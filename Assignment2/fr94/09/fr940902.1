SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed rule would change the membership of the Papaya Administrative Committee (committee), the agency responsible
for local administration of the Hawaiian papaya marketing order. This proposal would increase the number of grower
members on the committee from six to nine and reduce the number of handler members from six to three. The number of growers
in the industry has increased in recent years, during the same period the number of handlers has remained constant.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed rule is issued under Marketing Order No. 928 (7 CFR Part 928), as amended, regulating the handling of
papayas grown in Hawaii, hereinafter referred to as the order. This order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing
Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), hereinafter referred to as the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended
to have retroactive effect. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they
present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or an exemption therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the impact of this rule on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory rules to the scale of business subject to such rules in order that small businesses
will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued
thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on
their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 120 papaya handlers subject to regulation under the marketing order covering fresh papayas
grown in Hawaii, and approximately 400 producers of papayas in Hawaii. Small agricultural producers have been defined
by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small
agricultural service firms as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. A majority of these handlers
and producers may be classified as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to &sect;928.120, the committee currently consists of 13 members. Each member has an alternate. Six members
are growers, six are handlers, and one is a public member. The six handler members and alternates are nominated from
the production area at large. Grower membership on the committee is apportioned among three districts. District
1 (the Island of Hawaii) is represented by four members and alternates, and District 2 (the Islands of Kauai, Niihau,
Maui, Molakai, Lanai, Kahoolawe; and Kalawao county), and District 3 (the Island of Oahu) by one member and alternate
each. Any grower organization is limited to two members on the committee. Any handler organization is limited to one
member on the committee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 928.20 also allows the number of grower and handler members and alternate members on the committee and the
composition of the committee between growers and handlers to be changed as provided in &sect;928.31(o). Paragraph
(o) of &sect;928.31 also authorizes the committee, with the approval of the Secretary, to redefine the districts
into which the production area is divided, reapportion membership on the committee. Any such changes are required
to reflect, insofar as practicable, structural changes within the industry and shifts in papaya production within
the production area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule would change the composition of the committee by increasing grower representation on the committee from
six grower members to nine and reducing handler representation from six members to three. This change was recommended
by the committee on April 22, 1994, by a vote of 7 in favor, 3 opposed, and 2 abstentions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The papaya industry has historically demonstrated a policy of maintaining equitable representation among handlers
and growers. In 1989, committee membership was changed by allocating three grower member positions from District
1 to handlers in the State of Hawaii. This resulted in an increase from three to six handler members and a decrease in
grower members from District 1 from seven to four. The committee indicated that the number of growers in the industry
has increased from 325 to 400 since 1989, while the number of handlers has remained constant. The committee contends
that these factors support their recommendation to change committee membership. This action is intended to provide
increased grower representation on the committee consistent with the increased number of growers. This rule would
not impose any additional costs on growers or handlers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Members supporting this change stated that the marketing order is designed to primarily benefit growers and for that
reason growers should have a majority on the committee. Members supporting the recommendation also stated that this
change would increase growers' influence in matters concerning amendments to the marketing order, and market research
and development and promotion activities. The majority of that increase occurred in District 1. Members opposed
to the change in the current committee membership stated that the marketing order should benefit the entire industry,
and believe the current composition of the committee provides a good balance for the industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The committee indicated that the increase in the number of growers producing papayas in District 1, justified increasing
from four to seven the number of growers representing District 1 on the committee. Committee members supporting this
change contend that the vast majority of growers and the highest level of papaya production are located in District
1. District 1 is expected to produce 55.6 million pounds during the 1993&hyph;94 season. Over the last four years District
1 has had an average annual production of 54.1 million pounds of papayas. For the same period District 2 has an average
production of 760,000 pounds, and District 3 has an average production of 1,020,000 pounds of papayas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the available information, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this proposed rule would not
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Rural Electrification Administration (REA) proposes to amend its regulations on accounting policies and procedures
for REA electric borrowers as set forth in REA's regulation concerning Accounting Requirements for REA Electric
Borrowers, Uniform System of Accounts. This proposed rule would eliminate the requirement that REA borrowers place
the difference between the amount accrued for postretirement benefits during the year and the amount paid on a ``pay-as-you-go''
basis in an external, irrevocable trust to be used solely for postretirement benefits. REA borrowers may, however,
elect to voluntarily fund their postretirement benefit obligations. This proposed rule would set forth new accounting
interpretations that address the requirements of recently issued pronouncements of the Financial Accounting Standards
Board concerning the accounting for postemployment benefits and the accounting for certain investments in debt
and equity securities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, this proposed rule would also set forth a new accounting for storm damage costs and the associated funds
received from the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA). It would also clarify the accounting prescribed
for computer software costs by specifying the accounts to which generalized software costs should be amortized and
to which the costs of maintaining, updating, and converting files should be expensed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, this proposal would identify the organizational unit within REA to which borrower requests for departures
from or interpretations of the REA Uniform System of Accounts (USoA) should be submitted.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to facilitate the effective and economical operation of a business enterprise, adequate and reliable financial
records must be maintained. Accounting records must provide a clear and accurate picture of current economic conditions
from which management can make informed decisions in charting the company's future. The rate regulated environment
in which an electric utility operates causes an even greater need for financial information that is accurate, complete,
and comparable with that of other electric utilities.

REA, as a federal lender and mortgagee, and in furthering the objectives of the Rural Electrification Act (RE Act)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7 U.S.C. 901 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) has a legitimate programmatic interest and a substantial financial interest in requiring adequate records to be
maintained. In order to provide REA with financial information that can be analyzed and compared with the operations
of other borrowers in the REA program, all REA borrowers must maintain financial records that utilize uniform accounts
and uniform accounting policies and procedures. The standard REA security instrument, therefore, requires borrowers
to maintain their books, records, and accounts in accordance with methods and principles of accounting prescribed
by REA in the USoA for its electric borrowers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure that borrowers consistently account for and apply the provisions of recent pronouncements of the Financial
Accounting Standards Board, the USoA must be revised and updated as changes in generally accepted accounting principles
occur. REA is, therefore, proposing to add two new accounting interpretations to Section 1767.41, Accounting Methods
and Procedures Required of All REA Borrowers, that address the accounting requirements recently set forth in Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112, Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits (Statement No. 112),
and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities
(Statement No. 115). Statement No. 112 establishes the standards of financial accounting and reporting for employers
who provide benefits to former or inactive employees after employment but before retirement while Statement No.
115 establishes the standards of financial accounting and reporting for investments in debt securities and for investments
in equity securities that readily have determinable fair values. Copies of Statements of Financial Accounting Standards
may be obtained from the Order Department of the Financial Accounting Standards Board,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
REA is also proposing to amend accounting Interpretation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No. 626, Rural Economic Development Loan and Grant Program, to establish the accounting policies and procedures
for the Rural Economic Development Grant program recently established by REA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interpretation No. 604, Deferred Compensation, sets forth the specific accounting entries and the balance sheet
reporting requirements for participation in the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association's Deferred Compensation
Program. Under the terms of this program, a portion of an employee's current salary may be deferred until such time
as the employee retires or terminates employment. The employer makes a contribution into the deferred compensation
fund in an amount equal to the salary deferred. As such, the borrower records both an asset and a liability_an asset
in the amount of the contributions to the fund and a liability to that employee for future payment of the deferred compensation.
Current REA procedures require the asset and liability to be offset for financial reporting purposes. Financial
Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 39, Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts, states that
the offsetting of assets and liabilities in the balance is improper except where a right of offset exists and a right
of offset exists only when each of two parties owes the other determinable amounts. Contributions to the deferred
compensation fund are payable to the borrower and, as such, the right of offset does not exist. REA is, therefore, proposing
to amend Interpretation No. 604 to comply with generally accepted accounting principles by requiring the asset and
liability to be reported separately. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In December 1990, the Financial Accounting Standards Boards issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 106, Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions (Statement No. 106). Statement
No. 106 requires reporting entities to accrue the expected cost of postretirement benefits during the years in which
the employee provides service to the reporting entity. Prior to the issuance of Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No. 106, most reporting entities accounted for postretirement benefit costs on a ``pay-as-you-go'' basis; that
is, costs were recognized when paid, not when the employee provided service to the reporting entity in exchange for
the benefits.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A postretirement benefit plan is a deferred compensation arrangement in which an employer promises to exchange future
benefits for an employee's current services. Postretirement benefits include, but are not limited to, health care,
life insurance, tuition assistance, day care, legal services, and housing subsidies provided outside of a pension
plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The REA USoA parallels the USoA prescribed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for electric utilities
and, as such, is consistent with the standards of financial accounting for the electric utility industry as a whole.
As FERC amends its USoA, REA reviews the appropriateness and applicability of each amendment and proposes revisions,
as necessary, to the REA USoA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 17, 1992, FERC issued its policy statement on postretirement benefits. Included in its statement was
the requirement that natural gas pipelines and public utilities make cash deposits into an irrevocable, external
trust fund, in amounts that are proportional and, on an annual basis, equal to the annual test period allowance for
postretirement benefits. REA reviewed and analyzed these accounting policies and procedures, including the funding
requirement, and promulgated these requirements in its USoA. The REA USoA requires REA borrowers to fund the liability
associated with postretirement benefit costs by making cash deposits into an irrevocable trust. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the issuance of the final rule, REA borrowers and their representatives through the National Rural Electric
Cooperative Association, have questioned the necessity for REA borrowers to fund their postretirement benefit
obligations. FERC and a majority of state utility commissions require funding for the inclusion of postretirement
benefit expenses in rates, in order to deter investor owned utilities from arbitrarily increasing postretirement
benefit costs. Due to the many variables involved in estimating postretirement benefit costs, the cost incorporated
into rates can be easily manipulated if an investor owned utility desires to increase cash flow through increased
accruals of postretirement benefit costs. By requiring utilities to fund an amount equal to the postretirement benefit
costs that were recovered through rates, much of the incentive for investor owned utilities to over estimate postretirement
benefit costs is eliminated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ratepayers/consumers, and investors/owners of an REA electric borrower, because of its cooperative organizational
structure, are one in the same. REA cooperatives do not, therefore, have this same incentive to over estimate postretirement
benefits costs because profits do not accrue to a separate, different class of investors/owners. In fact, REA electric
borrowers have no incentive to over estimate postretirement benefit costs to increase rates since the investors/owners
are the same as the ratepayers/consumers. REA is proposing to eliminate the funding requirement currently contained
in Section 1767.41, Interpretation No. 627, Postretirement Benefits. REA borrowers may, however, elect to voluntarily
fund their postretirement benefit obligations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, REA is proposing to revise Section 1767.13, Departures from the Prescribed REA Uniform System of Accounts,
and Section 1767.14, Interpretations of the REA Uniform System of Accounts, to specifically identify the organizational
unit within REA to which requests for departures from and interpretations of the REA USoA should be addressed. This
revision should assist borrowers in filing requests and should expedite the review process within REA.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of recent hurricane, flood, and ice storm damage, the Rural Electrification Administration (REA) has
received several inquiries concerning the proper accounting for storm damage costs and the associated funds received
from the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Storm damage costs should be accounted for under the work order procedure. Units of property destroyed or otherwise
removed from service must be reflected on retirement work orders and units of property installed must be shown on construction
work orders. To ensure that the accounting for construction and retirement costs is as accurate as possible, an effort
should be made to accurately accumulate material, labor, and overhead costs. Even when extreme care has been exercised,
however, it may still be necessary to use estimates to develop the appropriate cost figures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When a storm occurs, a utility typically incurs a large retirement loss, all or a part of which should be charged to the
accumulated provision for depreciation. Storm damage costs over and above construction and retirement costs represent
maintenance expense. Maintenance costs include the costs of resagging lines, straightening poles, and replacing
minor items of property. When extensive damage has occurred, the need to restore the property to an operating condition
without delay usually results in excessive costs being incurred. Standard property unit costs may be used as a guide
in determining the amount to be capitalized. It should be noted, however, that when standard property unit costs are
used, all excess costs are charged to maintenance expense. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the storm's destruction, property is retired prematurely and as a result, extraordinary retirement losses
occur. When such extraordinary losses occur, they should be recorded in the year in which the losses are incurred.
If the recording of such losses will materially distort the income statement, such losses may be charged to Account
435, Extraordinary Deductions. These costs may be deferred and amortized to future periods only if the provisions
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation
(Statement No. 71), are applied. Under the provisions of Statement No. 71, a utility may defer certain costs, provided
such costs are included in the utility's rate base and recovered through future rates. If an REA borrower elects to
apply the provisions of Statement No. 71, REA approval is required. To obtain REA approval, a borrower must submit:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. A copy of the state Commission order authorizing recovery of the deferred costs through future rates, or in the absence
of commission jurisdiction, a resolution from the cooperative's board of directors authorizing such recovery;
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. A statement from the borrower's certified public accountant (CPA) or CPA firm indicating that the deferral and
amortization of these costs is in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assist in the restoration of the damaged facilities, the Federal government often provides assistance through
FEMA. Under current FEMA procedures, FEMA provides funds for the restoration of facilities based upon the cost estimates
submitted by the entity requesting assistance. If the FEMA grant is for less than 100 percent of the cost estimates,
FEMA does not specify which costs are to be reimbursed. When the funds are received, therefore, they should be accounted
for by crediting construction, retirement, and maintenance expense in direct proportion to the total costs incurred.
For example, if total storm damage costs are $1,000,000 with $500,000 incurred for maintenance, $300,000 for retirement,
and $200,000 for construction, the FEMA reimbursement should be accounted for by applying 50 percent of the funds
received as a credit to maintenance expense, 30 percent as a credit to retirement costs, and 20 percent as a credit to
construction.

 Account 426.5, Other Deductions, should be used to record the retirement loss as a current period expense. Account
435, Extraordinary Deductions, may be used when the loss will materially distort the income statement. Account 182.1,
Extraordinary Property Losses, should be used when such costs are being deferred under the provisions of Statement

&blank;401&blank;Computer Software Costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Computer software consists of programs and routines (sets of computer instructions) which direct the operation
of the computer. Software may refer to generalized routines useful in computer operations or to programs for specific
applications such as payroll. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The distinction between generalized software and application software is important. Generalized software provides
operating support for individual applications. This would include programs for such tasks as making printouts of
machine-readable records, sorting records, organizing and maintaining files, translating programs written in
a symbolic language into machine-language instructions, and scheduling jobs through the computer. These programs
are generally furnished by the manufacturer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Application software consists of a set of instructions for performing a particular data processing task. Application
programs are generally written by the user installation, but are frequently obtained as prewritten packages from
software vendors. Application software includes programs such as payroll, billing, general ledger, as well as engineering
or managerial applications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Costs incurred with the purchase or development of computer software shall be accounted for as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Capitalize in a subaccount of Account 391, Office Furniture and Equipment, all costs for generalized software.
Depreciate the cost over the service life (or remaining life) of the main hardware (i.e., containing central processor).
If the purchase invoice does not break out or assign a cost to the ``generalized software,'' it is appropriate to include
the full amount in hardware costs. Defer in Account 186, Miscellaneous Deferred Debits, the cost of all applications
software determined to have a service life of over one year. Amortize this cost to Account 425, Miscellaneous Amortization,
over the estimated useful life of the program. This amortization period shall not exceed five (5) years. We realize,
however, that there may be circumstances that justify a useful life longer than 5 years. When this is the case and it
is management's intent to utilize these programs over an extended period, written justification shall be submitted
to REA for approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Expense in Account 921, Office Supplies and Expenses, in the period incurred, all costs associated with the maintenance,
updating, and conversion of files or revision of all software, and all costs for software with a useful life of less
than 1 year. Also, expense the unamortized cost of all software determined, during year, to be no longer used by or useful
to the cooperative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In determining the total cost of purchased or internally developed software, the following items shall be included:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Costs incurred for feasibility studies if they result in the purchase or development of software; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. All costs related to the actual purchase or development of the software. These costs must be specifically identifiable
with the software and properly supported by time cards, invoices, or other documents; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. All costs incurred in ``testing and debugging'' the software.

Account 107, Construction Work-in-Progress, provided that the following criteria are met: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1. The computer program is specifically dedicated to performing a construction related activity, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The cost of the software is itemized separate and apart from other hardware and software costs.

The cost of software programs meeting the above requirements and having an estimated useful service life in excess
of 1 year shall be recorded in Account 186, Miscellaneous Deferred Debits, and amortized to Account 107, Construction
Work-in-Progress, over the estimated service life of the program not to exceed 5 years.

19. In &sect;1767.41, Interpretation No. 627 is revised, and Interpretation No. 628, Postemployment Benefits,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Postretirement Benefits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other
than Pensions (Statement No. 106), requires reporting entities to accrue the expected cost of postretirement benefits
during the years the employee provides service to the entity. For purposes of applying the provisions of Statement
No. 106, members of the board of directors are considered to be employees of the cooperative. Prior to the issuance
of Statement No. 106, most reporting entities accounted for postretirement benefit costs on a ``pay-as-you-go''
basis; that is, costs were recognized when paid, not when the employee provided service to the entity in exchange for
the benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As defined in Statement No. 106, a postretirement benefit plan is a deferred compensation arrangement in which an
employer promises to exchange future benefits for an employee's current services. Postretirement benefit plans
may be funded or unfunded. Postretirement benefits include, but are not limited to, health care, life insurance,
tuition assistance, day care, legal services, and housing subsidies provided outside of a pension plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This statement applies to both written plans and to plans whose existence is implied from a practice of paying postretirement
benefits. An employer's practice of providing postretirement benefits to selected employees under individual
contracts with specified terms determined on an employee-by-employee basis does not, however, constitute a postretirement
benefit plan under the provisions of this statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Postretirement benefit plans generally fall into three categories: single-employer defined benefit plans, multi-employer
plans, and multiple-employer plans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The accounting requirements set forth in this interpretation focus on single- and multiple-employer plans. The
accounting requirements set forth in Statement No. 106 for multiemployer plans or defined contribution plans shall
be adopted for borrowers electing those types of plans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the provisions of Statement No. 106, there are two components of the postretirement benefit cost: the current
period cost and the transition obligation. The transition obligation is a one-time accrual of the costs resulting
from services already provided. Statement No. 106 allows the transition obligation to be deferred and amortized
on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the active employees. If the average remaining
service life of the employees is less than 20 years, a 20-year amortization period may be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Accounting Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All REA borrowers must adopt the accrual accounting provisions and reporting requirements set forth in Statement

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No. 106. The transition obligation and accrual of the current period cost must be based upon an actuarial study. This
study must be updated to allow the borrower to comply with the measurement date requirements of Statement No. 106;
however, the study must, at a minimum, be updated every five years. REA will not allow electric borrowers to account
for postretirement benefits on a ``pay-as-you-go'' basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The deferral and amortization of the transition obligation does not require REA approval provided that it complies
with the provisions of Statement No. 106. If, however, a borrower elects to expense the transition obligation in the
current period and subsequently defer this expense in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation, the deferral must be approved by REA. In those states
in which the commission will not allow the recovery of the transition obligation through future rates, the transition
obligation must be expensed, in its entirety, in the year in which Statement No. 106 is adopted. A portion of the transition
obligation may be charged to construction and retirement activities provided such charges are properly supported.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For plans outside the United States and for defined benefit plans of employers that (a) Are nonpublic enterprises
and (b) sponsor defined benefit postretirement plans with no more than 500 plan participants in the aggregate, Statement
No. 106 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1994. For all other plans, Statement No. 106 is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
REA borrowers must comply with the implementation dates set forth in Statement No. 106. At the time of the adoption
of Statement No. 106, rates must be in place sufficient to recover the current period expense and any amortization
of the transition obligation. A copy of a board resolution or commission order, as appropriate, indicating that the
transition obligation and current period expense have been included in the borrower's rates must be submitted to
REA.

3. The deferral and amortization of the transition obligation under the provisions of Statement No. 106 is considered
to be an off balance sheet item. If, therefore, the borrower elects to defer and amortize the transition obligation
on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the active employees or 20 years in accordance
with Statement No. 106, no entry is required. Instead, the transition obligation is recognized as a component of postretirement
benefit cost as it is amortized. It should be noted, however, that the amount of the unamortized transition obligation
must be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.

Postemployment Benefits
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112, Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits (Statement
No. 112) establishes the standards of financial accounting and reporting for employers who provide benefits to former
or inactive employees after employment but before retirement. Inactive employees are those who are not currently
rendering service to the employer but who have not been terminated, including employees who are on disability leave,
regardless of whether they are expected to return to active service. For purposes of applying the provisions of Statement
No. 112, former members of the board of directors are considered to be employees of the cooperative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Postemployment benefits include benefits provided to former or inactive employees, their beneficiaries, and covered
dependents. They include, but are not limited to, salary continuation, supplemental benefits (including workmen's
compensation), health care, job training and counseling, and life insurance coverage. Benefits may be provided
in cash or in kind and may be paid upon cessation of active employment or over a specified period of time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The cost of providing postemployment benefits is considered to be a part of the compensation provided to an employee
in exchange for current service and should, therefore, be accrued as the employee earns the right to be paid for future
postemployment benefits. Applying the criteria set forth in Statement No. 43, a postemployment benefit obligation
is accrued when all of the following conditions are met:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The employer's obligation for payment for future absences is attributable to employees' services already performed;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The obligation relates to employee rights that vest or accumulate. Vested rights are considered those rights for
which the employer is obligated to make payment even if the employee terminates. Rights that accumulate are those
earned, but unused rights to compensated absences that may be carried forward to one or more periods subsequent to
the period in which they are earned;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Payment of the compensation is probable; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The amount can be reasonably estimated.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
If all of these conditions are not met, the employer must account for its postemployment benefit obligation in accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies (Statement No. 5) when it becomes
probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of that liability can be reasonably estimated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
If an obligation for postemployment benefits is not accrued in accordance with the provisions of Statement No. 5 or
Statement No. 43 only because the amount cannot be reasonable estimated, the financial statements should disclose
that fact.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities
(Statement No. 115), establishes the standards of financial accounting and reporting for investments in debt securities
and for investments in equity securities that have readily determinable fair values. Statement No. 115 does not apply
to investments in equity securities accounted for under the equity method nor to investments in consolidated subsidiaries.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the time of acquisition, an entity must classify debt and equity securities into one of three categories: held-to-maturity,
available-for-sale, or trading. At the balance sheet date, the appropriateness of the classifications must be reassessed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Investments in debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity and are measured at amortized cost in the balance
sheet only if the reporting entity has the positive intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity. Debt securities
are not classified as held-to-maturity if the entity has the intent to hold the security only for an indefinite period;
for example if the security would become available for sale in response to changes in market interest rates and related
changes in the security's prepayment risk, needs for liquidity, changes in the availability of and the yield on alternative
investments, changes in funding sources and terms, and changes in foreign currency risk.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Investments in debt securities that are not classified as held-to-maturity and equity securities that have readily
determinable fair values are classified as either trading securities or available-for-sale securities and are
measured at fair value in the balance sheet. Trading securities are those securities that are bought and held principally
for the purpose of selling them in the near future. Trading generally reflects active and frequent buying and selling
and trading securities are generally used with the objective of generating profits on short-term differences in
prices. Available-for-sale securities are those investments not classified as either trading securities or held-to-maturity
securities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Statement No. 115 requires unrealized holding gains and losses for trading securities to be included in earnings
in the current period. Unrealized holding gains and losses for available-for-sale securities are excluded from
earnings; however, they are reported as a net amount in a separate component of shareholders' equity until realized.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For individual securities classified as either available-for-sale or held-to-maturity, an entity must determine
whether a decline in the security's fair value below the amortized cost is other than temporary. If the decline in fair
value is determined to be permanent, that is, it is probable that the entity will not be able to collect all amounts due
under the contractual terms of the security, the realized loss is accounted for in earnings of the current period.
The new cost basis is not adjusted upward for subsequent recoveries in the fair value. Subsequent increases in the
fair value of available-for-sale securities are included in the separate component of equity. Subsequent decreases
are also included in the separate component of equity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All trading securities are reported as current assets in the balance sheet and individual held-to-maturity and available-for-sale
securities are classified as either current or noncurrent, as appropriate. Cash flows from the purchase, sale, or
maturity of available-for-sale securities and held-to-maturity securities are classified in the statement of
cash flows as cash flows from investing activities and reported gross for each security classification.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Veterans Education and Employment Amendments of 1989 and the Department of Defense Authorization Act, 1990,
contain provisions which change significantly the Montgomery GI Bill_Selected Reserve. These two acts expand this
program by adding new types of permissible training such as apprenticeship and other on-job training, cooperative
training, and flight training. Furthermore, the eligibility provisions are significantly liberalized. For instance,
the attainment of a baccalaureate degree or equivalent evidence of completion of study will no longer bar some reservists
from training under the Montgomery GI Bill_Selected Reserve. This proposal will acquaint the public with the way
in which VA (Department of Veterans Affairs), the Department of Defense, and the Department of Transportation intend
to implement these provisions of these two acts.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Veterans Employment Amendments of 1989 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;237) and the Department of Defense Authorization Act,
1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;189), contain provisions which affect the Montgomery GI Bill_Selected Reserve. These include
expanding this program to include additional types of training, liberalizing the eligibility requirements for
this program, and permitting recipients of benefits under the Montgomery GI Bill_Selected Reserve to participate
in VA's work-study program. The provisions concerning work-study were further amended by Pub. L. 102&hyph;16 to
permit training at Coast Guard and National Guard facilities. Regulations must be amended so that they implement
the new provisions of law.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pub. L. 101&hyph;237 permits the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to require a reservist to submit a verification of
continued pursuit of a reservist's program of education before releasing the monthly benefit to him or her. This proposal
contains regulations which would require these verifications from reservists. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has been a long-standing requirement of VA that monthly benefits would not be released to students training under
the Montgomery GI Bill_Active Duty until they submitted a monthly verification that they are continuing to pursue
their programs of education. During 1989 VA conducted a study to determine whether this monthly self-verification
was cost-effective. The study found that not only was it cost-effective for the Montgomery GI Bill_Active Duty, but
that it also would be cost-effective in the other educational programs which VA administers. The study discovered
that over 50% of the overpayments in a sample of non-Montgomery GI Bill_Active Duty cases would not have occurred if
all educational programs had monthly self-verification of pursuit. Accordingly, VA, the Department of Defense
and the Coast Guard are proposing amendments to &sect;&sect;21.7640 and 21.7654 which would extend monthly self-verification
of pursuit to the Montgomery GI Bill_Selected Reserve. At the same time the requirement that an educational institution
verify pursuit at least annually is being eliminated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has been a long-standing requirement of law that a reservist maintain satisfactory progress and conduct in order
to receive educational assistance. In order that this provision of law be met, &sect;21.7653 has required that educational
institutions report to VA whenever a reservist is not making satisfactory progress or conduct. Pub. L. 101&hyph;237
amended 38 U.S.C. 3474 to provide that VA would not pay educational assistance to a reservist who has an unsatisfactory
attendance record. Since each educational institution with an attendance standard is responsible for enforcing
it, VA, the Department of Defense and the Coast Guard are proposing to amend &sect;21.7653 to require that educational
institutions report to VA whenever a reservist's attendance is unsatisfactory. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense and the Department of Transportation have determined
that these amended regulations do not contain a major rule as that term is defined by E.O. 12291, entitled Federal Regulation.
The regulations will not have a $100 million annual effect on the economy, and will not cause a major increase in costs
or prices for anyone. They will have no significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity,
innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic
or export markets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary of Veterans Affairs, the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Transportation have certified that
these amended regulations, if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of
small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C.
605(b), the amended regulations, therefore, are exempt from the initial and final regulatory flexibility analyses
requirements of sections 603 and 604. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This certification can be made because the regulations affect only individuals. They will have no significant economic
impact on small entities, i.e., small businesses, small private and nonprofit organizations and small governmental
jurisdictions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
VA, the Department of Defense and the Department of Transportation find that good cause exists for making the amendments
to &sect;&sect;21.7639(a), 21.7642(a)(7), (8) and (9), 21.7652 and 21.7672(d), like the provisions of law they
implement, retroactively effective on December 18, 1989. VA, the Department of Defense and the Department of Transportation
find that good cause exists for making the new paragraphs &sect;21.7576(b)(7), 21.7635(b)(5) and 21.7639(j), the
amendments to &sect;21.7620(b) and those portions of the amendments to &sect;&sect;21.752)(b)(19), 21.7576(a)
and 21.7622(f) which deal with flight training, like the provisions of law they implement, retroactively effective
on September 30, 1990. VA, the Department of Defense, the Department of Transportation find that good cause exists
for making the new &sect;21.7645, like the provisions of law it implements, retroactively effective on May 1, 1990.
VA, the Department of Defense and the Department of Transportation find that good cause exists for making the remainder
of the amendments to the regulations (excluding the amendments to &sect;&sect;21.7654(a) and (b) and 21.7640(a)(1)
but including those portions of &sect;&sect;21.7520(b)(19), 21.7576(a) and 21.7622(f) which do not deal with flight
training), like the provisions of law they implement, retroactively effective on October 1, 1990. These provisions
are intended to achieve a benefit for the reservist. The maximum benefits intended in the provisions of law implemented
by the above proposed regulatory amendments will be achieved through prompt implementation. Hence, a delayed effective
date would be contrary to statutory design; would complicate administration of these provisions of law; and might
result in the denial of a benefit to a reservist who is entitled to it.

These regulations have been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to Executive Order 12866.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The information collection contained in the proposed revisions to &sect;21.7640 is identical to that used in the
administration of the Montgomery GI Bill_Active Duty. The revisions to &sect;21.7640 account for 36,973 hours of
the information collection approved under 2900&hyph;2073. This is estimated to average 10 minutes per response.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;21.7654 also contains information collection requirements which will result in a reporting burden.
The reporting burden is estimated to average 5 minutes per response for a total of 67,258 hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed &sect;21.7653(d) contains information collection requirements which will result in a reporting burden.
The reporting burden is estimated to average 5 minutes per response for a total of 517 hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The average estimated time for response for all these reporting burdens includes the time for reviewing instructions,
gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act, VA is submitting to the Office of Management and Budget
(OMB) a request that it approve this information collection requirement. Organizations and individuals desiring
to submit comments for consideration by OMB on these proposed information collection requirements should address
them to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, room 3002, New Executive Office Building, Washington,
DC 20503, Attention: Joseph F. Lackey.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) When a reservist is pursuing a program of education by correspondence, VA will make a charge against entitlement
for each payment made to him or her. The charge will be made in months and decimal fractions of a month, as determined
by dividing the amount of the payment by $140.

Concurrent enrollment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When a reservist cannot schedule his or her complete program at one educational institution, VA may approve a program
of concurrent enrollment. When requesting such a program, the reservist must show that his or her complete program
of education is not available at the educational institution in which he or she will pursue the major portion of his
or her program (the primary educational institution), or that it cannot be scheduled within the period in which he
or she plans to complete his or her program. A reservist who is limited in the types of courses he or she may pursue as provided
in &sect;21.7540(b) (2) and (3) may pursue courses only at an institution of higher learning. If such a reservist cannot
complete his or her program at one institution of higher learning, VA may approve a concurrent enrollment only if both
the educational institutions the reservist enrolls in are institutions of higher learning.

(A) Is offered by an institution of higher learning, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Does not lead to a standard college degree; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The institution of higher learning requires as part of the reservist's program of education one or more unit subjects
for which credit is granted toward a standard college degree. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) When measuring a reservist's enrollment during a semester or quarter when he or she is pursuing one or more courses
which the educational institution measures on a credit-hour basis, VA will convert the credit to equivalent clock
hours as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, and combine them with the clock hours of the other courses measured
by the school on that basis, as provided in paragraph (d)(4) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) VA shall_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Determine the equivalent clock hour factor by dividing the number of clock hours which constitute full time for
the enrollment as stated in paragraph (e) or (f) of this section by the number of credit hours which constitute a full
time undergraduate enrollment at the educational institution as stated in paragraph (a) of this section, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(5) and (6) of this section, multiply the number of credit hours in which the
reservist is enrolled by the equivalent clock hour factor as determined by paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section. This
will result in the number of equivalent clock hours in which the reservist is enrolled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) VA will add the number of clock hours in which the reservist is enrolled to the number of equivalent clock hours in
which he or she is enrolled. The result will be compared to paragraph (e) or (f) to determine the reservist's training
time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) When the number of class sessions per credit hours is so low that &sect;21.4272(f)(2)(ii) or (3) would control
the way in which VA would measure those credit hours, VA will make the calculations required by paragraph (d)(3)(ii)
of this section by multiplying the number of class sessions determined by the equivalent clock hour factor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) When the reservist is attending a nonstandard term, VA will make the calculations required by paragraph (d)(3)(ii)
of this section by determining the equivalent credit hours in which the reservist is enrolled as provided in &sect;21.4272(g),
and multiplying the equivalent credit hours by the equivalent clock hour factor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) In calculations required by this paragraph, fractions of an equivalent clock hour will be dropped.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 states that the Postal Service shall make available to a state or local
voting registration official the rate for any class of mail that is available to a qualified nonprofit organization
under 39 U.S.C. 3626 for the purpose of making a mailing that the official certifies is required by the Act. The law applies
only to state or local voting registration officials in those states and the District of Columbia that require a voter
to register to vote before the date of voting in a general election for public office. In accordance with this legislation,
the Postal Service proposes an amendment to Domestic Mail Manual (DMM) section E370.3.0 to describe the mailers eligible
for an authorization to mail at the special rates, and to DMM E370.5.0 to describe the matter that may be mailed by those
entitled to mail at the special rates under the new provision.

As information, the procedures for mailers seeking authorization under the new provisions, and mailing under these
authorizations, will be similar to those for nonprofit organizations mailing at the special rates. Each state and
local voting registration official must submit Form 3624, Application to Mail at Special Bulk Third-Class Rates,
at each post office where materials will be mailed at the special bulk third-class rates. Voting registration officials
will not be allowed to mail at the special rates before receiving an authorization from the Postal Service. After submitting
an application, the voting registration official may mail qualifying material under a pending arrangement through
arrangements with the postmaster. If the application is approved, the Postal Service will refund to the voting registration
official the difference in postage paid between the regular rates and the special bulk third-class rates for mailings
made after the effective date of the authorization. The authorization should be requested, and will be issued, by
the title of the official head of the government agency responsible for the registration of voters. As with all mailers
authorized to mail at the special rates, only third-class matter, deposited in prescribed minimum quantities and
prepared in accordance with postal regulations, is eligible for these rates. In addition to these general requirements,
the material must also be required or authorized by the Act. Finally, mailers must complete and deposit with each permit
imprint mailing the appropriate mailing statement: Form 3602&hyph;N, Statement of Mailing With Permit Imprint
Third-Class Mail (Nonprofit Rates Only); or Form 3602&hyph;PVN, Plant-Verified Drop Shipment (PVDS) Consolidated
Mailing Statement Register Third-Class (Special Rates Only: Permit Imprint). The certification sections on the
statements will be modified by inserting a new item number 6 as follows and renumbering current item 6 as item 7:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 as required by Sections 110 and 172 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7410 and 7502. The submittal consists of Administrative
Orders representing the St. Paul Park/Ashland area of Air Quality Control Region (AQCR) 131. In this action, USEPA
is proposing to disapprove the State's submittal based on enforceability and attainment demonstration concerns.
The MPCA must address the concerns detailed in this action and submit the Administrative Order to USEPA before the
end of the 30-day comment period. If no other substantive, adverse comments are received and MPCA adequately responds
the USEPA's concerns before the end of the 30-day comment period, USEPA intends to proceed with a direct final approval
of the submittal. If, however, the concerns are not adequately addressed before that time, USEPA will finalize the
disapproval. The direct final rulemaking would provide an opportunity for the public to comment on the final rulemaking
action.

I. Summary of State Submittal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 11, 1992, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) submitted a revision to the State Implementation
Plan (SIP) for sulfur dioxide (SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) in Air Quality Control Region (AQCR) 131 to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). The seven-county
metropolitan area (AQCR 131) has been designated, by the USEPA, as nonattainment for SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (40 C.F.R. 81.324). The submittal is intended to demonstrate attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards
(NAAQS) for SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in AQCR 131 for the area surrounding the Ashland Petroleum Company. The remainder of the area (Dakota County/Pine
Bend and the rest of the Twin Cities) is being addressed in separate rulemakings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The USEPA published the designation of AQCR 131 as a primary nonattainment area for SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on March 3, 1978 (43 FR 8962). The MPCA submitted a final SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 plan on August 4, 1980. USEPA published its final rule approving and promulgating the Minnesota Part D SIP for SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for AQCR 131 on April 8, 1981 (46 FR 20997). The MPCA submitted a request for redesignation to attainment of AQCR 131,
except for the Pine Bend area of Dakota County, on September 2, 1983. The redesignation request included permits for
several facilities, as well as, monitoring data and dispersion modeling intended to support the request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The USEPA requested several revisions to the permits and compliance data included in the 1983 submittal. In addition,
the Stack Height Rule promulgated on July 8, 1985, required the State to review all existing emission limitations
to determine whether any of these limitations had been affected by stack height credit above Good Engineering Practice
(GEP) stack height or by other dispersion techniques. As a result of this review, MPCA determined that Ashland Petroleum
Company (in addition to NSP-Riverside, and Koch Refining Company-Pine Bend) would require additional permit revisions
due to modeled violations using the reduced creditable stack heights. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the numerous changes which had occurred since the original redesignation request was submitted in 1983, the
submittal was withdrawn by the MPCA. A new SIP revision for Ashland Refining Company was submitted on June 30, 1987.
A SIP revision and redesignation request for the remainder of AQCR 131, excluding the Pine Bend area of Dakota County,
was submitted by the MPCA on September 10, 1987. The MPCA later withdrew the June 30, 1987, SIP revision because Ashland
Refining Company could not meet one of the emission limits listed in the permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 11, 1992, the MPCA submitted a SIP revision for SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for the St. Paul Park/Ashland area of AQCR 131. The submittal includes an Administrative Order for Ashland Petroleum
Company_St. Paul Park Refinery, in addition to dispersion modeling and technical support intended to show that the
limits in the Administrative Order are sufficient to attain the NAAQS for SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

This section will provide a general description of the State submittal followed by USEPA's review of the attainment
demonstration, including modeling specifics of the Administrative Order for the Ashland Petroleum Company. A more
detailed description of the Administrative Order and the attainment demonstration is included in the technical
support document associated with this action.

Description of State Emission Inventory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The emission units at the Ashland Refining Company_St. Paul Park facility that discharge sulfur dioxide to the atmosphere
are: three process steam boilers, 27 process heaters, one fluidized catalytic cracker regenerator, two sulfur recovery
units with a common Shell Claus Offgas Treatment (SCOT) tailgas unit, two diesel generators and heater decoking operations.
Specific emission limits and operating limits are listed in the administrative order for these sources. In addition,
sulfur control limits are applied to the diesel fuel and hydrogen sulfide limits are applied to the refinery gas. Compliance
with the emission limitations and operating restrictions shall be demonstrated through the combined use of continuous
emission monitors (CEMS) designed to measure SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions, continuous monitoring systems (CMS) that record fuel flowrate, and hydrogen sulfide content, and regular
fuel analysis and supplier certification to determine the sulfur content and heating value of the fuel oil and diesel
fuel. A stack test will be used to determine initial compliance at Emission Point 15 (SRU's and SCOT, and boilers 4 &amp;
6). It has been determined, based on guidance in the ``General Preamble for Future Proposed Rulemakings,'' published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on April 16, 1992 (57 FR 13498), that the compliance methods listed above provide for continuous compliance monitoring.

Description of State General Modeling Methodology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The modeling techniques used in the demonstration are based on the modeling guidelines in place at the time the analyses
were performed (i.e., ``Guideline on Air Quality Models, (Revised),'' July 1986, including ``Supplement A,'' July
1987).

Model 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The dispersion modeling conducted for this demonstration was performed using the Industrial Source Complex Short-Term
(ISCST) model (version 90346) for calculation of the 24-hour, 3-hour, and annual concentrations. The model was run
using the regulatory default option and urban mode 3 (McElroy-Pooler) dispersion coefficients. Although a land
use analysis around Ashland Refining Company would classify the area as rural, urban dispersion coefficients were
applied based on the results of a preliminary model/monitor comparison study which indicated that the available
rural models underpredict ambient concentrations. To assure attainment, MPCA found it necessary to apply the more
conservative urban dispersion coefficients. The State did not use the most recent version of the Industrial Source
Complex model, known as ISC2. The MPCA had completed the modeling to determine appropriate SIP limits before the ISC2
model was released. Therefore, based on USEPA guidance concerning grandfathering in the January 2, 1985, memorandum
from Joseph A. Tikvart, Chief, Source Receptor Analysis Branch, to the Regional Modeling Contacts, the use of the
ISCS2 version 90346 model is acceptable for this particular submittal. Future modeling of the AQCR 131 area will need
to be conducted using the ISC2 model.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The analysis used 1 year of on-site meteorological data (1988). As a comparison, the MPCA conducted supplemental
modeling using 1973&hyph;1977 Minneapolis Airport surface meteorological data, and St. Cloud mixing height data.
The results showed that the on-site meteorological data resulted in higher predicted 3-hour and 24-hour concentrations.
However, both data sets produced concentrations demonstrating modeled attainment of the SO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 unmodeled background concentration. The modeling inventory also included many minor sources whose collective
contributions were classified in the submittal as ``background.'' These modeled ``background'' values, along
with the monitored values, were included in the critical concentrations identified in the attainment demonstration.

The sulfur impacts were calculated over a 4-kilometer by 4-kilometer area with 100 meter resolution. Terrain effects
were considered. Complex terrain impacts were determined by using the COMPLEX1 model run in the VALLEY mode. The predicted
24-hour concentrations for the complex run was less than the ISCST simple terrain run; therefore, ISCST results were
used for establishing the SO

All Ashland Refinery stacks were modeled using the lesser of the actual stack height or 65 meters. Building downwash
was not incorporated in the original attainment demonstration because MPCA maintained the stack heights at the facility
were sufficiently high to avoid downwash. The USEPA requested, and received from the State, documentation demonstrating
that the significant sources at the facility were not subject to building downwash.

Section 110(a)(2) of the Clean Air Act requires that the Minnesota SIP prohibit emissions which would prevent attainment
or maintenance of the NAAQS in any other State. The Wisconsin border is approximately 40 kilometers (km) to the east
of the sources included in this attainment demonstration. For each source which was explicitly modeled in this submittal,
attainment in the adjacent State was demonstrated through supplemental dispersion modeling. This modeling showed
either decreasing or steady concentration gradients in the direction of the adjacent State and demonstrated that
SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions allowed in Minnesota would not prevent attainment or maintenance of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards
(NAAQS) in Wisconsin.

Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The USEPA has identified deficiencies in the Ashland Petroleum Company Administrative Order that the MPCA must adequately
address before the USEPA can proceed with a final approval. The deficiencies are presented in the following comments.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) On page 6, under the definition of 24-hour average, the word ``quality'' must be replaced by the word ``quantity.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) On page 9, Section I.C.2. states that ``the company is allowed to conduct decoking operations at each process heater
not more than 72 hours in each calendar quarter.'' However, the modeling demonstration appears to have based the decoking
emissions on operations restricted to 72 hours per year. The restriction in the order must reflect the same operating
hours as the attainment demonstration (72 hours per year). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) On page 10, Section I.C.4.a.2. limits the amount of hydrogen sulfide in the refinery gas to no more than 162 ppm as
an average for any consecutive 3-hour period. In the order, this limit does not apply during ``periods of startup,
shutdown, breakdown, maintenance and repair of the fuel gas amine system, SRU1, SRU2, the tailgas recovery unit (SCOT),
the heavy distillate hydrotreater, and significant decreases in hydrogen production.'' The emissions used in the
modeled attainment demonstration for the refinery gas sources appear to be based on the hydrogen sulfide limit on
the refinery gas. Allowing exemptions to the hydrogen sulfide limit during the time periods mentioned above may jeopardize
the SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 standards.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ``Guideline on Air Quality Models (Revised), including Supplement A,'' dated June 1987, allows exclusion of
emissions due to malfunctions from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the modeling demonstration. The non-malfunction related time periods either must be removed from paragraph I.C.4.a.2.
or it must be shown that the SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 standards are not violated during these periods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) On page 28, Section VI.D., the order states that ``no facility shall be permitted to operate if it experiences an
unreasonable breakdown frequency of control equipment.'' This provision is unenforceable and must be removed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) On page 29, Section VI.G., references to more stringent requirements must be removed. The final sentence should
read ``To the extent that any Federal or State statute, rule, permit, order, stipulation agreement, consent decree
or schedule of compliance now in force or subsequently issued imposes limits and requires actions additional to those
required in this Order, the Company shall comply with the additional requirements of the Federal or State statute,
rule, permit, order, stipulation agreement, consent decree, or schedule of compliance.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) A recent USEPA enforcement inspection of the facility showed that a bypass route is available for emissions from
the sulfur reduction units 1 and 2. When the bypass is utilized, emissions do not go through the tail gas unit or the incinerator
and are not monitored. There is no information in the order or the technical support which discusses potential emissions,
the reason for bypass, or frequency of use of this bypass route. It is reasonable to expect that the short-term SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) may be in jeopardy during bypass operations. Information must be provided
which demonstrates that the SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS are not violated when using the bypass associated with the sulfur reduction units. The information must include
why bypass routes are used, the frequency of use, and the associated sulfur emissions. In addition, bypass information
must be included in the notification requirements listed under Section V.C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) In Exhibit 2, Section E.1., should be entitled ``Sources not subject to New Source Performance Standards.'' Also,
in Section E.1.a.1. and 2, should state the testing capacity may be ``specified by the MPCA and/or USEPA.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further comments are documented in the Technical Support Document (TSD), dated March 18, 1994.

Section 172 Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Air Quality Control Region 131 is designated as a nonattainment area for the primary NAAQS for sulfur dioxide. As a
result, sulfur dioxide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonattainment area plans must meet the requirements of Subpart I of Part D of Subchapter I of the Clean Air Act, particularly
Section 172(c). Guidance on the requirements of Section 172 is given in the General Preamble for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implementation of Title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990; Proposed Rule; published April 16, 1992 at 57 FR 13498.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 172(c)(1) states that plans must require reasonably available control measures (RACT). The General Preamble
states that ``the definition of RACT for SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is that control technology which is necessary to achieve the NAAQS.'' Minnesota's submittal includes air dispersion
modeling designed to show that, when the comments are adequately addressed, the area will achieve attainment of the
SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS with the control measures fully implemented, and therefore satisfy the RACT requirement of Section 172(c)(1).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 172(c)(2) states that plans shall require reasonable further progress. The term ``reasonable further progress''
is defined in Section 171(1) as ``such annual incremental reductions in emissions of the relevant air pollutant as
are required by this part or may reasonably be required by the Administrator for the purpose of ensuring attainment
of the applicable NAAQS by the applicable date.'' These measures are not applicable because the Administrative Order
ensures attainment of the SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS by February 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 172(c)(3) requires a suitable emission inventory. A suitable inventory of SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions was included in the submittal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 172(c)(4) mandates that any stationary source growth margin included in the SIP must be expressly identified
and quantified. Zero growth margin was provided for in the submittal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 172(c)(5) mandates a suitable permit program for new and modified major stationary sources. A new source
permitting program for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonattainment areas was approved on April 28, 1994 (59 FR 21939). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 172(c)(6) requires enforceable limitations sufficient to provide for attainment. The Administrative
Order provides emission limitations, operating requirements, and compliance schedules. When the concerns identified
previously in this action are adequately addressed, the plan will then demonstrate, through air dispersion modeling,
that the fully implemented control measures achieve attainment of the SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 172(c)(7) mandates satisfaction of Section 110(a)(2). Principal among the requirements of Section 110(a)(2)
are requirements that the State adopt its limitations following a suitable opportunity for public comment. The MPCA
Commissioner has certified that the public hearing was noticed on November 9, 1992, and was held on December 15, 1992.
Section 172(c)(8) states 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the Administrator, in some circumstances, may allow the use of equivalent modeling emission inventory, and
planning procedures. MPCA did not seek this authorization.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 172(c)(9) requires the plan to provide for implementation of specific measures to be undertaken if the area
fails to make reasonable further progress (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, contingency measures), or to attain the primary NAAQS by the attainment date applicable under this part. The General
Preamble, referenced above, provides guidance on SIP requirements for SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonattainment areas. It discusses contingency measures for SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and states that it is unlikely for an area to implement SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 controls and fail to attain the NAAQS. Therefore, USEPA interprets ``contingency measures'' for SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to include the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ability to rely on comprehensive State programs to identify violations and to provide for compliance and enforcement.
Minnesota Stat. &sect;115.071 provides that the provisions issued by the MPCA may be enforced by various means. The
orders also contain reporting requirements necessary to determine compliance. Given this information, it has been
determined that the submittal contains appropriate contingency measures.

III. Proposed Rulemaking Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The USEPA is proposing to disapprove the Minnesota SIP revision for SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for the St. Paul Park/Ashland area of AQCR 131. However, if the above comments, detailed in this action, are adequately
addressed in revisions to this plan, and those revisions are submitted to USEPA by the end of the 30-day comment period,
then, assuming no other substantive adverse public comments are received, USEPA intends to publish a direct final
rulemaking approving the SIP revision as a whole including the supplemental submittal. If, at the end of the 30-day
comment period, the issues are still unresolved, final rulemaking disapproving the SIP revision will be promulgated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public comments are solicited on the requested SIP revision and on USEPA's proposal to disapprove. Public comments
received by October 3, 1994 will be considered in the development of USEPA's final rulemaking action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting, allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. USEPA shall consider each request for revision to the SIP in light of specific technical, economic,
and environmental factors, and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225). A revision to the SIP processing review tables was approved by the Acting
Administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation on October 4, 1993 (Michael Shapiro's memorandum to Regional Administrators).
A future notice will inform the general public of these tables. Under the revised tables, this action remains classified
as Table 2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this regulatory action from Executive Order 12866 review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities. (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604.) Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact
on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises,
and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USEPA's disapproval of the State request under Section 110 and Subchapter I, Part D of the CAA does not affect any existing
requirements applicable to small entities. Any pre-existing Federal requirements remaining in place after this
disapproval. Federal disapproval of the State submittal does not affect its state enforceability. Moreover, USEPA's
disapproval action does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities because it does not
remove existing requirements nor does it impose any new Federal requirements.

The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council (CAAC) and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council (DARC) are proposing
changes to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to require contractors to provide all material for performing
Government contracts, except when Government-furnished material is necessary to achieve significant economy,
standardization, or expedited production, or when it is otherwise in the Government's interest. Also, material
to be furnished by the Government shall be listed in the contract. This regulatory action was not subject to Office
of Management and Budget review pursuant to Executive Order No. 12866 dated September 30, 1993.

The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within
the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., because only a small amount of all Government-furnished material by acquisition cost is accountable to contracts
with small business and other interested parties. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not
been performed. Comments are invited from small businesses and other interested parties. Comments from small entities
concerning the affected FAR subpart will also be considered in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 610. Such comments must be
submitted separately and should cite 5 U.S.C. 601,

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council (CAAC) and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council (DARC) are proposing
to amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to add two new clauses entitled, ``Schedule of Government-Furnished
Property'' and ``Use on No-Charge Basis_Government Facilities, Special Test Equipment and Special Tooling''.
The Government property clauses have been changed to reference the ``Schedule of Government-Furnished Property''
clause. This regulatory action was not subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review pursuant to Executive
Order No. 12866 dated September 30, 1993.

As part of the Defense Management Review, the DARC reviewed regulatory text and clauses at the component level of the
military departments for possible elimination or combination into higher level regulations. Based on that review,
two clauses are recommended for inclusion into the FAR, Schedule of Government-Furnished Property and Use on No-Charge-Basis_Government
Facilities, Special Test Equipment and Special Tooling. The first clause will be used by contracting officers to
describe the items of Government-furnished property to be provided to the contractor, and the second clause will
authorize for the contractor's use on a no-charge basis, Government facilities, special test equipment and special
tooling. These clauses provide controls on the use of Government property by identifying the items of property furnished
under a contract or used on a no-charge basis, and the clauses also describe the obligations of both parties in regard
to the property.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 because the clauses identify and authorize property for use by the contractor which is mutually beneficial to both
parties and do not burden the contractor. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed.
However, comments are invited from small businesses and other interested parties. Such comments must be submitted
separately and should cite 5 U.S.C. 601, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act), announces
a 1-year finding on a petition to add the Pacific coast population of the cactus wren (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Campylorhynchus brunneicapillus couesi
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) to the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife. After a review of all available scientific and commercial information,
the Service determines that listing is not warranted at this time and hereby transfers the petitioned entity from
category 2 to category 3B of the Candidate Notice of Review. The Service concludes that the cactus wrens occupying
coastal southern California do not constitute a distinct population segment. Therefore, the Service concludes
that the Pacific coast population of the cactus wren is not a listable entity.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Pursuant to section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act, the Service is required to make a finding within 12 months of the date of the
receipt of a petition to revise the Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants on whether the petition
is (a) not warranted, (b) warranted, or (c) warranted but precluded for immediate proposal by other proposals of higher
priority. Section 4(b)(3)(C) requires that petitions for which the requested action is found to be ``warranted but
precluded'' should be treated as though resubmitted on the date of such finding. Therefore, a subsequent finding
should be made within 12 months.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 21, 1990, the Service received petitions from the San Diego Biodiversity Project and Palomar Audubon
Society to list the ``San Diego cactus wren'', 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Campylorhynchus brunneicapillus sandiegensis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, as an endangered species pursuant to section 4 of the Act. The San Diego cactus wren, as described, occurs from San
Juan Creek in southern Orange County through western San Diego County southward to Valle de las Palmas in Baja California,
which is just south of the U.S.-Mexico border.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The American Ornithologists' Union Committee on Classification and Nomenclature (Committee) did not recognize
the San Diego cactus wren (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. b. sandiegensis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) as a subspecies of the cactus wren (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Campylorhynchus brunneicapillus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The Committee has concluded that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. b. sandiegensis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is intermediate between 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. b. couesi
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

The Service considers the Committee to be the recognized authority on the taxonomy of the birds of North America. Since

under consideration for addition to the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 22, 1991, the Service announced its 90-day finding on the petitions (56 FR 12146), and indicated that we would
treat the petitions to list 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. b. sandiegensis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as a petition to list the coastal population of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. b. couesi
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, because the cactus wrens residing in coastal California may be disjunct from other cactus wrens, and may constitute
a distinct vertebrate population segment that could qualify for listing under the Act. Under section 3(15) of the
Act the term ``species'' includes any distinct population segment of any species of vertebrate fish and wildlife
which interbreeds when mature. Thus, we indicated that the petition had presented substantial information indicating
that the requested action may be warranted. Based upon our reevaluation of information received, the Service concludes
that the coastal population of cactus wren consists of Pacific coastal portions of

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

C. b. bryanti
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, Congressional intent indicates that the Service is to list populations only ``sparingly''. In determining
the appropriateness of listing a vertebrate population segment under the Act, the Service considers available scientific
evidence regarding the population's discreetness or distinctiveness and regarding the population's significance
to the species as a whole.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The cactus wren is a resident species, and numbers of cactus wrens residing in coastal sage scrub of coastal southern
California have declined as a result of the expressed effects of many of the same factors that have similarly impacted
the largely sympatric, threatened coastal California gnatcatcher (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Polioptila californica californica
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). All of the published literature on the status of coastal sage scrub vegetation types in California supports the
conclusion that this plant community is one of the most depleted habitat types in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, it is currently evident that the cactus wrens residing in coastal sage scrub plant communities are not distinct
from other cactus wrens. Therefore, cactus wrens occupying coastal southern California do not constitute a distinct
vertebrate population segment. For instance, although the coastal birds almost always nest in cactus, cactus is
a preferred nesting substrate of cactus wrens elsewhere in California and in the remainder of the species' range in
the United States. Perhaps more importantly, no apparent morphological or other morphometric differences have
been detected to date that distinguish coastal birds from other cactus wrens. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, it is apparent that the habitat preference of coastal birds 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
(coastal sage scrub) does not readily separate them from other members of the subspecies. Several treatments exist
describing various types of scrub communities in southern California and Baja California. The coastal sage scrub
plant formation grades into coastal succulent scrub and eventually into Sonoran desert scrub. Although some gaps
in the range of the species may exist, birds representing 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. b. bryanti 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
or 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. b. couesi
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, as currently defined by the American Ornithologist's Union (R. Banks, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1994), likely occupy all of these ``scrub'' plant communities or formations. Hence, because cactus wrens evidently
occupy several plant communities and are not isolated in habitat, the Service concludes that providing protection
pursuant to the Act for birds living in some (but not all) of these plant communities and habitats is inappropriate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the cactus wrens occupying coastal southern California are not likely significant to the continued
existence of a species that occurs in portions of southern California, southern Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Utah,
and Texas, in the United States, and mainland Mexico. The species is relatively common throughout much of its range.
However, since the birds occupying coastal southern California are not distinct, the issue of significance need
not be addressed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This finding announced herein is not intended to discount the importance of the coastal sage scrub ecosystem in southern
California, which is the subject of intense multispecies and ecosystem planning efforts that have been undertaken
and endorsed by the Service; the Secretary of Interior; the Resources Agency, State of California; the California
Department of Fish and Game; numerous local governments; citizens' groups; and individual citizens. Cactus wrens
living in coastal southern California have declined in numbers, and coastal sage scrub habitats are becoming increasingly
depleted. Efforts to conserve these depleted habitats will be of benefit to cactus wrens residing in coastal southern
California, Federal candidate species, and other sensitive species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the absence of sufficient evidence that a listable entity exists, the Service concludes that it is appropriate
to transfer the ``coastal population of the cactus wren'' from category 2 candidate status to category 3B. Category
3B species are taxa that, on the basis of current taxonomic understanding, do not represent distinct taxa, including
vertebrate populations, meeting the Act's definition of ``species.'' Such taxa could be reevaluated in the future
on the basis of new information. In that regard, the service will continue to accept information on the taxonomy and
distinctness of cactus wren taxa and the significance of the Pacific coast population segment.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On July 8, 1994, NMFS proposed listing Umpqua River cutthroat trout as endangered under the Endangered Species Act
(ESA) (59 FR 35089). Department of Commerce ESA implementing regulations state that the Secretary of Commerce ``shall
promptly hold at least one public hearing if any person so requests within 45 days of publication of a proposed regulation
to list.&blank;.&blank;.&blank;.a species'' (50 CFR 424.16 (c)(3)). A public hearing on the proposed listing provides
the opportunity for the public to give comments and to permit an exchange of information and opinion among interested
parties. In response to a request by the Douglas Timber Operators, Inc. for a public hearing, NMFS announces that a
hearing on the proposed listing of the Umpqua River cutthroat trout will be held from 7:00 p.m. to 9:30 p.m., Thursday,
September 29, 1994, at the Timber/Indian Rooms of the Campus Center at the Umpqua Community College. The Umpqua Community
College is located on College Way Road, Winchester, OR, and is approximately 7 miles north of Roseburg.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The original public comment period for the proposed listing of Umpqua River cutthroat trout was scheduled to close
on September 6, 1994. To ensure that the public is provided adequate opportunity to comment on the proposed listing,
and in order to accept public comment after the public hearing, NMFS is extending the ongoing public comment period
for 30 additional days. The extended public comment period for the proposed rule to list Umpqua River cutthroat trout
as endangered will conclude October 6, 1994. Written comments should be sent to the address below.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is proposing regulations governing lead-based paint activities to ensure that individuals engaged in such activities
are properly trained; that training programs are accredited; and that contractors engaged in such activities are
certified. This proposed rule would also establish standards for performing lead-based paint activities and require
that all lead-based paint activities be performed by certified individuals. When promulgated, the rule would fulfil
the mandate of section 402 (a)(1) of Title IV of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). Additionally, as part of this
proposed rule, EPA has, in accordance with section 404(d) of TSCA, developed a proposed Model State Program. When
promulgated, this program may be adopted by any State that seeks to administer and enforce a State program under Title
IV of TSCA.

EPA is issuing this proposed rule under the authority of section 402 and 404 of Title IV of the Toxic Substances Control
Act (TSCA) (15 U.S.C. 2682 and 2684.). Section 402(a) of TSCA directs EPA to promulgate regulations governing lead-based
paint activities. Section 404(a) of TSCA requires that any State that seeks to administer and enforce the requirements
established by the Agency under section 402 or 406 of TSCA must submit to the Administrator of EPA, in such form as the
Administrator shall require, a request for authorization of such a program. Section 406 of TSCA requires EPA to publish
and from time-to-time revise, a lead hazard information pamphlet and to publish regulations requiring the distribution
of such pamphlet. The requirements of section 406 are being developed in a separate rulemaking.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The objective of this regulation is to address the nation's need for a qualified and properly trained workforce to
assist in the elimination of hazards associated with lead-based paint. Providing for this workforce will ensure
that individuals and firms will conduct lead-based paint activities in a way that will safeguard the environment
and protect human health, specifically, the health of building occupants (especially children under 6 years of age)
and the workers themselves.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To successfully confront the issues associated with lead-based paint hazards at the national level will require
the involvement of many partners working together. In promulgating this regulation, EPA will be establishing the
framework required to address lead-based paint hazards. This framework will ultimately provide support for and
enhance activities currently conducted by public health officials.

<!-- PJG QTAG 01 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to a support system for public health officials, a suitable infrastructure is needed for other mandates
of TSCA Title IV. These mandates include the promulgation of regulations for the disclosure of lead-based paint hazards
in real estate transactions, and the development of a pamphlet to educate the public on potential hazards associated
with renovation and remodeling activities. Activities such as these increase public awareness of the hazards of
lead-based paint, resulting in the need for a workable regulatory infrastructure to respond to the public's concerns.

The Agency recognizes the nation's public health communities as powerful contributors in support of the program
outlined in this proposed regulation. Through the collective efforts of public health communities to address childhood
lead poisoning in areas such as blood-lead screening and case management, and EPA, through the identification and
control of lead-based paint hazards, the goal of preventing the poisoning of children from lead-based paint will
be realized nationwide.

The Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 amended TSCA by adding a new Title IV. Several sections
of Title X direct EPA to promulgate regulations aimed at fulfilling the purposes of the Title X. These include TSCA
section 402, Lead-Based Paint Activities Training and Certification, which directs EPA to promulgate a final regulation
to govern the training and certification of individuals engaged in lead-based paint activities, the accreditation
of training programs and standards for conducting lead-based paint activities; and section 404, Authorized State
Programs, which provides that any State may seek to administer and enforce the requirements established by the Agency
under sections 402 and 406. This proposed rule addresses both sections 402(a) and 404(d). Rules to address the requirements
of other sections of TSCA Title IV (e.g. sections 403 and 406), are being proposed separately. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 01 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Independently, these other sections of TSCA Title IV will support the overriding objectives of Title X. For example,
a required information dissemination program to inform the public of lead-based paint hazards in the home has been
proposed under section 406. Section 403 health-based standards will be developed and promulgated to provide the
basis for identifying hazardous levels of lead in dust, soil, and paint. Studies to determine whether renovation
and remodelling activities may pose a lead-based paint hazard, as well as studies to determine the efficiencies of
various abatement technologies are also being conducted under section 402(c)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the interrelated nature of the various sections of TSCA Title IV, EPA has developed and proposed a subpart A to
40 CFR part 745 which would serve as a reference point for the terms and provisions common to each of the regulations
to be promulgated under Title IV. Later in this preamble these other sections of Title IV and their relevance to today's
proposal will be discussed in more detail. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before it began the development of this proposed rule, EPA informally met with a broad range of interested parties
to solicit information on the subject of lead-based paint activities training, accreditation, certification,
and standards. In addition, the Agency received written comments from dozens of individuals, firms, organizations
and States, all of whom have provided their own perspective on Title X. Additionally, while the Agency continued to
meet informally with interested groups and review written comments, the Society for Occupational and Environmental
Health (SOEH) held a series of workshops with experts in the worker protection and training arena as participants.
Following the workshops, SOEH drafted and submitted to the Agency its recommendations for effective worker protection
during lead-based paint activities. The Agency has included the SOEH document and all other written comments, and
written summaries of meetings in the public docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is grateful to all who took the time to provide information, ideas, and suggestions. Over the last several
months, the Agency has carefully reviewed and considered all of this input. While not all points of view were incorporated
in the proposed rule, this proposal reflects many of the thoughts and viewpoints of these interested parties.

IV. Scope 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Lead-Based Paint Activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed regulation deals with the broad category of lead-based paint activities. The term lead-based paint
activities is defined by section 402(b) of TSCA to mean: (1) In the case of target housing _ risk assessment, inspection,
and abatement; and (2) in the case of any public building constructed before 1978, commercial building, bridge, or
other structure or superstructure _ identification of lead-based paint and materials containing lead-based paint,
deleading, removal of lead from bridges, and demolition. For the purposes of this definition, the term ``deleading''
means activities conducted by a person who offers to eliminate lead-based paint or lead-based paint hazards or to
plan such activities. Abatement, as defined in section 401 of TSCA, essentially means any set of measures designed
to eliminate lead-based paint hazards permanently. The definition of abatement in the proposed rule is intended
to include activities performed by those individuals, who by design or intent, perform lead abatement as defined
by TSCA Title IV. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should be noted that this proposed regulation would not require any person to abate lead-based paint, or to inspect
for the presence of lead-based paint. Rather, it would establish requirements and procedures applicable to individuals
and firms responsible for making a determination of the presence of lead-based paint and/or lead-based paint hazards
and identifying control strategies to address these hazards. If a decision is made to conduct an abatement, this regulation
would provide standards and procedures for conducting the abatement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress, in Title X, has purposefully excluded renovation and remodeling activities from the regulation's definition
of abatement. Section 402(c)(2) of TSCA requires the Agency to conduct a study to assist in determining the extent
to which persons engaged in specific renovation and remodeling activities in target housing, pre-1978 public buildings,
and commercial buildings are exposed to lead or create lead hazards in the conduct of such activities. Section 402(c)(2)
requires that this study be completed by April 28, 1995. Based on the results of this study and other information collected,
the regulation being proposed today must be amended by October 28, 1996, to apply only to certain renovation and remodeling
activities that - according to the section 402(c)(2) study and in consultation with labor organizations, contractors,
and experts in lead health effects create a lead-based paint hazard. As part of today's proposed rule, the Agency is
soliciting any available data that might be helpful in defining the risks posed to workers and/or building occupants
during typical renovation and remodeling activities. This information will assist the Agency in the required rule
revision. EPA recommends that States that are currently developing legislation for a State lead program consider
including legislative authority for the future regulation of renovation and remodeling activities within the scope
of the revised EPA regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the scope of this proposed regulation covers abatement activities as a means of controlling lead-based
paint hazards, the Agency does not wish to suggest that total abatement is the only option for controlling these hazards.
A wide variety of effective hazard control measures can be utilized. In a particular dwelling, it is possible that
a variety of control strategies (e.g., encapsulation, enclosure, component replacement) may need to be utilized
to address all of the lead-based paint hazards identified by the risk assessor. Complete abatement is not always the
best or most appropriate response to address lead-based paint hazards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Homeowners 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Title IV of TSCA does not specifically address whether the regulatory requirements developed for lead abatement
contractors under section 402 are also intended to apply to individual homeowners who conduct lead-based paint activities
within their own dwelling units. The Agency has decided that its section 402 rules should apply to all individuals
and firms conducting lead-based paint activities in target housing and other specifically identified categories
of buildings and structures, except persons who perform lead-based paint activities at residences which they own,
unless the residence is occupied by a person or persons other than the owner or the owner's immediate family while these
activities are being conducted. If the property is occupied by an individual that is not the owner or the owner's immediate
family, any lead-based paint activity, conducted at that time, must be conducted by a certified individual. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The very title of section 1021 of the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992, indicates that the
scope and focus of this section is on training and certification requirements for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
contractors
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, not homeowners. Section 1021 of the 1992 Act added a new Title IV to TSCA. The new Title IV includes both section 402
(``Lead-Based Paint Activities Training and Certification'') and 404 (``Authorized State Programs''). Significantly,
section 1021 itself is entitled ``Contractor Training and Certification.'' There is no express requirement in the
statute that homeowners doing lead-based paint activities in their homes must be trained and certified. Nor is there
any such indication in the legislative history. The section 402(a) requirement that all abatements in target housing
be performed by certified contractors has been interpreted by EPA to mean that a homeowner who hires a contractor to
do abatement in his home must hire a contractor who is certified. EPA does not interpret this requirement to mean that
uncertified homeowners cannot do their own abatements. While EPA recognizes it might be possible to draw a different
inference from the above-referenced certified contractor language of section 402(a) as it stands alone, the Agency
believes that the Congressional focus on regulating contractor activity evidenced by the reference in section 1021's
title to ``contractors'' as well as certain other language in sections 402(c)(3) and 406(b) requiring persons who
perform renovation of target housing 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
for compensation
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (e.g. ``contractors'') to provide safety pamphlets to owners and occupants creates enough ambiguity with respect
to Congressional intent that such an inference need not be drawn. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, in section 402(c), as discussed earlier in this preamble, Congress recognized that more needed to be
learned about the risks from renovation and remodelling activities before subjecting such activities to regulation.
Following the completion, by April 1995, of a study of the risks created by renovation and remodelling activities,
Congress has required EPA to revise the section 402(a) regulations to apply them to those renovation and remodeling
activities which create lead hazards. In section 402(c), Congress told EPA what factors to consider ``[i]n determining
which 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
contractors
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 are engaged in such activities'' and required that, if EPA determines that ``any category of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
contractor
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' does not require certification, EPA shall publish an explanation. Again, because of the fact that the Statute specifically
mentions ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
contractors
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' and not ``homeowners,'' it is EPA's interpretation of section 402(c)(3) that Congress' focus was on the need to
regulate contractors doing renovation and remodeling activities, and not homeowners doing renovation and remodeling
of their own homes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA assumes that in writing section 402(c), Congress did not direct that homeowners ultimately be regulated under
section 402(a) because Congress never intended homeowners doing abatements in their own homes to be covered by section
402(a) in the first place. Indeed, homeowners working in their own homes are more likely to be engaged in the sort of
activities described in the definition of ``interim controls,'' which activities require neither training nor
certification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While EPA recognizes that the universe of potentially regulated entities is broader than just contractors and homeowners
doing their own abatements, EPA has decided to exclude only the latter category of individuals from the scope of these
regulations. EPA has chosen to draft this exclusion narrowly because it recognizes the potential health and environmental
hazards that could result from improperly performed abatements and wants to minimize such hazards. However, EPA
invites comment on the scope of this exclusion as drafted and specifically on whether other categories of individuals
or groups (e.g. renters abating their own apartments or volunteer organizations that do renovation work) should
also be excluded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is, however, concerned about the potential exposures to lead which an untrained and uncertified homeowner may
cause to himself/herself and other family members as a result of work done. As a result of this concern, EPA strongly
encourages States to consider whether they wish to use their own legal authority to regulate work done by the homeowner.
For example, States may wish to consider the inclusion of standards for lead-based paint activities in appropriate
building codes. This approach could mirror other State and local regulatory programs already used to control other
work done in homes such as electrical and plumbing work. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to encouraging States to consider programs with the authority to regulate homeowners, EPA plans an aggressive
awareness campaign directed at homeowners. This program will include not only the design and distribution of informational
materials, but the Agency also intends to develop seminars to alert homeowners to the potential hazards associated
with lead-based paint activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Building Types 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In defining lead-based paint activities, section 402(b) of TSCA categorized target housing singly, and public buildings,
commercial buildings, and superstructures (e.g., bridges and watertowers) together. Lead-based paint activities
conducted in target housing are identified in 402(b) as risk assessment, inspection, and abatement. For public buildings,
commercial buildings, and superstructures, 402(b) defines lead-based paint activities as: the identification
of lead-based paint and materials containing lead-based paint; deleading; removal of lead from bridges; and demolition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is proposing to group public building and target housing activities together as one category, and to group
commercial building and superstructure activities together as a second category.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Target housing is defined in the proposed regulation and in section 1004 of Title X to mean ``any housing constructed
prior to 1978 except housing for the elderly or persons with disabilities (unless any child who is less than 6 years
of age resides or is expected to reside in such housing for the elderly or persons with disabilities) or any 0-bedroom
dwelling.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public buildings are not defined under Title X. EPA is proposing to define a public building as any building built before
1978, that is generally open to the public or occupied or visited by children. For example schools, daycare centers,
museums, airports, hospitals, stores, convention centers, and federal and other government facilities are all
considered to be public buildings. It should be noted that all federal facilities, regardless of whether they are
target housing, public buildings, commercial building, or steel structures are specifically covered under this
regulation, as directed by TSCA section 408.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing to define a commercial building as any building used primarily for commercial or industrial activity,
which is generally not open to the public, or occupied or visited by children, including but not limited to, warehouses,
factories, storage facilities, aircraft hangers, garages, and wholesale distribution facilities. Under TSCA,
section 402(b) the only example of a superstructure listed is a bridge, but drawing on the common meaning of superstructure,
EPA is proposing to include other structures such as watertowers, aboveground storage tanks, oil refineries, utility
and other structures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency's determination to group target housing and public buildings together is based on two factors. One factor
is that the potential for lead exposure in a public building setting, such as a museum, school, or daycare center, is
similar to the potential for lead exposure to children in target housing, where families and children reside. Consequently,
EPA is proposing standards for lead-based paint activities in public buildings that have the same degree of protectiveness
as those for target housing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second factor in EPA's decision to propose separate categories is due to differences in the structural design
and building materials that are commonly used in target housing/public buildings and those used in commercial buildings/superstructures.
For example, the structural design and building materials (e.g., wallboard, ceiling tiles, flooring materials,
wooden doorways, and window frames) found in public buildings are often similar to those found in target housing.
Commercial buildings and superstructures, on the other hand, typically are constructed of metal, such as structural
steel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Work practices for the conduct of lead-based paint activities also differ for the aforementioned categories. The
building materials in commercial buildings and superstructures require work practices for deleading activities
that are very different than activities associated with lead abatement in target housing or public buildings. For
example, the deleading of a watertower or industrial warehouse calls for sophisticated rigging and scaffolding
equipment and the erection of containment structures. These methods are not applicable to the abatement of lead-based
paint in target housing or public buildings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given these differences, as well as information supplied by the professional community on deleading steel structures
and commercial buildings, the Agency believes there is little crossover between workers practicing in the target
housing/public buildings realm and those in the commercial building/steel structures realm. Rather, evidence
suggests that individuals are either working in the abatement of target housing and public buildings, or in the deleading
of commercial buildings and steel structures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In drafting this proposal, the Agency considered information provided by several professional groups whose members
perform work in commercial buildings and superstructures. Based on this information, it appears that a broader range
of tasks are practiced by fewer categories of individuals working these structures. Consequently only two accreditation
disciplines (supervisor and worker) have been established for individuals working in commercial buildings and
superstructures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, this proposal would establish the following certification disciplines: inspector technician, inspector/risk
assessor, supervisor, planner/project designer, and worker for target housing and public buildings; and supervisor
and worker for commercial buildings and superstructures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is also proposing standards for lead-based paint activities in three separate categories of facilities. These
categories include target housing, public buildings, and commercial buildings and superstructures. In target
housing, the standards cover inspection, risk assessment, and lead abatement. The second set of standards, for public
buildings, covers the identification of lead-based paint and lead-containing materials, risk assessment, abatement,
and demolition. The final set of standards are for identification, deleading, and demolition in commercial buildings
and superstructures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is requesting comment on its proposed definition of public buildings and its proposal to regulate them
in a fashion similar to target housing. Specifically, the Agency is interested in comment on whether the universe
of building types covered under the proposed definition of public buildings comprise the appropriate range of building
types. Further, the Agency is interested in comment on an alternative strategy that would decrease the number of public
building types that should be regulated in a fashion similar to target housing.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Section 403 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As part of the Lead-Based Paint Exposure Reduction Act, sections 402 and 404 represent just two of the many mandates
that EPA is working under to address the issue of lead exposure. Section 403 of TSCA is one of these other mandates. That
section requires that the Agency shall ``. . .promulgate regulations which shall identify. . .lead-based paint hazards,
lead-contaminated dust, and lead-contaminated soil.'' The section 403 regulations will represent EPA's determination
of those conditions that cause exposure to lead in paint, residential soil, and dust that would result in adverse human
health effects. EPA expects the findings of this rule will be one of the most widely used tools to assist persons who
will make the decisions on whether and how to reduce risk from lead-based paint, soil, and dust. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV established the same 18&hyph;month deadline for promulgation of the section 403 rule as for the rules under
sections 402 and 404. At this time, the Agency is still developing its proposed regulation under section 403. While
the 403 rule, when promulgated, will be important for the lead exposure reduction program, it must be emphasized that
it is essentially a source of guidance for the decisionmaker. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is in contrast to today's proposed rule under sections 402 and 404, which is an infrastructure and ``how to'' type
of rule. When promulgated, today's proposal will develop an infrastructure of training, certification, and standards
for individuals engaged in lead-based paint activities. The 403 rule will identify conditions resulting in adverse
human health effects which may be eliminated pursuant to the standards and requirements contained in the 402 and 404
rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When promulgated, the section 403 rule will be an important part of the federal lead exposure reduction program. However,
it should be noted that the absence of the proposed section 403 rule at this time does not, in the Agency's opinion, significantly
impair the public's ability to meaningfully comment on today's proposal. This is because the identification at a
later date in the section 403 rule levels of lead that would result in adverse human health effects, is not expected
to have a significant impact on the development of the standards and requirements of this proposed regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, the procedures established in proposed &sect;745.228(b)(4) of the regulatory text for the conduct
of dust sampling as a part of a risk assessment in target housing are not expected to change as a function of the level
established for lead-contaminated dust under the section 403 rule. Similarly, the number of course hours needed
to properly train a risk assessor would probably not change due to the establishment of a particular definition of
``lead-based paint hazard'' under the section 403 regulation. In summary, the Agency believes that the standards
and requirements proposed in the 402 and 404 rules can be evaluated independently of the definitions to be proposed
in the future under section 403. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recently, the Agency published guidance on residential lead-based paint, lead-contaminated dust, and lead-contaminated
soil. This guidance is intended to be used to prioritize primary prevention activities that address hazards from
lead in and around residences. EPA expects that these hazards will be among those that will be identified when regulations
are issued under section 403. The levels and conditions described in this guidance should be used by decisionmakers'
to identify lead-based paint hazards, sources of lead exposure, and the need for control actions in residential environments
where children may be present.

V. Accreditation of Training Programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 402(a)(1) of Title IV of TSCA requires EPA to promulgate regulations governing lead-based paint activities
to ensure, among other items, that training programs for individuals engaged in lead-based paint activities are
accredited. Section 402(a)(2) states that these accreditation regulations must contain specific requirements
for the accreditation of lead-based paint activities training programs for workers, supervisors, inspectors and
planners, and other individuals involved in lead-based paint activities. These requirements must include, at least:
(1) Minimum requirements for the accreditation of training providers, (2) minimum training curriculum requirements,
(3) minimum training hour requirements, (4) minimum hands-on training requirements, (5) minimum trainee competency
and proficiency requirements, and (6) minimum requirements for training program quality control. Proposed &sect;745.225,
Minimum Requirements for the Accreditation of Training Programs, describes a Federal accreditation program that
EPA believes meets these requirements. Once the final rule is promulgated, &sect;745.225 may be used by States, as
defined by section 3 of TSCA as a model for purposes of establishing their own accreditation and certification programs
in the context of applying for authorization under section 404 of Title IV of TSCA. The procedures for State program
authorization are addressed in subpart Q of the regulatory text. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Framework for Training
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the proposed &sect;745.225(a), training programs may be accredited to offer courses for the following disciplines:
Inspector technician, inspector/risk assessor, supervisor, planner/project designer, and worker for target
housing and public buildings; and supervisor and worker for commercial buildings and superstructures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Discipline'' means a specific type or category of lead-based paint activity. For example, an ``inspector technician
for target housing and public buildings'' would be a discipline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The course content, as well as the tasks associated with these job disciplines, are based principally on the definition
of lead-based paint activities under TSCA, Title IV, as well as numerous comments the Agency received from practitioners
in the field regarding the tasks associated with lead-based paint activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following represents the categories, and respective roles and responsibilities for each discipline as proposed
in this regulation: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Target Housing and Public Buildings:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Inspector technicians
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 would be responsible for: (1) Conducting an inspection for lead-based paint in target housing and in public buildings;
(2) completing an inspection report; and (3) taking post-abatement soil and dust clearance samples.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Inspector/risk assessors
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 would be responsible for all of the same activities as the inspector technician, as well as: (1) Conducting a risk assessment
and other lead hazard assessment activities (such as screening a residence for lead hazards) in target housing and
in public buildings; (2) completing a risk assessment report; (3) interpreting the results of inspections, and assessments;
(4) identifying hazard control strategies to reduce or eliminate lead exposures; and (5) conducting post-abatement
soil and dust clearance sampling and evaluating the results.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Workers
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 would be responsible for: Conducting abatement activities in accordance with the procedures and requirements of
the pre-abatement plan.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Supervisors
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 would be responsible for: (1) Ensuring that abatement activities are conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements;
(2) in projects involving the abatement of less than 10 units, developing a written pre-abatement plan and an abatement

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Supervisors
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 would be responsible for: (1) Ensuring that deleading activities are conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements;
(2) developing a written deleading plan and a post-abatement report for each assigned abatement project; (3) maintaining
accessibility at all times when deleading activities are being conducted; (4) ensuring completion of all deleading
activities according to the standards of this regulation; (5) identifying lead-based paint; and (6) completing
all other reports required under this regulation. In the statute, activities associated with the inspection and
assessment of lead-based paint are clustered together, and the Agency originally envisioned that it would develop
one job discipline to both inspect for the presence of lead-based paint and to evaluate or assess any lead hazards.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In comments to the Agency, however, contractors performing work in large buildings (i.e., apartment complexes,
schools, etc.) indicated that the costs associated with requirements mandating that individuals conducting inspections
also be required to be trained to conduct risk assessments (as defined by the statute) were overly burdensome. Other
commenters suggested utilizing individuals with less skill, education and training to simply collect the data needed
by a ``risk assessor'' to evaluate lead hazards. Thus, in large settings the work could be done at a significantly lower
cost while not compromising the quality of either the inspection or risk assessment. Based on these comments, the
Agency is proposing the ``inspector technician'' discipline and the ``inspector/risk assessor'' discipline.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The establishment of two distinct disciplines _ one as an entry level position, the ``inspector technician,'' who
would only conduct inspections; and another more advanced position, the ``inspector/risk assessor,'' who would
conduct risk assessments, but who also could conduct inspections _ also will enable individuals to logically progress
in their profession. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To foster this progression, the Agency is proposing to structure the inspector technician course so that it may be
taken as a distinct course, separate from the inspector/risk assessor course. Upon passage of the inspector technician
course, an individual would be able to secure certification as an inspector technician. Once certified as an inspector
technician, an individual would be able to gain the work experience necessary to take the inspector/risk assessor
course and to become certified as an inspector/risk assessor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other hand, individuals that already possess the experience and/or education requirements to become certified
as an inspector/risk assessor would take the inspector technician training course and the inspector/risk assessor
training course together as one unit. Upon completion of the unit, individuals would become eligible for certification
as an inspector/risk assessor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By structuring the two courses in this way, the Agency also has avoided unnecessary duplication in training courses
which individuals seeking to advance their careers sometimes encounter when taking additional training for other
certifications. The content of the proposed inspector/risk assessor course supplements the inspector technician
course and would not repeat any of the material from the inspector technician course.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another example of this approach can be seen in the supervisor and planner/project designer training courses. An
individual could become certified as a supervisor for target housing and public buildings or as a planner/project
designer for target housing and public buildings. However, to become certified as a planner/project designer, an
individual would take the supervisor course and the planner/project designer course as one unit. Individuals seeking
certification as a supervisor would only take the supervisor course, but could take the segment on planning/project
design at a later date if they chose to pursue certification as a planner/project designer. Once again, the planner/project
designer course would supplement the supervisor course and would not repeat any of the material from the supervisor
course.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency received comments from a number of interested parties in reference to the need to avoid duplicative training.
In response, the Agency considered taking a modular approach by specifying a core curriculum that would be common
to all the categories of individuals conducting lead-based paint activities. However, EPA's review of the training
requirements indicates that the only knowledge and skill elements common to all the categories are: background information
on lead, health effects, and regulatory background. Because these elements would only make up one-half day of training,
the Agency believes it is not practical to break out these topics as a separate core curriculum. Consequently, the
Agency has proposed separate courses for each discipline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the Agency invites specific comments on its chosen approach and suggestions for outlining a modular approach
that could be practicably implemented. Currently, the regulation requires a minimum amount of classroom time for
each course (e.g. the inspector technician course shall last a minimum of 24 hours). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the Agency feels that the advantages of classroom training (opportunity for student teacher interaction,
the ability of the training provider to update or customize the course material delivery at the time of the course)
are significant, the Agency also is interested and requests comment on less traditional educational methods. These
alternative methods could include the use of videotape or at-home study, for the delivery of the course material.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One such alternative would allow individuals to study course materials at home, and then spend one or two days at a training
program facility to receive hands-on instruction and to take the course exam. This alternative would help to reduce
travel expenses, may lower tuition costs, and would reduce the time that a trainee would have to miss work. The Agency
is concerned however that non-classroom oriented instructional methods may not provide training of a quality equivalent
to classroom instruction. Comments on the impact of quality resulting from alternative training methods taking
into account the requirement for hands-on training, course test, and third party exam, are specifically sought as
a part of this proposal.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Application Process
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;745.225(a) describes the process a training program must follow when applying for accreditation
from an approving authority. ``Approving authority'' is defined in this proposed regulation to mean EPA or in the
case of a State or Tribal program authorized by EPA under this proposal, the appropriate State agency or Tribal authority;
an ``accredited training program'' means a training program that has been accredited by an approving authority to
provide training for individuals engaged in lead-based paint activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The procedures in proposed &sect;745.225(a) would apply to all training programs seeking accreditation, regardless
of when they began offering lead training. After the effective date of &sect;745.225, only accredited training programs
may offer lead-based paint activity training for individuals seeking certification under proposed &sect;745.226.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For a training program to be accredited, the program would have to submit an application and all of the documents and
information listed in proposed &sect;745.225(a)(2) to the approving authority. These documents would be used by
the approving authority to determine if the training program meets the minimum requirements for accreditation of
training programs listed in proposed &sect;745.225(b). Training programs also would be required to maintain copies
of all documents submitted with their application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Documents to be submitted as a part of the application would include a written statement signed by the training program
manager that clearly demonstrates that the training program meets the requirements outlined in &sect;745.225(b).
The training manager would be responsible for ensuring that the training program complies with all requirements
in proposed &sect;745.225(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The training manager must also certify that all of the program's principal instructor(s) and work practice instructor(s)
meet the specified experience requirements and ensure satisfactory performance of the program instructors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copies of the program's instructor/student manuals and the course agenda for each course must also be submitted with
the application for accreditation. However, if the training program chooses to utilize EPA-developed model course
materials, they would not be required to submit these materials, but only to maintain them. This exclusion is not intended
to favor the use of EPA-developed materials, but to minimize the documentation that a training program must submit,
and thus to minimize the paperwork burden generated by the application process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Once the training program's application for accreditation is submitted, the approving authority would have 180
days to approve or disapprove the application. The approving authority may, at its discretion, work with training
programs to address inadequacies in the request for accreditation. If a training program's application is disapproved,
the program may reapply at any time. If a training program's application is approved, a certificate of accreditation
would be sent to the applicant. A training program may offer basic full length training courses and refresher training
courses in as many disciplines as it chooses, but would be required to seek accreditation for each discipline. However,
a training program cannot apply for accreditation to teach a refresher course unless it is accredited to teach the
full length basic course. A training program may apply for accreditation to teach both the full length basic training
course and the refresher training courses simultaneously. Procedures to apply for accreditation to teach a refresher
training course are discussed in unit V.F. of this preamble. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Minimum Requirements for the Accreditation of Training Programs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For a training program to obtain accreditation for any of the courses, the program would have to demonstrate it meets
the requirements detailed in proposed &sect;745.225(b). The proposed requirements have been developed to ensure
that all accredited training programs are offering similar high quality training courses, regardless of where the
training programs are located.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The training program would have to employ a qualified training manager, principal instructor(s), and work practice
instructor(s) and would have the necessary facilities to teach both the lecture and hands-on portion of the course(s)
for which the program would be seeking accreditation. Proposed &sect;745.225(b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) lists the
education and experience requirements that the Agency believes training managers, principal instructors, and
work practice instructors would have to possess to ensure that training is conducted properly. Documents that would
serve as a proof of these educational requirements are identified in proposed &sect;745.225(b)(5). The Agency invites
specific comment on the educational and work experience requirements it is proposing for training program managers
and course instructors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The training manager is responsible for the overall quality of the training program from the qualifications of the
instructors to the adequacy of the training facility. They are responsible for certifying, in the program application,
that the program meets all of the accreditation requirements of this regulation, and for maintaining the program
at that level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The principal instructor is responsible for the organization, delivery and oversight of all course materials. In
this capacity the principal instructor has the flexibility to bring in experts (e.g. doctors or lawyers) to teach
selected portions of the training course (e.g., health effects of lead or regulatory requirements). These experts,
termed ``guest instructors,'' might not be professional trainers or practitioners in the lead-based paint activities
arena, but must maintain specialized knowledge of a particular course topic. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a part of the educational requirements for training managers, and principal and work practice instructors, the
Agency has proposed a 40&hyph;hour train-the-trainer course. The Agency chose 40 hours based on comments it has received
from a number of interested parties. On the other hand, several parties have expressed concern to the Agency that 40
hours is an extensive period of time for a train-the-trainer course. Comments on this issue are invited, as well as
the submission of supplemental information on the utility of a 40&hyph;hour course.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;745.225(c) of the regulatory text lists the minimum curriculum requirements for each course. The
minimum requirements are a list of topics that would be covered in each of the courses, as well as the specified skill
areas where hands-on training would occur. There would be minimum curriculum requirements for inspector technicians,
inspector/risk assessors, supervisors, planner/project designers, and workers in target housing and public buildings;
and supervisors and workers in commercial buildings and superstructures. The training programs would also provide
instruction in the standards in proposed &sect;745.228 for conducting lead-based paint activities. The course
topics that must include a hands-on exercise are noted in the proposed rule with an asterisk.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each training program's course would have to meet or exceed the appropriate minimum total training hour and hands-on
training requirements as stated in proposed &sect;745.225(b)(7) of the regulatory text. The hands-on training
hours are included in the total number of training hours. The total training hours and hands-on training hour requirements
were developed by the Agency based on its experience in developing other training programs for asbestos, pesticides,
and radon. In defining the total training hour requirements, the Agency also considered information it has received
from the EPA-sponsored Regional Lead Training Centers, private training providers, and other university-based
training providers, labor organizations, and other interested parties. The Agency is requesting that individuals
who have data that would support alternative minimum training hour requirements submit that information during
the comment period for consideration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure trainee competency and proficiency, the accredited training program would have to administer a course
test at the end of the course and conduct a hands-on skills assessment. The hands-on skills assessment would be an evaluation
of the effectiveness of the hands-on training which should test the ability of the trainees to demonstrate satisfactory
performance of all the specified work practices and procedures described in proposed &sect;745.225(c). Both the
hands-on assessment and the course test would have to be successfully completed to pass the course.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure the quality of the training programs, programs would have to develop, implement, and maintain a quality
control plan and submit the plan to the approving authority for consideration. The quality control plan should be
developed so as to maintain and improve the quality of the training program over time. The plan would address procedures
for periodic revision of training materials and the course test to reflect innovations in the field, and procedures
to periodically review instructor competency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An example of why the provisions for quality control and periodic revision of course materials are important is seen
in the inspector/risk assessor course. The procedures outlined in proposed &sect;745.228(b) and (e) of the regulatory
text are critical for the conduct of risk assessments in target housing and public buildings. However, risk assessment,
or determining the nature or severity of a lead-based paint hazard is an evolving field where technologies are advancing
at rapid pace. The skills needed for assessing lead-based paint hazards would be addressed in the inspector/risk
assessor course, so provisions for quality control and the periodic revision of course materials to include state-of-the-art
advances are of the utmost importance to ensure professional competence.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Course Test
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;745.225(b)(8) outlines the requirements for the course test that would be administered by training
programs at the completion of each course. The course test would be representative of the topics taught in the course.
Although the Agency expects most training providers to develop and administer a written course test, EPA is requesting
comment on the need to make special provisions for individuals who cannot read English, or who have a low reading comprehension.
For example, training providers may want to develop a course test in a foreign language, or to administer the test orally.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regardless of how it is administered, training participants would be required to pass the course test by answering
correctly at least 70 percent of the test questions. Upon successfully passing the course test and the hands-on assessment,
individuals would receive a course completion certificate. Passage of the course test and hands-on assessment would
demonstrate that the trainee has been properly trained.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
F. Minimum Requirements for the Accreditation of Refresher Training Programs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;745.225(d) outlines the minimum requirements that would be required for the accreditation of refresher
training programs. These requirements would ensure that all accredited training programs would offer similar high
quality refresher training courses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Refresher training would address the following topics: An overview of key safety practices; an update on current
laws and regulations (Federal, State, and local); and an update on new technologies. The course would be a minimum
of 7 training hours and would include a course test to be administered at the end of the course. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The minimum course requirements for a refresher training course would serve to update an individual's knowledge
and skills so they can effectively and safely continue to practice in the field.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to its application, a training program seeking accreditation to teach a refresher course(s) would submit
to the approving authority the materials to be used for the course. This information would be submitted for each discipline
for which the program will be seeking accreditation. The approving authority would have 45 days to approve or disapprove
the request for accreditation and to issue a certificate of accreditation. The approving authority may, at its discretion,
work with training programs to address inadequacies identified in the request for accreditation. If a training program's
application is disapproved, the program would be able to reapply at any time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A training program may offer refresher training courses in as many disciplines as it chooses, but would be required
to seek accreditation for each discipline. However, a training program cannot apply for accreditation to teach a
refresher course unless it is accredited to teach the full length basic course. A training program may apply for accreditation
to teach both refresher training courses and full length basic training courses simultaneously. Procedures to apply
for accreditation to teach a full length basic training course are discussed in paragraph C of this Unit in the preamble.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
G. Re-accreditation of Training Programs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To ensure that accredited training programs continue to offer high quality training, the Agency has proposed requirements
at &sect;745.225(e) for the re-accreditation of training programs. An accredited training program would have to
be re-accredited every 3 years by the approving authority. To qualify for this re-accreditation, an audit of the training
program by the approving authority may be performed at the approving authority's discretion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The application for re-accreditation shall include a list of courses for which the training program is applying to
teach and a description of any changes or updates to the training facility or equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the application, the training program manager would sign a statement certifying that: (1) The course
materials meet the applicable curricula requirements in proposed &sect;745.225(c); (2) the training manager,
principal instructors, and work practice instructors meet the qualifications in proposed &sect;745.225(b)(1),
(b)(2), and (b)(3); (3) the training program complies at all times with all requirements in proposed &sect;745.225(b);
(4) the quality control program meets the requirements described in proposed &sect;745.225(b)(11); and (5) that
the recordkeeping requirements in proposed &sect;745.225(h) are being followed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The training program would submit an application for re-accreditation at least 180 days prior to expiration of its
existing accreditation. If a training program does not submit its application for re-accreditation in time, EPA
would not be able to guarantee that the application would be processed before the applicant's accreditation expires.

H. Suspension, Revocation, and Modification of Accredited Training Programs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;745.225(f) contains the procedures that the approving authority would follow to suspend, revoke,
or modify a training program's accreditation. The approving authority may, generally after notice and opportunity
for a hearing, suspend, revoke, or modify a training program's accreditation if a training program or its training
manager, or other supervisor has committed any of the acts identified in proposed &sect;745.225(f).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;745.225(g) of the regulatory text describes the procedures that the approving authority would follow
if it decides to suspend, revoke, or modify the accreditation of a training program. These include procedures for
notifying the program; for conducting the hearing, if requested; and for immediate action to suspend the accreditation
of any program.

J. Training Program Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;745.225(h) of the regulatory text outlines the recordkeeping and reporting requirements for accredited
training programs. The recordkeeping requirements would ensure that the approving authority could obtain the information
necessary to audit programs and ensure that approved training programs are in compliance with all applicable standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The training program would maintain, and make available to the approving authority, if requested, all documents
submitted to the approving authority as listed in proposed &sect;745.225(a)(ii). In addition the training program
would maintain all documents specified in proposed &sect;745.225(b)(5) that demonstrate the qualifications of
the training manager, principal instructors, and work practice instructors. Student files also would be maintained
and would contain at a minimum, the results of the student's hands-on skills assessment and course test, and a copy
of their course completion certificate. The training program would retain these records for a minimum of 3 years and
6 months at the location and address specified on the training program accreditation application. Training programs
would notify the approving authority 30 days prior to relocating its business or transferring the records.

K. Training and Other Regulatory Requirements Applicable to Lead-Based Paint Abatement Professionals Under the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the training and recordkeeping requirements of this proposed rule, there are other regulations that
may apply to individuals engaged in lead-based paint activities. Some lead-based paint activities may result in
the generation of hazardous waste as defined under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). For convenience,
this paragraph includes references to the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Code of Federal Regulations
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (CFR) for applicable RCRA hazardous waste generator requirements (see 40 CFR part 262), as well as references to training
and recordkeeping requirements. References to training and recordkeeping requirements are specified as needed
in the following discussion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Training requirements
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Individuals involved in projects that generate more than 100 kilograms/month of hazardous waste must be instructed
in hazardous waste determination and management procedures relevant to their job descriptions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are also RCRA training requirements cited in 40 CFR 265.16 which are applicable to both large quantity generators
of hazardous waste (more than 1,000 kilograms/month of hazardous waste are generated) and operators of the RCRA treatment,
storage, and disposal facilities. Small quantity generators (more than 100 kilograms/month but less than 1,000
kilograms/month of hazardous waste are generated) must comply with the training requirements in 40 CFR 262.34(d).
Individuals engaged in lead-based paint activities must be familiar with the requirements cited in 40 CFR 265.16(b),
(c), and (d)(1) through (d)(4) and follow them when handling lead-based paint abatement waste.

. RCRA requires that training records cited in 40 CFR 265.16(d)(1) through (d)(4) be maintained by hazardous waste
generators to show that a generator of hazardous waste who generates greater than 1,000 kilograms/month of hazardous
waste (see 40 CFR 261.3 and 261.10 through 35) has completed the RCRA training requirements. The abatement workers'
RCRA training records must be maintained on-site where abatement work will be performed.

VI. Certification of Individuals and Firms Engaged in Lead-Based Paint Activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 402(a)(1) of Title IV of TSCA requires EPA to promulgate regulations to ensure, among other items, that contractors
engaged in
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lead-based paint activities are certified. EPA interprets this requirement to apply to individuals, as well as firms,
engaged in lead-based paint activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``certified contractor,'' as defined in section 1004 of Title X, includes (1) a contractor, inspector or
supervisor who has completed a training program certified by EPA and who has met any other requirements for certification
established by EPA or who has been certified by any State through a program which has been found by EPA to be at least as
protective as the Federal certification program; and (2) workers and designers who have fully met training requirements
established by EPA or an approved State program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, EPA has determined that an individual performing lead-based paint activities as an inspector, supervisor,
worker or designer is subject to regulations as a ``certified contractor'' pursuant to section 402. Although ``risk
assessor'' was not expressly listed in the definition of ``certified contractor'' in section 1004 of Title X, the
function of a risk assessor _ to prepare a risk assessment _ is defined as a lead-based paint activity under TSCA Title
IV, section 402(b). Consequently the Agency is proposing to define a risk assessor as a ``contractor'' in the same
way that inspectors and supervisors are defined as contractors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the same time the Agency recognizes that the term ``contractor'' may also be used to describe a firm or a company,
rather than an individual. Consequently, the Agency is proposing regulations governing the activities of firms,
as well as individuals engaged in lead-based paint activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;745.226(f) of the regulatory text identifies the requirements firms would need to meet to obtain
certification. Under these requirements a firm engaged in lead-based paint activities would submit to the approving
authority a letter certifying that the firm will only employ certified employees to conduct lead-based paint activities
and that the firm will adhere to the standards and recordkeeping requirements in proposed &sect;745.228.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure that individuals are adequately trained and certified the Agency has developed two distinct training and
certification programs. One of the programs has been designed for individuals engaged in lead-based paint activities
as workers and project planners/designers. The other program has been designed for individuals engaged in lead-based
paint activities as inspectors, supervisors and risk assessors. These certification programs are discussed in
detail in units VI.B. and C. of this preamble. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on comments received during the development of this proposed rule, the Agency is proposing the use of a national
certification exam to be included as a part of the certification process for inspector technicians, inspector/risk
assessors and supervisors. The national exam is included in the certification requirements described in &sect;745.226(b)
for inspector technicians, inspector/risk assessors and supervisors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency believes that the administration of a certification exam would significantly contribute to the Agency's
efforts to ensure that individuals are adequately trained and would encourage a nationally consistent approach
to the development of a trained and certified workforce. Options for the development of a national exam and the purpose
of the exam are discussed in more detail later in units VI.D. and E. of this preamble.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;745.226 of the regulatory text has also been developed as a model for States to use when establishing
their own certification programs in the context of applying for authorization under section 404 of Title IV of TSCA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although this proposed rule specifies certification requirements as well as standards for all individuals engaged
in lead-based paint activities, it does not contain a requirement that particular activities be undertaken in any
specific sequence. For example, there will be no requirement to conduct an inspection if, due to the availability
of historical information, lead-based paint is presumed to exist and a decision to abate without an inspection has
been made. Under such circumstances, the abatement may proceed using certified individuals without the conduct
of a prior inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Only certified individuals may conduct the lead-based paint activities defined in this proposed regulation. If
a homeowner decides to have an inspection (as defined by this proposed regulation) conducted, the individual providing
the inspection service must be certified. However, any lead related work that does not meet the definition of a lead-based
paint activity, as identified in section 402(b)(1) and (2) and as defined by this regulation, need not be conducted
by a certified individual. For instance, during a kitchen remodelling project a homeowner may decide to have the paint
on only one wall in the kitchen tested for lead, by a non-certified individual or firm because such limited testing
is not an ``inspection'' as that term is defined by the regulation. However, no individual or firm may perform or even
offer to perform any lead-based activity, e.g. inspection, risk assessment, or abatement, as defined in this part,
unless certified according to the procedures found at proposed &sect;745.226.

B. Inspector Technician, Inspector/Risk Assessor, or Supervisor Certification
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Individuals wishing to become certified by the approving authority as an inspector technician, an inspector/risk
assessor, or a supervisor would have to: (1) Successfully complete the appropriate training course offered by an
accredited training program and secure a course completion certificate; (2) meet the appropriate experience and/or
education requirements and; (3) pass the certification examination recognized by the approving authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To be eligible to take the certification examination, an individual would first have to present the required training
course completion certificate and documentation of the appropriate education/experience prerequisites to an
official of the examination administering body. Documents that would be recognized as proof of these prerequisites
are listed in proposed &sect;745.226(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Experience and/or education requirements are proposed in the regulatory text for inspector/risk assessors for
target housing and public buildings, supervisors for target housing and public buildings, and supervisors for commercial
buildings and superstructures. There are no experience and/or education requirements proposed for inspector technicians
because the EPA believes that this would present an unnecessary barrier to entry into this field.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many interested parties commented that the work experience and educational qualifications of inspector/risk assessors
and supervisors should be substitutable. Therefore, the Agency, in proposing education/experience requirements,
took into account its experience in developing training programs in the past (e.g., asbestos) and comments provided
by a number of interested parties, such as the Regional Lead Training Centers, labor organizations, advocacy organizations,
and trade organizations. Based on information received, the experience and education requirements for inspector/risk
assessors and supervisors were developed by the Agency in an effort to allow individuals to substitute qualifying
experience for education and visa versa. These requirements were developed to avoid excluding individuals whose
experience might warrant qualification to become certified but who would not qualify on the basis of the education
requirements alone. Proposed &sect;745.226(b)(1) of the regulatorytext describes the education/experience
requirements for inspector/risk assessors and supervisors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency specifically requests comment on the education and/or experience requirements it is proposing for inspector/risk
assessors and supervisors, and its decision not to propose any education and/or experience requirements for inspector
technicians. It also is seeking comment on the administration of a national certification examination as discussed
in units VI.D. and E. of this preamble. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Worker and Planner/Project Designer Certification
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Individuals wishing to become certified as workers in target housing and public buildings or commercial buildings
and superstructures or planner/project designers in target housing and public buildings would have to successfully
complete and receive a course completion certificate in the appropriate discipline from an accredited training
program. There are no experience and/or education prerequisites for workers or planner/project designers, nor
would these job disciplines be required to take a national certification examination. This decision is based on EPA's
understanding of the definition of ``certified contractor'' in section 1004 of Title X, which only requires training
as a precondition to certification for workers and planner/project designers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The training course completion certificate issued to a worker or planner/project designer would serve as an interim
training certificate for 6 months. Within 6 months the individual would submit a valid copy of their course completion
certificate to the approving authority. The approving authority would then issue a final certification to each worker
and project designer. This certification would be valid for 3 years. An individual would have to be re-certified by
the approving authority before the certification expires. Training programs may wish to assist trainees in notifying
the approving authority of their eligibility for certification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Certification Examination
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;745.226(b) of the regulatory text describes the certification requirements for inspector technicians,
inspector/risk assessors, and supervisors. Under these requirements, an individual would successfully complete
the appropriate training course and secure the course completion certificate, and meet the appropriate education/experience
requirements. After obtaining a course completion certificate and meeting these requirements, an individual would
be ready to take the certification examination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The certification examination is a key component of the Agency's certification program, especially for inspector
technicians, inspector/risk assessors, and supervisors. While there would be a required test at the end of each training
course, the certification examination would serve as a neutral or third party examination of the applicant's proficiency
in the appropriate training discipline. A neutral or third party would administer the examination in such a way that
the validity and security of the examination are maintained. The examination would serve to ensure that each individual
who will be certified under this program would have a common level of knowledge and understanding in their particular
discipline. It is the Agency's belief that administration of a neutral or third party examination would encourage
States to enter into reciprocal certification arrangements with other States nationwide.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The examination itself would not be developed as part of this proposed regulation, but would be developed separately
under the auspices of EPA, according to guidelines discussed in paragraph E of this Unit in the preamble.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is anticipated that the approving authority may not always be able to offer the certification examination immediately
after an individual has received their course completion certificate. To allow individuals to begin work, the course
completion certificate would also serve as an interim certification until evidence of successfully passing the
next available certification examination is provided. This interim certification would be valid for up to 6 months.
If an individual did not pass the certification examination and receive their certificate within this 6&hyph;month
period, the individual would have to retake the appropriate course before reapplying for certification from the
approving authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After passing the certification examination and meeting the education/experience prerequisites, an individual
would be issued a certificate by the approving authority. This certification would be valid for 3 years. There would
be separate certification examinations offered for each discipline.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is examining various options for the development and administration of the certification examination. One option
is for EPA or a State to work with a competent independent organization to develop and/or administer the certification
examinations based on the guidelines discussed below. A second option is to have authorized State programs develop
and administer their own certification examinations according to the Certification Examination Guidelines. A
third option is for EPA to develop and/or administer the certification examinations. Comment is invited on these
options and on the feasibility of an independent organization administering the examination. The goal of the certification
examination process is to give each State the flexibility it desires in fashioning its certification program, while
at the same time ensuring a consistent national level of competence in the lead-based paint activities workforce.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Certification Examination Criterion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following are criterion that, although not a part of this proposed rule, EPA expects will be followed when developing
the certification examination:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Subject matter experts (SMEs) will be consulted throughout the development and early evaluation process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. This consultation will be done using oral interviews and written questionnaires devised by the SMEs in concert
with testing development professionals. A job or task analysis will be performed for each discipline. This analysis
will be used in the development of the initial test questions and the overall development of the topical format of the
examinations, including the amount or percentage of questions for each topic covered on a particular examination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. A readability analysis of the test questions will be performed. Based on this evaluation, changes will be made as
necessary in the construction of the test questions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Complete psychometric evaluation techniques will be utilized in the initial construction of the tests.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. A cut score workshop will be conducted to review each question in the item bank (or test bank). The SME's shall be used
to evaluate each question. They would establish a level of difficulty for each question, as well as the percentage
of each topic to be covered on the test. Based on their knowledge of the industry, the SMEs will provide an estimate of
the number of candidates who would successfully complete each question. Once these items have been established,
an appropriate, industry accepted procedure will be used to set a minimum passing (or ``cut'') score for each examination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Continuous psychometric evaluation of the test questions will be used. The test questions will be periodically
revised and updated through the collection of statistics regarding the performance of candidates on each question.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA recognizes that States may wish to impose additional testing requirements on candidates. This practice is acceptable
as long as the test questions used by a State do not duplicate the topics covered in the standardized certification
examination, but rather are specific to State laws, regulations, and work practice requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
F. Certification Based on Prior Training
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is aware that when the regulation becomes effective, there will be many individuals who have, over the past several
years, already received training and have been working in the lead-based paint abatement field. While many of these
individuals may not believe that any additional training will be necessary, the Agency has a responsibility to ensure
that individuals engaged in lead-based paint activities are properly trained. The Agency does not, however, wish
to unnecessarily burden individuals, some of whom already have years of experience in this field.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recognizing this situation, the Agency has proposed at &sect;745.226(d) a procedure for certifying some of these
individuals under a reduced set of requirements. Anyone who has received lead-based paint activities training between
October 1, 1990, and the effective date of the rule may be eligible for certification under these proposed procedures.
To become eligible for certification based on prior training, all individuals would have to show proof of training
received after October 1, 1990, and that such training included a curricula similar to the requirements in &sect;745.225(c).
Inspector/risk assessors, and supervisors would also have to document that they meet the education and/or experience
requirements listed in proposed &sect;745.226(b)(1). These individuals would also have to successfully complete
a refresher training course and pass the national certification examination for the appropriate discipline.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Workers and planner/project designers seeking certification under these procedures would have to successfully
complete a refresher training course. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In considering grandfathering, the Agency invites comment on what criteria should be used to compare prior training
with the training described in proposed &sect;745.225(c). The Agency believes that some evaluation of the adequacy
of previous training will be necessary to ensure that individuals are properly trained.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has chosen the date of October 1, 1990, as the proposed cutoff for prior training because this is the date
the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) ``Interim Guidelines for Hazard Identification and Abatement
of Lead-Based Paint in Public and Indian Housing'' were issued. These guidelines were the most comprehensive and
accurate information on lead-based paint inspection and abatement issued up to that time. EPA believes that after
October 1, 1990, the HUD guidelines were widely distributed to training programs and that many individuals received
training based on these guidelines. The Agency requests specific comment on using the HUD Guidelines as a rationale
and the October 1, 1990 date as the cutoff point for allowing certification based on prior training.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As of July 1994, 3,245 copies of the guidelines and 231 copies of EPA's lead inspector training course, based substantially
on the HUD Guidelines, have been sold. Additionally, as of September 1993, 306 copies of EPA's model lead abatement
training course for supervisors and contractors, also substantially based on the HUD guidelines, had been sold.
All of these materials were sold to the general public through the HUD contractor-operated distribution center,
HUD User.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the establishment of EPA-supported Regional Lead Training Centers (RLTC) in March 1992, the Centers have trained
approximately 2,000 individuals in the Supervisor/Contractor Course (Ref. 8) and approximately 2,200 individuals
have received training in the RLTC's lead inspector training course (Ref. 9). The RLTCs use EPA's model courses as
the basis for their training classes. Again, EPA's model courses draw substantially from the HUD Guidelines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed rules, individuals would have up to 6 months after the effective date of proposed &sect;745.225
to apply for certification under these prior training procedures. After that date, all individuals wishing to obtain
certification would do so under the process outlined in proposed &sect;745.226(b) and (c) of the regulatory text.
The Agency recognizes that 6 months after &sect;745.225 becomes effective may not seem like an adequate amount of
time to apply for certification under the reduced set of requirements detailed in proposed &sect;745.226(d). However,
when it is considered that proposed &sect;745.225 does not become effective until 2 years and 6 months after the rule
(in its entirety) is issued or ``effective,'' the Agency believes that individuals will have plenty of time to prepare
to apply for certification under the procedures in &sect;745.226(d). The Agency requests comment on the procedures
it is proposing for a prior certification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
G. Re-certification
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency is aware that the lead-based paint activities field is evolving quickly in both inspection and abatement
technology. Given this, under the proposed rule, refresher training would be required every 3 years. This requirement
would be enforced by mandating that all certified individuals be recertified every 3 years. The Agency has chosen
3 years as the amount of time for re-certification for several reasons. EPA believes re-certification of individuals
every 1 or 2 years would be too burdensome. But, it also believes that waiting longer than 3 years would not allow individuals
to receive timely updates on innovations and technological advances in the lead inspection and abatement field or
on new regulatory requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To become re-certified, an individual would successfully complete an accredited 1&hyph;day refresher training
course specific to the discipline in which the individual seeks to be recertified through an accredited training
program; pass the refresher course test, and submit a refresher course completion certificate to the approving authority.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
H. Suspension, Revocation, and Modification of Certification of Individuals Engaged in Lead-Based Paint Activities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 402(a) of TSCA, the approving authority would be able to, after notice and opportunity for a hearing,
suspend, revoke, or modify an individual's certification if an individual has committed any one of the acts listed
in &sect;745.226(g) of the proposed regulatory text. In addition, the approving authority would be able to suspend,
revoke, or modify the certification of individuals who have been subject to a final order imposing a civil penalty
or a criminal conviction for engaging in a prohibited act under section 15 or section 409 of TSCA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, any individual who either: (1) Obtained certification through fraudulent representation or means,
or (2) obtained certification from a training program that is not accredited to offer training is not considered certified
for purposes of TSCA Title IV. It would be considered a violation of TSCA, as well as any other applicable provision
of law, for any such individual to conduct any lead-based paint activities requiring certification. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Certification of Firms Engaged in Lead-Based Paint Activities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;745.226(f) of the regulatory text outlines procedures for the certification of firms. All firms
acting as contractors or conducting lead-based paint activities would have to be certified by the approving authority.
To become certified, a firm would submit a letter to the approving authority certifying that the firm will only employ
certified employees to conduct lead-based paint activities and that the firm will follow the standards and recordkeeping
requirements in proposed &sect;745.228.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency believes the certification of firms is necessary to ensure the use of a certified workforce and compliance
with recordkeeping requirements. A certified firm would present the approving authority with a more manageable
point of contact for administration and enforcement, as opposed to the Agency attempting to monitor the activities
of every worker involved in lead-based paint activities. Additionally, the provisions for the identification of
qualified firms would provide a source of information for the public to identify firms qualified to conduct lead-based
paint activities in target housing, public and commercial buildings, and superstructures. Additionally, the required
certification mechanism would also provide the Agency with a mechanism for notifying contractors of new technologies
and regulatory requirements in an effective and timely manner. A certified firm would follow the recordkeeping standards
outlined in &sect;745.228 of the proposed regulatory text. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

J. Suspension, Revocation, and Modification of Certification of Firms Engaged in Lead-Based Paint Activities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The approving authority would be able to, after notice and opportunity for hearing, suspend, revoke, or modify a firm's
certificate if a firm has committed any of the acts listed in &sect;745.226(h) of the proposed regulatory text. In
addition, the approving authority may suspend, revoke, or modify the certification of firms that have been subject
to a final order imposing a civil penalty or a criminal conviction for engaging in a prohibited act under section 15
or section 409 of TSCA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore any firm which either: (1) Obtained certification through fraudulent representation or means, or (2)
fails to obtain a certificate from the approving Authority is not certified for purposes of TSCA Title IV. It shall
be considered a violation of TSCA as well as any other applicable provision of law, for any such firm to conduct any lead-based
paint activities requiring certification.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;745.226(h) outlines the procedures to be followed if the approving authority decides to suspend,
revoke or modify the certification of any individual or firm. These include procedures for the notification of the
individual or firm; the conduct of the hearing, if requested; and the procedures for immediate action to suspend the
certification of any individual or firm.

VII. Standards for Conducting Lead-Based Paint Activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 402(b) of TSCA requires EPA to develop training and certification requirements for individuals and contractors
engaged in lead-based paint activities. The statute also states that such regulations shall contain standards for
performing lead-based paint activities, taking into account reliability, effectiveness, and safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this proposed rule, EPA has divided the standards for lead-based paint activities into three separate categories
with lead identification and control disciplines specified for each category. These categories include target
housing, public buildings, and commercial buildings and superstructures. In target housing, the standards cover
inspection, risk assessment, and lead abatement. The second set of standards, for public buildings, covers the identification
of lead-based paint and lead-containing materials, risk assessment, abatement, and demolition. The final set of
standards are for identification, deleading, and demolition in commercial buildings and superstructures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although this proposed rule specifies certification requirements as well as standards for all individuals engaged
in lead-based paint activities, it does not contain a requirement that particular activities be undertaken in any
specific sequence. There will be no requirement to conduct an inspection if, due to the availability of historical
information, lead-based paint is presumed to exist and a decision to abate without an inspection has been made. Under
such circumstances, the abatement may proceed using certified individuals without the conduct of a prior inspection.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Background Documents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The statutory timeframe for developing final standards for conducting lead-based paint activities under section
402(a) did not allow sufficient time to conduct extensive new studies and develop entirely new standards for the broad
range of lead-based paint activities as defined in this proposed rule. However, the Agency was able to draw on a body
of existing information and research in the development of these standards. In addition, during the development
of this proposal, the Agency received written input from a broad range of individuals and groups who are currently
working in the fields that conduct lead-based paint activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One example of such resource material is the Interim HUD Lead-Based Paint Guidelines. The Guidelines, published
in 1990, is a comprehensive document that covers all aspects of lead-based paint inspection and abatement activities.
The Guidelines provided an invaluable starting point for the development of EPA's inspection, risk assessment,
and abatement standards. The Guidelines are the only nationally recognized blueprint for conducting safe and effective
abatement in target housing. While State and regional requirements exist for methodologies for some lead-based
paint activities, no other set of guidelines has been used as extensively as the HUD Guidelines. Section 1017 of Title
X requires that HUD issue new guidelines for risk assessment, inspection, interim controls, and abatement. These
guidelines will be entitled 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Guidelines for the Evaluation and Reduction of Lead-Based Paint Hazards in Housing
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Leading experts in the field of lead-based paint inspection, risk assessment, and abatement have been consulted
by HUD in developing these new guidelines, including lead-based paint abatement trainers and abatement professionals,
as well as government officials from the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCP), EPA and HUD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the development of the revised guidelines paralleled the development of this proposed rule, the Agency was
able to consult with HUD throughout the rule development process in an attempt to achieve consistency between the
two documents. The Agency will, when it is available, include a copy of the new HUD guidelines in the public docket for
this proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Inspection for Target Housing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The objective of an inspection is to determine, and then report, the existence of lead-based paint in residential
dwellings through a surface-by-surface investigation. The data collection and reporting standards specified
in &sect;745.228(a) must be followed when conducting an inspection. Because the data collection and reporting standards
are crucial to the accuracy of an inspection, an inspection may only be conducted by an individual certified as either
an inspector technician or an inspector/risk assessor. An inspection is, by definition, intended to provide a comprehensive
inventory of all lead-based paint in a dwelling unit. Consistent with this definition, the inspection report will
provide a detailed evaluation of the presence of lead in all paint within the unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing to define a unit as a room, or connected group of rooms, used or intended to be used by a single tenant
or owner. Section 745.228(a)(2)(ii) of the proposed regulatory text states that component surfaces with distinct
painting histories in every unit must be tested. This effectively means that every unique component within a room
that has a painted surface that has been deemed to have such a painting history by the inspector technician or inspector/risk
assessor, would have to be tested. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirement that every unique painted surface be tested is consistent with the Title X definition of an inspection
involving a ``surface-by-surface investigation.'' An inspection is intended to provide detailed information
on the presence of lead in all paint in a dwelling unit, and the procedures in this proposed standard are intended to
provide a framework to obtain this information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The inspection standards reflect the Agency's preliminary decision not to provide detailed instruction on how to
perform specific lead-based paint identification tasks, for instance, taking a paint chip sample or operating an
XRF instrument, but instead to assure that analysis information is obtained and maintained as part of the recordkeeping
requirements. Because the actual methods and techniques used to determine the presence of lead-based paint (the
test methods) are constantly evolving, and improvements in technology are expected to continue, the standards contained
in this proposed rule do not specify the technology to be utilized for analysis, but do require documented methodologies
which incorporate adequate quality control procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Examples of analytical technologies capable of lead-based paint testing include field portable XRF and, laboratory
analysis of paint chip samples by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission
spectroscopy (ICP). EPA does not intend, in this regulation, to specify in detail the procedures for the analysis
of paint for lead content. The new HUD guidelines, provide comprehensive guidance on both XRF sampling, and laboratory
analytical methods, and the procedures in the guidelines should be followed when conducting lead-based paint testing.
The Agency is considering the need for promulgating detailed regulatory requirements for lead-based paint testing
and requests comment on the need for such an enforceable testing regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed standards do require that any environmental laboratory analysis to determine the lead content in paint,
dust, and soil, be done by only those laboratories recognized by the Agency as being capable of performing these activities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy is widely used as a field inspection devise. The accumulated experience in
use of XRF instruments has provided anecdotal evidence that they are subject to unexplained variances in performance.
To date, there has been little comprehensive evaluation of the performance of XRFs under actual field conditions.
Because of the questions raised concerning XRFs performance, EPA is conducting a field study of lead-based paint
measurement technology. Results of this study will be used to shape lead-based paint testing guidelines which will
be reflected in the new HUD guidelines and disseminated as guidance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While methodologies for determining the presence of lead-based paint may vary, the inspection standards would require
that the inspector technician or inspector/risk assessor prepare an inspection report that would detail the findings
of their inspection and the methods used during the inspection. The inspector technician or inspector/risk assessor
would have to adhere to the reporting requirements listed in proposed &sect;745.228(a)(6) of the regulatory text.
Accurate completion of the report would be the enforceable component of the inspection standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The inspection report would serve as a guide for the inspector technician or inspector/risk assessor to ensure that
all of the necessary information will be obtained during an inspection. An example of an inspection report can be found
in the HUD guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An inspection report would have to be completed for each unit inspected. Upon completion of the testing, an inspection
report would be written and would include all information required in &sect;745.228(a)(6) of the proposed regulatory
text. The inspection report would be retained by the owner of the residence or building and the certified firm that
conducted the inspection for a period of 3 years. Section 1018 of the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction
Act of 1992 requires that by October 1994, the Agency and HUD develop a regulation for the disclosure of lead-based
paint hazards in target housing which will be offered for sale or lease. The inspection report would be subject to the
disclosure and recordkeeping requirements of the section 1018 regulation.

D. Risk Assessment for Target Housing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal government's commonly held definition of risk assessment defines the health effects of exposure to hazardous
materials to individuals or populations by conducting a hazard identification, a dose-response assessment, an
exposure assessment, and a risk characterization (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) (Ref. 1). This form of risk assessment focuses on a quantitative analysis of risk to human health and does not recommend
options for the management of the risk. Risk assessment as defined by TSCA Title IV, differs from this traditional
concept in that the inspector/risk assessor is relied upon to not only identify lead-based paint hazards, but to also
recommend options for the management of these hazards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 401(16) of TSCA provides that the objective of a risk assessment is to determine, and then report the existence,
nature, severity, and location of lead-based paint hazards in residential dwellings through an on-site investigation.
This definition is based on the risk assessment protocols developed by HUD and the Housing Authority Risk Retention
Group (HUD/HARRG) as mandated by amendments to the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987, the Lead-Based
Paint Poisoning Prevention Act (Pub. L. 100&hyph;242). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed rule, a risk assessment, including the risk assessment report, may only be conducted by an individual
certified as an inspector/risk assessor. However, an inspector technician may, assist a certified inspector/risk
assessor by taking paint, soil, and dust samples. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency views the role of the inspector/risk assessor as pivotal in reducing risks associated with lead-based
paint. The certified inspector/risk assessor will be a trained specialist equipped with the requisite professional
credentials needed to evaluate risks associated with lead-based paint. The Agency envisions that a certified inspector/risk
assessor would be qualified to make a competent, and rational assessment of the location and severity of lead-based
paint hazards. The procedures outlined in proposed &sect;745.228(b) of the regulatory text provide a framework
for the collection of risk assessment data. These procedures were developed on the premise that the background and
required training of a professional inspector/risk assessor would enable the inspector/risk assessor to identify
risks associated with lead-based paint hazards and to develop options for actions to eliminate hazards. The required
training would, through the accreditation process outlined in this regulation, include the best scientific information
available on characterizing hazardous levels of lead in paint, soil, and dust. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated earlier in this preamble, the Agency is currently developing criteria pursuant to section 403 of TSCA for
the identification of lead hazards in soil, dust, and paint to facilitate the risk assessment decision making process.
When promulgated, the determinations made under the section 403 regulation, and associated guidance, will be widely
disseminated by the Agency, and will be a required element of the training course curricula under this regulation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The standards in this regulation are intended to apply to individual residential dwelling units, whether in multi-unit
residential dwelling or in single-family housing. The procedures for determining which units are to be assessed
within a multiunit dwelling are not included in these standards. This decision should be made by the building owner
or housing authority in consultation with the inspector/risk assessor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first step of a risk assessment is to have the risk assessor survey the unit or dwelling to evaluate its overall condition.
In buildings built after 1960 in relatively good condition where the probability of finding lead-based paint hazards
is low, a comprehensive risk assessment may be unnecessary. To avoid the cost of conducting a comprehensive risk assessment,
an owner of these dwellings may wish to have the risk assessor conduct a lead hazard screen before initiating the complete
risk assessment. According to the HUD guidelines, such a screen employs more limited sampling and more sensitive
hazard identification criteria. In general a screen involves determining overall paint condition in a unit, taking
limited dust samples from floors and exterior window sills, and soil samples from bare soil. A detailed discussion
of how to conduct a screen and the criteria used to evaluate the results of a screen can be found in the HUD guidelines.
If a unit fails this screen, EPA recommends that a risk assessment, as described in proposed &sect;745.228(b)(2)
through (b)(9) of the regulatory text, be conducted. Failure of the screen indicates that lead hazards may be present
and that a more thorough risk assessment is warranted to definitively identify the lead hazards within the unit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At this point the risk assessor would review any background information as described in proposed &sect;745.228(b)(2).
This data will contain useful information regarding the physical characteristics of the unit and residential use
patterns within the unit. This information includes the age of the building or if there are children under age 6 living
in the unit, as well as information on any known lead-related health problems of any occupant of the dwelling unit.
Further, the risk assessor would obtain any other available information that would characterize occupant use patterns
that may generate or contribute to lead-based paint hazards. Examples of this information could include family hobbies
that involve lead, the location of a commonly used entryway or commonly opened windows. The inspector/risk assessor
should also obtain, if available, any previous test results or inspections regarding lead-based paint or other assessments
for lead-related hazards. This information may prove valuable in determining the presence of lead-based paint without
having to re-sample areas of the unit. However, the inspector/risk assessor must evaluate the quality and the reliability
of any previous test results. Past inspections may not conform to current standards of care, possibly resulting in
an incorrect determination of the location of lead-based paint. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The next step in a risk assessment is to conduct a closer visual inspection of the condition of the painted surfaces
within the unit. Any paint found to be deteriorated should be tested by an inspector technician or the inspector/risk
assessor according to the procedures found in the inspection portion of the proposed standards. The inspector/risk
assessor should also test any surfaces that they determine may be a source of lead dust or lead-based chips. These include
friction and impact surfaces such as door and window frames, or painted surfaces accessible to children such as window
sills or stair treads. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dust samples should be collected within each selected unit according in parts of the living area where children are
most likely to come into contact with dust. These areas include bedrooms, family rooms, and kitchens. In general,
any area that children frequent in the dwelling should be evaluated for lead-contaminated dust. The HUD guidelines
as well as the currently available EPA model inspector course provide detailed guidance and instruction in the collection
of dust samples in residential dwellings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, randomly selected soil samples should be collected by an inspector technician or inspector/risk assessor
and analyzed in order to adequately characterize the lead concentrations in exterior play areas, areas containing
bare soil, and along the dripline or foundation area of a unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All dust, soil, and where appropriate, paint samples should be sent to a laboratory that is fully recognized by EPA
as being capable of performing these activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As with an inspection, the data collected as part of a risk assessment would be documented in an assessment report.
Proposed &sect;745.228(b)(8) of the regulatory text describes all items required to be included in the risk assessment
report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to section 401(16) of TSCA, a risk assessment may include ``other activity as may be appropriate.'' Based
on this language, the Agency is proposing that the risk assessment report should, as a final step, identify lead hazard
control strategies to address all identified lead-based paint hazards. A justification for each hazard control
strategy identified must also be provided. The inspector/risk assessor should also prioritize each of the hazard
control actions based on the immediacy of the hazard, and recommend a schedule to the building owner for addressing
hazards. Clearly the most hazardous conditions (e.g. badly deteriorated lead-based paint) within a unit should
be addressed as soon as possible, and before other control actions are taken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The risk assessment report is to be maintained by the owner of the residence or building, as well as the certified individual
or firm that conducted the assessment for at least three years. This information would also be subject to the disclosure
and recordkeeping requirements of the regulation developed under section 1018 of Title X.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Abatement for Target Housing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Abatement is defined by section 401(1) of TSCA as ``any set of measures designed to permanently eliminate lead-based
paint hazards.'' The term, as defined, includes the removal of lead-based paint and lead-contaminated dust, the
permanent containment or encapsulation of lead-based paint, the replacement of lead-painted surfaces or fixtures,
and the removal or covering of lead-contaminated soil. In addition, it includes all preparation, cleanup, disposal,
and post-abatement clearance testing activities associated with such measures. By definition, abatement is limited
to those activities that are designed to permanently eliminate lead-based paint hazards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Abatement does not include renovation and remodeling, or landscaping activities, whose primary intent is not to
permanently eliminate lead-based paint hazards, but is instead to repair, restore, or remodel a given structure
or dwelling, even though these activities may incidently result in a reduction in lead-based paint hazards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the purposes of this regulation, the Agency will presume abatement to occur in the following circumstances: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Projects for which there is a written contract stating that an individual or firm will be conducting activities
on or in a dwelling unit that will permanently eliminate lead-based paint hazards; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Projects involving the permanent elimination of lead-based paint or lead-contaminated soil conducted by firms
or individuals certified in accordance with this regulation; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Projects involving the permanent elimination of a lead-based paint hazard or lead-contaminated soil conducted
by firms or individuals who, through their company name, promotional literature, or otherwise, advertise or hold
themselves out to be lead abatement professionals. The definition of abatement includes the phrase ``permanent
containment or encapsulation.'' Encapsulation is defined as a process that makes lead-based paint inaccessible,
by providing a barrier between the lead-based paint and the environment. This barrier is formed using a liquid applied
coating or an adhesively bonded material. The primary means of attachment for an encapsulant is bonding of the product
to the surface either by itself or through the use of an adhesive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency recognizes the fact that all encapsulant's will degrade over time, so therefore, no encapsulant is truly
permanent. Nevertheless, the Agency would consider an encapsulant to be ``permanent'' within the meaning of TSCA
Title IV if the encapsulant is periodically monitored and maintained over the lifetime of the surface. The Agency
is soliciting comment on the proposed requirement for the periodic monitoring of encapsulants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The permanent containment of lead-based paint would be achieved through the use of a mechanical enclosure system.
The enclosure should be a rigid, durable barrier that is mechanically attached to the building component, with all
edges and seams sealed with caulk or other sealant to provide a dust-tight system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As defined in this proposal, an abatement would have to be conducted by persons certified by the appropriate approving
authority as a worker or supervisor. Every abatement project would require a supervisor assigned to it who has been
certified by the appropriate approving authority. The supervisor, if not on-site, would have to be available by phone
and able to physically be present at the work-site within 2 hours. This supervisor, as well as the certified firm they
work for, would be responsible for ensuring that all abatement activities in target housing are completed according
to the standards outlined in this proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding project designer/planners, the Agency is including in proposed &sect;745.228(c)(7) of the regulatory
text, a requirement that they prepare a written pre-abatement plan for projects involving the abatement of 10 or more
units, since the size of these operations may require a level of expertise not required in single-family, or smaller
multi-unit projects. The Agency is requesting comment on the proposed requirement that a project designer/planner
must be utilized to design abatement projects for units numbering 10 or more. The Agency has also considered this size
distinction in development of its Interim Final Regulations to amend the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act's
(AHERA) Asbestos Model Accreditation Plan to include public buildings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A pre-abatement plan is to be completed by the supervisor or project designer/planner as appropriate for the size
of the work project. This plan would follow the standards for worker, environmental and occupant protection as outlined
in this proposed rule. Because there may be a potential conflict of interest between those who conduct the inspection/risk
assessment and those who actually do the abatement, it is recommended that the plan contain a statement that the persons
or firm engaged in the inspection and/or risk assessment of a unit should not perform lead abatement activities in
that same unit. This type of conflict may arise if inspector/risk assessors are in a position to receive a financial
benefit by recommending that an abatement be conducted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To protect the health of building occupants, the rule as proposed would require that an occupancy protection plan
be developed by the supervisor or planner/project designer. This plan should address what measures would be taken
during the abatement to protect the building occupants, and what method of verification would be utilized to document
this protection. In development of the plan, certain factors should be taken into consideration, for example, the
length of abatement, remaining access to facilities and exits, and total area involved. In plans which require the
relocation of occupants, samples would be collected, analyzed, and clearance levels met according to proposed &sect;745.228(c)(9)
before re-occupancy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An abatement project typically involves one or more of the following techniques: Building component replacement,
the use of physical enclosure systems, or on-site or off-site paint removal from building components. It is the responsibility
of the abatement supervisor, with possible input from the risk assessor, to determine the most appropriate course
of action to eliminate identified lead hazards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 745.228(c)(6) of the proposed rule would require that the supervisor of an abatement job submit a pre-abatement
notification to EPA or the approving authority, for their information, prior to the commencement of the abatement.
In the case of an authorized State program, States may develop their own notification procedures as part of the State
program. This requirement has been included to assist with targeting enforcement efforts. The Agency wants to protect
against lead abatement related risks to workers, the environment, and any individuals who may remain in a unit during
abatement. The Agency believes that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) May 4, 1994 Interim
Final Rule, Lead Exposure in Construction, will adequately protect all workers engaged in lead-based paint abatement.
The Agency is currently working closely with OSHA to ensure that workers employed by State and local governments,
and therefore not covered by the OSHA regulation, will be covered under this proposed regulation in States without
OSHA-approved State plans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its interim rule, OSHA reduced the permissible exposure limit (PEL) from 200

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The OSHA interim rule also includes a list of three categories of tasks that are commonly known to produce exposures
above the PEL. The performance of the tasks within these categories automatically triggers basic protective provisions
that mandate the use of particular types of respiratory protection unless air monitoring is conducted to determine
that protection is not required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although not currently part of this proposed regulation, the Agency is considering prohibiting certain work practices,
due to the potential risk of lead contamination posed by these practices to workers and/or the environment. The following
work practices are being considered for prohibition during the abatement of lead-based paint in target housing:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. Open flame burning of painted surfaces. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. Dry scraping or sanding of painted surfaces. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iii. The use of heat guns on painted surfaces for abatement without proper protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These practices have been singled out because of the potential risk of exposure to lead-contaminated dust and toxic
fumes. The Agency is seeking comments and/or data related to exposure to lead-contaminated dust and fumes from these
or other abatement work practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following the completion of an abatement, post-abatement soil and dust clearance testing would have to be conducted
by a certified inspector technician or an inspector/risk assessor according to the procedures in proposed &sect;745.228(c)(9)
for dust sampling, and proposed &sect;745.086(c)(10) for soil sampling. Exterior dust and soil clearance levels
would also have to be evaluated after the lead-based paint abatement of exterior walls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The inspector/risk assessor would evaluate the results of the clearance testing to determine if the clearance levels
have been met. It is also recommended that there be no economic relationship between the inspector technician or inspector/risk
assessor and persons engaged in abatement due to conflict-of-interest concerns. The Agency is interested in comments
on the burden of requiring that the clearance determination being made by the inspector/risk assessor, as opposed
to the abatement supervisor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The inspector/risk assessor should compare the residual lead dust level (as determined by the laboratory analysis)
from each dust sample with the clearance levels for lead in dust on floors, window sills, window wells, and exterior
surfaces, as established in the HUD Guidelines for the Evaluation and Controls of Lead-Based Paint Hazards in Housing.
The Agency may in the future establish clearance levels pursuant to section 403 of TSCA, and if so, then these levels
will be applicable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a unit fails clearance testing, the unit will be recleaned followed by repeating clearance procedures. In addition,
the hazard control strategy may need to be reexamined and appropriately adjusted or improved if clearance levels
continually fail to meet prescribed levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential for soil contamination, following exterior lead-based paint abatement activities, is also a concern
of the Agency. The proposed approach to dealing with this problem is the comparison of pre- and post-abatement soil
lead levels to determine what soil lead level should be achieved for clearance following an abatement. The testing
protocol for soil in proposed &sect;745.228(c)(10) includes the sampling of soil from the dripline and foundation
areas as well as any children's play areas. To determine if post-abatement soil lead levels (using the above-mentioned
sampling methods) have increased at a statically significant level, the Agency is proposing that a statistical analysis,
such as a paired student T-test be used. If the soil lead levels increase at the 95 percent confidence limit, then the
soil must be remediated back to the pre-abatement lead level, or the soil must be abated following the standards in
proposed &sect;745.228(j). If there is no significant increase at the 95 percent confidence limit, then no remediation
or abatement is necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reports and recordkeeping play an essential role in tracking and monitoring the effectiveness and safety of lead-based
paint hazard abatement in target housing. The certified supervisor is responsible for completing the abatement
report as described in proposed &sect;745.228(c)(12). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Records would be maintained by the building owner and the persons conducting the abatement activity for at least 3
years. These records will be subject to the disclosure and recordkeeping requirements promulgated under section
1018 of Title X. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed soil abatement procedures in &sect;745.228(j) of the regulatory text would require the removal of soil
to a depth determined by the inspector/risk assessor and replacement of contaminated soil with non-contaminated
soil. If contaminated soil is to be replaced with non-contaminated soil, the inspector/risk assessor will determine
the source of soil that is to be used as a replacement. Since most soil has naturally occurring background levels of
lead, replacement soil should contain levels that are not hazardous to human health or the environment. The Agency
feels that the inspector/risk assessor has the experience necessary to chose an appropriate source of replacement
soil. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As an alternative to removal and possible replacement, the contaminated soil shall be permanently covered. Examples
of a permanent covering include pavement or concrete. Grass or other landscaping material are not considered permanent
covering. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A written abatement report would also be prepared by the supervisor or planner/project designer, (depending on the
size of the project) that provides a written description of the abatement and presents the results of the clearance
testing. The abatement report would also be subject to the disclosure and recordkeeping requirements of the regulation
developed under section 1018 of Title X.

F. Management of Waste From Target Housing Lead Abatement Activity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) establishes a comprehensive Federal program to regulate the handling
of solid wastes under 42 U.S.C. sections 6901&hyph;6992k. RCRA Subtitle C creates a cradle-to-grave regulatory
structure for the treatment, storage, and disposal of hazardous waste (42 U.S.C. sections 6921&hyph;6939b). RCRA
Subtitle D governs the disposal of nonhazardous solid waste (42 U.S.C. sections 6941&hyph;6969a). The RCRA regulatory
structure requires generators to determine whether their solid wastes are hazardous wastes regulated under RCRA
Subtitle C. EPA has promulgated a rule under RCRA which sets forth criteria for determining whether certain solid
wastes or debris are hazardous wastes. One of the characteristics of hazardous wastes is toxicity. To determine if
a solid waste is a toxicity characteristic hazardous waste, it should be tested for its toxicity characteristic pursuant
to 40 CFR 261.24. The Toxicity Characteristic (TC) regulatory limit for lead is 5 parts per million in the leachate
from the test protocol. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When abating lead paint, different types of solid waste are generated which may be subject to RCRA hazardous waste
regulations. EPA is concerned that the application of RCRA hazardous waste regulations to these wastes may unnecessarily
hamper lead abatement. The Agency wishes to minimize potential regulatory impediments thus facilitating lead paint
abatement in residences where children and other individuals may be at risk. EPA is currently evaluating options
for modifying RCRA regulations so that lead abatement proceeds expeditiously while ensuring safe and effective
management and disposal of abatement wastes. Under a separate rulemaking, EPA plans to issue a proposal addressing
lead abatement wastes.

G. Identification of Lead-Based Paint in Public Buildings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 745.228 (a)(1) through (a)(7)(i) of the regulatory text proposes standards that would be used for the identification
of lead-based paint in public buildings. Because children make up a significant number of the occupants in target
housing and public buildings, which include day-care centers, schools, museums, and churches, these standards
are the same as those proposed for target housing. A second reason for utilizing the same standards is the similarity
of building and structural components in target housing and public buildings. Although many public buildings contain
structural steel components, such as steel frames, these are covered for fire protection and cosmetic reasons with
materials that are similar to those used in target housing. Given the similarity of materials presenting exposure
risks to occupants, EPA believes that persons seeking to identify lead-based paint in public buildings can use the
same inspection methods (such as XRF analysis) as those used in target housing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under proposed &sect;745.228 (d)(2), all information collected from the identification of lead-based paint would
have to be maintained by the owner of the public building tested for a period of not less than 3 years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
H. Risk Assessment for Public Buildings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the structural similarities between public buildings and target housing, a high probability exists
in certain public buildings (e.g., day care centers and schools), as in target housing, that children will be present
and potentially exposed to lead-based paint hazards. Although, TSCA Title IV does not expressly require EPA to establish
a risk assessment standard for public buildings, the Agency has decided for public health reasons to propose such
a standard in this regulation. The Agency believes that regulating the conduct of a risk assessment in public buildings
is implied in the definition of ``deleading'' in section 402(b), which includes planning of lead elimination activities.
The Agency believes that without a proper risk assessment, there is no assurance that effective abatements can be
conducted in public buildings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The objective of a risk assessment is to determine the existence, nature, severity, and location of lead-based paint
hazards and identify appropriate hazard reduction steps. Given the structural similarities between target housing
and public buildings, this proposed regulation provides similar protocols to those required for conducting risk
assessments in target housing. The Agency is specifically requesting comment on this proposed approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under proposed &sect;745.228(e)(2), records would have to be maintained by the building owner and persons conducting
the abatement and all information collected must be maintained by the owner of the building tested for a period of not
less than 3 years.

I. Abatement in Public Buildings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed standards in &sect;745.228(c)(1) through (c)(9)(iv)(D) and (c)(11) through (c)(16) of the regulatory
text would also be applicable to abatement in public buildings as defined by this proposed rule. Section 402(b) of
TSCA identifies abatement-like activities associated with public buildings using the term ``deleading.'' Because
both terms are defined in Title IV in terms of the ``elimination'' of lead-based paint hazards, for purposes of this
proposed regulation, the Agency is treating the two terms, ``abatement'' and ``deleading,'' as if they were synonymous.
The Agency believes that abatement activities in public buildings and methods of measuring protection for their
workers, occupants, and the environment should be similar to those for target housing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under proposed &sect;745.228(f)(2), records would have to be maintained by the building owner and persons conducting
the abatement and all information collected must be maintained by the owner of the building tested for a period of not
less than 3 years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management of waste from lead-based paint abatement activities in public buildings, including schools and day-care
centers, is another area of concern to EPA. Wastes generated from lead-based paint activities (e.g., abatement and
deleading) are currently, depending upon the results of the TC analysis, covered by RCRA hazardous waste regulations.
As discussed in unit VIII.F. of this preamble, EPA is evaluating options for modifying existing RCRA regulations
to eliminate potential impediments to lead abatement, while ensuring safe and effective management and disposal
of such wastes.

J. Demolition in Public and Commercial Buildings and Superstructures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under &sect;745.228(g)(1), the certified supervisor would be required to collect any historical information on
the uses of lead-based paint in a building or superstructure that would be demolished. The proposed standards for
demolition are applicable only when the deleading of components prior to destruction of the facility occurs. If deleading
is conducted as a part of the demolition activity, the standards under &sect;745.228(i)(1) through (7) are applicable.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the conduct of lead-based paint activities would require a hazardous waste determination pursuant
to 40 CFR 262.11 prior to demolition. All demolition waste would be treated in accordance with RCRA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
K. Identification of Lead-Based Paint in Commercial Buildings and Superstructures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed standards in &sect;745.228(h)(1) through (h)(4) of the regulatory text describe the standards for
the identification of lead-based paint on steel superstructures and commercial buildings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on information received from professional organizations that are involved in steel structure deleading activities,
EPA believes: (1) That maintenance and painting records are available more often in a commercial setting than in target
housing or public buildings; (2) that processes for lead identification in commercial buildings would be more similar
to those used in superstructures than to those used in target housing because unenclosed metal components are a primary
architectural feature of commercial buildings such as warehouses; and (3) the purpose of identifying lead is inherently
different in commercial and superstructure settings from that in target housing settings. Unlike target housing,
the purpose of identifying lead hazards in commercial and superstructure settings is not to remove the lead-based
paint because it may pose a hazard to occupants. Instead, the purpose is to identify a potential hazard to workers doing
building or structural maintenance, and the environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paint (lead paint included) removed from components in commercial buildings and superstructures, is generally
removed as part of routine maintenance on those components. The supervisor should determine if lead-based paint
exists prior to starting work to minimize exposures to workers. Given the toxicity of lead, sampling to determine
the presence of lead-based paint is commonly practiced prior to maintenance work on superstructures and in commercial
settings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These identification practices include obtaining relevant, available historical information on the use of lead-based
paint for a structure or building. Previous project specifications or inspection reports may provide the necessary
information. If the use of lead-based paint cannot be conclusively ruled-out, limited sampling would be conducted
by a certified supervisor according to proposed &sect;745.228(h)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) ban on the use of lead-based paint on bridges in 1980, many States
have required the use of lead substitutes for primary coatings on bridges. Given this requirement, the frequency
with which bridges are repainted raises some fundamental questions about recordkeeping requirements. The Agency
is proposing that all information collected from the identification of lead-based paint on steel structures such
as bridges, would be maintained by the owner of the structure tested until such a time that the structure, or portion
of the structure is to be repainted. This proposed requirement is based on the variable frequency with which steel
structures are generally repainted and maintained. The Agency is requesting comment on this requirement to maintain
records.

L. Deleading of Lead-Based Paint in Commercial Buildings and Superstructures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed standards for deleading of commercial buildings and superstructures are found in &sect;745.228(i)(1)
through (i)(8) of the regulatory text. Given the similarities between superstructures and commercial buildings
described earlier, the Agency believes that deleading activities and methods of ensuring the protection of workers,
occupants and/or individuals within the vicinity, and the environment should also be similar to those used for superstructures.
A deleading plan would have to be completed by a certified supervisor prior to initiating deleading activities. This
plan would address worker protection, as well as environmental protection issues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is concerned about the risk to workers and the environment due to deleading activities in commercial buildings
and steel structures. As with all other abatement and deleading activities, the Agency is relying on the May 4, 1994
Interim Final OSHA rule, Lead Exposure in Construction. For a more complete discussion of these standards see the
OSHA requirements at 29 CFR part 1926. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is also considering prohibiting open flame burning of painted surfaces; the dry scraping or sanding of
painted surfaces; and the use of heat guns on painted surfaces for deleading on superstructures and commercial buildings
because of the potential risk of lead contamination to workers and/or the environment posed by these practices. The
Agency is interested in comments on whether it should prohibit these practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Waste generated when abating commercial buildings and superstructures may be subject to RCRA Subtitle C hazardous
waste regulations and should be handled accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recordkeeping requirements for deleading in commercial buildings or on superstructures with lead-based paint
are proposed in &sect;745.228(i)(6). The report described in &sect;745.228(i)(6) shall be maintained by the owner
or oversight agency until such a time that the structure, or portion of the structure is to be repainted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The removal of lead-based paint in commercial buildings and superstructures, could potentially affect water quality
through two routes. The first route is by non-point source contamination, e.g., lead-contaminated dust that is deposited
as a result of deleading activities is transported overland to waterbodies through stormwater runoff. The second
route is by point source discharge, e.g., a direct deposition of lead-based paint or dust to a waterbody, or from channelized
stormwater runoff. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Non-point source contamination may be controlled through compliance with RCRA (40 CFR 3004(d) and 268.35(a)), which
includes settled dust and debris from deleading activities. RCRA 40 CFR 268.35(a) prohibits the land disposal of
waste which exceed the toxic characteristic regulatory limit for lead. In addition, guidance issued by EPA pursuant
to the Coastal Zone Act Re-authorization Amendments (CZARA) section 6217(g) identifies a management measure for
the operation and maintenance of roads, highways, and bridges in coastal States to incorporate requirements for
pollution prevention procedures to reduce pollutant loadings to surface waters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Removal of lead-containing materials from steel bridges has resulted in inadvertent discharges of lead compounds
that exceeded State water quality criteria, and showed the potential for long-term environmental impacts based
on sediment sampling (``Long Term Environmental Evaluation of Paint Residue and Blast Cleaning Abrasives from the
Middle River Bridge Repainting Project,'' California State Department of Transportation, 1982). Existing federal
regulations on steel structural projects are being applied on a site-specific basis. However, differences between
States' water quality standards and subsequent implementation of those standards indicates a need for a consistent
water quality policy with respect to discharges of lead into waterways during removal of lead-containing materials
from steel structures. This is of particular importance due to the number of contractors who work in multiple State
jurisdictions, as well as the occurrence of bridge structures which span interstate waters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Clean Water Act's (CWA) National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program and interpretive
case law, paint removal devices used on bridges/superstructures, such as wet and dry abrasive blasters, high pressure
waterjet blasters, and sponge-jet blasters, may constitute point sources. Therefore, the CWA mandates that NPDES
permit applications must be submitted to either EPA or States approved to administer the NPDES program prior to any
discharge [40 CFR 122.21(c)]. Of course, if there is no discharge or potential discharge to waters of the U.S., no NPDES
permit is required. Individual sources are required to obtain permits, but EPA believes that general permits may
be an appropriate mechanism to cover bridge stripping and painting discharges. According to 40 CFR 122.28 (a)(2)(ii),
the sources covered in a general permit must involve the same types of operations, discharge the same types of wastes,
require the same operating conditions, require similar monitoring, and be more appropriately controlled under
a general permit than under individual permits. General permits reduce the administrative burden on both the permitting
agency and the permittee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA requests comment on the best technologies available to avoid or eliminate releases of lead to the air, land, or
water, and studies showing the amounts of releases that occur with those technologies. EPA can then suggest operating
conditions or discharge limits which may be appropriate for general permits.

M. Applicability of RCRA to Lead-Based Paint Wastes from Public and Commercial Buildings and Superstructures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Waste generated by the lead-based paint abatement contractors when removing lead paint from public and commercial
buildings and superstructures may be subject to RCRA Subtitle C hazardous waste regulations. The Toxicity Characteristic
(TC) regulatory limit for lead is 5 parts per million in a leachate derived by utilizing the Toxic Characteristic Leaching
Protocol (TCLP). The lead-based paint waste generator must determine if the waste generated is hazardous by either
testing a representative sample of the waste in accordance with 40 CFR part 261 subpart C, or an equivalent method approved
pursuant to 40 CFR 260.21, or by applying knowledge of the hazard characteristic of the waste in light of the materials
or process used. If the representative test sample exceeds the TC regulatory limit, the waste must be managed as a RCRA
hazardous waste, and the contractor would be a hazardous waste generator and must, therefore, comply with 40 CFR part
262 requirements. In addition, the training requirements for generators of lead-based paint waste as discussed
in this preamble are applicable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has different requirements for generators of different quantities of hazardous waste. For example, the regulations
conditionally exempt small quantity generators of 100 kg or less hazardous waste per calendar month, but it is very
unlikely that waste generated during the deleading or abatement work on larger buildings and superstructures would
generate less than 100 kg. Therefore, many of these contractors would be classified as ordinary generators and therefore
would be subject to 40 CFR parts 262 through 266, 268, and 270 requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the lead-based paint waste is determined to be a hazardous waste and is captured, it could be managed on-site, most
likely through storage or treatment. This can be technically more challenging and may require a hazardous waste treatment
permit pursuant to 40 CFR part 270. One notable exception is the generator. Under this exception, a generator may treat
lead-contaminated waste or lead-contaminated debris in containers or tanks in compliance with part 265, subparts
I and J, and within the accumulation time limit of 90 days as specified in 40 CFR 262.34 (see 51 FR 10168, March 24, 1986).
On August 18, 1992, EPA promulgated the Land Disposal Restrictions (LDR) for hazardous debris (57 FR 37194). In that
rulemaking, hazardous debris is defined as solid waste with particle size 60 mm or larger. Therefore, paint chips,
paint dust, and sludge's would not be considered hazardous debris. As part of that rulemaking, the Agency promulgated
standards for a new hazardous waste management unit known as a containment building (40 CFR parts 264 and 265, Subpart
DD), which may also be used to treat waste at the generator facility without a permit, provided the waste is not held
longer than 90 days. If hazardous debris is captured, hazardous debris treatment technologies that may be used include
abrasive blasting, grinding or planing, vibratory finishing, high pressure steam, or water spraying to meet the
performance standard referred to as the ``clean debris surface.'' Other treatment technologies include macroencapsulation
or sealing (surfacial treatment) or microencapsulation (solidifying with portland cement or lime). Microencapsulation
could be done in tanks or containers. Hazardous debris is subject to compliance under the LDR treatment standards.
Many States are currently authorized to implement LDR requirements pertaining to lead-based paint activities under
the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984.

N. Applicability of RCRA to Lead-Contaminated Soil Near Public and Commercial Buildings and Superstructures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is possible that, when performing lead-based paint activities (e.g., HEPA vacuum removal or sand blasting of lead
paint) on public and commercial buildings, lead paint chips or lead dust hazardous under the TCLP would be released
and would either fall on the soil underneath or blown down wind before reaching the ground. This constitutes ``illegal
disposal'' of characteristic hazardous waste and is prohibited under RCRA sections 3004 and 3008. Therefore, individuals
engaged in lead-based paint activities must take appropriate precautions to contain lead dust releases during sand
blasting or when conducting activities that could potentially release significant quantities of paint dust leading
to its deposition on the soil near public and commercial buildings or superstructures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the lead-based paint that is being removed exhibits the characteristic of toxicity for lead when conducting the
abatement or deleading, it would be necessary to take steps to prevent deposition on land by capturing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lead-contaminated dust and debris. If the abatement of deleading work resulting in land contamination is done without
a RCRA TSD permit, then this deposition would be inferred as ``illegal disposal.'' When conducting lead-based paint
activities, therefore, it would be necessary to take steps to minimize ``illegal disposal'' by capturing lead paint
dust. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are two issues of concern for the Agency with regard to the enforcement of RCRA provisions for illegal disposal.
These issues involve the possible impacts on worker protection and how compliance can be achieved given existing
abatement and deleading technologies. Comments are requested on achievable methods to protect both the environment
and workers in light of existing abatement and deleading technology.

VIII. State Programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This unit is comprised of two parts: (1) Procedures for States and Indian Tribes to follow in order to obtain authorization
from EPA to administer and enforce a lead-based paint activities program, and (2) a model program that will serve as
an archetype for these State and Tribal programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 404(a) of Title IV of TSCA provides that any State which seeks to administer and enforce the standards, regulations,
or other requirements established under section 402 or 406 may submit an application to the Administrator for approval
of such program. Section 404(b) states that the Administrator may approve such an application only after finding
that the State program is at least as protective of human health and the environment as the Federal program established
according to the mandate of section 402 or 406 of TSCA and that it provides adequate enforcement. The procedures for
submitting a State application are found in proposed &sect;745.325 of the regulatory text and are discussed in more
detail below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 404(d), directs the Agency to promulgate a model State program which may be adopted by any State which seeks
to administer and enforce such a program. Given that section 404(a) requires that an authorized State program be at
least as protective as the Federal program, the Agency expects that a State program seeking authorization, would
resemble, in significant respects, the Federal program, and further, that the regulations found at proposed &sect;&sect;745.225
through 745.237 would serve as an appropriate model for such a State program. Therefore, the Agency is at this time
proposing these regulations as the model program for the regulations developed under section 402(a) of TSCA. The
regulations for section 406 of TSCA can be found at 40 CFR 745 subpart E. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;745.225 of the regulatory text contains procedures for the accreditation of training programs for
lead-based paint activities. Proposed &sect;745.226 would establish procedures for the certification of individuals
engaged in lead-based paint activities, and proposed &sect;745.228 would establish standards for conducting these
activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Submission of State Application 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Any State which seeks to administer and enforce the requirements of this proposed regulation or the regulation developed
under section 406 of TSCA would have to submit an application to the Administrator according to the procedures contained
in proposed &sect;745.325. No other political subdivision (e.g. cities, towns, counties, etc.) other than States,
as defined by section 3 of TSCA, and Indian Tribes, are eligible for authorization under this program. Following notice
and an opportunity for a public hearing, EPA would approve a State application within 180 days, if EPA finds that the
State program is at least as protective of human health and the environment as the Federal program, and it provides
adequate enforcement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before developing an application for authorization, a State would publicly disseminate a notice of intent to seek
such authorization and provide an opportunity for public hearing. A State application would contain a copy of the
regulations and/or legislation establishing the State program, the name of the State agency that will administer
and enforce the program, as well as information on the resources that the State intends to devote to the program, and
an assurance that the State has or will have the legal authority necessary to carry out the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to section 404(a) of TSCA, at the time of submitting such an application, the State may also certify to the
Administrator that the State program meets the requirements of section 404(b)(1) and 404(b)(2) of TSCA. If this certification,
or certificate of compliance, is contained in a State's application, the State program shall be deemed to be authorized
by EPA, until such time as the Administrator withdraws the authorization. This certification would take the form
of a letter from the Governor or Attorney General to the Administrator, and would include detailed written justification
for concluding that the State's program is at least as protective as the Federal program. If the application does not
contain such certification, the State program would be considered authorized only after the Administrator approves
the State application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA invites States to submit their authorization applications at any time after the effective date of the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
EPA approval
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Within 180 days following submission of the application, the Administrator would approve or disapprove the application.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of a State that provides a certificate of compliance, the program would be immediately deemed approved.
In the case of a State application which does not contain a certification of compliance, the Administrator would approve
a State program only if, after notice and after opportunity for public hearing, the Administrator finds that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. The State program is at least as protective of human health and the environment as the Federal program contained
in &sect;&sect;745.225 through 745.237 of the proposed regulatory text, or in subpart E ``Residential Property
Renovation,'' has been proposed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 separately from this regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. The State program provides adequate enforcement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency would notify the State in writing of the Administrator's decision. Upon authorization of a State program
it would be unlawful, for any person to violate or fail or refuse to comply with any requirements of such program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The decision criteria above give the Agency reasonably broad latitude in approving or disapproving State programs.
Specifically, EPA interprets the standard ``. . .at least as protective as. . .'' to mean that a State program need not
be identical to, or administered and enforced in a manner identical to, the Federal program. The Agency expects to
receive applications for State programs that will differ in some respects from the Federal program. The Agency will
make every attempt to accommodate these differences while following the statutory requirement of ensuring that
every State program be at least as protective as the Federal program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon notification of authorization, the designated State agency within that State would be considered the approving
authority for purposes of training program accreditation, certification of individuals, and enforcement of this
program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a State does not have a State program authorized under this section and in effect by the date which is 2 years after
promulgation of this proposed regulation, the Administrator would, by such date, establish the Federal program
under subpart Q, or subpart E, as appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has received a number of comments from State representatives presenting concerns related to their potential
inability to introduce legislation and promulgate regulations for an entire training, certification, and accreditation
program that would cover target housing, public and commercial buildings, and superstructures within the TSCA Title
IV timelines. The Agency understands these concerns and is committed to devising a program that would promote State
adoption of the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a State does not have an approved program within 2 years, the Agency would be required to establish a Federal program
in that State. However, it was the intent of Congress, and is the policy of the Agency to encourage States to administer
and enforce this program at the State level. The Agency is seeking comment on how to best achieve this goal within the
2&hyph;year time frame mandated by TSCA while ensuring that all lead-based paint activities will be adequately regulated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the Agency has received comment that there may be a need for Federal enforcement programs to be in place
even before State programs are enacted and authorized. It has been noted to the Agency that there may be the potential
for egregious or widespread releases of lead-containing materials by ``unregulated'' abatement actions during
the interim before State programs become effective. The Agency is confident that such situations can be effectively
addressed through the application of a combination of existing Federal, State and local statutes and regulations.
However, the Agency seeks comment on whether some or all of the requirements of the Federal program should be made immediately
effective following promulgation of the final rule, pending authorization of State programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Withdrawal of authorization
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. As required by section 404(c) of TSCA, if a State is not administering and enforcing its authorized program in compliance
with the standards, regulations, and other requirements of Title IV of TSCA, including section 404(b)(1) and (b)(2),
the Agency would so notify the State and, if corrective action is not completed within a reasonable time, not to exceed
180 days, the Administrator would withdraw authorization of such program and establish a Federal program pursuant
to Title IV of TSCA. Procedures for withdrawal of authorization can be found at proposed &sect;745.325(h) of the regulatory
text. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Model State Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 404(d) of TSCA, directs the Agency to promulgate a model State program which may be adopted by any State which
seeks to administer and enforce a lead-based paint activities program. Given that section 404(a) requires that an
authorized State program be at least as protective as the Federal program, the Agency expects that a State program
seeking authorization, would resemble, in significant respects, the Federal program. Therefore, the entire Federal
program for lead-based paint activities found at proposed &sect;&sect;745.225 through 745.237 is being proposed
as the Model State Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 745.225 of the proposed regulatory text contains procedures and minimum requirements for the accreditation
of lead-based paint activities training programs for workers, supervisors, inspectors and planners, and other
individuals involved in lead-based paint activities. These requirements include: (1) Minimum requirements for
the accreditation of training providers, (2) minimum training curriculum requirements, (3) minimum training hour
requirements, (4) minimum hands-on training requirements, (5) minimum trainee competency and proficiency requirements,
and (6) minimum requirements for training program quality control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;745.226 contains procedures and requirements for the certification of individuals engaged in the
following activities: target housing and public building inspector technicians, inspector/risk assessors, supervisors,
planner/project designers, and workers; and commercial building and superstructure supervisors and workers.
These procedures include specific training and, when appropriate, experience/education prerequisites that individuals
seeking certification would have. Additionally, this section specifies requirements for the certification of
firms involved in inspection and abatement activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;745.228 contains standards for conducting these activities. The standards for lead-based paint
activities are divided into three separate categories: target housing, public buildings, and commercial buildings
and steel structures. In target housing, the standards cover inspection, risk assessment, and lead abatement. The
second set of standards, for public buildings, cover the inspection, risk assessment, abatement, and demolition.
The final set of standards are for industrial settings. These include activities such as identification, deleading,
and demolition for commercial buildings and superstructures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency hopes that this model will be especially useful to the many States that do not currently have an existing
lead-based paint activities program. The Agency believes that adoption of this program would effectively reduce
the risks of lead-based paint activities. However, the State program need not duplicate the Federal program in order
to receive authorization from EPA. A State may choose to develop its own program, and it would be authorized if it is
as protective as the Federal program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Major program elements
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 When developing a lead-based paint activities program, a State may choose to use the Federal program as a specific
model or it may develop its own program. For States that choose not to use the Federal program as a specific model, the
Agency has identified several major program elements below that a State program must have if it seeks to receive authorization
from the Agency to administer and enforce the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To administer and enforce such a program successfully, a State must develop the appropriate infrastructure. A State
program must establish a State agency or agencies, or designate an existing State agency or agencies to implement,
administer, and enforce the State program. Given the scope of the program, it is likely that more than one State agency
would be involved in the implementation and enforcement of this program. States are required to identify one State
agency or organization within a State (the primary agency) that would serve to coordinate the activities of these
agencies. States are also encouraged to, whenever possible, utilize existing State and local certification and
accreditation programs and procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State program would require the certification of individuals and firms engaged in lead-based paint activities.
The program would establish training requirements for individuals engaged in lead-based paint activities. The
training component of a State's program would require that training be provided by an accredited training program.
Proposed &sect;745.226 details the certification program developed by the Agency which may be adopted by a State,
or it may be used as a model for States developing their own certification program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State program would contain regulations or procedures for the accreditation of training programs. The regulations
or procedures would contain the following: (1) Minimum requirements for the accreditation of training programs;
(2) minimum training curriculum requirements; (3) minimum training hour requirements; (4) minimum hands-on training
requirements; (5) minimum trainee competency and proficiency requirements; and (6) minimum requirements for training
program quality control. The State accreditation program would contain the minimum requirements of the accreditation
program found at proposed &sect;745.225 of the regulatory text. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State agency would establish standards for performing lead-based paint activities, taking into account reliability,
effectiveness, and safety. The Federal program at proposed &sect;745.228 would establish specific standards for
performing these activities which a State program may choose to adopt. A State may also develop its own standards for
some or all of these activities, as long as they are judged by EPA to be at least as protective as the Federal standards.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For instance, at proposed &sect;745.228(b), the Agency has developed procedures for conducting a risk assessment
in target housing. The goal of a risk assessment is to determine and report the existence, nature, severity, and location
of lead-based paint hazards in residential dwellings. Proposed &sect;745.228(b) specifically describes a method
of conducting such an assessment, and a State may choose to adopt this standard. A State may also develop its own procedures
that achieve the same goal. This is the case for all of the standards in this regulation. In general, the Agency has developed
specific standards that States may choose to adopt, or they may utilize their own standards, as long as they are at least
as protective as the EPA standards. The State agency or agencies would provide for the enforcement of the State certification
and accreditation program, and establish suitable sanctions for those who fail to comply with the program requirements.
This element of a State's program is essential because one of the Agency's two decision criteria for approval of State
programs is the adequacy of the State's enforcement program. Before promulgation of the final regulation, the Agency
anticipates developing a compliance and inspection strategy that would facilitate State implementation and provide
guidance in determining that the State programs provide adequate enforcement. The State agency or agencies must
have the authority to charge certification and accreditation fees. Section 402(a)(3) of TSCA states that:

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administrator (or the State in the case of an authorized State program) shall impose a fee on: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) persons operating training programs accredited under this title; and (2) lead-based paint activities contractors
certified in accordance with [section 402(a)] paragraph (1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fees shall be established at such a level as is necessary to cover the costs of administering and enforcing the standards
and regulations under this section [section 402] which are applicable to such programs and contractors. The fee shall
not be imposed on any State, local government, or nonprofit training program. The Administrator (or the State in the
case of an authorized State program) may waive the fee for lead-based paint activities contractors under subparagraph
A) for the purposes of training their own employees.

Reciprocity.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA strongly encourages each State to establish reciprocal arrangements with other States with authorized State
programs. Such arrangements might address cooperation in certification determinations, the review and accreditation
of training programs, candidate testing and examination administration, curriculum development, policy formulation,
compliance monitoring, or the exchange of information and data. The benefits to be derived from these arrangements
include a potential cost-savings from the reduction of duplicative activity and attainment of a more professional
workforce as States are able to refine and improve the effectiveness of their programs based upon the experience and
methods of other States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are several elements of the EPA training and accreditation program at proposed &sect;&sect;745.225 through
745.226 that are intended to facilitate interstate reciprocity. The first, and most critical, is the certification
examination. The examination would serve to ensure that each individual who is certified under this program has a
minimum level of knowledge in his or her particular discipline. At the same time, the certification examination development
procedures would allow a State the flexibility to either adopt a ``standardized'' examination, or develop its own
examination according to ``standardized'' guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As an additional element to facilitate interstate reciprocity, the Agency has proposed relatively specific minimum
curriculum requirements. A third element is the inclusion of a refresher training course in the Federal program.
Successful completion of a State accredited refresher course may serve as an ideal requirement for individuals seeking
a reciprocal certification in another State.

D. Indian Lands

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal also addresses implementation of sections 402 and/or 406 of TSCA on Indian lands. For the most part,
implementation of section 402 and 404 would be primarily a State responsibility. EPA would enforce a Federal program
only if it does not approve a State program or if it finds that a State program is inadequate. While Congress did not specifically
address implementation of Title IV on Indian lands, EPA has determined that proper lead abatement is as important
for Indian Tribes as for anyone else. Accordingly, EPA has decided to treat Indian Tribes as if they were States for
the purpose of administering and enforcing lead programs under sections 402 and 404.

Indian Governing Body to implement Title IV, as it has done under most other major environmental statutes amended
since 1986 (Safe Drinking Water Act, CERCLA, Clean Water Act, Clear Air Act). The term Indian Governing Body is used
throughout this proposal to mean the governing body of the Tribe, band or group of Indians subject to the jurisdiction
of the U.S. and recognized by the U.S. as possessing powers of self government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There exist three principal options for effectively ensuring comprehensive implementation of Title IV on Indian
Reservations: (1) Allow Tribes to apply for approval of section 402 or 406 programs in the same manner as States under
this proposal; (2) make determinations on a case-by-case basis whether the State has adequate authority to ensure
compliance with section 402 or 406 on Indian Reservations; and (3) make a blanket determination that States lack the
authority to implement their programs on Indian Reservations and that EPA would enforce sections 402 or 406 directly
on Indian Reservations in light of this determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that the preferred approach would be to use a combination of options 1 and 2. Under this approach a State
may propose, as part of its program approval application, to ensure section 402 or 406 compliance on Indian Reservations.
The State would have to demonstrate adequate authority to ensure compliance with section 402 or 406 on the Indian Reservations.
The burden the State would meet to demonstrate its authority to regulate on Indian Reservations is a high one, however.
This type of demonstration of State authority over Indian Reservations is allowed, for instance, under regulations
for the Underground Injection Control (UIC) Program of the Safe Drinking Water Act as well as several other EPA programs.
40 CFR 125.24(b). See e.g., 45 FR 33378 (1980); 53 FR 43080 (1988). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the alternative, an Indian Governing Body could apply for authorization to run a section 402 or 406 program in the
same manner as a State pursuant to the procedures specified in this proposal. Where it does not do so, EPA would enforce
section 402 or 406 directly. Allowing for Tribal assumption of the section 402 or 406 program is consistent with EPA's
Indian Policy and existing practice for other environmental programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that adequate authority exists under TSCA to allow Tribes to apply for and receive authorization to run
Title IV programs. EPA's interpretation of TSCA is governed by the principles of

 test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While some tribes may entirely develop their own lead programs, other tribes may look to existing programs as a starting
point. Today's action does not require tribes to develop lead programs wholly from scratch. For example, a tribe could
negotiate a cooperative agreement with an adjoining State to jointly plan and administer lead programs that are appropriately
tailored to individual reservation conditions and tribal policies. Such an agreement would be subject to the review
and approval of EPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another possible option includes incorporating standards from an adjacent State as the tribe's own, with appropriate
revisions that adapt the State standards to reservation conditions and tribal policies. Such adaptations would
build on State experience and expertise and might represent quicker and less costly ways to establish tribal programs
than developing tribal programs independently. This technique of utilizing small-scaled adaptations of State
programs would allow tribes to build experience and expertise that could later be used to revise existing programs,
if appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Smaller tribes may also wish to form consortiums or create inter-tribal agencies as ways to develop the necessary
expertise to administer lead programs in a cost-effective way. Aside from any formal arrangements between tribes
and States, EPA notes that the objective of this proposed rule is to provide for the safe, effective, and reliable abatement
of lead-based paint hazards. Therefore, EPA encourages all affected sovereigns to work cooperatively in informal
capacities to protect the public health and welfare from the serious health and welfare effects associated with lead-based
paint hazards. Consistent with EPA's interpretation of the application of Title IV to Indian lands, the proposed
regulations would permit the Agency to make grants to Indian Governing Bodies and States to implement authorized
Section 402 and 406 programs.

2 years after promulgation of the final rule. In such States: (1) Training providers shall not provide, or claim to
provide training for certification without accreditation from the Agency pursuant to &sect;745.225 after 2 years
and 180 days after promulgation of the final rule; (2) No person shall engage in lead-based paint activities without
certification from the Agency, pursuant to &sect;745.226 after 3 years after promulgation of the final rule; and
(3) All lead-based paint activities shall be performed pursuant to the standards contained in &sect;745.228 after
promulgation of the final rule. These dates should allow training providers sufficient time to receive accreditation,
and for individuals to then receive training from an accredited training program and obtain certification. The Agency
felt that because the standards in this regulation are being taught in the training courses, the standards should
only be enforced after individuals have received training and obtain certification. Upon promulgation, the Agency
will assess the number of programs that it must administer. If the demand for accreditation and certification is expected
to greatly exceed the Agency's capability to approve training providers and certify individuals, the enforcement
deadlines may be revised following appropriate public notice.

Introduction
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. EPA has prepared a Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) in conjunction with this proposed rule. Ideally, when conducting
an RIA, a benefit-cost analysis which measures all marginal benefits and costs of the regulation should be performed.
Although it was possible to estimate the incremental costs, it was not possible to estimate incremental benefits.
Data limitations prevented a complete estimate of incremental benefits: The absence of the necessary dose-response
functions precluded the estimation of certain benefit categories (e.g., adult residential benefits and ecological
benefits), and knowledge of certain impacts (e.g., blood-lead levels with and without training) did not allow for
the estimation of the incremental benefits associated with this proposed rule. Therefore, an alternative approach
was employed whereby total measured benefits (i.e., benefits that have been identified and quantified) of the regulation
abatements were estimated to provide a perspective on the magnitude of the benefits against which to assess the possibility
of net benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The major findings contained in the RIA are presented in this brief summary, organized into five sections appearing
below: Cost of Regulatory Action; Benefits of Regulatory Action; Benefit-Cost Analysis; Uncertainties and Sensitivity
Analysis; and Impacts of the Proposed Rule. The complete document, ``Title X Sections 402 and 404 Regulatory Impact
Analysis,'' is available for inspection in the public docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title X, the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992, amended TSCA by adding Title IV. The purposes
of Title X included a desire to develop a national strategy to build the infrastructure necessary to eliminate lead-based
paint hazards in all housing as expeditiously as possible. Further, the Title X sought to encourage effective action
to prevent childhood lead poisoning by establishing a workable framework for lead-based paint hazard evaluation
and reduction and by ending the current confusion over reasonable standards of care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 402, Lead-Based Paint Activities Training and Certification, is only one of the initiatives under TSCA Title
IV aimed at fulfilling these goals. EPA is currently developing or has developed other portions of this overall lead
hazard reduction program. For example, a required information dissemination program to inform the public of lead-based
paint hazards in the home during renovation has been proposed under section 406. A regulation developed under section
1018 of Title X will soon be proposed and would require the distribution of this pamphlet at the time of real estate transfer,
would require the disclosure of any known lead-based paint hazards and would allow the purchaser of real estate a 10&hyph;day
period to conduct a risk assessment of the property. Benefits of these actions flow from providing information describing
lead hazards to home owners renovating homes, home buyers, and renters. Costs of these actions include preparing
and disseminating information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 403 of TSCA requires that the Agency shall ``. . .promulgate regulations which shall identify. . .lead-based
paint hazards, lead-contaminated dust, and lead-contaminated soil.'' The section 403 regulations will represent
EPA's determination of those conditions that cause exposure to lead in paint, residential soil and dust that would
result in adverse human health effects. Benefits and costs accrue from the abatement of the identified lead-based
hazards, and lead-contaminated dust and soil. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although each of these initiatives have positive and negative impacts associated with them, the following narrative
focuses on those impacts resulting from the implementation of sections 402 and 404.

Cost of regulatory action.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The total estimated incremental costs associated with this proposed rule are presented in Table 1. Cost estimates
are presented for two different abatement scenarios to present a range of possible costs: (1) Assuming abatement
occurs whenever X-ray Florescence (XRF) Analysis indicates a lead in paint level of greater than 1 (XRF 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1) and 500 parts per million (ppm) or more lead in soil (Scenario 1); and (2) assuming abatement occurs whenever X-ray
Florescence Analysis indicates a lead in paint level of greater than 6 (XRF 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
6) for paint and 2,000 ppm or more lead in soil (Scenario 2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lead-based paint activities take place in target housing, as well as in public buildings constructed before 1978,
commercial buildings, and steel structures. Maintenance of steel structures such as bridges, water tanks, and electrical
towers may also involve activities affected by the proposed rules. Estimates of the costs of performing lead-based
paint activities pursuant to the proposed standards were based on a number of factors, including the number of lead-related
inspections, risk assessments, and abatement activities and the unit costs associated with such activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The incremental costs estimated to be incurred in association with the proposed rule have been grouped into three
categories: (a) Costs resulting from the imposition of the standards for conducting lead-based paint activities;
(b) costs resulting from the training and certifying of individuals engaged in lead-based paint activities; and
(c) costs of establishing and operating State or Federal programs to administer and enforce the standards, regulations,
or other requirements established under this proposed rule. For each of these three categories of costs, total incremental
costs were estimated separately for the first year following promulgation (1994), and the present value for a 50&hyph;year
stream of costs discounted at 3 percent. (A 50&hyph;year stream was used because it was thought to provide a reasonable
estimate of the average life of a home, and a period beyond which discounted costs would have little impact on total
costs). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Scenario 1, total first-year incremental costs were estimated to be approximately $1.4 billion, while total
incremental costs, discounted at 3 percent over 50 years, were estimated to be $10.6 billion. Under Scenario 2, total
first year incremental costs were estimated at $.8 billion and total incremental costs, discounted at 3 percent over
50 years, were estimated at $6.2 billion. As may be discerned from Table 1, by comparing cost estimates for the two scenarios
presented, total costs decrease as abatement cut-offs increase (paint and soil lead concentrations), since fewer
structures and less soil would be abated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As demonstrated in the accompanying RIA, the standards for conducting lead-based paint activities are the main source
of costs, accounting for approximately 80 percent of the total incremental costs under both scenarios, due largely
to identification and inspection requirements and soil abatement. Under Scenario 1, the incremental cost of public
building identification is the greatest expenditure, accounting for 27 percent of the total incremental costs in
the first year of implementation and approximately 23 percent of the $10.6 billion total incremental cost. Under
Scenario 2, public building identification is again the greatest expenditure accounting for 47 percent of total
incremental costs in the first year of implementation and approximately 39 percent of the $6.2 billion total incremental
cost discounted over 50 years. The public building identification costs associated with the nonresidential sector
are high due to the assumed high level of activity in this sector during the first 3 years of rule implementation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Training costs were estimated to be approximately 17 percent of total discounted costs for each of the scenarios.
Factors affecting the potential magnitude of training costs are frequency and duration of training, as well as the
number of potential trainees and associated productivity losses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to State program costs, EPA found the one-time start-up costs to be the dominant factor. Owing to such start-up
costs, total first-year costs were estimated to be much larger than costs for any subsequent year. In developing its
total cost estimates for State programs, EPA assumed all States would establish such programs. While nothing in Title
IV requires States to seek authorization, the costs of EPA administration and enforcement were judged to be comparable
to State costs; thus, for the purposes of this analysis, this assumption is believed to provide a reasonable representation
of costs attributable to section 404. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Benefits of regulatory action.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 To most accurately estimate the benefits associated with this proposed rule, all private and social advantages of
the proposed rule's requirements would need to be identified and quantified. In particular, the incremental risk
reduction brought about by conducting lead-based paint activities using trained and certified individuals and
complying with the standards would need to be measured and valued as incremental benefits. Such risk reduction would
be the result of reduced lead exposure to residents of target housing; to occupants of and visitors to public and commercial
buildings; to risk assessors, inspectors, and abatement workers; to individuals in close proximity to lead-related
activities; and to the environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total measured benefits (i.e., benefits that have been identified and quantified) associated with complete
residential abatement, include intelligence effects on infants and children, reductions in neonatal mortality
due to decreased exposure to pregnant residents, and benefits to workers of avoidance of the very high blood lead levels
associated with occupational exposure. (EPA also considered benefits resulting from reduced exposure to adult
residents. The results of these preliminary calculations are included in the sensitivity analysis below.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Total measured benefits estimated in this manner overstate actual benefits associated with the incremental improvement
imparted by the training, certification, and standards outlined in the proposal. EPA believes, however, that these
total measured benefit estimates when compared to the incremental cost are sufficient to provide the basis for an
informed decision. EPA requests comment, in light of the data limitations, on the value of this approach in evaluating
the potential effectiveness of this regulation. Further, the Agency requests the submission of any available data
that would facilitate the development of incremental benefit values for the requirements of this regulation as well
as incremental benefits and costs of alternative regulatory requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The results of this approach are presented in Table 2. The estimated discounted total measured benefits over 50 years
range from a low of $11.8 billion (abatement Scenario 2) up to $21.6 billion (abatement Scenario 1). The largest category
of benefits accrue in association with children's intelligence effects, with an expected 50&hyph;year benefit
of $11 billion to $19 billion, depending on the abatement scenario. Benefits realized in association with reductions
in neonatal mortality were estimated to range between $.8 billion and $2.6 billion, while benefits to workers were
estimated at $2.1 to $5.1 million, over 50 years. In addition, benefits to non-residential abatement workers were
estimated at $34 to $49 million.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Benefit-cost analysis.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As shown in Table 3, total measured benefits are approximately double the incremental costs_the estimated incremental
costs of the regulation under Scenario 2, discounted at 3 percent and summed over 50 years, is estimated to be $6.2 billion,
and the estimated total measured benefits of the regulation, discounted at 3 percent and summed over 50 years, are
$11.8 billion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given that the incremental costs associated with the nonresidential sector amount to nearly 58 percent of all costs
attributable to the rule and that the data limitations so severely restrict the benefit estimations for the nonresidential
sector, the base case analysis also compares total measured benefits and incremental costs on a per residential abatement
basis to gain additional insight to the impacts of the proposed regulation. In an effort to minimize the impact of the
above limitations on the assessment of net benefits, an additional comparison was made between benchmark total measured
benefits and incremental costs for a single residential abatement. As shown in Table 4, if only a small portion of estimated
total measured benefits, say 15 to 20 percent are attributable to the proposed rule, it is possible for the incremental
benefits to equal or exceed the incremental costs for paint abatement activities in the residential housing sector.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A similar comparison is not possible for the nonresidential sector because data limitations preclude benefit estimates
for this sector. This is not to imply that the benefits resulting from nonresidential abatements are insignificant.
All the benefit categories believed to result from public and commercial and steel structure deleading are identified
in Table 3. Available information regarding the scope of activity (and presented in the uncertainties section below)
would suggest that substantial benefits are likely to exist in the form of other worker benefits, benefits to nearby
residents, and ecological benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The estimate of the benefits would increase if all the omitted health and ecological effects were included. Even when
restricted to the limited coverage of the effects of lead paint exposure that are included in this analysis, it is possible
that the measured benefits associated with sections 402 and 404 will exceed the costs of the regulations. The measured
benefits of complete abatements are more than six times the incremental costs for Abatement Scenario 2. Thus if the
sections 402 and 404 rules increase the measured benefits of residential abatements (using current industrial practices)
by as little as 18 percent, the benefits would exceed the costs of the regulation. A benefits analysis that included
the significant omitted benefit categories would indicate that an even smaller percentage increase in the benefits
of current abatement practices would be sufficient to cover the costs of the regulation.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Uncertainties and sensitivity analysis uncertainties
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The development of the estimated costs for this proposed rule relied on three steps: The determination of ``common''
practices, a comparison of these practices to the requirements of the rule, and an estimation of the cost of the additional
or incremental activities. While there is a general uncertainty about all the estimates, this approach may have resulted
in an overestimate of the costs. In the case of the number of samples to be tested, the analysis included costs for the
full number of tests required under the regulation. Inspectors are already taking some samples, although some may
not take as many as the regulations will require. Lacking information on the typical number of samples tested, the
analysis included the costs for all the tests. Likewise, interviews with industry representatives indicated that
very few soil abatements were currently taking place. Therefore, the analysis estimated the rate of soil abatements
under the regulation based on estimates of household radon abatement. Since radon abatements are less expensive
than soil abatements, this assumption may have resulted in an overestimate of the number of soil abatements and thus
an overestimate of both benefits and costs. Both these issues are examined by the sensitivity analysis below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The development of the benefit estimates was also limited by numerous factors. It was not possible to include several
potentially major sources of health benefits at this time. Some of the major omitted benefits include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;All benefits to adult residents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;All benefits to building occupants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;All benefits to workers with blood lead levels below 50

g/dL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;All benefits to residents near steel structure deleadings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;All ecological benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
All of the benefits in three of the five major categories, and part of the benefits to workers, result from changes affecting
abatements and deleading of public and commercial buildings and steel structures. As a result, the underestimation
of benefits has its greatest effect on the evaluation of the proposed rule's affect on nonresidential lead-based
paint activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The magnitude of some of these omitted benefits can be approximated by examining the extent of the likely exposure
and the nature of the resulting adverse effects. In the case of benefits to occupants of public and commercial buildings,
the potentially exposed population is very large. Over one-third of public buildings built before 1980 (approximately
900,000 buildings) have lead-based paint at an XRF reading of 1 or greater. In addition, about 27 percent of commercial
buildings (approximately 415,000 buildings) have lead-based paint at an XRF reading of 1 or greater. An equal percentage
(nearly 150,000) of industrial buildings also have lead-based paint at that level. Currently, these buildings result
in over one-half million deleadings per year. While the length of time of exposure for each individual building occupant
may be short, the number of exposed individuals is great, resulting in potentially substantial population risks
from improperly performed abatements. In addition, inadequate inspection and/or risk assessments could result
in much longer-term exposures if lead risks are not identified and abated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the deleading of steel structures mainly occurs out-of-doors, there is a significant potential of exposure
to the surrounding environment if deleading is not conducted properly. Currently, there are approximately 725,000
highway and railroad bridges, 30,000 water tanks, 75,000 petroleum and liquefied natural gas tanks, and 133,000
electrical transmission towers with lead-based paint that need repainting, and about 128,000 underground storage
tanks with lead-based coatings that need removal and demolition. While this analysis has not estimated the number
of people living in proximity to these structures, the large number of structures combined with the fact that many
are located in urban areas means that substantial numbers of people and large areas of ecosystems could be exposed
to lead. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to adverse human health effects, lead can impose substantial adverse effects on ecosystems. Although
lead occurs naturally in the environment, it plays no known beneficial role in biological processes. In fact, lead
is a natural toxicant that affects a broad spectrum of species and persists in the environment. Elevated ambient lead
levels that are bioavailable can seriously disrupt population and ecosystem dynamics. As a result, lead is considered
a particularly hazardous ecotoxicant. While deleading of steel structures is likely to have the greatest impact
on ecosystems, improperly performed abatements in other nonresidential and residential buildings can also introduce
lead into the general environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to omitting benefits to occupants of nonresidential buildings, benefits to residents near steel structures,
and ecological benefits, the estimates presented in the RIA may underestimate benefits because of the assumption
made concerning which residential units will be abated. The analysis assumes that all the housing stock with XRF and/or
soil-lead levels greater than the scenario levels are eligible candidates for abatement, and that housing units
receiving abatements are twice as likely to have young children and newborns as the housing stock in general. This
second assumption captures the increased concern about lead hazards and children, and the increased benefits that
would accrue to households with young children. The increased concern will likely result in increased abatement
rates among housing units with children. However, there are no data currently available on which to base an estimate
of this increased likelihood of abatement, and the estimate used may be low. A low estimate will result in an underestimate
of the average residential unit benefits. (Likewise, a high estimate will result in an overestimate of the average
residential unit benefits.) In addition, if the likelihood of abatement increases with the level of lead present
in the home, which is very likely, the average per unit benefits of residential abatement will increase correspondingly.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Data limitations have prevented the estimation of the relevant abatement demand and cost functions which are necessary
for accurately estimating the aggregate benefits and costs of the proposed rule. Adoption of the rule will impact
variables that affect both the demand and supply functions. For instance, in theory, the increase in abatement costs
resulting from training, accreditation, and standards required by section 402 will be reflected in an upward shift
of the supply function, increasing prices and resulting in a decreased demand. However, it is reasonable to expect
countervailing forces to exist. If people perceive that abatements performed by trained and certified contractors
are a better quality service than currently available, the demand for the improved abatements may increase. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to demand shifts as a result of section 402, informational sections of Title IV and Title X such as sections
405, 406, and 1018, respectively, will likely stimulate demand for abatements further. These actions provide information
and education to consumers about the inherent dangers of lead. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The net effect of these countervailing forces is difficult to predict with the limited information available. Data
limitations have also prevented an assessment of how the quantity of lead-based paint activities may change with
alternative regulatory options. Therefore, EPA has been unable to estimate the effect of more (or less) precriptive
approaches relative to the proposal on the quantity of lead-based paint activities. The Agency solicits comments
and suggestions about data sources or methods that may help in assessing the incremental benefits and costs of alternative
approaches. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to deal with this issue, it is assumed that the demand for deleading in Massachusetts can provide a proxy for
estimating national demand after the regulation is in place. This is deemed appropriate since the training, accreditation,
and performance requirements (thus costs) for the established Massachusetts' program are similar to that of the
proposed rule. To the extent that residential abatements are mandatory in Massachusetts when elevated-blood-lead
(EBL) children are identified, the adoption of Massachusetts' abatement rates will result in an overestimation
of the number of national residential abatements. However, it is felt that overestimation will be minimal for the
following two reasons: information from the Massachusetts' Department of Health indicates that only 10 to 20 percent
of the residential abatements are a result of the presence of EBL children, and because it is likely that other States
will also adopt a mandatory abatement provision for EBL children. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA knows of no other State programs that may provide additional insights to the expected impacts on demand resulting
from the implementation of the proposed rule and, therefore, solicits public comment on the existence of State programs
and relevant information germane to this issue.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sensitivity analysis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Six sets of sensitivity analyses were conducted. Two sets affecting only the costs are alternative costs of standards,
resulting from alternative estimates of unit costs or alternative assumptions of the number of events; and, alternative
training costs, resulting from alternative definitions of training requirements. There are two sets of sensitivity
analyses that affect the benefits while leaving the costs unchanged. These two analyses explore alternative levels
of benefits to adult residents of units abated and alternative value of a statistical life. And finally, there are
two sets of analyses that affect both the costs and the benefits. These use an alternative discount rate, and assume
alternative levels of abatement activity. The impacts of these variables on the estimated costs and benefits are
presented in Tables 5 and 6, respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The greatest affects on the estimated benefits and costs are associated with the assumptions concerning choice of
discount rate and the rate at which soil abatements will occur. Since the benefits resulting from the proposed regulation
will not occur simultaneously with the costs, it is necessary to compare streams of costs with the resulting streams
of benefits. This is done by discounting future costs and benefits and summing the discounted values. Two alternative
approaches were investigated: using 7 percent in place of 3 percent to reflect an alternative social rate of time preference,
and using a two-stage procedure that allows for the use of two different discount rates: marginal rate of return on
capital (7 percent) for annualizing the capital costs; and a social rate of time preference (3 percent) for discounting
the stream of annualized costs and benefits. The distinction between these two approaches rests with whether the
source of funds for lead-based paint activities are displacing investment or consumption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Simply discounting the stream of costs by 7 percent decreases the total 50&hyph;year cost estimate by 27 percent.
At the same time, increasing the discount rate to 7 percent substantially decreases the estimated benefits more than
the cost, because many of the benefits will occur further in the future. There are potentially two separate effects
of changing the discount rate. First, the benefits per abatement decrease for all the quantified benefit categories
except for workers benefits and the present value of the 50&hyph;year benefits decreases for all the benefit categories
(including workers). The combination of these two effects decreases the present value of the 50&hyph;year benefit
stream by 87 percent. Consequently, the choice of discount rate affects benefits to a much greater extent than it does
costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The results of the two-stage discounting procedure are very sensitive to the amortization period (the length of time
capital is diverted from investments). Given the uncertainties about the appropriate amortization period, 50&hyph;year
discounted costs were not calculated. However, as demonstrated in the literature the two-stage results will fall
between the single discount rates of 3 and 7 percent used in these analyses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of the most important elements used in estimating the benefits is the willingness to pay to avoid a unit reduction
in the risk of death, also referred to as the value of a statistical life. The value of a statistical life directly enters
the calculations of the benefits of the avoided neonatal mortality, adult resident hypertension related benefits
(when included), and worker benefits. The results presented in base case are calculated using a value of $5.3 million
per statistical life. The standard deviation of these values is $3.8 million. A useful range of alternative values
for sensitivity analysis is mean value minus one standard deviation, and the mean value plus one standard deviation.
The range of alternative values of a statistical life is therefore $1.8 million to $9.1 million. Use of this range will
have a significant effect on neonatal mortality benefits. However, the alternative values do not alter the overall
benefit estimates greatly; the present value of benefits per abatement and of total benefits (over 50 years, discounted
at 3 percent) changes by plus or minus 5 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The primary analysis relies on Massachusetts and OSHA data to estimate most of the levels of abatement activity, in
terms of the number of inspections, and abatements/deleading, under the proposed regulation. The Massachusetts
and OSHA data provide little information regarding the number of soil abatements. For estimates of rates of soil abatement,
therefore, the analysis relies on information on rates of radon abatement. The primary analysis assumes a similar
response rate to the presence of lead in soil as to the presence of radon in soil. In other words, 20 percent of the soil
inspections that determine the presence of lead result in a soil abatement. The sensitivity analysis assumes two
alternative abatement rates (84 and 10 percent) which reflect likely response rate extremes. For target housing,
the lead paint abatement rate was 84 percent. If individuals respond to the presence of lead in the soil similarly to
interior lead paint, then the soil abatement rate also will be 84 percent. The 10 percent alternative is examined because
based on the radon abatement experience, the 20 percent abatement rate used in the primary analysis may be too high.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Changing the level of soil abatement activities will affect training, standards, and state costs at an 84 percent
abatement rate, the total cost of the regulation will increase by 26 percent, with standards costs increasing 32 percent.
Using a 10 percent abatement rate the total costs will decrease by only 4.5 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Changing the level of soil abatement activities also changes the estimated benefits. The per-abatement benefits
do not change from performing an interior-only, soil-only, or combined paint and soil abatement. However, the average
per-abatement benefits change when the number of soil (and paint and soil combined) abatements change. At an 84 percent
abatement rate, the total measured benefits will increase 30 percent; and using a 10 percent abatement rate will result
in a 5 percent decrease in total measured benefits.

Impacts of the proposed rule.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In assessing impacts of the proposed rule, EPA focussed on the potential of the rule to affect international trade
and to impact technological innovation. The distributional consequences of regulation (environmental equity)
were also investigated. (Small business impacts, assessed pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, were
also assessed. The results of this analysis are presented in unit X. of this preamble.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to international trade impacts, EPA examined the affected industries to determine whether the extent
of foreign trade merited a detailed examination of potential impacts. Since the industries directly affected by
this proposed rule are service industries, marketable goods would not be produced for trade. The reduction in lead-based
paint hazards expected is achieved through the identification and abatement of lead-based paint structures in the
United States and, therefore, will have no implications for international trade. Thus, EPA concludes that there
is no appreciable international trade in these services.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In assessing the proposed rule's potential impacts on innovative activity, EPA believes that certain requirements
are likely to encourage innovation, while others may be a hinderance. For example, an area where innovation might
be encouraged is in the case of testing to determine the presence of lead. The standards require that the presence of
lead be determined by a test that produces discrete measures. While this proposed rule does not prescribe or prohibit
any particular practice, it does require that certain results be achieved. Thus, in setting criteria for new approaches
in this case, the proposed rule does not eliminate the potential for innovation by requiring the use of any particular
method, such as XRF. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The key factor in EPA's investigation into the distributional impacts of the proposed rule was the distribution of
lead-based paint in the nation's housing stock. Lead-based paint is more common in older, low-cost housing units
in the Northeast and Midwest. Because such housing units tend to be occupied by households at or below the poverty level,
including a disproportionate share of African-Americans, these subpopulations are exposed to relatively more
risks than other subpopulations. While these sub-populations would be likely to receive a greater portion of the
overall risk reduction benefits of the rule, the fact that most abatements are voluntary suggests that wealthier
households will be more likely to proceed with abatements. Unfortunately, data are not available to permit estimates
to be made of the demand for abatement given differing household income levels; thus, the distribution of benefits
and costs across geographic and demographic lines were not estimated.

G. Enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 409 of TSCA makes it unlawful to fail or refuse to comply with any provision of a rule promulgated under Title
IV of TSCA. Therefore, failure to comply with any provisions of the final rule would be a violation of TSCA. In addition,
section 15 of TSCA makes it unlawful for any person to fail or refuse to permit entry or inspection as required by section
11 of TSCA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Violators may be subject to both civil and criminal liability. Under the penalty provision of section 16 of TSCA, any
person who violates section 15 or 409 is subject to a civil penalty of up to $25,000 for each violation. Each day a violation
continues may constitute a separate violation. Knowing or willful violations of any provision of the final rule could
lead to the imposition of criminal fines of up to $25,000 and imprisonment for up to 1 year for each violation. In addition,
other remedies are available to EPA under sections 7 and 17 of TSCA, such as seeking an injunction to restrain violations
of the rule and seizing any imminently hazardous chemical substance. Section 15 and 16 of TSCA apply to ``any person''
who violates various provisions of TSCA. EPA may, at its discretion, proceed against individuals as well as companies
or Federal facilities. In particular, EPA may proceed against individuals who report false or misleading information
or cause it to be reported.

H. Business Confidentiality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 14 of TSCA, a person may assert a claim of business confidentiality for any public comments submitted
to EPA in connection with the proposed rule. Any person who submits a public comment for which a claim of confidentiality
has been made must also submit a nonconfidential version. Any claim of confidentiality must accompany the information
when it is submitted to EPA. Persons may claim information in comments confidential by circling, bracketing, or underlining
it, and marking it with ``CONFIDENTIAL'' or some other appropriate designation. EPA will disclose information subject
to a claim of business confidentiality only to the extent permitted by section 14 of TSCA and 40 CFR part 2, subpart B.
If a person does not assert a claim of confidentiality for information in comments at the time it is submitted to EPA,
EPA will make the information public without further notice to that person by placing the comments in the public docket
for this rulemaking.

EPA will hold an informal hearing at a time and place announced at a later date in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Any informal hearing will be conducted in accordance with EPA's ``Procedures for Conducting Rulemaking Under Section
6 of the Toxic Substances Control Act'' (40 CFR part 750). Persons or organizations desiring to participate in the
informal hearing must file a written request to participate. The written request to participate must be sent to the
Environmental Assistance Division at the address listed under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. The written request to participate must include: (1) A brief statement of the interest
of the person or organization in the proceeding; (2) a brief outline of the points to be addressed; (3) an estimate of
the time required; and (4) if the request comes from an organization, a non-binding list of the persons to take part
in the presentation. Organizations are requested to bring with them, to the extent possible, employees with individual
expertise in and responsibility for each of the areas to be addressed.

J. Official Rulemaking Record
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has established a record for this rulemaking (docket control number OPPTS&hyph;62128). A public version of the
record, without any information claimed as confidential business information, is available in the TSCA Nonconfidential
Information Center (NCIC) from 12 noon to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays. The TSCA NCIC is located
at EPA headquarters, in Rm. NE&hyph;B607, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC. 20460.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rulemaking record contains information considered by EPA in developing this proposed rule. The record includes:
(1) All Federal Register notices, (2) relevant support documents, (3) reports, (4) memoranda and letters, and (5)
hearing transcripts responses to comments, and other documents related to this rulemaking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following is a list of documents which the Agency relied upon while developing this proposed regulation and can
be found in the docket. Other documents, not listed here, such as those submitted with written comments from interested
parties, are contained in the TSCA Docket office as well. The drafts of proposed rules submitted by the Administrator
to the Office of Management and Budget for any interagency review process prior to proposal of the rule will also be
contained in the public docket. The drafts of the final rule submitted for OMB review before promulgation will also
be placed into the public docket.

A. Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under E.O. 12866, (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether regulatory action is ``significant''
and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements of the Executive
Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines ``a significant regulatory action'' as an action that is likely to result
in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting a
sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local
or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious
inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering
the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues
arising out of legal mandates, the Presidents priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, it has been determined that this rule is a ``significant regulatory
action'' because it will have an annual effect on the economy of over $100 million annually. As such, this action was
submitted to OMB for review, and any comments or changes made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations, have
been documented in the public record.

Introduction
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) requires regulators to analyze impacts on small entities. EPA conducted
such an analysis, including it as part of the RIA. Based on this analysis of available data, EPA preliminarily concludes
that the proposed rule should not place undue burden on small business. The analysis is summarized below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Impacts on Small Businesses.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA assessed potential impacts, both absolute and relative burden, on small abatement firms in the construction
industry. To examine the potential impacts of the proposed rule on small abatement establishments, compliance costs
as a percentage of operating costs were estimated for both small and large firms and then compared to determine if small
firms are more adversely impacted than large firms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The compliance costs consist of two components: (1) Licensing and training costs for workers and supervisors, as
well as licensing costs for firms, and (2) incremental costs of performance standards for abatement procedures.
These two components coincide with the two decision points faced by firms interested in performing lead-based paint
abatement work (including soil abatement). In order to be a ``player'' in this industry, a firm must be licensed and
its employees must be trained and certified. It is likely that a firm will incur these expenses in anticipation of work,
based on its assessment of the future demand for such services, its competition, and the price it will be able to charge.
Therefore, the firm may incur the costs with no opportunity to recoup them, thus decreasing its profits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second set of costs, those resulting from performance standards, are of a different nature. The firms that do lead
abatement work also perform similar work in settings that do not involve lead and are not affected by the proposed rule.
These costs occur at the second decision point. They will be incurred by a firm only if it chooses to undertake a given
lead-based paint job. In each case, the firm can determine the impact of the performance standards on its sales and
profit levels. If the impact will be undesirable (e.g., decrease profit levels), the firm can decline the work. In
this voluntary setting, the performance standards will not have an impact on the profits of small businesses. Likewise,
owners of property will incur the performance standards costs only if abatements are in their benefit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A comparison of incremental training and licensing costs to the estimated operating costs for an average small firm,
for each SIC group involved with lead abatement, is shown in Table 7 below. These SIC groups cover abatements in residential,
public, commercial, and industrial buildings, as well as steel structure abatement and deleading. Assuming that
none of the training and licensing costs are shifted forward in the form of higher prices, the ratio of compliance costs
to operating costs for small establishments range between 1.2 and 3.2 percent. Cost ratios are similarly estimated
for large establishments in Table 8 below. For large firms, the ratios tend to be slightly lower, ranging from1.0 to
2.3 percent. For both large and small establishments, the largest cost ratio occurs for SIC 1721, painting contractors.
However, for these firms, a large non-lead paint market is available. In all cases, compliance costs equal a small
percentage of operating costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While this shifting of costs will alleviate the burden on abatement and deleading firms, the incremental costs of
the regulations may affect residential and commercial building owners. Consistent with the arguments presented
above, under this proposed rule abatement is a voluntary action. As such, a landlord is unlikely to undertake an abatement
unless he or she is able to pass the cost on to his or her tenants or otherwise recoup the costs in terms of higher property
values. EPA is concerned about the possibility that landlords of marginally profitable property, under the threat
of civil suits may chose the alternative of abandoning the property rather than incur the cost of abatement. EPA solicits
comments providing data or methods any such effects on the removal target housing from the market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An alternative indicator which demonstrates potential impacts on small abatement firms focuses on profitability.
EPA subtracted estimated establishment compliance costs from average profits per establishment to determine post-compliance
profits. This calculation was also performed separately for small and large establishments for the same SIC codes
identified above assuming Scenario 1 (See Tables 9 and 10 below). The estimated average adjusted profits for small
establishments in two of the nine affected industry sectors become negative. One of these sectors, Miscellaneous
Trade Contractors, was assumed as the most likely to perform a high frequency of very costly soil abatement projects;
thus, compliance costs exceeded profits by more than a factor of 10. For 3 other sectors, compliance costs represented
more than 50 percent of abatement establishment profits. For large firms, the results of this calculation indicated
the typical large firm to remain profitable in all sectors. Thus, based on the profitability indicator size of deleading
firms entering the abatement industry may be impacted by this proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These calculations on profits assume all costs were absorbed by affected firms. This is more reasonable in the short
run than in the long run. EPA does not have the necessary information to ascertain the cost pass through rate and resulting
impacts on individual firms in the short run. Also, the analysis was constrained to use SIC data that are from a set of
firms that may be different from firms complying with this proposed rule and, therefore, the financial information
may not be representative of potential abatement firms. EPA solicits comments on available data to estimate these
impacts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The two indicators presented above were selected to present the likely bounds of the impacts associated with the proposed
rule. The actual impact will likely lie somewhere between these extremes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comparison of impacts on small and large training providers was not performed for two reasons. Except for the RLTCs,
most training providers are small, so there would be no differential effect based on size of the firm. In addition,
it is likely that the training providers will pass the additional costs on to their trainees. Since the changes will
be required by Federal regulations, they will apply to all training providers. Second, there will be heightened concern
about lead-based paint hazards and thus a greater willingness to pay for trained personnel who will presumably provide
higher quality services. In fact, these regulations are likely to create a market for training services and thus will
be beneficial to small businesses.

C. Paperwork Reduction Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Information Collection requirements in this proposed rule have been submitted for approval to the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. An Information Collection Request (ICR)
document has been prepared by EPA (ICR No. 15 USC 2682 and 15 USC 2688) and a copy may be obtained from Sandy Farmer, Information
Policy Branch, (2136) EPA, 401 M st., SW Washington DC 20460, or by calling (202) 260&hyph;2740. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This collection of information has an estimated reporting burden averaging 2.67 hours per response while the estimated
recordkeeping burden was estimated to be 0.32 hours per response. These estimates include time to review instructions,
search existing data sources, gather and maintain the data needed, and complete the collection information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Send comments regarding the burden estimate, or any other aspect of this collection of information including suggestions
for reducing this burden to Chief, Information Policy Branch, (2136) EPA 401 M St., S.W., Washington, DC 20460, marked
``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.'' The final rule will respond to OMB or public comments on the information collection
requirements contained in this proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This regulation includes a number of reporting and record keeping requirements, which are designed to help EPA verify
compliance with the rule after it is promulgated. This analysis identifies the reporting and record keeping requirements
specified in the proposed rule and estimates the burden and cost that these requirements will impose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This regulation will add to the reporting and recordkeeping burden for three entities: states, training providers,
and lead inspection and abatement firms. Where applicable, burden numbers were based on those developed for the Asbestos
Model Accreditation Plan (MAP)(U.S. EPA, 1993b). In all other cases, burden numbers were estimated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reporting burdens presented are classified into two groups: initial and annual. The burden associated with the start-up
efforts of states, training providers, and lead inspection and abatement firms are referred to as the initial burden.
For the purpose of this analysis, all of these efforts are assumed to be completed during 1994, the first year of the
rule. The burden associated with reporting requirements that will be required on an annual basis are referred to as
the annual burden and are presented based on the projected activity level for 1994. Initial and annual estimates are
combined to project the burden and costs that will be imposed during the first year of the rule, while the annual costs
alone serve as an estimate of the burden level expected during the second year (and subsequent years) of the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first and second year burden estimates for all entities subject to reporting requirements under this rule, were
estimated to two abatement scenarios of XRF

2,000 ppm. With regard to the first abatement scenario, during the initial year of the rule the burden is projected
to be 11.4 million hours and $228.8 million. Assuming all entities seeking accreditation and certification are in
place during the first year of the rule, the burden estimate associatedwith the second year (and all subsequent years)
is projected to be 10.8 million hours and $217.6 million. At XRF

2000 ppm, the total burden for the initial year is estimated to be 6.2 million hours and $126.1 million. For the second
year, and subsequent years, the total burden is 6.1 million hours and $120.9 million. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The majority of the burden, for both abatement scenarios, falls on lead abatement firms and is driven by the reporting
requirements associated with on-site lead-based paint activities. Because this burden is driven by the number of
lead-based paint projects, it is expected to decline substantially in subsequent years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total annual recordkeeping costs for the XRF

500 ppm represent the worst-case scenario due to the number of events that occur. Total annual costs are estimated
to be approximately $1.3 million.

This subpart contains procedures and requirements for the accreditation of lead-based paint activities training
programs, procedures and requirements for the certification of individuals and firms engaged in lead-based paint
activities, and standards for performing such activities. This subpart also contains requirements that all lead-based
paint activities shall be performed by certified individuals. This subpart is applicable to all individuals and
firms who are engaged in lead-based paint activities as defined in &sect;745.223, except persons who perform these
activities within residences which they own, unless the residence is occupied by a person or persons other than the
owner or the owner's immediate family while these activities are being conducted. This subpart is applicable only
in those states or Indian Reservations that do not have an authorized state program pursuant to &sect;745.325 or &sect;745.327
respectively of Subpart Q of this part. Each department, agency, and instrumentality of the executive, legislative,
and judicial branches of the Federal Government having jurisdiction over any property or facility or engaged in any
activity resulting, or which may result, in a lead-based paint hazard, and each officer, agent, or employee thereof,
shall be subject to, and comply with all Federal, State, interstate, and local requirements, both substantive and
procedural, including the requirements of this subpart regarding lead-based paint, lead-based paint activities,
and lead-based paint hazards.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed rule establishes regulations for seasons, harvest limits, methods, and means related to taking of
wildlife for subsistence uses during the 1995&hyph;1996 regulatory year. This rulemaking is necessary because
subpart D regulations require annual public review. When final, this rule making will replace hunting and trapping
regulations in ``Subsistence Management Regulations for Public Lands in Alaska, Subpart D_1994&hyph;1995 Subsistence
Taking of Fish and Wildlife Regulations,'' which expire on June 30, 1995.

 Written public comments and proposals to change this proposed rule will be accepted through November 11, 1994. Federal
Subsistence Regional Advisory Councils (Regional Councils) will hold public meetings on this proposed rulemaking
from October 3&hyph;November 4, 1994, at the following locations in Alaska: Anchorage, Barrow, Bethel, Fairbanks,
Galena, Kodiak, Kotzebue, Naknek, Nome, and Sitka. Written proposals to change subpart D regulations will be compiled
and distributed for additional public review during the second week of November 1994. A second 30-day public comment
period will follow distribution of the compiled proposal packet. Written public comments on distributed proposals
will be accepted during the second public comment period. Comments on proposals to change subpart D regulations may
be presented to the Regional Councils at their meetings. The Federal Subsistence Board (Board) will deliberate and
take final action on proposals received that request changes to this proposed rule at a public meeting to be held in
Anchorage during April 1995.

Proposed Changes From 1994&hyph;1995 Seasons and Bag Limit Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subpart D regulations are subject to an annual cycle and require development of an entire new rule each year. Consequently,
this proposed rule reflects regulation changes for the 1995&hyph;1996 regulatory year that are approved by the Board.
Regulations contained in this proposed rule will take effect on July 1, 1995, unless elements are changed by subsequent
Board action following the public review process outlined herein. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The text of the 1994&hyph;1995 subpart D final rule served as the foundation for the 1995&hyph;1996 subpart D proposed
rule. Minor editorial changes to the 1994&hyph;1995 final rule have been made to clarify and enhance Federal subsistence
management program regulations for the 1995&hyph;1996 regulatory year. The other proposed regulatory changes
include:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 15, 1993, the Native American Rights Fund, on behalf of a number of individuals and organizations, submitted
a petition to the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture requesting that they include navigable
waters within the definition of ``public lands'' as used in implementing Title VIII. This was a request for administrative
relief. The Secretaries continue their evaluation of this petition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 30, 1994, the U.S. District Court for Alaska issued a decision in the consolidated 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Katie John, et al. v. the United States, et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 litigation. The court concluded that the Secretaries are entitled to manage fish and wildlife on public lands in Alaska
for the purposes of providing the subsistence priority mandated in Title VIII of ANILCA. The court further concluded
that, for the purposes of Title VIII, ``public lands'' includes all navigable waterways in Alaska. The court then
issued a stay of the decision for 60 days to allow the filing of an appeal and ordered that the stay would remain in effect,
pending an appellate decision, if one or more appeals were filed. Because the Federal government has successfully
petitioned the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals for permission to appeal from the district court's decision, the stay
presently remains in effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the petition for rulemaking is still under consideration by the secretaries and because of the stayed court
decision relative to actual Federal jurisdiction, the Board believes that issuing regulations immediately, assuming
additional authority or revising existing regulations are not warranted and, in fact, appear to be inappropriate
at this time. However, any comments or proposals received will be carefully considered and retained for use when the
regulations are revised the next time. Therefore, the existing fish and shellfish regulations were extended (59
FR 32923, dated June 27, 1994) until December 31, 1995, or until the Secretaries direct the revision of the subsistence
fish and shellfish regulations based on a revised area of jurisdiction, or until the court directs the preparation
of regulations implementing its order.

At this time, Federal subsistence management program regulations apply to all non-navigable waters located on public
lands and to navigable waters located on the public lands identified at 50 CFR 100.3(b) and 36 CFR 242.3(b) of the Subsistence
Management Regulations for Public Lands in Alaska, subparts A, B, and C (57 FR 22940&hyph;22964) published May 29,
1992. Nothing in these regulations is intended to enlarge or diminish authorities of the Departments to manage submerged
lands, title to which is held by the United States government.

Pursuant to the Record of Decision, Subsistence Management for Federal Public Lands in Alaska, April 6, 1992, and
the Subsistence Management Regulations for Public Lands in Alaska, 36 CFR 242.11 (1992) and 50 CFR 100.11 (1992),
and for the purposes identified therein, Alaska has been divided into ten subsistence resource regions, each of which
is to be represented by a Regional Council. Charters for these Regional Councils were approved and signed by former
Secretary Lujan on January 19, 1993. The Regional Councils provide a forum for rural residents with personal knowledge
of local conditions and resource requirements to have a meaningful role in the subsistence management of fish and
wildlife on Alaska public lands. The Regional Councils have a substantial role in helping residents of the region
reviewing this proposed rule and making comments on it. Presently, the Regional Councils are composed of no fewer
than seven and no more than thirteen members who are residents of the region and are knowledgeable of local subsistence
concerns. Regional Council members serve a three-year term with one-third of the terms expiring annually. An extensive
recruitment effort for new Regional Council members occurs each fall. The Regional Council members represent varied
geographical, cultural, and user diversity within each region. Moreover, the Council Chairs present their Council's
recommendations at the Board meeting in April 1995.

A Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) that described four alternatives for developing a Federal Subsistence
Management Program was distributed for public comment on October 7, 1991. That document described the major issues
associated with Federal subsistence management as identified through public meetings, written comments and staff
analysis and examined the environmental consequences of the four alternatives. Proposed regulations (Subparts
A, B, and C) that would implement the preferred alternative were included in the DEIS as an appendix. The DEIS and the
proposed administrative regulations presented a framework for an annual regulatory cycle regarding subsistence
hunting and fishing regulations (Subpart D). The Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) was published on February
28, 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the public comment received, the analysis contained in the FEIS, and the recommendations of the Federal Subsistence
Board and the Department of the Interior's Subsistence Policy Group, it was the decision of the Secretary of the Interior,
with the concurrence of the Secretary of Agriculture, through the U.S. Department of Agriculture-Forest Service,
to implement Alternative IV as identified in the DEIS and FEIS (Record of Decision on Subsistence Management for Federal
Public Lands in Alaska (ROD), signed April 6, 1992). The DEIS and the selected alternative in the FEIS defined the administrative
framework of an annual regulatory cycle for subsistence hunting and fishing regulations. The final rule for Subsistence
Management Regulations for Public Lands in Alaska, Subparts A, B, and C (57 FR 22940&hyph;22964, May 29, 1992) implements
the Federal Subsistence Management Program and includes a framework for an annual cycle for subsistence hunting
and fishing regulations.

Compliance With Section 810 of ANILCA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The intent of all Federal subsistence regulations is to accord subsistence uses of fish and wildlife on public lands
a priority over the taking of fish and wildlife on such lands for other purposes, unless restriction is necessary to
conserve healthy fish and wildlife populations. A Section 810 analysis was completed as part of the FEIS process.
The final Section 810 analysis determination appears in the April 6, 1992, ROD which concluded that the Federal Subsistence
Management Program, under Alternative IV with an annual process for setting hunting and fishing regulations, may
have some local impacts on subsistence uses, but it does not appear that the program may significantly restrict subsistence
uses.

These rules contain information collection requirements subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval
under 44 U.S.C. 3501&hyph;3520. They apply to the use of public lands in Alaska. The information collection requirements
described above are approved by the OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501 and have been assigned clearance number 1018&hyph;0075.

Public reporting burden for this form is estimated to average .1382 hours per response, including time for reviewing

(1018&hyph;0075), Washington, D.C. 20503. Additional information collection requirements may be imposed if Local
Advisory Committees subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act are established under Subpart B. Such requirements
will be submitted to OMB for approval prior to their implementation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) requires preparation of flexibility analyses for rules that will have a significant effect on a substantial number
of small entities, which include small businesses, organizations or governmental jurisdictions. The Departments
have determined that this rulemaking will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small
entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rulemaking will impose no significant costs on small entities; the exact number of businesses and the amount
of trade that will result from this Federal land-related activity is unknown. The aggregate effect is an insignificant
positive economic effect on a number of small entities. The number of small entities affected is unknown; but, the
fact that the positive effects will be seasonal in nature and will, in most cases, merely continue preexisting uses
of public lands indicates that they will not be significant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These regulations do not meet the threshold criteria of ``Federalism Effects'' as set forth in Executive Order 12612.
Title VIII of ANILCA requires the Secretaries to administer a subsistence preference on public lands. The scope of
this program is limited by definition to certain public lands. Likewise, these regulations have no significant takings
implication relating to any property rights as outlined by Executive Order 12630.

then down the Junjik River past Timber Lake and a larger tributary, to a major, unnamed tributary located directly
south of Little Njoo Mountain; the boundary leaves the river and continues upstream along this unnamed tributary,
northwesterly, for approximately 6 miles where the stream forks into two roughly equal drainages; the boundary follows
the eastern most fork, proceeding almost due north to the headwaters and intersects the Continental Divide; the boundary
then follows the Continental Divide easterly, through Carter Pass, then easterly and northeasterly approximately
20 miles along the divide to an unnamed peak, elevation 6,460, located north of the most southerly major fork of the
headwaters of Cane Creek; then the boundary continues due south 1.5 miles to the high point of a saddle, then down the
headwaters tributary to Cane Creek and down the creek to the confluence of Cane Creek and the East Fork Chandalar. Sheep
hunting in this area is restricted to residents of Arctic Village, Venetie, Fort Yukon, Kaktovik and Chalkytsik.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary proposes to amend the regulations governing the Upward Bound Program. These regulations are needed
to further implement statutory changes made to the Upward Bound Program by the Higher Education Amendments of 1992,
and to clarify and simplify certain requirements governing the program. The selection criteria, prior experience
criteria, and grantee accountability provisions are affected by these proposed changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purposes and allowable activities of the Upward Bound Program support the National Education Goals. Specifically,
the program funds projects designed to increase high school graduation rates, increase competency over challenging
subject matters, encourage more students to pursue programs in mathematics and science, and help gain parental participation
in the social, emotional and academic growth of their children.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Upward Bound Program provides grants to institutions of higher education; public and private agencies and organizations;
combinations of institutions, agencies, and organizations; and secondary schools under special circumstances.
The purpose of the program is to generate the skills and motivation necessary for success in education beyond high
school. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 1, 1993, the Secretary published revisions to the Upward Bound Program regulations to implement changes
required by the Higher Education Amendments of 1992 (58 FR 51520&hyph;21). This NPRM proposes program improvements
that were not covered by the October 1, 1993 regulations. The major provisions of these proposed regulations include
the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Definitions (&sect;645.5).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed regulations revise or add definitions to clarify certain terms used in the regulations, including definitions
of ``participant,'' ``independent student,'' and ``organization/agency.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Kinds of Projects (&sect;645.10).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed regulations will define in general the three types of Upward Bound projects supported under the program,
i.e., Regular Upward Bound projects, Math and Science Upward Bound projects, and Veterans Upward Bound projects.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Upward Bound services and activities (&sect;&sect;645.11&hyph;645.14).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 645.11 of the proposed regulations lists the services that all Upward Bound projects must provide. Section
645.12 describes the manner in which services are provided in Regular Upward Bound projects. Section 645.13 lists
additional services that the Math and Science Upward Bound project must provide and the manner in which services are
provided. Section 645.14 lists additional services that the Veterans Upward Bound project must provide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
How does one apply for an award? (&sect;&sect;645.20&hyph;645.21).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 645.20 of the proposed regulation describes the condition under which the Secretary will accept more than
one application from an eligible applicant. Section 645.21 describes the assurances an applicant must include in
an application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Selection criteria (&sect;645.31).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed regulations revise the order, weighting, and content of application selection criteria. The purpose
for this revision is to simplify and clarify the review process and increase grantee accountability. In addition,
the proposed regulations clarify and strengthen the requirements for a grantee's evaluation of a project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Prior experience (&sect;645.32).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed regulations revise the criteria for the evaluation of a grantee's prior experience to focus on project
outcomes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Project size (&sect;645.43(a)).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed regulations establish a minimum number of participants residing in the target area who must be served
by a project in each budget period, and permit that number to be reduced if the grant amount for the budget period is less
than $190,000. The proposed regulations require that Veterans Upward Bound projects serve at least 120 participants
during each budget period, and that all other Upward Bound projects serve at least 50 participants in each budget period.
Coupled with the new definition of ``participant'' in &sect;645.6 and the new recordkeeping requirements for participants
in &sect;645.43(c), this provision is intended to ensure that projects provide a reasonable level of services to
a significant number of recipients. This intended result is consistent with section 402A(b)(3) of the HEA, which
establishes a $190,000 minimum grant level for awards beginning in fiscal year 1994, unless the applicant requests
a lesser amount. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Project period (&sect;645.34).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed regulations implement a statutory provision that expands the project period to four years_or five years
in the case of applications that receive peer review scores in the highest 10 percent of all scores for approved new
projects.

Clarity of the Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12866 requires each agency to write regulations that are easy to understand. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary invites comments on how to make these regulations easier to understand, including answers to questions
such as the following: (1) Are the requirements in the regulations clearly stated? (2) Do the regulations contain
technical terms or other wording that interferes with their clarity? (3) Does the format of the regulations (grouping
and order of sections, use of headings, paragraphing, etc.) aid or reduce their clarity? Would the regulations be
easier to understand if they were divided into more (but shorter) sections? (A ``section'' is preceded by the symbol
``&sect;'' and a numbered heading; for example, &sect;645.20. (4) Is the description of the proposed regulations
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 section of this preamble helpful in understanding the proposed regulations? How could this description be more helpful
in making the proposed regulations easier to understand? (5) What else could the Department do to make the regulations
easier to understand? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A copy of any comments that concern whether these proposed regulations are easy to understand should also be sent to
Stanley Cohen, Regulations Quality Officer, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, SW. (Room 5125,
FOB&hyph;6), Washington, DC 20202&hyph;2241.

Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary certifies that these proposed regulations would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. The small entities that would be affected by these regulations are small institutions of
higher education, other agencies and organizations, and secondary schools that receive Federal funds under this
program. However, the regulations would not have a significant economic impact on the small entities affected because
the regulations would not impose excessive regulatory burdens or require unnecessary Federal supervision. The
regulations would impose minimal requirements to ensure the proper expenditure of program funds.

Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 645.4, 645.31, 645.32, and 645.43 contain information collection requirements. As required by the Paperwork
Reduction Act of 1980, the Department of Education will submit a copy of these sections to the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) for its review. (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Institutions of higher education; public and private agencies and organizations; combinations of institutions,
agencies, and organizations; and secondary schools are eligible to apply for grants under these regulations. The
Department needs and uses the application data and information to make grants. Annual grantee reporting is estimated
to average 40 hours per response for over 600 respondents, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching
existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of
information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on the information collection requirement should direct
them to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, Room 10235, New Executive Office Building, Washington,
DC 20504; Attention: Daniel J. Chenok.
