SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is revising its regulations governing use of temporary appointments (i.e.,
appointments limited to 1 year or less) to set a uniform service limit for such appointments in both the competitive
and the excepted service at 1 year with no more than one 1-year extension (24 months total service). This change is intended
to ensure that temporary appointments, under which employees receive no benefits, are used to meet truly short-term
needs.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 1, 1994 (59 FR 4601), OPM published proposed regulations to reduce the time limit for temporary appointments,
curtail use of temporary hiring for extended seasonal work, and prohibit successive temporary appointments to the
same or successor jobs. We developed those regulations in response to Congressional and employee concerns and evidence
that some employees were, indeed, serving for years under a succession of temporary appointments with no benefits
and no job security.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations generated numerous comments from agencies, individual managers and employees, and local
employee organizations. Many of the commenters took opposite positions. Many anticipated changes that will be proposed
in legislation implementing the recommendations of the National Performance Review (NPR). We could not adopt all
of their suggestions, which are summarized below. We have, however, attempted to balance their various concerns
and to provide reasonable operating flexibility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Relationship to NPR
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many of the commenters felt that the proposal did not go far enough. They stated that the issue of benefits for temporary
employees should be addressed directly by affording benefits and within-grade increases to temporary employees,
that long-term temporaries who have demonstrated their abilities on the job should not have to compete with the public
for permanent vacancies, and that agencies should be able to set the length of temporary appointments based on mission
needs, not arbitrary regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OPM supports all of those goals. These regulations are 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
intended to be the final solution to all of the problems of temporary employment. Rather, they are an interim measure
to address those issues within our control pending more comprehensive reform. We expect that legislation implementing
the human resource recommendations of the NPR will be proposed within the next few months. Until such legislation
is passed, however, OPM has no authority to establish those provisions by regulation.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We expect that the forthcoming legislative proposal would also allow agencies to determine the maximum duration
of temporary appointments, subject to collective bargaining or consensus building procedures. In the meantime,
however, we believe that stricter service limits are needed to ensure that employees who serve for extended periods
are not denied benefits because of their temporary status. We note that the report of the National Performance Review
recommended that temporary employees should serve no more than 2 years (24 months) without benefits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Effect on Current Employees
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters feared that tightening limits on temporary service could hurt, not help, employees, especially
those who have limited skills, whose conversion to permanent or term appointments would be blocked by candidates
on an agency's reemployment list, or who work in locations where there are few employment opportunities. We share
this concern. We recognize that some employees may be terminated under the new limits. On balance, however, we believe
that a greater number would be hurt if we withdrew these regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Employees serving under temporary appointments_even those who have been reappointed or extended many times_have
no guarantee of continued employment. Contacts with agencies and employees indicate that some installations are
not renewing temporary appointments as readily as in the past because of reduced funding. Installations facing severe
budget cuts or downsizing are likely to reduce their temporary workforce even without changes in regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In installations that do not face such severe difficulties, use of term appointments, which afford benefits, to fill
longer-lasting nonpermanent jobs would provide more stability for both the agency and the employees. Some agencies
expressed concern about losing their investment in training if employees had to be terminated after 2 years (24 months
total service). Use of term appointments should reduce turnover and its attendant recruiting and training costs,
partially offsetting the cost of providing benefits for the employees.

Converting Current Employees to Term Appointments Outside the Register
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To facilitate transition from temporary to term appointments, agencies are authorized to give their current competitive
service temporary employees term appointments outside the register in accordance with the following conditions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Duration of Authority
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This authority is effective 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
immediately upon publication 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
of these regulations and will remain in effect for 6 months. (Please note that this is different from the effective
date of the regulations.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Eligibility
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This authority applies to any employee who is serving in the agency under a temporary appointment in the competitive
service on the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
publication 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
date and whose service is needed for more than 1 additional year. Several agencies expressed concern that some positions
now filled by temporary appointments would not meet the conditions for term appointment. As long as the positions
will last for more than 1 year, that is not true. OPM's current instructions permit term appointments to be used in the
same situations as temporary appointments. The only difference is the service limit. (Those instructions, provisionally
retained in the Federal Personnel Manual Sunset Document, will be incorporated in 5 CFR part 316 in a separate regulation
implementing FPM sunset.)

Procedures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Appointments under this authority are subject to the procedures set out in 5 CFR part 333, except for the public notice
requirement in &sect;333.102. (Public notice is required by law only when jobs will be filled from outside the Federal
Government.) An agency that will not convert all eligible temporaries holding identical jobs in the same location
must apply veterans' preference in accordance with part 333 in selecting the employees to receive term appointment.

Position to Which Converted
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Employees converted under this authority must be given term appointments to positions in the same series, grade,
and location as their temporary positions. Thereafter, they may be reassigned or promoted to other term positions
in accordance with their agency's merit promotion policies. The appointments may be made for any period of more than
1 but no more than 4 years, depending on the agency's need for the employee's services.

Impact of Downsizing and Need for Flexibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters expressed concern that imposing more restrictive limits now could inhibit agencies' ability
to deal with significant budget reductions and downsizing. They suggested either that authority to extend temporary
appointments beyond 2 years be delegated to agencies or that OPM consider mission needs and downsizing when acting
on extension requests. One commenter also asked whether agencies would have to request each extension separately.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the regulations, OPM may approve extensions beyond 2 years (24 months total service) in response to major reorganization,
downsizing, or other unusual circumstances. While normal workload fluctuations would not meet this condition,
an unusual degree of fluctuation resulting from governmentwide staffing changes and resource reductions may justify
extensions. We will entertain requests on that basis and consider each agency's situation on its merits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requests based on agencywide restructuring downsizing would be submitted by the agency's headquarters, specifying
the conditions, locations, and timeframe for the extensions. OPM approval would cover all extensions meeting the
agreed upon conditions during the authorized time period so there would be no need for individual requests. Agencies
would submit individual extension requests to the appropriate OPM service center to meet one-time needs (e.g., to
complete construction work delayed by unusually severe weather).

Tracking and Documentation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several agencies stated that their personnel record systems might not provide specific information needed to administer
the new requirements (particularly the prohibition against making a new temporary appointment to a position that
had been filled by temporary appointment for an aggregate of 2 years, or 24 months, of the preceding 3 years). They stated
that their systems may not clearly identify ``same or successor'' positions as defined in the regulations. One agency
suggested that the supervisory certification required by the regulations be accepted as documentation that time
limits are met. Another agency suggested dropping the certification requirement in line with the NPR recommendation
to reduce unproductive paperwork. Some agencies asked how the limits would apply when an agency has several identical
jobs in the same commuting area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We have adopted the suggestion to use the supervisory certification to document compliance with time limits. This
suggestion is consistent with the NPR recommendation to make managers and supervisors accountable for personnel
actions. It is also practical a personnel officer or higher level official may not have enough information to determine
compliance. The supervisor or manager filling a job knows, or should know, whether it has previously been filled temporarily
and whether its duties are substantially the same as a previous temporary position. The supervisory certification
is not unproductive paperwork, but is an alternative to more burdensome tracking requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the regulations the time limits apply to positions within the same local commuting area and major subdivision
of the agency. We believe each agency can and should identify its own major subdivisions. Often, we expect that these
will coincide with the competitive areas established by the agency for RIF. However, in applying these regulations,
an agency may use any objective criteria that clearly distinguish separate functional areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When an agency has identical positions within a major subdivision and commuting area, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
successive 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
temporary appointments to those positions would be subject to the 2-year (24 month) aggregate limitation. However,
the limit would be calculated separately for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
simultaneous 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
temporary appointments to the positions. The difference is that recurring needs could potentially be met through
permanent or term appointments with a less-than-full-time work schedule. Purely temporary needs_regardless of
the number of jobs involved_could not. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seasonal Positions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal to permit unlimited extensions of temporary appointments to jobs involving less than 6 months (1,040
hours) of seasonal or intermittent work a year raised some practical concerns among managers and employees in agencies
with substantial seasonal or intermittent hiring. They believe that managers should not be forced to terminate experienced
employees who work more than 6 months in a season to meet emergency or uncontrollable workload demands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When employees are regularly needed for 6 months or more in a year, the seasonal jobs are not truly temporary and should
be filled by term or permanent appointments. However, we agree that flexibility is needed when an employee who normally
works less than 6 months a year exceeds the limit in a single season. Therefore, the final regulations provide that
OPM may approve exceptions to the 6-month limit. We expect that most such exceptions will be requested on a case-by-case
basis from the appropriate OPM service center. However, we would consider requests to use an alternative method of
calculation (e.g., averaging service over several seasons) if an agency demonstrates that its system and its tracking
capacity will produce long-term compliance with the regulation. Requests for approval of alternate methods should
be submitted through the agency's headquarters.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some comments also noted the need to train employees for seasonal work during the off-season. To accommodate this
need, the regulations provide an exception to the 6-month limit for up to 120 days of training following initial appointment
and up to 2 weeks a year thereafter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We did not adopt suggestions to exclude all excepted appointments from the regulatory time limits. The conditions
justifying exception from competitive hiring procedures do not always dictate that appointments be limited to 1
year. In fact, the situation most commonly cited as requiring employment longer than 2 years (24 months) was for research
projects. Most excepted authorities covering research positions provide for appointments in increments longer
than 1 year. Such appointments are not covered by these regulations.

Continuing Authority for Appointments Outside the Competitive Examining Process
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As several commenters noted, the authority to make temporary appointments for most positions using applicant supply
file procedures is currently set out only in Chapter 316 of the Federal Personnel Manual. That chapter will be terminated
on December 31, 1994, as part of FPM sunset. We are incorporating the authority in the revised regulations. We are also
adopting an agency's suggestion to remove all grade level limitations. (The current authority does not apply to positions
at GS&hyph;13 through GS&hyph;15.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We did not adopt suggestions to authorize term appointments outside the register or to permit temporary appointments
to be converted to term appointments without further competition whenever the need for an employee's services exceeds
original expectations. These suggestions are outside the scope of our regulatory proposal. OPM service centers
may, however, continue to authorize term appointments outside registers when there are insufficient eligibles
on an appropriate register. Agencies that have delegated examining authority may also elect to fill temporary and/or
term positions through those registers. If the same register is used for both temporary and term appointments, applicants
who would have been within reach for term appointments may be converted without further competition. We have clarified
this provision in the regulations. This provision will not apply when positions are publicized and applications
are solicited solely for temporary appointment.

Reemployed Annuitants
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We have not incorporated in the regulations the authority, now contained in provisionally retained FPM Chapter 316,
for unlimited extensions of temporary employment of reemployed annuitants. That authority is no longer needed.
When the FPM provision was established, certain annuitants (e.g., those over age 70) could be employed only on a temporary
basis. That is no longer true. Annuitants may now be employed under any type of authority_permanent, term, or temporary_that
is appropriate for the job being filled. However, under 5 U.S.C. 3323, reemployed annuitants serve at the will of the
agency. Therefore, agencies need not designate their appointments as temporary in order to retain flexibility.

authority, an agency may make Schedule A, B, or C appointments on either a permanent or nonpermanent basis, with any
appropriate work schedule (i.e., full-time, part-time, seasonal, on-call, or intermittent).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) When OPM establishes eligibility requirements (e.g., residence, family income) for appointment under particular
Schedule A or B exceptions, an individual's eligibility for appointment must be determined before appointment and
without regard to any conditions that will result from the appointment.

&sect;213.104
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Special provisions for temporary, intermittent, or seasonal appointments in Schedule A, B, or C.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) When OPM specifies that appointments under a particular Schedule A, B, or C authority must be temporary, intermittent,
or seasonal, or when agencies elect to make temporary, intermittent, or seasonal appointments in Schedule A, B, or
C, those terms have the following meanings:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Temporary appointments,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 unless otherwise specified in a particular Schedule A, B, or C exception, are made for a specified period not to exceed
1 year and are subject to the time limits in paragraph (b) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Intermittent positions
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 are positions in which work recurs at sporadic or irregular intervals so that an employee's tour of duty cannot be scheduled
in advance of the administrative workweek.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Seasonal positions
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 involve annually recurring periods of employment lasting less than 12 months each year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Temporary appointments, as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, are subject to the following limits:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Service limits.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Agencies may make temporary appointments for a period not to exceed 1 year, unless the applicable Schedule A, B, or
C authority specifies a shorter period. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, agencies may extend
temporary appointments for no more than 1 additional year (24 months of total service). Appointment to a successor
position (i.e., a position that replaces and absorbs the original position) is considered to be an extension of the
original appointment. Appointment to a position involving the same basic duties, in the same major subdivision of
the agency, and in the same local commuting area is also considered to be an extension of the original appointment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Restrictions on refilling positions under temporary appointments.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, an agency may not fill any position (or its successor) by a temporary
appointment in Schedule A, B, or C if that position had previously been filled by temporary appointment(s) in either
the competitive or excepted service for an aggregate of 2 years, or 24 months, within the preceding 3-year period.
This limitation does not apply to programs established to provide for systematic exchange between a Federal agency
and nonfederal organizations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Exceptions to the general limits.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The service limits and restrictions on refilling positions set out in this section do not apply when:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Positions involve intermittent or seasonal work, and employment in the same or a successor position under one
or more appointing authorities totals less than 6 months (1,040 hours), excluding overtime, in a service year. The
service year is the calendar year that begins on the date of the employee's initial appointment in the agency. Should
employment in a position filled under this exception total 6 months or more in any service year, the general limits
set out in this section will apply to subsequent extension or reappointment unless OPM approves continued exception
under this section. An individual may be employed for training for up to 120 days following initial appointment and
up to 2 weeks a year thereafter without regard to the service year limitation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Positions are filled under an authority established for the purpose of enabling the appointees to continue or
enhance their education, or to meet academic or professional qualification requirements. Such authorities include
those set out in paragraphs (p), (q), (v), (w), and (jj) of section 213.3102 of this part and authorities granted to
individual agencies for use in connection with internship, fellowship, residency, or student programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) OPM approves extension of specific temporary appointments beyond 2 years (24 months total service) when necessitated
by major reorganizations or base closings or other rare and unusual circumstances. Requests based on major reorganization,
base closing, restructuring, or other unusual circumstances that apply agencywide must be made by an official at
the headquarters level of the Department or agency. Requests involving extension of appointments to a specific position
or project based on other unusual circumstances may be submitted by the employing office to the appropriate OPM service
center.

 We are amending the list of generally infested areas under the gypsy moth quarantine and regulations by removing and
adding areas in Ohio and Virginia. These changes affect 7 areas in Ohio and 5 areas in Virginia. These actions are necessary
in order to impose certain restrictions on the interstate movement of regulated articles to prevent the artificial
spread of gypsy moth and delete unnecessary restrictions on the interstate movement of regulated articles.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The gypsy moth, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lymantria dispar
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Linnaeus), is a destructive pest of forest trees. The gypsy moth regulations (contained in 7 CFR 301.45 through 301.45&hyph;12,
and referred to below as the regulations), quarantine certain States because of the gypsy moth, and restrict the interstate
movement of certain articles from generally infested areas in the quarantined States to prevent the artificial spread
of the gypsy moth. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with &sect;301.45&hyph;2 of the regulations, generally infested areas are, with certain exceptions,
those areas in which a gypsy moth general infestation has been found by an inspector, or each portion of a State which
the Administrator deems necessary to regulate because of its proximity to infestation or its inseparability for
quarantine enforcement purposes from infested localities. Less than an entire State will be designated as a generally
infested area only if: (1) The State has adopted and is enforcing a quarantine or regulation which imposes restrictions
on the intrastate movement of the regulated articles which are substantially the same as those which are imposed with
respect to the interstate movement of such articles; and, (2) the designation of less than the entire State as a generally
infested area will be adequate to prevent the artificial interstate spread of infestations of the gypsy moth. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Designation of Areas as Generally Infested Areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We are amending &sect;301.45&hyph;3(a) of the regulations, which lists generally infested areas, by adding Carroll,
Cuyahoga, Jefferson, Lucas, Portage, Stark, and Summit Counties in Ohio, and Bath, Greensville and Highland Counties
and the city of Emporia in Virginia to the list of generally infested areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are taking this action because surveys conducted by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) resulted
in the detection of all life stages of the gypsy moth and the determination that reproducing populations do exist at
significant levels in these areas. Eradication of these populations is not considered feasible because these areas
are immediately adjacent to areas currently recognized to be generally infested and therefore subject to continued
reinfestation.

Removal of Areas From List of Generally Infested Areas

We are also amending &sect;301.45&hyph;3(a) by removing Franklin County in Virginia from the list of generally infested
areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are taking this action because Franklin County was previously listed in error. There is no basis for listing this
area as a generally infested area. This action removes unnecessary restrictions on the interstate movement of regulated
articles from this area. A map designating the regulated areas is as follows:

Emergency Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that an emergency exists that
warrants publication of this interim rule without prior opportunity for public comment. Immediate action is necessary
because of the possibility that the gypsy moth could be spread artificially to noninfested areas of the United States,
where it could cause economic loss due to defoliation of susceptible forest areas. Also, where gypsy moth no longer
occurs, immediate action is needed to delete unnecessary restrictions on the interstate movement of regulated articles.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This interim rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. For this action, the Office of Management and Budget
has waived its review process required by Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action affects the interstate movement of regulated articles and outdoor household articles from and through
gypsy moth regulated areas in Ohio and Virginia. There are several types of restrictions that will apply to the newly-listed
areas in these States. These restrictions will have their primary impact on persons moving households, nursery stock,
logs and wood chips, and mobile homes out of a generally infested area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Individual and commercial movers moving outdoor household articles (OHA) to areas outside the generally infested
area must attach to the articles either a certificate issued by an inspector, or an OHA document issued by the owner
of the articles. Most individual homeowners moving their own articles who comply with the regulations choose to self-inspect
and issue an OHA document. This takes a few minutes and involves no monetary cost. Individuals may also have State certified
pesticide applicators, trained by the State or USDA, inspect and issue certificates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Persons moving regulated articles from a generally infested area (significant examples include logs, pulpwood
and wood chips; mobile homes; and nursery stock) must obtain a certificate or limited permit to move the articles.
There is one exception to this requirement, for logs, pulpwood and wood chips. This exception allows the person moving
such articles to self-certify on the waybill that he or she has inspected the articles. This exception minimizes costs
with regard to logs, pulpwood, and wood chips. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Persons moving mobile homes and nursery stock must obtain a certificate or limited permit. They may obtain one from
an inspector, or a qualified certified applicator. Inspectors will issue these documents at no charge, but costs
may result from delaying the movement of commercial articles while waiting for the inspection. Documents self-issued
under a compliance agreement avoid this delay costs, but result in costs associated with salary and recordkeeping
for the self-inspections.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When inspection of regulated articles or outdoor household articles reveals gypsy moth, treatment is often necessary.
Treatment is done by qualified certified applicators, which are private businesses that charge, on the average,
$50 to $100 to treat a shipment of articles. Most qualified certified applicators are small businesses. By declaring
an area as a generally infested area, the regulations may increase business for the qualified certified applicator
located in generally infested areas. It is estimated that these businesses will average $50 to $150 per month in additional
income per business. Since the seven counties in Ohio to be regulated contain the metropolitan areas of Akron, Cleveland,
and Toledo, we expect that several hundred shipments containing outdoor household articles will require inspection
to move out of the generally infested area. We anticipate training up to 24 qualified certified applicators to perform
these inspections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The majority of direct costs from this rule would be incurred by establishments moving trees or shrubs with roots,
such as nurseries. We estimate that approximately 130 such establishments move approximately 1,050 shipments of
trees and shrubs each year to areas outside the generally infested areas. All of these establishments are believed
to be small entities. These establishments would need to be inspected, either by an inspector or through self-inspection
under a compliance agreement. If the inspection reveals signs of gypsy moth, the establishment would have to be treated
in order to ship regulated articles outside the generally infested area. We estimate that annually, approximately
10 percent of these establishments (13 establishments) will be required to treat the establishment, and that the
average area to be treated will be 17 acres. At an average treatment cost of $10 per acre, the average total annual cost
to each establishment would be $170. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Christmas tree industry would also be impacted by this rule change, since Christmas trees moved interstate from
generally infested areas to areas not generally infested would have to be moved under a certificate or permit. We estimate
that there are about 5 Christmas tree producers in the generally infested areas who ship approximately 100 trees each
year to nonregulated areas. All of these establishments are believed to be small entities. Services of an inspector
will be available without charge to inspect the premises and issue certificates and permits. We estimate that 10 percent
of these premises will be found to contain gypsy moth, and will require treatment in order to ship trees. The average
area to be treated is estimated to be 80 acres, and treatment costs are estimated to average $10 per acre. Therefore,
we estimate that the total annual treatment costs for one Christmas tree producer would be approximately $800. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is expected that, in most cases, Christmas tree growers would meet the requirements for certification by having
inspectors determine that the plantations where the trees are grown are free from gypsy moth. This alternative would
be less costly than inspecting or treating individual shipments of trees and would minimize the economic impact of
the change to the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule finalizes without change two interim final rules which revised the handling requirements for California
nectarines and peaches by expanding the regulatory periods and by modifying the grade, maturity, size, container,
and pack requirements for fresh shipments of these fruits, beginning with 1994 season shipments. This finalization
will enable handlers to continue shipping fresh nectarines and peaches meeting consumer needs in the interest of
producers, handlers, and consumers of these fruits.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Marketing Order Nos. 916 and 917 [7 CFR Parts 916 and 917] regulating
the handling of nectarines and peaches grown in California, hereinafter referred to as the orders. The orders are
effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674], hereinafter
referred to as the Act.

The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have retroactive
effect. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable
conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. The purpose of the RFA
is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not
be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder,
are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf.
Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are about 300 California nectarine and peach handlers subject to regulation under the orders covering nectarines
and peaches grown in California, and about 1,800 producers of these fruits in California. Small agricultural producers
have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than
$500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000.

The Nectarine Administrative Committee (NAC) recommended revision of the handling requirements for California
nectarines, and the Peach Commodity Committee (PCC) recommended revision of the handling requirements for California
peaches. These committees meet prior to and during each season to review the rules and regulations effective on a continuous
basis for California nectarines and peaches under the orders. These committee meetings are open to the public, and
interested persons may express their views at these meetings. The Department reviews committee recommendations
and information, as well as information from other sources, and determines whether modification, suspension, or
termination of the rules and regulations would tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule finalizes two interim final rules that revised the handling requirements for nectarines in &sect;916.350
California Nectarine Container and Pack Regulation [7 CFR 916.350], and in &sect;916.365 California Nectarine
Grade and Size Regulation [7 CFR 916.365], and for peaches in &sect;917.442 California Peach Container and Pack Regulation
[7 CFR 917.442] and in &sect;917.459 California Peach Grade and Size Regulation [7 CFR 917.459]. The first interim
final rule was issued on March 29, 1994, and published in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 [59 FR 15835, April 5, 1994], and the second interim final rule was issued on June 9, 1994, and published in the

 [59 FR 31118, June 17, 1994]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first interim final rule provided a 30-day comment period ending May 5, 1994, and two comments were received. The
first comment received was from John Kovacevich, Jr., a California peach grower and shipper, requesting a change
in the peach grade requirements to permit handlers to ship peaches with additional amounts of open sutures. The change
requested by this commentor was included in the first interim final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second comment received was from Harold McClarty of The HMC Group of Kingsburg, California, supporting the weight-count
revisions made in the handling requirements for fresh nectarines and peaches by the first interim final rule, since
such revisions will be beneficial when they packed fruit in volume-filled containers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second interim final rule provided a 30-day comment period ending July 18, 1994, and one comment was received.
The comment was received from Gary W. Van Sickle, Field Director for the PCC and the NAC, reaffirming the PCC's and the
NAC's support of the revised pack requirements contained in the second interim final rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The first interim final rule amended paragraph (a) in &sect;916.350 and paragraph (a) in &sect;916.356 to change
the regulatory periods in each of these sections to April 1 through October 31 each year, so that all nectarine shipments
made each season are covered by these regulatory requirements. Correspondingly, paragraph (a)(7) of &sect;916.356
was revised to change the beginning date of the regulatory requirements to April 1 from April 15 each year. Handlers
ship fresh nectarines during the April 1&hyph;April 15 period when the harvest season begins early. The NAC unanimously
recommended this change. Prior to amendment, &sect;&sect;916.350 and 916.356 were effective for the period April
15 through October 31 each year.

Container and Pack Requirements (Nectarines) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 916.350 specifies container and pack requirements for fresh nectarine shipments. Paragraph (a)(4)(iv)
of &sect;916.350 specifies the tray-pack size designations which must be marked on loose-filled or tight-filled
containers, depending on the size of the fruit. The size designations specify the maximum number of nectarines in
a 16-pound sample for each tray-pack size designation. The first interim final rule revised paragraph (a)(4)(iv)
of &sect;916.350 by modifying Table I to specify weight-count standards for early-season and mid-season nectarine
varieties, and by adding a new Table 2 to specify weight-count standards for late-season nectarine varieties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NAC recommended these revised container marking requirements for nectarines after a comprehensive review of
the appropriate size pack-count relationships between the tray-pack containers and loose-filled or tight-filled
containers for all nectarine varieties. The revised provisions more precisely reflect the characteristics of different
varieties of fruit during the course of the season. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first interim final rule also revised &sect;916.350 by adding a proviso to paragraph (a)(4)(iv), and revises
&sect;916.356 by redesignating current paragraph (b) as (c) and adding a new paragraph (b) to that section. These
revisions specify the procedure to be used in determining whether nectarines meet the minimum size requirements
specified for each size category in this section when applying the 16-pound sample requirements. Under this procedure,
a sample consisting of one-half of the number of fruit specified for a 16-pound sample for a particular size category
shall be used, provided such sample weighs at least 8 pounds. When one-half the specified number of fruit in a sample
results in a number ending with one-half a fruit, the smaller full number of fruit is used to determine the sample weight.
If a sample fails with respect to minimum size requirements on the basis of an 8-pound sample, a full 16-pound sample
must be used to determine if the fruit meets minimum size requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NAC recommended this sampling procedure change after determining that the size of nectarines could be adequately
determined by using an 8-pound sample in most instances, and finding that application of this procedure would reduce
inspection time and inspection costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second interim final rule further revised &sect;916.350 by adding a new proviso to paragraph (a)(1) specifying
that the nectarines in any volume-filled container need only be filled to within one inch of the top of the container.
The second interim final rule also removed the proviso in paragraph (a)(1) of &sect;916.350 reading ``That nectarines
in any container shall be fairly uniform in size'', because such requirements are included within the definition
of ``standard pack'' in the United States Standards for Grades of Nectarines, and therefore are not needed in this
paragraph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NAC recommended these revised pack requirements for fresh nectarines in volume-filled containers after a comprehensive
review of changes in the nectarine industry packing practices over the years, and the need to make appropriate changes
in the pack requirements to reduce bruising of the fruit due to excessively tight packs. The revision provided handlers
with more flexibility in packing their nectarines and selecting the appropriate size container for certain volume-filled
packs to help prevent fruit bruising.

Maturity Requirements (Nectarines) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 916.356 specifies maturity guides for fresh nectarines in paragraph (a)(1)(i), including Table I, for fruit
being inspected and certified as meeting the maturity requirements for ``well matured'' fruit. Such maturity guides
(e.g., color chips) are specified in Table I of &sect;916.356 for nectarines. The first interim final rule revised
Table I of paragraph (a)(1)(i) of &sect;916.356 for nectarines to add maturity guides for 18 nectarine varieties
and to change the maturity guide for two nectarine varieties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NAC recommended these maturity guide changes for these nectarine varieties based on a continuing review of their
individual maturity characteristics, and the identification of the appropriate color chip corresponding to the
``well matured'' level of maturity for such varieties.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 916.356 specifies size requirements for fresh nectarines in paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(9). The first
interim final rule revised &sect;916.356 to establish variety-specific size requirements for seven nectarine
varieties that were produced in commercially significant quantities of more than 10,000 packages for the first time
during the 1993 season. Paragraph (a)(3) was revised to include the May Kist variety; and paragraph (a)(6) of &sect;916.356
was revised to include the Arctic Rose, Del Rio Rey, Kay Diamond, Late Red Jim, Prima Diamond, and Red Glen varieties.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first interim final rule also revised &sect;916.356 to remove five nectarine varieties from the variety-specific
size requirements specified in the section, because less than 5,000 packages of each of these varieties were produced
during the 1993 season. Paragraph (a)(4) of that section was revised to remove the Apache and Early May Grande nectarine
varieties; and paragraph (a)(6) was revised to remove the Nectarine 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
4, Tasty Free, and 9&hyph;86&hyph;04&hyph;87 nectarine varieties. The nectarine varieties removed from the nectarine
variety-specific list became subject to the non-listed variety size requirements specified in paragraphs (a)(7),
(a)(8), and (a)(9) of &sect;916.356. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first interim final rule also lowered the minimum size requirement for the Zee Grand variety by permitting as many
as 88 nectarines to be packed in a lug box rather than 84 nectarines, and as many as 83 nectarines when packed otherwise
rather than 75 nectarines. This was accomplished by reassigning that variety to paragraph (a)(4) from paragraph
(a)(5) in &sect;916.356. The NAC recommended this change based on a more accurate evaluation of this variety's sizing
and maturity characteristics. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, in &sect;916.356, paragraphs (a)(6)(i) and (a)(9)(i) were revised to permit as many as 84 nectarines to
be packed in a No. 22D standard lug box if they are ``well matured'', and paragraphs (a)(6)(ii) and (a)(9)(ii) were
revised to permit as many as 75 nectarines in a 16-pound sample if they are ``well matured''. These changes permit late-season
nectarine varieties to be shipped to the fresh market at a slightly smaller size than in past seasons, if they meet the
higher ``well matured'' maturity standard. The higher maturity standard is important for such smaller size fruit,
because it will assure that the smaller fruit is of acceptable maturity and quality to be shipped to the fresh market
in the interest of growers, handlers, and consumers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the first interim final rule changed the minimum size requirements for several varieties of nectarines
packed in loose-filled and tight-filled containers by revising the count-size for nectarines specified in paragraphs
(a)(2)(ii), (a)(3)(ii), (a)(4)(ii), (a)(5)(ii), (a)(7)(ii), and (a)(8)(ii). These size changes correspond to
the weight-count changes made in column 2 of both Table I for early-season and mid-season nectarine varieties, and
Table 2 for late-season nectarine varieties cited in paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of &sect;916.350. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NAC recommended these changes in the minimum size requirements based on a continuing review of the sizing and maturity
relationships for these nectarine varieties, and consumer acceptance levels for various sizes of fruit. The first
interim final rule was designed to establish minimum size requirements for fresh nectarines consistent with expected
crop and market conditions.

Container and Pack Requirements (Peaches) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 917.442 currently specifies container and pack requirements for fresh peach shipments. Paragraph (a)(4)(iv)
of &sect;917.442 specifies the tray-pack size designations which must be marked on loose-filled or tight-filled
containers, depending on the size of the fruit. The size designations specify the maximum number of peaches in a 16-pound
sample for each tray pack size designation. The first interim final rule revised paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;917.442 by modifying Table I to specify weight-count standards for early-season and mid-season peach varieties,
and by adding a new Table 2 to specify weight-count standards for late-season peach varieties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;917.459 by redesignating current paragraph (d) as (e) and by adding a new paragraph (d) to that section. These
revisions specify the procedure to be used in determining whether peaches meet the minimum size requirements specified
for each size category in this section when applying the 16-pound sample requirement. Under this procedure a sample
consisting of one-half of the number of fruit specified for a 16-pound sample for a particular size category shall
be used, provided such sample weighs at least 8 pounds. When one-half the specified number of fruit in a sample results
in a number ending with one-half a fruit, the smaller full number of fruit is used to determine the sample weight. If
a sample fails with respect to minimum size requirements on the basis of an 8-pound sample, a full 16-pound sample must
be used to determine if the fruit meets the minimum size requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PCC recommended this sampling procedure change after determining that the size of peaches could be adequately

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second interim final rule further revised &sect;917.442 by adding a new proviso to paragraph (a)(1) specifying
that the peaches in any volume-filled container need only be filled to within one inch of the top of the container. The
PCC recommended these revised pack requirements for fresh peaches in volume-filled containers after a comprehensive

Grade Requirements (Peaches) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 917.459 specifies grade requirements for peaches in paragraph (a)(1), requiring peaches shipped fresh
to meet the requirements of the U.S. No. 1 grade. The first interim final rule revised paragraph (a)(1) of &sect;917.459
to provide an additional 25 percent tolerance for fruit damaged by open sutures, but not seriously damaged, in addition
to the 10 percent general lot tolerance currently permitted under the U.S. No. 1 grade. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PCC recommended this change to permit handlers to ship peaches with additional amounts of open sutures. Open sutures
are not considered to be a serious grade defect since they affect only the appearance of the fruit. The open suture condition
occurs infrequently in peaches and is most likely due to unusual weather and climatic conditions. However, this condition
can cause considerable economic loss to growers when it does occur, because it sometimes affects a large portion of
their crop.

Section 917.459 specifies maturity guides for fresh peaches in paragraph (a)(1)(i), including Table I, for fruit
being inspected and certified as meeting the maturity requirements for ``well matured'' fruit. Such maturity guides
(e.g., color chips) are specified in Table I of &sect;917.459 for peaches. The first interim final rule revised Table
I of paragraph (a)(1)(i) of &sect;917.459 for peaches to add maturity guides for 19 peach varieties and to change the
maturity guide for one peach variety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PCC recommended these maturity guide changes for these peach varieties based on a continuing review of their individual

Size Requirements (Peaches) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 917.459 specifies size requirements for fresh peaches in paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(6), and paragraphs
(b) and (c). The first interim final rule revised &sect;917.459 by redesignating current paragraph (a)(6) as paragraph
(a)(3) and current paragraphs (a)(3), (a)(4), and (a)(5) as paragraphs (a)(4), (a)(5), and (a)(6), respectively,
so that the size regulations are in sequential order. The first interim final rule also revised &sect;917.459 to establish
variety-specific size requirements for five peach varieties that were produced in commercially significant quantities
of more than 10,000 packages for the first time during the 1993 season. In &sect;917.459 redesignated paragraph (a)(5)
was revised to include the Crimson Lady and Rich May peach varieties; and redesignated paragraph (a)(6) was revised
to include the Fancy Lady, Snow Ball, and Sugar Lady peach varieties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first interim final rule also revised &sect;917.459 to remove four peach varieties from the variety-specific
size requirements specified in that section, because less than 5,000 packages of each of these varieties were produced
during the 1993 season. In &sect;917.459 redesignated paragraph (a)(5) of &sect;917.459 was revised to remove the
Flavor Red peach variety; and redesignated paragraph (a)(6) was revised to remove the July Lady, Red Cal, and Redglobe
peach varieties. The peach varieties removed from the variety-specific list became subject to the non-listed variety
size requirements specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of &sect;917.459. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first interim final rule also amended &sect;917.459 by revising paragraph (b) to change the ending date of the
regulatory requirements for the non-listed peach varieties referred to in that paragraph to June 30 from July 2, and
paragraph (c) to change the beginning date of the regulatory requirements for the non-listed peach varieties referred
to in that paragraph to July 1 from July 3. These changes reflect the sizing characteristics of such peach varieties.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, in &sect;917.459 redesignated paragraph (a)(6)(i) was revised to permit as many as 80 peaches to packed
in a No. 22D standard lug box if they are ``well matured'', and redesignated paragraph (a)(6)(iii) was revised to permit
as many as 73 peaches in a 16-pound sample if they are ``well matured''. These changes permit certain late-season peach
varieties to be shipped to the fresh market at a slightly smaller size than in past seasons, if they meet the higher ``well
matured'' maturity standard. The higher maturity standard is important for such smaller size fruit, because it will
assure that the smaller fruit is of acceptable maturity and quality to be shipped to the fresh market in the interest
of growers, handlers, and consumers.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the first interim final rule changed the minimum size requirements for several varieties of peaches
packed in loose-filled and tight-filled containers by revising the count-size for peaches specified in paragraphs
(a)(3)(iii), (a)(4)(iii), and (a)(5)(iii). These size changes correspond to the weight-count changes made in column
2 of both Table I for early-season and mid-season peach varieties, and Table 2 for late-season peach varieties cited
in paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of &sect;917.442. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PCC recommended these changes in the minimum size requirements based on a continuing review of the sizing and maturity
relationships for these peach varieties, and the consumer acceptance levels for various sizes of fruit. The first
interim final rule was designed to establish minimum size requirements for fresh peaches consistent with expected
crop and market conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule reflects the committees' and the Department's appraisal of the need to finalize the revised handling requirements
for California nectarines and peaches, as specified. The Department's determination is that this rule will have
a beneficial impact on producers, handlers, and consumers of California nectarines and peaches. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule finalizes the revised handling requirements for fresh California nectarines and peaches consistent with
expected crop and market conditions, and will help ensure that all shipments of these fruits made each season will
continue to meet acceptable handling requirements established under each of these orders. This rule will also help
the California nectarine and peach industries continue to provide fruit desired by consumers. This rule is designed
to maintain orderly marketing conditions for these fruits in the interest of producers, handlers, and consumers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities.

 The Department of Agriculture (Department) is adopting as a final rule, without change, the provisions of an interim
final rule changing the rules and regulations under the cranberry marketing order. The marketing order regulates
the handling of cranberries grown in 10 States and is administered locally by the Cranberry Marketing Committee (Committee).
This rule revises or deletes language in the order's rules and regulations to reflect amendatory changes to the marketing
order completed in 1992. This rule makes the order's rules and regulations consistent with the current marketing
order language.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 929 [7 CFR Part 929], as amended, regulating the handling
of cranberries grown in 10 States, hereinafter referred to as the ``order.'' The order is effective under the Agricultural
Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C 601&hyph;674], hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have retroactive
effect. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable
conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 30 handlers of cranberries who are subject to regulation under the order and approximately
1,050 producers of cranberries in the regulated area. Small agricultural service firms have been defined by the Small
Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $5,000,000, and small agricultural
producers are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $500,000. The majority of handlers and producers
of cranberries may be classified as small entities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule finalizes revisions or deletions to the language in the order's rules and regulations to reflect amendatory
changes to the order completed in 1992. This rule makes the order's rules and regulations consistent with current
order language. These changes were unanimously recommended by the Cranberry Marketing Committee (Committee) at
its March 1, 1994, meeting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim final rule was issued on July 11, 1994, and published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 [59 FR 36021, July 15, 1994], with an effective date of July 15, 1994. That rule amended &sect;&sect;929.107, 929.108,
929.110, 929.148, 929.150, and 929.153 of the rules and regulations in effect under the order. That rule provided
a 30-day comment period which ended August 15, 1994. No comments were received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1992, the cranberry marketing order was amended [57 FR 38748, August 27, 1992] to change, among other provisions,
the volume control features of the order. Prior to the amendment, the order authorized a base quantity program in which
each producer received a base quantity calculated by the Committee from a representative period in the order. Base
quantity was annually distributed to existing producers and new producers based on a formula in the order. The 1992
order amendments authorized a volume control program to be based on the sales history of each producer. The Committee
now calculates a sales history for each producer based on the average of sales for a specified period for each producer
or, in the case of a new producer, sales history is based on a State's average yield per acre. Other order amendments
were made to reflect current industry practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first change revises section 929.107 which currently provides the basis for determining established cranberry
acreage. The section is revised by deleting various terms, dates, and section references. The term ``established''
cranberry acreage and the reference to section 929.16 are no longer applicable since they were removed by the 1992
amendment. The reference to growing cranberries during a specified period of time (i.e., 1965&hyph;66 through 1967&hyph;68)
and other similar date references are removed since producers are no longer required to produce during this period
to have a commercial crop of cranberries. Other modifications are made in the section for clarity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second change deletes section 929.108 which provides for procedures to substantiate a firm and substantial commitment
for use in determining base quantities. This section is no longer applicable since the order amendments authorize
a sales history to be computed for every producer. New or existing producers no longer have to show a firm and substantial
commitment to receive base quantity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third change revises section 929.110 which provides for transfers or sales of cranberry acreage during the representative
period. This section is revised by deleting the term ``representative period.'' This term is no longer applicable
since all reference to a representative period for computing base quantities was removed by the 1992 amendment. Producers
must inform the Committee at any time when transfers or sales of acreage are made. Also, the term ``base quantity''
is deleted and replaced with the term ``sales history.'' Other minor changes are made to the section to make it consistent
with the order amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fourth change deletes section 929.148 which provides factors to be considered when assigning or adjusting base
quantities for producers. This section is no longer applicable since the order amendment authorizes the computation
of a sales history for each producer. These factors are not used when calculating sales history. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fifth change revises section 929.150(a) which provides for the transfer or assignment of base quantities. This
section is revised by deleting the term ``base quantity'' and replacing it with the term ``sales history.'' The term
base quantity is no longer applicable since the order amendment authorizes a sales history to be calculated for each
producer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The last change deletes section 929.153 which provides for the establishment and distribution of a base quantity
reserve. This section is no longer applicable since the 1992 order amendment provides for a volume control program
to be based on sales histories of producers. A producer's sales history is updated annually based on the highest four
out of six years' sales. Therefore, a base quantity reserve is not necessary for updating producers' sales histories
or for allowing entry of new growers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information collection requirements contained in the referenced sections have been previously approved by
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35 and have been assigned OMB number
0581&hyph;0103. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on these considerations, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all relevant material presented, the information and recommendations submitted by the committee,
and other information, it is found that finalizing the interim final rule, without change, as published in the

 This interim final rule authorizes the use of smaller sized olives in the production of limited use styles for California
olives during the 1994&hyph;95 crop year. This action is intended to allow more olives into fresh market channels
and is consistent with current market demand for olives. As required under section 8e of the Agricultural Marketing
Agreement Act of 1937, this action also changes the import regulation so that it conforms with the requirements established
under the California olive marketing order.

 This rule is issued under Marketing Agreement No. 148 and Order No. 932 [7 CFR Part 932], as amended, regulating the
handling of olives grown in California, hereinafter referred to as the order. The order is effective under the Agricultural

This rule is also issued under section 8e of the Act, which requires the Secretary of Agriculture to issue grade, size,
quality, or maturity requirements for certain listed commodities, including olives, imported into the United States
that are the same as, or comparable to, those imposed upon the domestic commodities regulated under the Federal marketing
orders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are 5 handlers of California olives that will be subject to regulation under the order during the current season,
and there are about 1,200 olive producers in California. There are approximately 25 importers of olives subject to
the olive import regulation. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration
[13 CFR &sect;121.601] as those whose annual receipts are less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms,
which include handlers and importers, have been defined by the Small Business Administration as those having annual
receipts of less than $5,000,000. None of the domestic olive handlers may be classified as small entities. The majority
of olive producers and importers may be classified as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nearly all of the olives grown in the United States are produced in California. The growing areas are scattered throughout
California with most of the commercial production coming from inland valleys. The majority of olives are produced
in central California. California olives are primarily used for canned ripe whole and whole pitted olives which are
eaten out of hand as hors d'oeuvres or used as an ingredient in cooking and in salads. The canned ripe olive market is
essentially a domestic market. A few shipments of California olives are exported. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Olive production has fluctuated from a low of 24,200 tons during the 1972&hyph;73 crop year to a high of 163,023 tons
during the 1992&hyph;93 crop year. The California Olive Committee (committee) indicated that 1993&hyph;94 production
totalled about 120,049 tons. Total production for the 1994&hyph;95 crop year is estimated to be 95,000 tons. Because
olive trees need to restore their nutrients from one season to the next, various varieties of olives produced in California
have alternate bearing tendencies. This results in high production one year and low the next, which usually causes
the total crop to vary greatly from year to year. This crop year's estimated production is expected to be smaller than
last year due to weather conditions early in the season which resulted in poor fruit pollination. However, based on
past production and marketing experience, the committee believes that handlers will need smaller sized olives during
the 1994&hyph;95 crop year to meet market demand for limited use styles of canned olives. Limited use olives are too
small to meet the minimum size requirements established for whole and whole pitted canned ripe olives. However, they
are large enough to be suitable for processing into limited use styles such as wedges, halves, slices, or segments.
Absent this action, olives which are smaller than those authorized for whole and whole pitted canning uses would have
to be disposed of by handlers into non-canning uses such as crushing into oil. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a)(3) of &sect;932.52 of the order provides that processed olives smaller than the sizes prescribed for
whole and whole pitted styles may be used for limited uses if recommended by the committee and approved by the Secretary.
Until October 1, 1991, paragraph (a)(3) also prescribed minimum sizes, by variety group, which could be authorized
for use in the production of limited use styles by the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Effective October 1, 1991, certain non-canning size disposition requirements specified in &sect;932.51(a)(3)
and minimum sizes authorized for limited use specified in &sect;932.52(a)(3) of the marketing order were suspended.
The committee may now recommend the use of olives for limited uses that are smaller than those previously permitted
under the order. Minimum size and grade requirements may be recommended annually by the committee and approved by
the Secretary. During the past three crop years, 1991&hyph;92, 1992&hyph;93, and 1993&hyph;94, the committee recommended
sizes smaller than those previously authorized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The minimum sizes which could previously be authorized for limited uses were established in a 1971 amendment to the
marketing order. Olives smaller than the prescribed minimum sizes which could be authorized for limited uses had
to be disposed of through less profitable non-canning uses such as crushing for oil. Returns to producers are lower
on fruit used for such purposes. The use of smaller sized olives for limited use styles has been authorized in all but
two crop years since the order was promulgated in 1965.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action will help growers and handlers to meet the growing market demand for limited use style olives based upon
current conditions. The limited use size requirements allow the use of sizes which would otherwise have to be disposed
of for less profitable, non-canning uses. Permitting the use of such smaller olives for limited use styles would therefore
improve grower returns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 13, 1994, the committee recommended by a vote of 15&hyph;1, to establish grade and size regulations for limited
use size olives during the 1994&hyph;95 crop year pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of &sect;932.52 of the order. The one
handler member who dissented was concerned that approval of limited use size olives would be detrimental to handlers,
due to already large inventories of such olives from the two previous seasons. The recommended grade and size requirements
are the same as those established during the 1990&hyph;91 crop year, which means slightly larger minimum sizes than
were in effect during the 1991&hyph;92, 1992&hyph;93, and 1993&hyph;94 crop years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The specified sizes for the different olive variety groups are the minimum sizes which are deemed desirable for use
in the production of limited use styles at this time. As in past years, permitting the use of the smaller olives in the
production of limited use styles allowed handlers to take advantage of the strong market for halved, segmented, sliced,
and chopped canned ripe olives. Handlers will be able to market more olives than would be permitted in the absence of
this relaxation in size requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The committee also based its decision on certain production and market factors. The last three crop years were the
first crop years that limited use olives were authorized at sizes below the 1990&hyph;91 crop year minimum size requirements.
Prior to the 1990&hyph;91 crop year, the committee investigated limited use olives that were below permitted minimum
sizes. From investigations and surveys within the industry, the committee determined that limited use olives below
1990&hyph;91 minimum sizes could be efficiently sliced using current technology. However, consumer interest in
and need for such olives also had to be determined, specifically for smaller sliced olive rings. Thus, minimum size
requirements below the 1990&hyph;91 crop year were recommended and became effective for limited use olives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the following three seasons, the industry experienced a higher percentage of broken pieces in the smaller
olives than with the slightly larger sizes. The U.S. Standards for Grades of Canned Ripe Olives (Standards) define
a broken piece as any piece of olive that is less than three quarters of a full unit. This situation had a negative impact
on the California olive market as the extra broken pieces caused customers to complain about the lack of uniformity
and poorer quality of product from these smaller sizes. Such olives also had to compete with imported sliced olives
that had fewer broken pieces. Therefore, the committee recommended slightly larger minimum size requirements for
limited use olives in order to improve the quality of and enhance the market for California limited use olives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, the committee estimates that production for this crop year is expected to be at 95,000 tons, which is smaller
than the previous two seasons. Weather conditions early in the crop year caused poor pollination resulting in a smaller
crop with an uneven distribution of sizes. The 1992&hyph;93 and 1993&hyph;94 crop years produced large crops of 163,023
tons and 120,049 tons, respectively. During years with large olive crops, the ratio of limited use olives to other
sizes tends to be higher; there are more limited use size olives in proportion to the other sizes. During years with
small olive crops, the ratio of smaller olives to other sizes is smaller; there tends to be fewer limited use size olives
in proportion to the other sizes. The increased availability of limited use sized fruit could be reflected in handler
processing for the last three seasons. For example, during the 1992&hyph;93 crop year, 19 percent of the olives (163,024
tons) processed by handlers were limited use, and during the 1991&hyph;92 crop year, 11 percent of total olives (63,259
tons) processed by handlers were limited use. Although limited use minimum sizes were larger during the 1990&hyph;91
season, limited use olive processed by handlers were 16 percent of total olives (126,879 tons) purchased by handlers.
Thus, unlike the two previous seasons, fewer small limited use olives are expected to be harvested this season. The
percentage of limited use olives is expected to be smaller. The slight increase in minimum limited use size requirements
being established for the 1994&hyph;95 season is therefore not expected to greatly impact available supplies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, it is found that permitting limited use olives as recommended by the committee is expected to improve market
conditions, and grower returns, and meet market needs for limited use style olives.

Section 8(e) of the Act requires that whenever grade, size, quality, or maturity requirements are in effect for olives
under a domestic marketing order, imported olives must meet the same or comparable requirements. This action allows
smaller olives for limited use styles under the marketing order. Therefore, a corresponding change is needed in the
olive import regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Canned ripe olives, and bulk olives for processing into canned ripe olives, imported into the United States must meet
certain minimum grade and size requirements specified in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Olive Regulation 1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 [7 CFR &sect;944.401]. All canned ripe olives are required to be inspected and certified prior to importation (release
from custody of the United States Custom Service), and all bulk olives for processing into canned ripe olives must
be inspected and certified prior to canning. ``Canned ripe olives'' means olives in hermetically sealed containers
and heat sterilized under pressure, of two distinct types, ``ripe'' and ``green-ripe'', as defined in the Standards.
The term does not include Spanish-style green olives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any lot of olives failing to meet the import requirements may be exported, disposed of, or shipped for exempt uses.
Exportation or disposal of such olives would be accomplished under the supervision of the Processed Products Branch
of the Fruit and Vegetable Division, with the costs of certifying the disposal of the olives borne by the importer.
Exempt olives are those imported for processing into oil or donation to charity. Any person may also import up to 100
pounds (drained weight) of canned ripe olives or bulk olives exempt from these grade and size requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interim final rule modifies paragraph (b)(12) of the olive import regulation to authorize the importation of
bulk olives which do not meet the minimum size requirements established for olives for whole and whole pitted uses
to be used in the production of limited use styles during the 1994&hyph;1995 crop year. This rule also establishes
size regulations for such olives in paragraph (b)(12). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The committee recommended to authorize establishment of minimum sizes for use in the production of limited use styles
during the 1994&hyph;95 crop year. The sizes are specified in terms of minimum weights for individual olives in various
variety groups and are the same for both domestic and imported olives. An extra category is continued in the import
regulation to apply comparable requirements for varieties not grown domestically. The minimum sizes for import
requirements are as follows:

Permitting the use of smaller olives in the production of limited use styles will allow importers to take better advantage
of the strong market for halved, segmented, sliced, and chopped canned ripe olives. Importers will be able to import
and market more olives than would be permitted in the absence of this relaxation in size requirements. This additional
opportunity is provided to maximize the use of the available olive supply and facilitate market expansion. In the
absence of this action, the smaller fruit could not be imported for limited uses, and would have to be disposed of through
less profitable, non-canning uses under the supervision of the inspection service, exported, or utilized in exempt
outlets.

 This final rule modifies the time periods when imported onions are regulated based on the grade, size, quality and
maturity requirements of the South Texas onion and Idaho-Eastern Oregon onion marketing orders. This rule also establishes
import requirements for red variety onions based on South Texas requirements. The changes are needed to make the onion
import requirements consistent with changes to the South Texas onion marketing order, as required by section 8e of
the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 (Act).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule is effective under section 8e of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674],
hereinafter referred to as the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have retroactive
effect. This rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable
conflict with this rule. There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. There are approximately 75 importers of onions who
will be affected by this final rule. Small agricultural service firms, which include onion importers, have been defined
by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $5,000,000. The
majority of onion importers may be classified as small entities.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Import regulations issued under the Act are based on regulations established under Federal marketing orders to regulate
domestically produced products. Thus, this final rule has small entity orientation, and impact on both small and
large business entities in a manner comparable to rules issued under marketing orders. This rule modifies the dates
when imported onions, including red variety onions, are regulated based on requirements of the South Texas onion
and Idaho-Eastern Oregon onion marketing orders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 8e provides that whenever certain specified commodities, including onions, are regulated under a Federal
marketing order, imports of that commodity must meet the same or comparable grade, size, quality, and maturity requirements
as those in effect for the domestically produced commodity. The Act further provides that when two or more marketing
orders covering the same commodity are concurrently in effect, imports will be subject to the requirements established
for the commodity grown in the area with which the imported commodity is in most direct competition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Marketing Order No. 958 regulates onions grown in certain counties of Idaho and Eastern Oregon and Marketing Order
No. 959 regulates onions grown in South Texas. Fresh onion shipments from Idaho-Eastern Oregon are regulated throughout
the year, while onion shipments from South Texas were regulated from March 1 through May 20 each year. On the basis of
past shipment data, the Secretary of Agriculture (Secretary) had determined that onions imported during the March
10 through May 20 period were in most direct competition with onions grown in South Texas and found that the minimum
grade, size, quality, and maturity requirements for onions imported during that period should be the same as those
established for South Texas onions under Marketing Order No. 959. The Secretary further determined that onions imported
during the May 21 through March 9 period were in most direct competition with onions grown in Idaho-Eastern Oregon
and that the minimum grade, size, quality, and maturity requirements for onions imported during that period should
be the same as those established for Idaho-Eastern Oregon onions under Marketing Order No. 958. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on a recommendation of the South Texas Onion Committee (committee), the agency responsible for local administration
of Marketing Order No. 959, the Department has extended the end of the South Texas regulatory period from May 20 to June
15. The Fruit and Vegetable Division's Market News Service has reported no onion shipments of commercial quantities
from the Idaho-Eastern Oregon production area during June from the 1990 through 1993 period, and only one year during
this period, 1993, were onion shipments recorded during May. Therefore, onions imported during the period March
10 through June 15 are in most direct competition with those produced in South Texas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, now that the change in the regulatory period for South Texas onions is effective, a corresponding change must
be made in the onion import regulation so that the requirements established under the South Texas marketing order
will be the determining requirements for onions imported during the May 21 through June 15 period. Currently, imports
of onions during that period are required to meet minimum requirements based on those established under the Idaho-Eastern
Oregon marketing order. This rule changes onion import requirements to be the same as the South Texas requirements
during that period. With that adjustment, the onion import requirement will be based on the requirements for South
Texas onions during the period March 10 through June 15, and will be based on the requirements for Idaho-Eastern Oregon
onions during the June 16 through March 9 period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Red onion varieties are subject to minimum grade, size, quality, and maturity requirements under the Idaho-Eastern
Oregon marketing order, but those requirements are not in effect for imported red onions during the South Texas regulatory
period. However, based on a recommendation of the committee, the Department has established minimum requirements
for red onion varieties grown in the South Texas production area. Since South Texas red onion varieties are regulated,
red onions, imported from March 10 to June 15 shall be required to grade at least U.S. No. 1 with a 20 percent defect allowance
and 1 and 3/4 inch minimum diameter. This requirement will be in effect through June 15 as the South Texas regulatory
period has been extended to June 15. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Notice of this rule was published in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 [59 FR 33453]. Interested persons were invited to file written comments with respect to the proposal until July 29,
1994. No comments were received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on these considerations, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 8e of the Act, the U.S. Trade Representative has concurred with the issuance of this final
rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all relevant material presented, including the proposal submitted by the committee, and
other information, it is hereby found that this regulation, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the
declared policy of the Act.

 This final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement No. 146 [7 CFR part 998] regulating the quality of domestically
produced peanuts, hereinafter referred to as the agreement. This agreement is effective under the Agricultural
Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674], hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.''

The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have retroactive

The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are about 75 handlers of peanuts subject to regulation under the agreement, and about 47,000 peanut producers
in the 16 States covered under the program. Small agricultural service firms are defined by the Small Business Administration
[13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $5,000,000, and small agricultural producers have been
defined as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000. Some of the handlers signatory to the agreement are
small entities, and a majority of the producers may be classified as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1993, the reported U.S. production, mostly covered under the agreement, was approximately 3.33 billion pounds
of peanuts, a 22 percent decrease from 1992 and the lowest level since 1983. The preliminary 1993 peanut crop value
is $991.65 million, 77 percent of the 1992 crop value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The objective of the agreement, in place since 1965, is to ensure that only wholesome peanuts enter edible market channels.
About 70 percent of U.S. shellers (handlers), handling approximately 95 percent of the crop, have voluntarily signed
the agreement. Under the agreement, farmers' stock peanuts with visible 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Aspergillus flavus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 mold (the principal source of aflatoxin) are required to be diverted to non-edible uses. Each lot of milled peanuts
must be sampled and the samples chemically analyzed for aflatoxin contamination. Signatory handlers who comply
with these requirements may be eligible for indemnification of losses for individual lots of their peanuts which
test positive to aflatoxin. Indemnification and administrative costs are paid by assessments levied on handlers
signatory to the agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee, which is composed of growers and handlers of peanuts, meets to review the rules and regulations effective
on a continuous basis for peanuts regulated under the agreement. Committee meetings are open to the public, and interested
persons may express their views at these meetings. The Department reviews Committee recommendations and information,
as well as information from other sources, and determines whether modification, suspension, or termination of the
rules and regulations will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee met on March 15 and 16, 1994, and unanimously recommended clarifying changes to &sect;998.100 Incoming
quality regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 998.34 of the agreement provides authority for the modification of the incoming quality regulation by the
Secretary of Agriculture, if the Secretary finds that such modification would tend to effectuate the objectives
of the agreement.

 mold must be stored and shelled separate and apart from other peanuts. The regulation does not specifically state
that Segregation 2 seed peanuts containing up to three percent damaged kernels and no visible 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Aspergillus flavus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
mold can be stored and shelled with Segregation 1 seed lots if the seed peanuts were produced under the auspices of a
State agency. The Committee believes that the current provisions authorize such commingling but believe that the
authority should be expressly stated to avoid confusion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee noted that requiring Segregation 2 seed peanuts to be stored separately from Segregration 1 seed peanuts
would increase the number of storage bins handlers needed to maintain separation. This would increase handler costs.
It also noted that requiring the Segregation 2 seed peanuts to be shelled separate and apart from Segregation 1 seed
peanuts would increase handler shelling costs with no apparent benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Committee recommended adding a sentence to paragraph (e) clarifying that seed peanut lots may be stored
and shelled with Segregation 1 lots if: (1) The seed peanuts do not exceed 3 percent total damage and have no visible

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Aspergillus flavus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
mold; and (2) both the Segregation 2 seed peanut lot and the Segregation 1 seed peanut lot are produced under the auspices
of a State agency which regulates or controls the production of seed peanuts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule also provides that the unchanged portions of the incoming, outgoing, and indemnification regulations
currently in effect under the agreement for 1993 crop peanuts be established for 1994 and subsequent crop peanuts.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all relevant matter presented, the information and recommendations submitted by the Committee,
and other information, it is found that finalizing the interim final rule, without change, as published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 18, 1994, [59 FR 36353] will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. That rule provided that interested
persons could file comments through August 17, 1994. No comments were received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is further found that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (5 U.S.C. 553) because: (1) This action clarifies requirements currently in effect for peanut handlers who are signatory
to the agreement; and (2) the interim final rule provided that interested persons could file comments through August
17, 1994. No comments were received and the Department is adopting a final rule, without change, the provisions of
the interim final rule.

The Farm Credit Administration (FCA) published a final regulation under part 650 on March 1, 1994 (59 FR 9622). The
final regulation adds 12 CFR part 650 to require the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation to adopt a conflict-of-interest
policy that defines the types of relationships, transactions, or activities that might reasonably be expected to
give rise to a potential conflict of interest. In accordance with 12 U.S.C. 2252, the effective date of the final rule
is 30 days from the date of publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc. Model
206A, 206A&hyph;1, 206B, 206B&hyph;1, 206L, 206L&hyph;1, and 206L&hyph;3 series helicopters. This action requires
initial and repetitive inspections of the swashplate for cracks in the swashplate support assembly fillet radius
area and replacement, if necessary. This amendment is prompted by reports of cracks found in the swashplate support
assembly fillet radius area near the base. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent failure of the swashplate
support assembly, loss of control of the main rotor system, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) applicable to Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc. (BHTI) Model
206A, 206A&hyph;1, 206B, 206B&hyph;1, 206L, 206L&hyph;1, and 206L&hyph;3 series helicopters, equipped with swashplate
support assembly, part number (P/N) 206&hyph;010&hyph;452&hyph;001, &hyph;005, or &hyph;109. BHTI has received
three reports of swashplate support assemblies with cracks in the fillet radius area near the base. The cracks originated
on the aft section of the swashplate support assembly. The total time-in-service (TIS) on each of the reported swashplate
support assemblies exceeded 1,500 hours. The swashplate support assembly is a critical, non-rotating, rotor system
component that supports the rotating swashplate. Through the swashplate support assembly and subsequently the
swashplate, the pilot control movements that are necessary to maintain rotorcraft control are transferred to the
main rotor system. Therefore, a crack in a swashplate support assembly creates an unsafe condition. This condition,
if not corrected, could result in failure of the swashplate support assembly, loss of control of the main rotor system,
and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc. Alert Service Bulletin No. 206&hyph;93&hyph;74,
Revision B, and 206L&hyph;93&hyph;89, Revision B, both dated April 4, 1994, which describe procedures for an initial
visual inspection for cracks within the next 25 hours TIS using a 10-power magnifying glass, and thereafter, repetitive
visual inspections for cracks at intervals not to exceed 50 hours TIS from the last inspection. The inspections are
for swashplate support assemblies that have more than 1,500 hours TIS. If a crack is suspected, the Alert Service Bulletins
provide for a dye penetrant inspection. If a crack is found, the applicable Alert Service Bulletin specifies replacement
of the swashplate support assembly with an airworthy swashplate support assembly prior to the next flight. Neither
BHTI Alert Service Bulletin No. 206&hyph;93&hyph;74, Revision B, nor 206L&hyph;93&hyph;89, Revision B, both dated
April 4, 1994, shows the Model 206A&hyph;1 as being an affected model helicopter. However, this model helicopter
uses the same swashplate support assembly as the Model 206A helicopter. Therefore, for purposes of this AD, Alert
Service Bulletin No. 206&hyph;93&hyph;74, Revision B, dated April 4, 1994, will also apply to the Model 206A&hyph;1
helicopter.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other Bell Helicopter Textron,
Inc. Model 206A, 206A&hyph;1, 206B, 206B&hyph;1, 206L, 206L&hyph;1, and 206L&hyph;3 series helicopters of the
same type design, this AD is being issued to prevent failure of the swashplate support assembly, loss of control of
the main rotor system, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter. For swashplate support assemblies that have
1,500 hours or more total TIS, this AD requires an initial visual inspection for cracks using a 10-power or higher magnifying
glass within 25 hours TIS. Also, for swashplate support assemblies with less than 1,500 hours total TIS, this AD requires
an initial visual inspection for cracks using a 10-power or higher magnifying glass prior to attaining 1,525 hours
total TIS. Thereafter, repetitive inspections of the affected swashplate support assemblies are required at intervals
not to exceed 50 hours TIS from the last inspection. If a crack is suspected, a dye penetrant inspection is required.
Replacement of cracked swashplate support assemblies with airworthy swashplate support assemblies is required.
Installation of an airworthy swashplate support assembly, P/N 206&hyph;010&hyph;452&hyph;113, constitutes
a terminating action for the requirements of this AD. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with
the service bulletins described previously. Due to the criticalness of the swashplate support assembly and the short
compliance times, this rule must be issued immediately to correct an unsafe condition in aircraft. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
should identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this rule must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 93&hyph;SW&hyph;22&hyph;AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and that it is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866.
It has been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and
Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be
significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed
in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This action maintains the Class D airspace that was formerly a part of the Lawton, OK, Class D airspace, and establishes
Class E airspace at Fort Sill, OK. Henry Post Army Airfield, Fort Sill, OK, was previously a satellite airport within
the Lawton Class D airspace, Lawton, OK. The local aircraft operators requested and the FAA decided to divide the Lawton
Class D airspace into two individual areas of Class D airspace; one area covering the Lawton Municipal Airport, Lawton,
OK, and the other area covering Henry Post Army Airfield, Fort Sill, OK. Controlled airspace from the surface is needed
at Fort Sill on a continuous basis for instrument flight rules (IFR) operations at Henry Post Army Airfield. Therefore,
during the hours the Fort Sill airport traffic control tower (ATCT) is in operation, Class D airspace will be in effect,
and during hours the ATCT is non-operational, Class E airspace will be in effect. This action is intended to provide
for more flexibility in airspace utilization and to provide control over each individual area of airspace, particularly
during times when the towers are non-operational.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
History
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On November 24, 1993, a proposal to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to split the Class
D airspace at Lawton, OK. into Lawton, OK, Class D airspace and Ft. Sill, OK, Class D airspace, and re-designate Lawton,
OK, Class E airspace as Fort Sill, OK, airspace, was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (For Lawton, OK. at 58 FR 62057, for Fort Sill, OK. at 58 FR 62054). Prior to this action, Henry Post Army Airfield, Fort
Sill, OK, was a satellite airport within the Lawton Class D airspace, Lawton, OK. Local aircraft operators requested
and the FAA decided to divide the Lawton Class D airspace into two individual areas of Class D airspace; one area covering
the Lawton Municipal Airport, Lawton, OK, and the other area covering Henry Post Army Airfield, Fort Sill, OK. This
proposed action would provide for more flexibility and control of the airspace from the surface when it is needed at
Fort Sill, OK, for instrument flight rules (IFR) operations at Henry Post AAF. This action will establish Class D airspace
during hours the airport traffic control tower (ATCT) is operational and Class E airspace during hours the ATCT is
non-operational.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on
the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal were received. The Notice of proposed rulemaking described
extensions to the Class D airspace 4-mile radius as ``within 1.3 miles each side of the 181
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; bearing from the Trail NDB extending from the 4-mile radius to 6.2 miles north of the Henry Post AAF and within
1.2 miles each side of the 003
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; radial of the Lawton VOR/DME extending from the 4-mile radius to 4.7 miles north of the Henry Post AAF''. If any
extension to a Class D airspace extends beyond 2 miles, all extensions for the Class D airspace area will be classified
as Class E airspace. The airspace extensions as described in the NPRM would have lead to an incorrect classification
of the airspace extensions as Class D airspace instead of Class E airspace. The proposal should not have included the
extensions within the Class D description. Therefore, the narrative description of the Class D airspace has been
corrected to exclude these extensions, and a separate Class E description has been added for this airspace. Other
than these changes, this amendment is the same as that proposed in the notice. The FAA has determined that these changes
will not increase the scope of this rule since they are relieving in nature, i.e., re-designating proposed Class D
airspace to less restrictive Class E airspace.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The coordinate for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D airspace designations are published
in paragraph 5000, Class E extensions to a Class D surface area are published in paragraph 6004, and Class E airspace
designated as a surface area for an airport are published in paragraph 6002 of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994,
and effective September 16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class D and Class E airspace
designations listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
The Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) establishes separate Class D and Class
E airspace for Henry Post Army Airfield, Fort Sill, OK.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations that need
frequent and routine amendments to keep them operational current. If, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory
action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated
impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation,
it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This action modifies the Class D airspace at Lawton, OK. The current Lawton, OK, Class D airspace encompasses both
the Lawton Municipal Airport, Lawton, OK, and Henry Post Army Airfield, Fort Sill, OK. The local aircraft operators
requested and the FAA decided to divide the Lawton Class D airspace into two individual areas of Class D airspace; one
area covering the Lawton Municipal Airport, Lawton, OK, and the other area covering Henry Post Army Airfield, Fort
Sill, OK, as well as re-designate the former Lawton Class E airspace as Fort Sill, OK, Class E airspace. This action
is intended to provide for more flexibility in airspace utilization and provide control over each individual area
of airspace, particularly during times when the towers are non-operational.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
History 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On November 24, 1993, a proposal to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to modify the Class
D airspace at Lawton, OK, was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 62057). A request was made by local aircraft operators to divide the Lawton Class D airspace, Lawton, OK, into
two separate areas of Class D airspace; one area covering the Lawton Municipal Airport, Lawton, OK, and one covering
Henry Post Army Airfield (AAF), Fort Sill, OK. This proposed modification would allow for more flexibility in controlling
each individual area of airspace to the extent deemed necessary, particularly during the times when the towers are
non-operational. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on
the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal were received. The current Lawton Class D airspace has
Class E extension's to the surface area. When Lawton Municipal Airport and Henry Post AAF were designated as separate
Class D airspace areas, it became necessary to re-designate the Class E extension's to the previous Lawton Class D
airspace area as Class E extension's to the Fort Sill Class D airspace because of their locations. The original proposal
failed to address this situation. Therefore, this action corrects that oversight by revoking the Class E extension's
to the Lawton Class D airspace. The Class E airspace extension's that have been revoked by this action have been re-instated
in the rulemaking action that establishes the Class D airspace for Henry Post Army Airfield, Fort Sill OK. Except for
this change, the amendment is the same as that proposed in the notice. The FAA has determined that this change will not
increase the scope of this rule because it is relieving, i.e. it revokes previous Class E airspace making it less restrictive.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D and Class E airspace designations
are published respectively in paragraphs 5000 and 6004 of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective September
16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class D and Class E airspace designations listed in
this document will be published subsequently in the Order.

The Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) modifies the Class D airspace at Lawton,
OK, to separate the Lawton Class D airspace into two separate Class D airspace; one area covering the Lawton Municipal
Airport, Lawton, OK, and one covering Henry Post Army Airfield, Fort Sill, OK. This action also revokes the Class E
extension's to the previous Lawton, OK, Class D airspace so it can be redesignated as Fort Sill, OK, Class E airspace.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations that need
frequent and routine amendments to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) Is not a ``significant regulatory
action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated
impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation,
it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 11, 1994, the Agency published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 an interim rule with request for comments. The interim rule amended &sect;514.30, which governs the administration
of camp counselor exchanges conducted under the auspices of the Exchange Visitor Program. Specifically, this amendment
permits repeat participation, in excess of two summers, for no more than ten percent of each Agency-designated sponsor's
camp counselor exchange participants for a particular exchange year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Despite assertions received by the Agency to the contrary, the designation of exchange visitor sponsors and the administration
of the Exchange Visitor Program are deemed to be foreign affairs functions of the Untied States. The Administrative
Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1)(1989) specifically exempts such functions from the requirements of the Act. Nevertheless,
the Agency invited comments from the public on the matter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three comments were received, all of them favorable. One comment from Camp America noted that the ten percent rule
would provide opportunities to the greatest number of participants while minimizing disruption of existing programs.
Another, from the Alliance for International Educational and Cultural Exchange, noted that the interim rule adopted
a ``reasonable compromise'' to the concerns raised by Alliance members and the American Camping Association, although
it noted for the record that camp counselor sponsors did not support the participation limitation for counselors.
The Alliance also expressed a reservation regarding the ability of sponsors to ascertain whether an individual has
previously participated in any other camp counselor programs, and recommended that the rule be modified to require
only that a sponsoring organization be responsible for reporting its own repeat participation rate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the Agency is aware that sponsors may not have adequate resources to detect an outright fabrication about
program participation by a prospective counselor, it is nevertheless incumbent upon sponsoring organizations
to use every reasonable means at their disposal to ascertain that counselor's program participation history. This
includes, but is not limited to, informing the counselor of the importance of the participation requirement and explicitly
asking potential counselors about prior participation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information collection requirement of this regulation has been submitted to and approved by the Office of Management
and Budget under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act. In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Agency certifies
that this rule does not have a significant adverse economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. It is
not considered to be a major rule within the meaning of section 1(b) of E.O. 12291, nor does this rule have Federalism
implications warranting the preparation of a Federalism Assessment in accordance with E.O. 12612.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Interim Rule which amended 22 CFR 514.30, published at 59 FR 16983 on April 11, 1994 is adopted as a
Final Rule without change.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard is establishing a safety zone on the Upper Mississippi River. This regulation is needed to restrict
vessel traffic in the regulated area to prevent an allision with the salvage equipment located mid-channel at mile
43.0, Upper Mississippi River. The regulation restricts general navigation in the regulated area for the safety
of vessel traffic and the protection of life and property along the river.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking has not been published for this regulation and good
cause exists for making it effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. Following normal rulemaking
procedures would have been impracticable. Specifically, recent decreases in the river levels of the Upper Mississippi
River have necessitated the removal and salvage of two sunken barges at miles 43.0 and 42.7 that have been determined
to be a hazard to navigation in that area. As a result, the Coast Guard deems it to be in the public's best interest to issue
a regulation immediately.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Background and Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The situation requiring this regulation is the reduction of the channel width to 200 feet from below the Thebes Railroad
Bridge at mile 43.7 to mile 42.0 due to the presence of salvage equipment. The salvage equipment is on scene to refloat
two sunken barges at miles 43.0 and 42.7 that have been determined to be a hazard to navigation in that area. The regulation
is intended to restrict all vessels to the following provisions. Meeting, overtaking or passing in the safety zone
is prohibited. Upbound tows transiting the safety zone are limited in size to twenty barges and not more than four wide.
Downbound tows transitting the safety zone are limited in size to fifteen barges and not more than three wide. During
daylight hours, all vessels approaching the safety zone must contact the Coast Guard representative on board the
M/V CAPTAIN VAL on VHF&hyph;FM channels 6, 13 or 16 for passing instructions. Upbound vessels must call in when approaching
mile 39.0 and downbound vessels must call in when approaching mile 58.0. During hours of darkness, all vessels must
use all reasonable means to identify vessels transiting or approaching the safety zone and make safe passing arrangements.
All vessels must transit the safety zone at their slowest safe speed and should expect delays. All vessels are urged
to give the widest possible berth to salvage equipment and operations. All vessels transiting the area are urged to
exercise extreme caution.

Regulatory Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review
by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not under the regulatory policies and procedures of the
Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). Because the duration of this emergency situation
is anticipated to be short, the Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this regulation to be so minimal that a full
Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
To avoid any unnecessary adverse economic impact on businesses which use the river for commercial purposes, Captain
of the Port, Paducah, Kentucky will monitor river conditions and will authorize unrestricted entry into the restricted
area as conditions permit. Changes will be announced by Marine Safety Information Radio broadcast (Broadcast Notice
to Mariners) on VHF marine band radio, channel 22 (157.1 MHz). Mariners may also call the Marine Safety Office, Paducah,
Kentucky for current information.

The Coast Guard finds that the impact on small entities, if any, is not substantial. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies
under section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.

The Coast Guard is establishing a safety zone in Sheffield Harbor, around the fireworks barge C&hyph;33 located approximately
1200 feet northwest of the abandoned lighthouse on Sheffield Island, Norwalk, CT from 9:15 p.m. through 10 p.m. on
September 17, 1994. This safety zone is needed to protect the maritime community from possible navigation hazards
associated with a fireworks display. Entry into this zone is prohibited unless authorized by the Captain of the Port,
Long Island Sound.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On July 13, 1994, the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking entitled Safety Zone; Widmann Wedding
Fireworks Display, Sheffield Island, CT in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 35661). The deadline for the submission of comments was August 12, 1994. Accordingly, there is insufficient
time available to publish this final rule 30 days in advance of the event. The Coast Guard received no letters commenting
on the proposal. A public hearing was not requested and one was not held. The Captain of the Port, Long Island Sound has
decided to publish the final rule as proposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Background and Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The sponsor, Jim Widmann, President of CT Pyro Display Company, South Norwalk, CT has requested that a fireworks display
be permitted in the port of Norwalk in the vicinity of Sheffield Island, Norwalk CT. This safety zone is required to
protect the maritime community from the dangers associated with this fireworks display. The zone covers all waters
of Sheffield Harbor within a 1200 foot radius of the fireworks barge C&hyph;33.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulatory Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review
by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies
and procedures of DOT is unnecessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The safety zone will last approximately 45 minutes. The area affected by this event receives infrequent commercial
traffic. Because of the short duration of the event, and the extensive advisories which will be made, commercial entities
will be able to adjust to any disruptions. The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this proposal to be so minimal
that a Regulatory Evaluation is unnecessary.

Small Entities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant
in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act
(15 U.S.C. 632).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons addressed in the Regulatory Evaluation above, the Coast Guard certifies under section 605(b) of the
Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

This rule contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Federalism
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard has analyzed this action in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order
12612, and has determined that these regulations do not raise sufficient federalism implications to warrant the
preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of these regulations and concluded that under section 2.B.2.e.
of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, they are categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.
A Categorical Exclusion Determination will be included in the docket.

 The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) approves Illinois' 1990 base year ozone precursor emission
inventories for certain ozone nonattainment areas as revisions to the Illinois ozone State Implementation Plan
(SIP). The emission inventories were submitted by the State of Illinois to satisfy a Federal requirement that States
containing ozone nonattainment areas submit inventories of actual ozone precursor emissions in accordance with
USEPA guidance. The ozone nonattainment areas covered by the emission inventories addressed in this rulemaking
are: Chicago (Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry, and Will Counties, Aux Sable and Goose Lake Townships in Grundy County,
and Oswego Township in Kendall County); Metro-East St. Louis (Madison, Monroe, and St. Clair Counties); and Jersey
County. In the proposed rules section of this

I. Emission Inventory Policy and Guidelines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Under the Clean Air Act (Act), as amended in 1990 (amended Act), States have the responsibility to inventory emissions
contributing to the violation of National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS), to track these emissions over time,
and to ensure that control strategies are implemented to reduce the emissions and move the areas towards attainment
of the NAAQS. States containing ozone nonattainment areas are required, under section 182(a)(1) of the amended Act,
to submit by November 15, 1992, a comprehensive, accurate and current inventory of actual ozone precursor emissions
(emissions of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC), Oxides of Nitrogen (NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), and Carbon Monoxide (CO)) for each ozone nonattainment area. This inventory must include base year (1990) emissions
from point, area, on-road mobile, and non-road mobile anthropogenic (man-made) sources and biogenic (natural or
plant generated) sources in the ozone nonattainment area(s) and the ozone precursor emissions from major stationary
source (with VOC, NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, or CO emissions equal to or exceeding 100 tons per year) located within 25 miles of the nonattainment area(s). The
emissions inventory must be established for the peak ozone season (those months when peak hourly ozone concentrations
occur in excess of the primary ozone NAAQS, generally June through August in Illinois) and must represent typical
weekday emissions. Available guidance for preparing and reviewing the emission inventories is provided in the General
Preamble to title I of the Act. See 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992). Additional guidance is identified in the Technical
Support Document (TSD) for this rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amended Act also requires States with ozone nonattainment areas classified as moderate, serious, severe, or
extreme to submit a plan by November 15, 1993 to reduce VOC emissions by 15 percent by November 15, 1996. The baseline
level of emissions, from which the 15 percent reduction is calculated, is determined by adjusting the base year emissions
inventory to exclude biogenic emissions and certain emission reductions not creditable toward the 15 percent Reasonable
Further Progress (RFP) requirement. The 1990 base year emissions inventory is the primary emissions inventory from
which the RFP projection inventory, future period inventories, and attainment demonstration modeling inventories
are derived. Further information on these inventories and their purposes can be found in the ``Emission Inventory
Requirements for Ozone State Implementation Plans,'' U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Air Quality
Planning and Standards, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, March 1991.

As a primary tool for the review of the quality of emission inventory submittals, the USEPA has developed three levels
(I, II, and III) of emission inventory quality assurance review checklists. The Level I and II reviews are used to determine
that all required components of the base year emission inventory and its associated documentation are present. These
reviews also evaluate the level of quality of the supporting documentation and the data provided by the State and assess
whether the emission estimates were developed according to current USEPA guidance. The Level III review evaluates
10 crucial aspects and the overall acceptability of the emission inventory submittal. Failure to meet one of these
crucial aspects would lead to disapproval of the emission inventory submittal. The 10 crucial aspects of the emission
inventory submittal are:

Detailed Level I and II review procedures and questions may be found in the ``Quality Review Guidelines for 1990 Base
Year Emission Inventories,'' United States Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Air Quality Planning and
Standards, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, July 1992. Level III criteria are specified in a memorandum from
David Mobley, Emission Inventory Branch, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, USEPA, to the Chief of the
Regulation Development Branch, Region V, et al., titled ``Final Emission Inventory Level III Acceptance Criteria,''
October 7, 1992.

The Act requires States to observe certain procedural requirements in development and submitting SIP revisions,
including the base year emissions inventory submittal. Section 110(a)(2) of the Act provides that each SIP revision
submitted by the State must be adopted after reasonable notice and public hearing. Final approval of the emissions
inventory would not occur until the State revises the emissions inventory to address public comments. Future changes
to the base year emission inventory (due to previously missed sources or to corrected source emission factors or activity
levels) that impact the 15 percent RFP calculations or the demonstration of attainment or that require a revised emission
control strategy will be required to be addressed in a SIP revision.

II. Illinois' Emission Inventory Submittals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 12, 1993, the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) submitted the final, adopted base year
ozone precursor emission inventories for the Chicago, Metro-East St. Louis (the Illinois portion of the St. Louis/Metro-East
St. Louis ozone nonattainment area), and Jersey County ozone nonattainment areas. The emission inventory submittals
cover the emissions of VOC, NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and CO for each of the ozone nonattainment areas as well as the emissions from major stationary sources located within
25 miles of the ozone nonattainment areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to developing the base year emission inventories, the IEPA developed an IPP as required by the USEPA. This IPP
outlined the procedures that would be followed in preparing and documenting the emission inventories and defined
the QA procedures that would be used to assure the accuracy and completeness of the emission inventories. The IPP was
submitted to the USEPA in March 1992, and was approved by the USEPA in May 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Emissions contained in the emission inventories cover the general source categories of stationary point sources
(or simply point sources), area sources, on-road mobile sources, off-road mobile sources, and biogenic sources.
Emission inventory summary tables in the submittals include more detailed source category breakdowns as requested
by the USEPA. All emission summaries were accompanied by documentation covering the sources and values of input data
and by sample calculations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To determine point source emissions, the IEPA used permit-based data from the State's Emission Inventory System
(EIS) for all process emission sources in the ozone nonattainment areas and for major sources located within 25 miles
of the ozone nonattainment areas. This data base provided current documentation of the facility-specific and source
type-specific emissions for all facilities with VOC, NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, or CO emissions to an accuracy of 0.1 pounds per hour. Data obtained from the EIS were cross-referenced with data from
other databases, such as USEPA's Toxic Release Information System (TRIS) and the Illinois Manufacturers Directory
to assure data accuracy and completeness of source coverage. Potentially missing sources were identified and were
contacted concerning their ozone precursor emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The point source portions of the emission inventories contain detailed facility-specific emission listings at
the source segment level as well as facility emission totals. All facilities emitting VOC, NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, or CO at an actual rate of 10 tons per year or more are covered in the point source emission listings (many facilities
with lower emissions are also included). Emissions were calculated using techniques outlined in the approved IPP
and included the use of emission factors obtained from stack tests, the AP&hyph;42 Compilation of Air Pollution Emission
Factors, and other publications containing current emission factors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The point source inventory detailed listings identify the emission factors, source activity levels or throughputs,
operating schedules, and control equipment efficiencies used for each facility and source segment. All emissions
were adjusted in the facility emission totals to reflect weekday emissions for the June through August period. Where
covered by emission controls, total facility emissions were adjusted to account for rule effectiveness and rule
penetration. Sources subject to controls with emission control efficiencies equal to or greater than 95 percent
were covered by facility-specific rule effectiveness studies. For these facilities, rule effectiveness values
determined through the studies were applied to the facility emissions. For those facilities with emission control
efficiencies equal to or greater than 95 percent but not covered specifically in the rule effectiveness studies,
a median rule effectiveness level of 92.1 percent was assumed. For all other facilities, a default rule effectiveness
of 80 percent was assumed. Using guideline emission profiles, the State has adjusted emissions to exclude compounds
considered by the USEPA to be nonreactive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Area source emissions were calculated using a variety of information sources and guidance from the USEPA. Where appropriate,
point source emissions have been subtracted from the calculated area source emissions to account for source coverage
overlap between the point source emissions and the area source emissions and to avoid double counting of emissions.
For all source categories covered by emission control regulations, the IEPA has assumed a rule effectiveness level
of 80 percent where sources are covered by emission control regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To estimate the area source emissions, the IEPA primarily relied on the USEPA guidance documents,

EPA&hyph;450/4&hyph;91&hyph;016 and EPA&hyph;450/4&hyph;91&hyph;014, May 1991. The documentation of the area
source emissions covers the techniques used for each source category. Sample calculations are given for each source
category and input data are documented for each source category by county. The data are well documented in both hard
copy and in computer data files submitted as additional documentation.

On-road mobile source emissions were calculated using USEPA's

and USEPA's MOBILE5a emission factor model. Weekday average Vehicle Miles Travelled (VMT) and speed data by roadway
link were obtained by the IEPA from the Chicago Area Transportation Study (CATS) for the Chicago urban area and from
the East-West Gateway Coordinating Council (EWGCC) for the Metro-East St. Louis urban area. These VMT and speed data
were produced by the application of transportation models in these urban areas. The Illinois Department of Transportation
(IDOT) provided VMT data by county and roadway type for the roadways outside of the urban areas and for roadways in the
urban areas not covered by the transportation models. The VMT data have been quality assured by comparison of modelled
roadway link traffic levels with current traffic counts (the IDOT VMT estimates were derived directly from current
traffic counts). All VMT data supplied by CATS, EWGCC, and IDOT were adjusted, based on monthly traffic data, to reflect
VMT levels during the peak ozone season. To determine speeds for roadways not covered by the CATS and EWGCC urban transportation
models, the IEPA developed tables of speeds by roadway type based on the averages of speeds by roadway types derived
in the CATS and EWGCC urban transportation models. Speeds for both congested periods and for noncongested periods
were considered in the calculation of average day emission levels. The IEPA, based on hourly averaged traffic data,
assumed that 75 percent of the daily VMT occurred at congested period speeds and that 25 percent of the daily VMT occurred
during noncongested periods. It should be noted that the vehicle speeds were generated by the traffic models rather
than generated independently as inputs to the traffic models. The IEPA has reviewed the speed assignments by roadway
type and county and asserts that the speeds generated by the model are conceptually sound and are viewed as being quality
assured.

The IEPA used the modelled VMT and speed data along with other area-specific data, such as the areas' representative
vehicle type distribution based on vehicle registration data, and default data and USEPA's MOBILE5a model to estimate
the on-road mobile source emissions. These emission estimates were adjusted to account for the impacts of vehicle
Inspection and Maintenance (I/M) and the average minimum and maximum daily temperatures on the ten highest ozone
days in each ozone nonattainment area. All input data used in the MOBILE5a modeling were described and documented
in the emission inventory submittals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Off-road mobile source emissions for railroad locomotives were based on the annual amount of fuel oil used by locomotives
in the ozone nonattainment areas and AP&hyph;42 emission factors. County fuel oil usage rates were calculated by
apportioning State total fuel oil usage based county track mileage. To calculate daily emission rates, locomotive
usage was assumed to be uniform throughout the year and occurring over 61/2 days per week. VOC emissions were multiplied
by 0.98 to remove the emissions of methane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Off-road mobile source emissions for aircraft were based on landing/takeoff rates for O'Hare and Midway Airports
in the Chicago area accounting for the number and types of engines for each type of plane. Emissions by engine type were
obtained from current Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reports. Emissions for all other airports were determined
considering annual operations (a landing or a takeoff) for each airport (landing/takeoff rates are assumed to equal
one-half the number of annual operations). For these airports, annual emissions were determined using the derived
landing/takeoff rates and default emission factors obtained from FAA reports. All aircraft emissions, calculated
on an annual basis, were converted to daily emissions assuming uniform operations throughout the year and throughout
the week. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Off-road mobile source emissions for commercial vessels were determined by considering distillate and residual
fuel oil sales data and vessel movement data combined with AP&hyph;42 emission factors. Emissions were apportioned
to counties by considering the county mileage of navigable waterways and tonnage of shipments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Off-road mobile source emissions for all other off-road mobile source categories were determined as part of an USEPA
off-road emission study. This 1991 study directly supplied emissions for the Chicago and St. Louis/Metro-East St.
Louis ozone nonattainment areas. Off-road mobile source emissions for Jersey County were derived from the 1991 USEPA
study by proportioning the study derived emissions for the St. Louis area to Jersey County on the basis of population
ratios and other source activity levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Biogenic emissions for all three areas were determined using USEPA's PC&hyph;BEIS biogenic emissions calculation
model. Information on land use, an input to the model, was obtained from several sources. Agricultural data for 1990
was obtained from the 1991 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Other land use data were taken from the database supplied with the PC&hyph;BEIS model. Meteorological data used with
PC&hyph;BEIS were determined by following USEPA guidance on the use of PC&hyph;BEIS and considering the ten days
(1988 through 1990) with the highest peak hourly ozone concentrations in each ozone nonattainment area. The representative
day (from a meteorological standpoint) was selected as the day with the fourth highest daily maximum ozone concentration
for each ozone nonattainment area. All data considered in the modeling of biogenic emissions were documented in the
emission inventory submittals and included in associated computer-based data files.

The USEPA has conducted Level I, II, and III quality assurance reviews of the Illinois emission inventory submittals
and has concluded that the State of Illinois has met the requirements of section 182(a)(1) of the Act by submitting
an ozone precursor emission inventory that includes comprehensive, accurate, and current actual emissions from
all identified sources in the subject ozone nonattainment areas. In particular, the Illinois submittals meet the
10 crucial criteria contained in the Level III quality assurance review. The emissions inventory is, therefore,
approved for incorporation in the SIP as satisfying the requirements of section 182(a)(1) of the amended Act. This
approved SIP revision and the emission levels contained within it will form the basis for subsequent SIP revisions
dealing with RFP and attainment of the ozone standard.

The USEPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because USEPA views this as a noncontroversial amendment
and anticipates no adverse comments. However, in a separate document in this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 publication, the USEPA is proposing to approve the requested SIP revision should adverse or critical comments be
filed. This action will be effective on November 14, 1994, unless adverse or critical comments are received by October
13, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the USEPA receives such comments, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing a subsequent
rule that withdraws this final action. All public comments received will then be addressed in a subsequent final rule
based on this action serving as a proposed rule. The USEPA will not institute a second comment period on this action.
Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. If no such comments are received, the
public is advised that this action will be effective November 14, 1994.

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The OMB has exempted this regulatory action from Executive Order
12866 review.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to any SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq., USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis
assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, USEPA may
certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small
entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction
over populations of less than 50,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D, of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply
approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does not impose
any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on small entities. Moreover, due to the nature
of the Federal-State relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute
Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The Act forbids the USEPA to base its actions concerning
SIPs on such grounds.

I. Summary of State Submittal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 5, 1987, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA) submitted to the USEPA a request for a revision
to the Ohio SIP for particulate matter and nitrogen oxides for sources within specified source categories that require
continuous emissions monitoring (CEM) and reporting. The revision request consisted of CEM requirements contained
in operating permits for 116 associated sources at 37 facilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revision was submitted to satisfy the requirements of section 110(a)(2)(F)(i), (ii) and (iii) of the Clean Air
Act and the specific provisions described in 40 CFR part 51, appendix P. Section 110(a)(2)(F) provides that the SIP
must require the installation of equipment to monitor emissions from stationary sources, periodic reporting of
such emissions and correlation of such reports with any emission limitations established in the SIP for source categories
identified in 40 CFR part 51, appendix P.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The source categories and the respective monitoring requirements identified in 40 CFR part 51, appendix P are listed
below:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Fossil fuel-fired steam generators. This category shall be

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Fluid bed catalytic cracking unit catalyst regenerators. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 This category shall be monitored for opacity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Sulfuric acid plants. This category shall be monitored for
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 sulfur dioxide emissions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Nitric acid plants with greater than 300 tons per day

On March 11, 1994, the USEPA published a rulemaking action in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 11569) proposing to disapprove the requested revision because the CEM requirements were contained in expired
permits and were no longer enforceable. USEPA stated in the proposed rulemaking action that if the OEPA submitted
up-to-date permits containing approvable CEM requirements for the facilities covered by the revision, USEPA would
approve the revision request through the effective dates of such permits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 11, 1994, the OEPA submitted a new revision request to USEPA in response to the March 11, 1994 proposed rulemaking,
along with its comments on the rulemaking. Comments were also received from Dayton Power and Light Company (DP&amp;L),
and Fuller &amp; Henry on behalf of the Environmental Committee of the Ohio Electric Utility Institute and the following
member companies: Buckeye Power, Inc., Columbus Southern Power Company, Dayton Power and Light Company, Ohio Edison
Company, Ohio Power Company, Ohio Valley Electric Corporation, The Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company, The
Cincinnati Gas &amp; Electric Company, and The Toledo Edison Company (Ohio Utilities).

OEPA Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 On May 5, 1987, USEPA approved Ohio EPA's SIP revision based on permits to operate which incorporated the appendix
P sulfur dioxide monitoring requirements for Coulton Chemical Plant in Toledo, Ohio and the E. I. duPont de Nemours
and Company facility in Miami, Ohio that were issued on January 3, and March 25, 1986, respectively.

USEPA Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rulemaking action involves CEM requirements for particulate matter and nitrogen oxide emissions. As stated
in the proposed rulemaking action, this revision request does not apply to the monitoring of sulfur dioxide emissions
at fossil fuel-fired steam generators and sulfuric acid plants. The sulfur dioxide CEM requirements for the above
facilities were discussed in a separate 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 rulemaking (54 FR 1693), dated January 17, 1989.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
OEPA Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Failure on the part of USEPA to act on the opacity monitoring provisions of the SIP in a timely manner has adversely affected
the State since it is required to resubmit additional documentation and be subject to changes in USEPA policy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
USEPA Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This Agency is limited to taking action on the revision request that has been formally submitted to it, and has no choice
except to disapprove CEM, recording, and reporting requirements contained in unenforceable expired permits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
OEPA Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As late as April 8, 1994, Ohio EPA staff has been told that even if OEPA filed the required information in accordance
with the March 11, 1994 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the SIP submittal may not be approvable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
USEPA Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This comment seems to be the result of a misconception on the part of OEPA. USEPA stated in the March 11, 1994 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that if the OEPA submitted up-to-date permits, containing approvable CEM requirements, the USEPA would then approve
the revision request in the final rulemaking action. In an April 5, 1994, discussion regarding furnishing OEPA example
CEM rule language, it was mentioned that USEPA was exploring the possibility of conditionally approving the SIP revision
request in the final action. It was further stated that conditionally approving the revision might not be possible
and the issue would be discussed further with OEPA. No statement was made that the revision might not be approved if
up-to-date permits were submitted to USEPA.

Ohio Utilities Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Ohio Utilities' stated concern with USEPA's proposed disapproval action is OEPA's proposed incorporation of
the CEM program into Ohio's SIP on a permit-by-permit basis. This method of adopting approvable CEM requirements
creates an unnecessary burden on Ohio EPA and the regulated community, fails to recognize the flexibility needed
to operate a successful CEM program, and does not allow for due process as in the case of rulemaking. USEPA should instead
require Ohio EPA to go through rulemaking procedures and adopt 40 CFR part 51, appendix P to satisfy CEM requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Ohio Utilities also expressed concern that permit specific CEM requirements place unnecessary burdens on OEPA
and the regulated community and that there is little or no opportunity for public comment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
USEPA Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The USEPA has requested that the OEPA go through rulemaking procedures and adopt the CEM requirements in 40 CFR part
51, appendix P by revising language in existing Ohio Administrative Code rules or by adopting new rules. OEPA's promulgation
of rules will resolve the problems associated with incorporating the CEM requirements into the SIP on a permit-by-permit
basis. The rules would require that all sources in a category listed in 40 CFR part 51, appendix P install, calibrate,
maintain and operate equipment for continuously monitoring, recording and reporting emissions in accordance with
appendix P's minimum monitoring requirements. Section 119.03 of the Ohio Revised Code requires OEPA to provide public
notice and hold a public hearing when rules are adopted, amended or rescinded. Written or oral comments may be presented
at the public hearing. The rules would then be submitted to the USEPA as a SIP revision request. Thus, all interested
parties would have an opportunity to comment before the revision to the SIP becomes final. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Ohio Utilities Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Ohio Utilities expressed concern about the fact that circumstances at a facility may change requiring a change
in the CEM monitoring requirements and the facility would have to follow existing permit requirements, even though
inapplicable, until OEPA revises the SIP. Additionally, Ohio Utilities expressed concern that the OEPA may have
erroneously incorporated CEM requirements into permits for sources not covered by appendix P. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
USEPA Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The USEPA understands the concerns of the Ohio Utilities. Instead of incorporating CEM requirements on a permit-by-permit
basis, USEPA has requested that the OEPA revise existing rules or adopt new rules to incorporate the CEM requirements,
for specified source categories, into the Ohio SIP. Any revised rules adopted by the State to establish its CEM program
must meet all of the requirements of section 110(a)(2)(F)(i), (ii) and (iii) of the Clean Air Act and the specific provisions
contained in 40 CFR part 51, appendix P. As to the point regarding erroneous incorporation of CEM requirements into
permits, it is not clear to USEPA which sources are being referred to by the Ohio Utilities. However, before the new
rules are incorporated in the Ohio SIP, the regulated community will be given an opportunity to comment regarding
the appropriateness of CEM requirements being applied to sources. Also, see USEPA's response below that addresses
concerns about CEM requirements for two facilities. Adherence to the State and the Federal administrative procedure
acts will ensure that the regulated community is afforded the due process associated with rulemaking actions. The
CEM requirements being approved by this rulemaking action will be effective through the expiration date of the permits.

USEPA Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The OEPA submitted a SIP revision request, consisting of Permits to Operate to USEPA on January 5, 1987, and requested
that USEPA rulemake only on those portions of the permits pertaining to the CEM requirements. The Longworth Station,
Application No. 0857040016 B004, was identified in OEPA's January 5, 1987, submittal as a fossil fuel-fired steam
generator with greater than 250 million BTU per hour heat input that requires CEM. The Permit to Operate for Longworth
Station, Application Number 0857040016 B004 in OEPA's April 11, 1994, revised submittal does not contain CEM requirements,
but instead provides for visible emission readings. Therefore, USEPA is not rulemaking on the Longworth Station
Permit to Operate.

DP&amp;L Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 DP&amp;L's Hutchings Station has demonstrated to the State that it has an annual average capacity factor of less than
30 percent for its boilers and, pursuant to 40 CFR part 51, appendix P, paragraph 2.1 is not subject to CEM requirements.
Because of the low annual average capacity factor, neither Ohio EPA nor the Regional Air Pollution Control Agency
have required Hutchings Station to install opacity monitors.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
USEPA Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 40 CFR part 51, appendix P, paragraph 2.1 requires CEM for fossil fuel-fired steam generators with an annual average
capacity factor of greater than 30 percent as reported to the Federal Power Commission, or as otherwise demonstrated
to the State by the owner or operator. The Special Terms and Conditions contained in the Permits to Operate submitted
to USEPA by OEPA on April 11, 1994 for DP&amp;L, Hutchings Station, Application Numbers 0857780013 B001 through 0857780013
B006, require that Hutchings Station undergo an annual review to determine if continuous opacity monitors must be
installed. As requested by OEPA, USEPA is rulemaking only on the portions of the permits that contain CEM requirements.
Therefore, USEPA is not rulemaking on the DP&amp;L, Hutchings Station, Permits to Operate.

DP&amp;L Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 DP&amp;L expressed its concern about the CEM requirements being approved only through the effective dates of the
permits and about the fact that the OEPA has not adopted rules to incorporate the CEM program requirements into the
Ohio SIP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
USEPA Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As stated previously in USEPA's response to the Ohio Utilities comment, USEPA has requested that OEPA adopt new or
revised rules for incorporating the CEM requirements of 40 CFR part 51, appendix P into the Ohio SIP. As to the limited
duration of the approval, CEM plans are required by 40 CFR 51.214 to contain legally enforceable procedures for requiring
stationary sources listed in 40 CFR part 51, appendix P, to install and operate CEM equipment. In this instance, USEPA
can only approve the CEM requirements through the effective date of the permits, because expired permits are not legally
enforceable and would, therefore, not meet the requirements of 40 CFR part 52, appendix P.

Nitric acid plants of greater than 300 tons per day production capacity must be monitored for nitrogen oxides. The
State of Ohio does not have any nitric acid plants that exceed the 300 ton per day production capacity. Therefore, USEPA

On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from
the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for 2 years. The USEPA has submitted a request for a permanent
waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's
request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866, which superseded Executive Order 12291 on

., USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact

SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve

new requirements. I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The CAA forbids USEPA to base
its actions concerning SIPS on such grounds.

USEPA's disapproval of a portion of the State request under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA does not affect
any existing requirements applicable to small entities. Any pre-existing Federal requirements remain in place
after this disapproval. Federal disapproval of the State submittal does not affect its State-enforceability. Moreover,
USEPA's disapproval of a portion of the submittal does not impose any new Federal requirements. Therefore, USEPA
certifies that this action does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities because it
does not remove existing requirements nor does it impose any new Federal requirements.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Due to an adverse comment, EPA is removing approval of a moderate nonattainment area state implementation plan (SIP)
revision for La Grande, Oregon, submitted by the State of Oregon for the purpose of bringing about attainment of the
national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or
equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM&hyph;10). The original action was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 1, 1994, as a direct final rule. 59 FR 33914. As stated in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice, if adverse or critical comments were received by August 1, 1994, the effective date would be delayed and timely
notice would be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
. Therefore, due to receiving an adverse comment within the comment period, EPA is removing approval of the SIP revision
and will address all public comments received in a subsequent final rule based on the proposed rule also published
on July 1, 1994. 59 FR 33941. EPA will not institute a second comment period on this document.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Portions of the EEZ around Hawaii and Guam are closed to longline fishing in order to prevent conflicts with users of
other types of fishing gear. In &sect;685.23, the listing of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coordinates for the waters around Guam that are closed to longline fishing contains an error that was made in a final
rule document published October 6, 1992 (57 FR 45989). This technical amendment corrects that error in order to provide
the public and enforcement entities the proper coordinates.

Because this technical amendment makes only a minor correction to an existing rule, notice and public comment thereon
and a delay in effective date would serve no purpose. Accordingly, under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) and (d), notice and public
comment thereon and a delay in the effective date are unnecessary.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A&hyph;110 provides standards for obtaining consistency and uniformity
among Federal agencies in the administration of grants and agreements with institutions of higher education, hospitals,
and other non-profit organizations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OMB issued Circular A&hyph;110 in 1976 and made a minor revision in February 1987. To update the Circular, OMB established
an interagency task force to review the Circular. The task force solicited suggestions for changes to the Circular
from university groups, non-profit organizations and other interested parties and compared, for consistency,
the provisions of similar provisions applied to State and local governments. On November 29, 1993, OMB issued a revised
circular which reflects the results of these efforts. This final rule adopts the revised circular as it pertains to
HUD. However, this rule contains, in subpart E, special provisions relating to the use of lump sum grants. Therefore,
subpart E will be treated as an interim rule, and the public is invited to submit comments on subpart E.

Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A&hyph;110 provides standards for obtaining consistency and uniformity
among Federal agencies in the administration of grants and agreements with institutions of higher education, hospitals,
and other non-profit organizations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OMB Circular A&hyph;110 was issued under the authority of 31 U.S.C. 503 (the Chief Financial Officers Act), 31 U.S.C.
1111, 41 U.S.C. 405 (the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act), Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970, and E.O. 11541
(``Prescribing the Duties of the Office of Management and Budget and the Domestic Policy Council in the Executive
Office of the President'').

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OMB issued Circular A&hyph;110 in 1976 and made a minor revision in February 1987. To update the circular, OMB established
an interagency task force to review the circular. The task force solicited suggestions for changes to the circular
from university groups, non-profit organizations and other interested parties and compared, for consistency,
the provisions of similar provisions applied to State and local governments. On August 27, 1992, OMB published a notice
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, at 57 FR 39018, requesting comments on proposed revisions to OMB Circular A&hyph;110. Interested parties were invited
to submit comments. OMB received over 200 comments from Federal agencies, non-profit organizations, professional
organizations and others. All comments were considered in developing the final revision. On November 29, 1993, at
58 FR 62992, OMB issued a revised circular which reflects the results of these efforts. This final rule represents
HUD's adoption of the revised circular as part 84 of title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations and sets forth the provisions
and procedures HUD will follow in compliance with the uniform requirements set for Federal agencies in the newly revised
OMB Circular A&hyph;110 regarding the administration of grants to and agreements with institutions of higher education,
hospitals, commercial organizations and international organizations when operating domestically, and other
non-profit organizations. If any statute specifically prescribes policies or specific requirements that differ
from the standards provided herein, the provisions of the statute shall govern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recipients shall apply the provisions of this Circular to subrecipients performing substantive work under grants
and agreements that are passed through or awarded by the primary recipient. This rule does not apply to grants, contracts,
or other agreements between HUD and units of State or local governments covered by OMB Circular A&hyph;102, ``Administrative
Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements to State, Local and Federally Recognized Indian Tribal Governments,''
as codified in 24 CFR part 85. In addition, subawards and contracts to State or local governments are not covered by
this rule. However, this rule applies to subawards made by State and local governments to organizations covered by
this rule. HUD shall apply the provisions of this part to commercial organizations and international organizations
(when operating domestically). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of ``award'' does not include technical assistance, which provides services instead of money; other
assistance in the form of loans, loan guarantees, capital advances under the Sections 202 and 811 programs, interest
subsidies, or insurance; direct payments of any kind to individuals; and, contracts which are required to be entered
into and administered under procurement laws and regulations. Therefore, this rule does not apply to these types
of activities. Consequently, this rule does not apply to any matter involving funds which would be covered by a regulatory
agreement between a mortgagor and the Secretary, executed under Sections 201, 207(b), 232(d)(1), 242(d)(1), and
236 (including Rental Assistance Payments) of the National Housing Act; Section 101(a) of the Housing and Urban Development
Act of 1965; and Section 201(a) of the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978.

Justification for Interim and Final Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department has determined that notice and public comment are unnecessary and contrary to the public interest
before making this rule effective because the substance of the rule received public comment when the circular was
published on August 27 1992. All comments received were reviewed and considered in the development of the revised
circular. However, the Department will accept and review any comments received on subpart E because of the selective
use of certain provisions as they apply to the use of lump sum grants.

A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations
at 24 CFR Part 50, which implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The Finding
of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the Office
of the Rules Docket Clerk, Office of the General Counsel, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Room 10276,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this rule before
publication and by approving it certifies that this rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. It pertains only to the administration of grants and agreements with institutions of higher
education, hospitals, and other non-profit organizations.

recipient transfers funds to another entity and that entity is the project. A distinction is made between such a transfer
for the furtherance of the prime recipient's goals and the transfer of funds to a subrecipient who carries out activities
and is accountable to the prime recipient. For example, in a CDBG award where a prime recipient has as its program goal
the revitalization of a downtown area, the funds transferred to a business in the downtown area to remodel its store
would not be considered a subaward subject to this part 84.

Use of Grants and Cooperative Agreements, and Contracts. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In each instance, HUD shall decide on the appropriate award instrument (i.e., grant, cooperative agreement, or contract).
The Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act (31 U.S.C. 6301-08) governs the use of grants, cooperative agreements
and contracts. A grant or cooperative agreement shall be used only when the principal purpose of a transaction is to
accomplish a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by Federal statute. The statutory criterion for
choosing between grants and cooperative agreements is that for the latter, ``substantial involvement is expected
between the executive agency and the State, local government, or other recipient when carrying out the activity contemplated
in the agreement.'' Contracts shall be used when the principal purpose is acquisition of property or services for
the direct benefit or use of the Federal Government.

The Metric Conversion Act, as amended by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act (15 U.S.C. 205) declares that the

to establish a date or dates in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, when the metric system of measurement
will be used in the agency's procurements, grants, and other business-related activities. Metric implementation
may take longer where the use of the system is initially impractical or likely to cause significant inefficiencies
in the accomplishment of federally-funded activities. HUD shall follow the provisions of E.O. 12770, ``Metric Usage

Under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) (Pub. L. 94&hyph;580, 42 U.S.C. 6962), any State agency or
agency of a political subdivision of a State which is using appropriated Federal funds must comply with Section 6002.
Section 6002 requires that preference be given in procurement programs to the purchase of specific products containing
recycled materials identified in guidelines developed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (40 CFR parts
247 through 254). Accordingly, State and local institutions of higher education, hospitals, commercial organizations
and international organizations when operating domestically, and non-profit organizations that receive direct
Federal awards or other Federal funds shall give preference in their procurement programs funded with Federal funds
to the purchase of recycled products pursuant to the EPA guidelines.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Accurate, current and complete disclosure of the financial results of each federally-sponsored project or program
in accordance with the reporting requirements set forth in &sect;84.52. If a recipient maintains its records on other
than an accrual basis, the recipient shall not be required to establish an accrual accounting system. These recipients
may develop such accrual data for their reports on the basis of an analysis of the documentation on hand. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Records that identify adequately the source and application of funds for federally-sponsored activities. These
records shall contain information pertaining to Federal awards, authorizations, obligations, unobligated balances,
assets, outlays, income and interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Effective control over and accountability for all funds, property and other assets. Recipients shall adequately
safeguard all such assets and assure they are used solely for authorized purposes.

and the issuance or redemption of checks, warrants or payments by other means for program purposes by the recipient.
To the extent that the provisions of the Cash Management Improvement Act (CMIA) (Pub. L. 101-453) govern, payment
methods of State agencies, instrumentalities, and fiscal agents shall be consistent with CMIA Treasury-State Agreements
or the CMIA default procedures codified at 31 CFR part 205, ``Withdrawal of Cash from the Treasury for Advances under
Federal Grant and Other Programs.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Written procedures for determining the reasonableness, allocability and allowability of costs in accordance
with the provisions of the applicable Federal cost principles and the terms and conditions of the award.

(7) Accounting records including cost accounting records that are supported by source documentation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Where the Federal Government guarantees or insures the repayment of money borrowed by the recipient, HUD, at its
discretion, may require adequate bonding and insurance if the bonding and insurance requirements of the recipient
are not deemed adequate to protect the interest of the Federal Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) HUD may require adequate fidelity bond coverage where the recipient lacks sufficient coverage to protect the
Federal Government's interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Where bonds are required in the situations described above, the bonds shall be obtained from companies holding
certificates of authority as acceptable sureties, as prescribed in 31 CFR part 223, ``Surety Companies Doing Business

State agencies or instrumentalities shall be consistent with Treasury-State CMIA agreements or default procedures
codified at 31 CFR part 205. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Recipients are to be paid in advance, provided they maintain or demonstrate the willingness to maintain: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Written procedures that minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds and disbursement by the recipient;
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Financial management systems that meet the standards for fund control and accountability as established in &sect;84.21.
Cash advances to a recipient organization shall be limited to the minimum amounts needed and be timed to be in accordance
with the actual, immediate cash requirements of the recipient organization in carrying out the purpose of the approved
program or project. The timing and amount of cash advances shall be as close as is administratively feasible to the
actual disbursements by the recipient organization for direct program or project costs and the proportionate share
of any allowable indirect costs.

(d) Requests for Treasury check advance payment shall be submitted on SF&hyph;270, ``Request for Advance or Reimbursement,''
or other forms as may be authorized by OMB. This form is not to be used when Treasury check advance payments are made to
the recipient automatically through the use of a predetermined payment schedule or if precluded by special HUD instructions

(e) Reimbursement is the preferred method when the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section cannot be met. HUD
may also use this method on any construction agreement, or if the major portion of the construction project is accomplished
through private market financing or Federal loans, and the Federal assistance constitutes a minor portion of the
project.

<!-- PJG QTAG 01 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

the billing is improper.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(f) If a recipient cannot meet the criteria for advance payments and HUD has determined that reimbursement is not feasible
because the recipient lacks sufficient working capital, HUD may provide cash on a working capital advance basis.
Under this procedure, HUD shall advance cash to the recipient to cover its estimated disbursement needs for an initial
period generally geared to the awardee's disbursing cycle. Thereafter, HUD shall reimburse the recipient for its
actual cash disbursements. The working capital advance method of payment shall not be used for recipients unwilling
or unable to provide timely advances to their subrecipient to meet the subrecipient's actual cash disbursements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(g) To the extent available, recipients shall disburse funds available from repayments to and interest earned on
a revolving fund, program income, rebates, refunds, contract settlements, audit recoveries and interest earned
on such funds before requesting additional cash payments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Unless otherwise required by statute, HUD shall not withhold payments for proper charges made by recipients at
any time during the project period unless paragraphs (h)(1) or (h)(2) of this section apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A recipient has failed to comply with the project objectives, the terms and conditions of the award, or Federal
reporting requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The recipient or subrecipient is delinquent in a debt to the United States as defined in OMB Circular A&hyph;129,
``Managing Federal Credit Programs.'' Under such conditions, HUD may, upon reasonable notice, inform the recipient
that payments shall not be made for obligations incurred after a specified date until the conditions are corrected
or the indebtedness to the Federal Government is liquidated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Standards governing the use of banks and other institutions as depositories of funds advanced under awards are
as follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Except for situations described in paragraph (i)(2) of this section, HUD shall not require separate depository
accounts for funds provided to a recipient or establish any eligibility requirements for depositories for funds
provided to a recipient. However, recipients must be able to account for the receipt, obligation and expenditure
of funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Advances of Federal funds shall be deposited and maintained in insured accounts whenever possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) Consistent with the national goal of expanding the opportunities for women-owned and minority-owned business
enterprises, recipients shall be encouraged to use women- owned and minority-owned banks (a bank which is owned at
least 50 percent by women or minority group members). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(k) Recipients shall maintain advances of Federal funds in interest bearing accounts, unless paragraphs (k)(1),
(k)(2), or (k)(3) of this section apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The recipient receives less than $120,000 in Federal awards per year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The best reasonably available interest bearing account would not be expected to earn interest in excess of $250
per year on Federal cash balances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The depository would require an average or minimum balance so high that it would not be feasible within the expected
Federal and non-Federal cash resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(l) For those entities where CMIA and its implementing regulations do not apply, interest earned on Federal advances
deposited in interest bearing accounts shall be remitted annually to Department of Health and Human Services, Payment
Management System, P.O. Box 6021, Rockville, MD 20852. In keeping with Electronic Funds Transfer rules (31 CFR part
206), interest should be remitted to the HHS Payment Management System through an electronic medium such as the FEDWIRE
Deposit system. Recipients which do not have this capability should use a check. Interest amounts up to $250 per year
may be retained by the recipient for administrative expense. State universities and hospitals shall comply with
CMIA, as it pertains to interest. If an entity subject to CMIA uses its own funds to pay pre-award costs for discretionary
awards without prior written approval from the Federal awarding agency, it waives its right to recover the interest
under CMIA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(m) Except as noted elsewhere in this rule, only the following forms shall be authorized for the recipients in requesting
advances and reimbursements. Federal agencies shall not require more than an original and two copies of these forms.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Are verifiable from the recipient's records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Are not included as contributions for any other federally-assisted project or program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Are necessary and reasonable for proper and efficient accomplishment of project or program objectives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Are allowable under the applicable cost principles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Are not paid by the Federal Government under another award, except where authorized by Federal statute to be used
for cost sharing or matching. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Are provided for in the approved budget when required by HUD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Conform to other provisions of this part, as applicable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Unrecovered indirect costs may be included as part of cost sharing or matching only with the prior approval of HUD.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Values for recipient contributions of services and property shall be established in accordance with the applicable
cost principles. If HUD authorizes recipients to donate buildings or land for construction/facilities acquisition
projects or long-term use, the value of the donated property for cost sharing or matching shall be the lesser of paragraphs
(c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section.

The current fair market value.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 However, when there is sufficient justification, HUD may approve the use of the current fair market value of the donated
property, even if it exceeds the certified value at the time of donation to the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Volunteer services furnished by professional and technical personnel, consultants, and other skilled and unskilled
labor may be counted as cost sharing or matching if the service is an integral and necessary part of an approved project
or program. Rates for volunteer services shall be consistent with those paid for similar work in the recipient's organization.
In those instances in which the required skills are not found in the recipient organization, rates shall be consistent
with those paid for similar work in the labor market in which the recipient competes for the kind of services involved.
In either case, paid fringe benefits that are reasonable, allowable, and allocable may be included in the valuation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) When an employer other than the recipient furnishes the services of an employee, these services shall be valued
at the employee's regular rate of pay (plus an amount of fringe benefits that are reasonable, allowable, and allocable,
but exclusive of overhead costs), provided these services are in the same skill for which the employee is normally
paid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Donated supplies may include such items as expendable equipment, office supplies, laboratory supplies or workshop
and classroom supplies. Value assessed to donated supplies included in the cost sharing or matching share shall be
reasonable and shall not exceed the fair market value of the property at the time of the donation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) The method used for determining cost sharing or matching for donated equipment, buildings and land for which title
passes to the recipient may differ according to the purpose of the award, if paragraphs (g)(1) or (g)(2) of this section
apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If the purpose of the award is to assist the recipient in the acquisition of equipment, buildings or land, the total
value of the donated property may be claimed as cost sharing or matching. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the purpose of the award is to support activities that require the use of equipment, buildings or land, normally
only depreciation or use charges for equipment and buildings may be made. However, the full value of equipment or other
capital assets and fair rental charges for land may be allowed, provided that HUD has approved the charges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) The value of donated property shall be determined in accordance with the usual accounting policies of the recipient,
with the following qualifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The value of donated land and buildings shall not exceed its fair market value at the time of donation to the recipient
as established by an independent appraiser (e.g., certified real property appraiser or General Services Administration
representative) and certified by a responsible official of the recipient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The value of donated equipment shall not exceed the fair market value of equipment of the same age and condition
at the time of donation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The value of donated space shall not exceed the fair rental value of comparable space as established by an independent
appraisal of comparable space and facilities in a privately-owned building in the same locality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The value of loaned equipment shall not exceed its fair rental value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The following requirements pertain to the recipient's supporting records for in-kind contributions from third
parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Volunteer services shall be documented and, to the extent feasible, supported by the same methods used by the recipient
for its own employees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The basis for determining the valuation for personal service, material, equipment, buildings and land shall
be documented.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The inclusion, unless waived by HUD, of costs that require prior approval in accordance with OMB Circular A&hyph;21,
``Cost Principles for Institutions of Higher Education,'' OMB Circular A&hyph;122, ``Cost Principles for Non-Profit
Organizations,'' or 45 CFR part 74 Appendix E, ``Principles for Determining Costs Applicable to Research and Development

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) No other prior approval requirements for specific items may be imposed unless a deviation has been approved by
OMB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Except for requirements listed in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(4) of this section, HUD is authorized, at its option,
to waive cost-related and administrative prior written approvals required by Circular A&hyph;110 and OMB Circulars
A&hyph;21 and A&hyph;122. Such waivers may include authorizing recipients to do any one or more of the following.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Incur pre-award costs 90 calendar days prior to award or more than 90 calendar days with the prior approval of HUD.
All pre-award costs are incurred at the recipient's risk (i.e., HUD is under no obligation to reimburse such costs
if for any reason the recipient does not receive an award or if the award is less than anticipated and inadequate to cover
such costs). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Initiate a one-time extension of the expiration date of the award of up to 12 months unless one or more of the following
conditions apply. For one-time extensions, the recipient must notify HUD in writing with the supporting reasons
and revised expiration date at least 10 days before the expiration date specified in the award. This one-time extension
may not be exercised merely for the purpose of using unobligated balances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) HUD may, at its option, restrict the transfer of funds among direct cost categories or programs, functions and
activities for awards in which the Federal share of the project exceeds $100,000 and the cumulative amount of such
transfers exceeds or is expected to exceed 10 percent of the total budget as last approved by HUD. HUD shall not permit
a transfer that would cause any Federal appropriation or part thereof to be used for purposes other than those consistent
with the original intent of the appropriation.

(i) No other prior approval requirements for specific items may be imposed unless a deviation has been approved by
OMB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) When HUD makes an award that provides support for both construction and nonconstruction work, HUD may require
the recipient to request prior approval from HUD before making any fund or budget transfers between the two types of
work supported. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(k) For both construction and nonconstruction awards, HUD shall require recipients to notify HUD in writing promptly
whenever the amount of Federal authorized funds is expected to exceed the needs of the recipient for the project period
by more than $5000 or five percent of the Federal award, whichever is greater. This notification shall not be required
if an application for additional funding is submitted for a continuation award. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(l) When requesting approval for budget revisions, recipients shall use the budget forms that were used in the application
unless HUD indicates a letter of request suffices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(m) Within 30 calendar days from the date of receipt of the request for budget revisions, HUD shall review the request
and notify the recipient whether the budget revisions have been approved. If the revision is still under consideration

For each kind of recipient, there is a set of Federal principles for determining allowable costs. Allowability of
costs shall be determined in accordance with the cost principles applicable to the entity incurring the costs. Thus,
allowability of costs incurred by State, local or federally-recognized Indian tribal governments is determined
in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A&hyph;87, ``Cost Principles for State and Local Governments.''
The allowability of costs incurred by non-profit organizations is determined in accordance with the provisions
of OMB Circular A&hyph;122, ``Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations.'' The allowability of costs incurred
by institutions of higher education is determined in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A&hyph;21, ``Cost
Principles for Educational Institutions.'' The allowability of costs incurred by hospitals is determined in accordance
with the provisions of Appendix E of 45 CFR part 74, ``Principles for Determining Costs Applicable to Research and
Development Under Grants and Contracts with Hospitals.'' The allowability of costs incurred by commercial organizations
and those non-profit organizations listed in Attachment C to Circular A&hyph;122 is determined in accordance with

HUD prescribes the following requirements for recipients concerning the use and disposition of real property acquired
in whole or in part under awards: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Title to real property shall vest in the recipient subject to the condition that the recipient shall use the real
property for the authorized purpose of the project as long as it is needed and shall not encumber the property without
approval of HUD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The recipient shall obtain written approval by HUD for the use of real property in other federally-sponsored projects
when the recipient determines that the property is no longer needed for the purpose of the original project. Use in
other projects shall be limited to those under federally-sponsored projects (i.e., awards) or programs that have
purposes consistent with those authorized for support by HUD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) When the real property is no longer needed as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the recipient shall
request disposition instructions from HUD or its successor Federal awarding agency. HUD shall observe one or more
of the following disposition instructions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The recipient may be permitted to retain title without further obligation to the Federal Government after it compensates
the Federal Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the property attributable to the Federal
participation in the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The recipient may be directed to sell the property under guidelines provided by HUD and pay the Federal Government
for that percentage of the current fair market value of the property attributable to the Federal participation in
the project (after deducting actual and reasonable selling and fix-up expenses, if any, from the sales proceeds).
When the recipient is authorized or required to sell the property, proper sales procedures shall be established that
provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible return. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The recipient may be directed to transfer title to the property to the Federal Government or to an eligible third
party provided that, in such cases, the recipient shall be entitled to compensation for its attributable percentage
of the current fair market value of the property.

Federally-owned property. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Title to federally-owned property remains vested in the Federal Government. Recipients shall submit annually
an inventory listing of federally-owned property in their custody to HUD. Upon completion of the award or when the
property is no longer needed, the recipient shall report the property to HUD for further HUD utilization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If HUD has no further need for the property, it shall be declared excess and reported to the General Services Administration,
unless HUD has statutory authority to dispose of the property by alternative methods (e.g., the authority provided
by the Federal Technology Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 3710 (I)) to donate research equipment to educational and non-profit
organizations in accordance with E.O. 12821, ``Improving Mathematics and Science Education in Support of the National
Education Goals.'') Appropriate instructions shall be issued to the recipient by HUD.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Exempt property. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When statutory authority exists, HUD has the option to vest title to property acquired with Federal funds in the recipient
without further obligation to the Federal Government and under conditions HUD considers appropriate. Such property
is ``exempt property.'' Should HUD not establish conditions, title to exempt property upon acquisition shall vest
in the recipient without further obligation to the Federal Government.

(a) Title to equipment acquired by a recipient with Federal funds shall vest in the recipient, subject to conditions
of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The recipient shall not use equipment acquired with Federal funds to provide services to non-Federal outside
organizations for a fee that is less than private companies charge for equivalent services, unless specifically
authorized by Federal statute, for as long as the Federal Government retains an interest in the equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The recipient shall use the equipment in the project or program for which it was acquired as long as needed, whether
or not the project or program continues to be supported by Federal funds and shall not encumber the equipment without
approval of HUD. When the equipment is no longer needed for the original project or program, the recipient shall use
the equipment in connection with its other federally-sponsored activities, in the following order of priority:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Activities sponsored by HUD which funded the original project; then 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Activities sponsored by other Federal awarding agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) During the time that equipment is used on the project or program for which it was acquired, the recipient shall make
it available for use on other projects or programs if such other use will not interfere with the work on the project or
program for which the equipment was originally acquired. First preference for such other use shall be given to other
projects or programs sponsored by HUD that financed the equipment; second preference shall be given to projects or
programs sponsored by other Federal awarding agencies. If the equipment is owned by the Federal Government, use on
other activities not sponsored by the Federal Government shall be permissible if authorized by HUD. User charges
shall be treated as program income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) When acquiring replacement equipment, the recipient may use the equipment to be replaced as trade-in or sell the
equipment and use the proceeds to offset the costs of the replacement equipment subject to the approval of HUD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) When the recipient no longer needs the equipment, the equipment may be used for other activities in accordance
with the following standards. For equipment with a current per unit fair market value of $5000 or more, the recipient
may retain the equipment for other uses provided that compensation is made to HUD or its successor. The amount of compensation
shall be computed by applying the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the original project or program
to the current fair market value of the equipment. If the recipient has no need for the equipment, the recipient shall
request disposition instructions from HUD. HUD shall determine whether the equipment can be used to meet HUD's requirements.
If no requirement exists within HUD, the availability of the equipment shall be reported to the General Services Administration
by HUD to determine whether a requirement for the equipment exists in other Federal agencies. HUD shall issue instructions
to the recipient no later than 120 calendar days after the recipient's request and the following procedures shall

Purpose of procurement standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 84.41 through 84.48 set forth standards for use by recipients in establishing procedures for the procurement
of supplies and other expendable property, equipment, real property and other services with Federal funds. These
standards are furnished to ensure that such materials and services are obtained in an effective manner and in compliance
with the provisions of applicable Federal statutes and executive orders. No additional procurement standards or
requirements shall be imposed by HUD upon recipients, unless specifically required by Federal statute or executive
order or approved by OMB.

Recipient responsibilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The standards contained in this section do not relieve the recipient of the contractual responsibilities arising
under its contract(s). The recipient is the responsible authority, without recourse to HUD, regarding the settlement
and satisfaction of all contractual and administrative issues arising out of procurements entered into in support
of an award or other agreement. This includes disputes, claims, protests of award, source evaluation or other matters
of a contractual nature. Matters concerning violation of statute are to be referred to such Federal, State or local
authority as may have proper jurisdiction.

Codes of conduct. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The recipient shall maintain written standards of conduct governing the performance of its employees engaged in
the award and administration of contracts. No employee, officer, or agent shall participate in the selection, award,
or administration of a contract supported by Federal funds if a real or apparent conflict of interest would be involved.
Such a conflict would arise when the employee, officer, or agent, any member of his or her immediate family, his or her
partner, or an organization which employs or is about to employ any of the parties indicated herein, has a financial
or other interest in the firm selected for an award. The officers, employees, and agents of the recipient shall neither
solicit nor accept gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors, or parties to subagreements.
However, recipients may set standards for situations in which the financial interest is not substantial or the gift
is an unsolicited item of nominal value. The standards of conduct shall provide for disciplinary actions to be applied
for violations of such standards by officers, employees, or agents of the recipient.

Competition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All procurement transactions shall be conducted in a manner to provide, to the maximum extent practical, open and
free competition. The recipient shall be alert to organizational conflicts of interest as well as noncompetitive
practices among contractors that may restrict or eliminate competition or otherwise restrain trade. In order to
ensure objective contractor performance and eliminate unfair competitive advantage, contractors that develop
or draft specifications, requirements, statements of work, invitations for bids and/or requests for proposals
shall be excluded from competing for such procurements. Awards shall be made to the bidder or offeror whose bid or offer
is responsive to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the recipient, price, quality and other factors considered.
The other factors shall include the bidder's or offeror's compliance with Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development
Act of 1968 (12 U.S.C. 1701u), hereafter referred to as ``Section 3.'' Section 3 provides that, to the greatest extent
feasible, and consistent with existing Federal, State, and local laws, and regulations, economic opportunities
generated by certain HUD financial assistance shall be directed to low- and very low-income persons. Solicitations
shall clearly set forth all requirements that the bidder or offeror shall fulfill in order for the bid or offer to be
evaluated by the recipient. Any and all bids or offers may be rejected when it is in the recipient's interest to do so.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) All recipients shall establish written procurement procedures. These procedures shall provide for, at a minimum,
that paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Recipients avoid purchasing unnecessary items. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Where appropriate, an analysis is made of lease and purchase alternatives to determine which would be the most
economical and practical procurement for the Federal Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Solicitations for goods and services provide for all of the following. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for the material, product or service to be procured.
In competitive procurements, such a description shall not contain features which unduly restrict competition.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Requirements which the bidder/offeror must fulfill and all other factors to be used in evaluating bids or proposals.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A description, whenever practicable, of technical requirements in terms of functions to be performed or performance
required, including the range of acceptable characteristics or minimum acceptable standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The specific features of ``brand name or equal'' descriptions that bidders are required to meet when such items
are included in the solicitation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The acceptance, to the extent practicable and economically feasible, of products and services dimensioned in
the metric system of measurement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Preference, to the extent practicable and economically feasible, for products and services that conserve natural
resources and protect the environment and are energy efficient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Positive efforts shall be made by recipients to utilize small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's
business enterprises, whenever possible. Recipients of Federal awards shall take all of the following steps to further
this goal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Ensure that small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises are used to the fullest
extent practicable.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Make information on forthcoming opportunities available and arrange time frames for purchases and contracts
to encourage and facilitate participation by small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Consider in the contract process whether firms competing for larger contracts intend to subcontract with small
businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Encourage contracting with consortiums of small businesses, minority-owned firms and women's business enterprises
when a contract is too large for one of these firms to handle individually.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Use the services and assistance, as appropriate, of such organizations as the Small Business Administration
and the Department of Commerce's Minority Business Development Agency in the solicitation and utilization of small
businesses, minority-owned firms and women's business enterprises.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The type of procuring instruments used (e.g., fixed price contracts, cost reimbursable contracts, purchase
orders, and incentive contracts) shall be determined by the recipient but shall be appropriate for the particular
procurement and for promoting the best interest of the program or project involved. The ``cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost''
or ``percentage of construction cost'' methods of contracting shall not be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Contracts shall be made only with responsible contractors who possess the potential ability to perform successfully
under the terms and conditions of the proposed procurement. Consideration shall be given to such matters as contractor
integrity; compliance with public policy, including, where applicable, Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development
Act of 1968 (12 U.S.C. 1701u); record of past performance; financial and technical resources or accessibility to
other necessary resources. In certain circumstances, contracts with certain parties are restricted by implementation
of E.O.s 12549 and 12689, ``Debarment and Suspension,'' at 24 CFR part 24.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Recipients shall, on request, make available for the Federal awarding agency, pre-award review and procurement
documents, such as requests for proposals or invitations for bids, independent cost estimates, etc., when any of
the following conditions apply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A recipient's procurement procedures or operation fails to comply with the procurement standards in HUD's implementation
of Circular A&hyph;110.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The procurement is expected to exceed $100,000 or the small purchase threshold fixed at 41 U.S.C. 403 (11), whichever
is greater, and is to be awarded without competition or only one bid or offer is received in response to a solicitation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The procurement, which is expected to exceed the small purchase threshold, specifies a ``brand name'' product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The proposed award over the small purchase threshold is to be awarded to other than the apparent low bidder under
a sealed bid procurement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) A proposed contract modification changes the scope of a contract or increases the contract amount by more than
the amount of the small purchase threshold.

(a) Contracts in excess of the small purchase threshold shall contain contractual provisions or conditions that
allow for administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances in which a contractor violates or breaches
the contract terms, and provide for such remedial actions as may be appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) All contracts in excess of the small purchase threshold shall contain suitable provisions for termination by
the recipient, including the manner by which termination shall be effected and the basis for settlement. In addition,
such contracts shall describe conditions under which the contract may be terminated for default as well as conditions
where the contract may be terminated because of circumstances beyond the control of the contractor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Except as otherwise required by statute, an award that requires the contracting (or subcontracting) for construction
or facility improvements shall provide for the recipient to follow its own requirements relating to bid guarantees,
performance bonds, and payment bonds unless the construction contract or subcontract exceeds $100,000. For those
contracts or subcontracts exceeding $100,000, HUD may accept the bonding policy and requirements of the recipient,
provided HUD has made a determination that the Federal Government's interest is adequately protected. If such a determination
has not been made, the minimum requirements shall be as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A bid guarantee from each bidder equivalent to five percent of the bid price. The ``bid guarantee'' shall consist
of a firm commitment such as a bid bond, certified check, or other negotiable instrument accompanying a bid as assurance
that the bidder shall, upon acceptance of his bid, execute such contractual documents as may be required within the
time specified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A performance bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price. A ``performance bond'' is
one executed in connection with a contract to secure fulfillment of all the contractor's obligations under such contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A payment bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price. A ``payment bond'' is one executed
in connection with a contract to assure payment as required by statute of all persons supplying labor and material
in the execution of the work provided for in the contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Where bonds are required in the situations described herein, the bonds shall be obtained from companies holding
certificates of authority as acceptable sureties pursuant to 31 CFR part 223, ``Surety Companies Doing Business
with the United States.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) All negotiated contracts (except those for less than the small purchase threshold) awarded by recipients shall
include a provision to the effect that the recipient, HUD, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their
duly authorized representatives, shall have access to any books, documents, papers and records of the contractor
which are directly pertinent to a specific program for the purpose of making audits, examinations, excerpts and transcriptions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

be due 30 days after the reporting period. HUD may require annual reports before the anniversary dates of multiple
year awards in lieu of these requirements. The final performance reports are due 90 calendar days after the expiration
or termination of the award.

of the investigator, or both. Whenever appropriate and the output of programs or projects can be readily quantified,
such quantitative data should be related to cost data for computation of unit costs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Reasons why established goals were not met, if appropriate.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) HUD requires recipients to use the SF&hyph;269 or SF&hyph;269A to report the status of funds for all nonconstruction
projects or programs. HUD has the option of not requiring the SF&hyph;269 or SF&hyph;269A when the SF&hyph;270, Request
for Advance or Reimbursement, or SF&hyph;272, Report of Federal Cash Transactions, is determined to provide adequate
information to meet its needs, except that a final SF&hyph;269 or SF&hyph;269A shall be required at the completion
of the project when the SF&hyph;270 is used only for advances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) HUD shall prescribe whether the report shall be on a cash or accrual basis. If HUD requires accrual information
and the recipient's accounting records are not normally kept on the accrual basis, the recipient shall not be required
to convert its accounting system, but shall develop such accrual information through best estimates based on an analysis
of the documentation on hand. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) HUD shall determine the frequency of the Financial Status Report for each project or program, considering the
size and complexity of the particular project or program. However, the report shall not be required more frequently
than quarterly or less frequently than annually. A final report shall be required at the completion of the agreement.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) HUD requires recipients to submit the SF&hyph;269 or SF&hyph;269A (an original and no more than two copies) no
later than 30 days after the end of each specified reporting period for quarterly and semi-annual reports, and 90 calendar
days for annual and final reports. Extensions of reporting due dates may be approved by HUD upon request of the recipient.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) SF&hyph;272, Report of Federal Cash Transactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) When funds are advanced to recipients HUD shall require each recipient to submit the SF&hyph;272 and, when necessary,
its continuation sheet, SF&hyph;272a. HUD shall use this report to monitor cash advanced to recipients and to obtain
disbursement information for each agreement with the recipients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) HUD may require forecasts of Federal cash requirements in the ``Remarks'' section of the report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) When practical and deemed necessary, HUD may require recipients to report in the ``Remarks'' section the amount
of cash advances received and retained in excess of three days. Recipients shall provide short narrative explanations
of actions taken to reduce the excess balances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Recipients shall be required to submit not more than the original and two copies of the SF&hyph;272 15 calendar
days following the end of each quarter. HUD may require a monthly report from those recipients receiving advances
totaling $1 million or more per year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) HUD may waive the requirement for submission of the SF&hyph;272 for any one of the following reasons: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) When monthly advances do not exceed $25,000 per recipient, provided that such advances are monitored through
other forms contained in this section; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) If, in HUD's opinion, the recipient's accounting controls are adequate to minimize excessive Federal advances;
or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) When the electronic payment mechanisms provide adequate data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) When HUD needs additional information or more frequent reports, the following shall be observed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) When additional information is needed to comply with legislative requirements, HUD shall issue instructions
to require recipients to submit such information under the ``Remarks'' section of the reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) When HUD determines that a recipient's accounting system does not meet the standards in &sect;84.21, additional
pertinent information to further monitor awards may be obtained upon written notice to the recipient until such time
as the system is brought up to standard. HUD, in obtaining this information, shall comply with report clearance requirements
of 5 CFR part 1320. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) HUD will shade out any line item on any report if not necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) HUD may accept the identical information from the recipients in machine readable format or computer printouts
or electronic outputs in lieu of prescribed formats. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) HUD may provide computer or electronic outputs to recipients when such expedites or contributes to the accuracy
of reporting.

Retention and access requirements for records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) This section sets forth requirements for record retention and access to records for awards to recipients. HUD
shall not impose any other record retention or access requirements upon recipients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Financial records, supporting documents, statistical records, and all other records pertinent to an award shall
be retained for a period of three years from the date of submission of the final expenditure report or, for awards that
are renewed quarterly or annually, from the date of the submission of the quarterly or annual financial report, as
authorized by HUD. The only exceptions are the following. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If any litigation, claim, or audit is started before the expiration of the 3-year period, the records shall be retained
until all litigation, claims or audit findings involving the records have been resolved and final action taken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Records for real property and equipment acquired with Federal funds shall be retained for 3 years after final disposition.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) When records are transferred to or maintained by HUD, the 3-year retention requirement is not applicable to the
recipient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocation plans, etc. as specified in &sect;84.53(g). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Copies of original records may be substituted for the original records if authorized by HUD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) HUD shall request transfer of certain records to its custody from recipients when it determines that the records
possess long term retention value. However, in order to avoid duplicate recordkeeping, HUD may make arrangements
for recipients to retain any records that are continuously needed for joint use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) HUD, the Inspector General, Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives,
have the right of timely and unrestricted access to any books, documents, papers, or other records of recipients that
are pertinent to the awards, in order to make audits, examinations, excerpts, transcripts and copies of such documents.
This right also includes timely and reasonable access to a recipient's personnel for the purpose of interview and
discussion related to such documents. The rights of access in this paragraph (e) are not limited to the required retention
period, but shall last as long as records are retained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Unless required by statute, HUD shall not place restrictions on recipients that limit public access to the records
of recipients that are pertinent to an award, except when HUD can demonstrate that such records shall be kept confidential
and would have been exempted from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) if the records
had belonged to HUD.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section apply to the following types of documents, and their supporting records_indirect
cost rate computations or proposals, cost allocation plans, and any similar accounting computations of the rate
at which a particular group of costs is chargeable (such as computer usage chargeback rates or composite fringe benefit
rates).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
If submitted for negotiation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the recipient submits to HUD or the subrecipient submits to the recipient the proposal, plan, or other computation
to form the basis for negotiation of the rate, then the 3-year retention period for its supporting records starts on
the date of such submission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

other computation and its supporting records starts at the end of the fiscal year (or other accounting period) covered
by the proposal, plan, or other computation.

Remedies for noncompliance
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. If a recipient materially fails to comply with the terms and conditions of an award, whether stated in a Federal statute,
regulation, assurance, application, or notice of award, HUD may, in addition to imposing any of the special conditions
outlined in &sect;84.14, take one or more of the following actions, as appropriate in the circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Temporarily withhold cash payments pending correction of the deficiency by the recipient or more severe enforcement
action by HUD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Disallow (that is, deny both use of funds and any applicable matching credit for) all or part of the cost of the activity
or action not in compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the current award. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Hearings and appeals
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Effects of suspension and termination
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Costs of a recipient resulting from obligations incurred by the recipient during a suspension or after termination
of an award are not allowable unless HUD expressly authorizes them in the notice of suspension or termination or subsequently.
Other recipient costs during suspension or after termination which are necessary and not reasonably avoidable are
allowable if paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The costs result from obligations which were properly incurred by the recipient before the effective date of suspension
or termination, are not in anticipation of it, and in the case of a termination, are noncancellable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The costs would be allowable if the award were not suspended or expired normally at the end of the funding period
in which the termination takes effect.

Definition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) A lump sum award is an award for a predetermined amount, as set forth in the grant agreement, which amount does not
vary with the amount of the recipient's actual incurred costs. Under this type of award, HUD does not pay the recipient
for its incurred costs but rather for completing certain defined events in the work or achievement of some other well-defined
milestone. Some of the ways in which the grant amount may be paid are, but are not limited to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) In several partial payments, the amount of each agreed upon in advance, and the ``milestone'' or event triggering
the payment also agreed upon in advance, and set forth in the grant; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) On a unit price basis, for a defined unit or units (such as a housing counseling unit), at a defined price or prices,
agreed to in advance of performance of the grant and set forth in the grant; or, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) In one payment at grant completion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The key distinction between a lump sum and a cost reimbursement grant is the lack of a direct relationship between
the costs incurred by the recipient and the amount paid by HUD in the lump sum arrangement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the provisions of this subpart E, subparts A and B of this part apply to lump sum grants.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Financial and program management. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section prescribe standards for financial management systems, methods for making
payments, budget revision approvals, and making audits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Standards for financial management systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Records that identify adequately the source and application of funds for federally-sponsored activities are
required. These records shall contain information pertaining to Federal awards, authorizations, obligations,
unobligated balances, assets, outlays, income and interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Effective control over and accountability for all funds, property and other assets are required. Recipients
shall adequately safeguard all such assets and assure they are used solely for authorized purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Comparison of outlays with budget amounts for each award is required. Whenever appropriate, financial information
should be related to performance and unit cost data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Where HUD guarantees or insures the repayment of money borrowed by the recipient, HUD, at its discretion, may require
adequate bonding and insurance if the bonding and insurance requirements of the recipient are not deemed adequate
to protect the interest of the Federal Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) HUD may require adequate fidelity bond coverage where the recipient lacks sufficient coverage to protect the
Federal Government's interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Where bonds are required in the situations described above, the bonds shall be obtained from companies holding
certificates of authority as acceptable sureties, as prescribed in 31 CFR part 223, ``Surety Companies Doing Business
with the United States.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Payment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The standard governing the use of banks and other institutions as depositories of funds advanced under awards
is, HUD shall not require separate depository accounts for funds provided to a recipient or establish any eligibility
requirements for depositories for funds provided to a recipient. However, recipients must be able to account for
the receipt, obligation and expenditure of funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Consistent with the national goal of expanding the opportunities for women-owned and minority-owned business
enterprises, recipients shall be encouraged to use women-owned and minority-owned banks (a bank which is owned at
least 50 percent by women or minority group members). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Except as noted elsewhere in this part, only the following forms shall be authorized for the recipients in requesting
payments. HUD shall not require more than an original and two copies of these forms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
SF-270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD has adopted the SF-270 as a standard form for all nonconstruction programs when electronic funds transfer or predetermined
advance methods are not used. The SF-270 shall also be used for lump sum payment requests. HUD, however, has the option
of using this form for construction programs in lieu of the SF-271, ``Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement
for Construction Programs.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
SF-271, Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD has adopted the SF-271 as the standard form to be used for requesting reimbursement for construction programs.
However, HUD may substitute the SF-270 when HUD determines that it provides adequate information to meet HUD's needs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Revision of budget and program plans. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The budget plan is the financial expression of the project or program as approved during the award process. It may
include either the Federal and non-Federal share, or only the Federal share, depending upon HUD requirements. It
shall be related to performance for program evaluation purposes whenever appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Recipients are required to report deviations from program plans, and request prior approvals for budget and program
plan revisions, in accordance with this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) For nonconstruction awards, recipients shall request prior approvals from HUD for one or more of the following
program or budget related reasons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Change in the scope or the objective of the project or program (even if there is no associated budget revision requiring
prior written approval).

following. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Initiate a one-time extension of the expiration date of the award of up to 12 months unless one or more of the following
conditions apply. For one-time extensions, the recipient must notify HUD in writing with the supporting reasons

unless: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The terms and conditions of award prohibit the extension. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The extension requires additional Federal funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

OMB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) When HUD makes an award that provides support for both construction and nonconstruction work, HUD may require
the recipient to request prior approval from HUD before making any fund or budget transfers between the two types of
work supported. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Non-Federal audits. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Recipients and subrecipients that are institutions of higher education or other non-profit organizations shall
be subject to the audit requirements contained in OMB Circular A&hyph;133, ``Audits of Institutions of Higher Education
and Other Non-Profit Institutions,'' as codified in 24 CFR part 44. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) State and local governments shall be subject to the audit requirements contained in the Single Audit Act (31 U.S.C.

Purpose of property standards.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section set forth uniform standards governing management and disposition of property
furnished by the Federal Government whose cost was charged to a project supported by a Federal award. HUD shall require
recipients to observe these standards under awards and shall not impose additional requirements, unless specifically
required by Federal statute. The recipient may use its own property management standards and procedures provided
it observes the provisions of paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Insurance coverage. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Recipients shall, at a minimum, provide the equivalent insurance coverage for real property and equipment acquired
with Federal funds as provided to property owned by the recipient. Federally-owned property need not be insured unless
required by the terms and conditions of the award. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Real property. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD prescribes the following requirements for recipients concerning the use and disposition of real property acquired
in whole or in part under awards: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Title to real property shall vest in the recipient subject to the condition that the recipient shall use the real
property for the authorized purpose of the project as long as it is needed and shall not encumber the property without
approval of HUD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The recipient shall obtain written approval by HUD for the use of real property in other federally-sponsored projects
when the recipient determines that the property is no longer needed for the purpose of the original project. Use in
other projects shall be limited to those under federally-sponsored projects (i.e., awards) or programs that have
purposes consistent with those authorized for support by HUD.

Federally-owned and exempt property. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Federally-owned property. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Title to federally-owned property remains vested in the Federal Government. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Recipients shall submit annually an inventory listing of federally-owned property in their custody to HUD. Upon
completion of the award or when the property is no longer needed, the recipient shall report the property to HUD for
further HUD utilization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If HUD has no further need for the property, it shall be declared excess and reported to the General Services Administration,
unless HUD has statutory authority to dispose of the property by alternative methods (e.g., the authority provided
by the Federal Technology Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 3710 (I)) to donate research equipment to educational and non-profit
organizations in accordance with E.O. 12821, ``Improving Mathematics and Science Education in Support of the National
Education Goals.'') Appropriate instructions shall be issued to the recipient by HUD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Exempt property. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When statutory authority exists, HUD has the option to vest title to property acquired with Federal funds in the recipient
without further obligation to the Federal Government and under conditions HUD considers appropriate. Such property
is ``exempt property.'' Should HUD not establish conditions, title to exempt property upon acquisition shall vest
in the recipient without further obligation to the Federal Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Title to equipment acquired by a recipient with Federal funds shall vest in the recipient, subject to conditions
of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The recipient shall use the equipment in the project or program for which it was acquired as long as needed, whether
or not the project or program continues to be supported by Federal funds and shall not encumber the equipment without
approval of HUD. When the equipment is no longer needed for the original project or program, the recipient shall use
the equipment in connection with its other federally-sponsored activities, in the following order of priority:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Activities sponsored by HUD which funded the original project; then 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Activities sponsored by other Federal awarding agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) During the time that equipment is used on the project or program for which it was acquired, the recipient shall make
it available for use on other projects or programs if such other use will not interfere with the work on the project or
program for which the equipment was originally acquired. First preference for such other use shall be given to other
projects or programs sponsored by HUD that financed the equipment; second preference shall be given to projects or
programs sponsored by other Federal awarding agencies. If the equipment is owned by the Federal Government, use on
other activities not sponsored by the Federal Government shall be permissible if authorized by HUD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The recipient's property management standards for equipment acquired with Federal funds and federally-owned
equipment shall include all of the following. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(F) Location and condition of the equipment and the date the information was reported. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Equipment owned by the Federal Government shall be identified to indicate Federal ownership. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A physical inventory of equipment shall be taken and the results reconciled with the equipment records at least
once every two years. Any differences between quantities determined by the physical inspection and those shown in
the accounting records shall be investigated to determine the causes of the difference. The recipient shall, in connection
with the inventory, verify the existence, current utilization, and continued need for the equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) A control system shall be in effect to insure adequate safeguards to prevent loss, damage, or theft of the equipment.
Any loss, damage, or theft of equipment shall be investigated and fully documented; if the equipment was owned by the
Federal Government, the recipient shall promptly notify HUD.

(5) HUD may reserve the right to transfer the title to the Federal Government or to a third party named by the Federal
Government when such third party is otherwise eligible under existing statutes. Such transfer shall be subject to
the following standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(1) The recipient may copyright any work that is subject to copyright and was developed, or for which ownership was
purchased, under an award. HUD reserves a royalty-free, nonexclusive and irrevocable right to reproduce, publish,
or otherwise use the work for Federal purposes, and to authorize others to do so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Recipients are subject to applicable regulations governing patents and inventions, including government-wide
regulations issued by the Department of Commerce at 37 CFR part 401, ``Rights to Inventions Made by Nonprofit Organizations
and Small Business Firms Under Government Grants, Contracts and Cooperative Agreements.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Title to intangible property and debt instruments acquired under an award or subaward vests upon acquisition
in the recipient. The recipient shall use that property for the originally-authorized purpose.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Purpose of procurement standards. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraphs (b) through (i) of this section set forth standards for use by recipients in establishing procedures for
the procurement of supplies and other expendable property, equipment, real property and other services with Federal
funds. These standards are furnished to ensure that such materials and services are obtained in an effective manner
and in compliance with the provisions of applicable Federal statutes and executive orders. No additional procurement
standards or requirements shall be imposed by HUD upon recipients, unless specifically required by Federal statute
or executive order or approved by OMB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Recipient responsibilities. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The standards contained in this section do not relieve the recipient of the contractual responsibilities arising
under its contract(s). The recipient is the responsible authority, without recourse to HUD, regarding the settlement
and satisfaction of all contractual and administrative issues arising out of procurements entered into in support
of an award or other agreement. This includes disputes, claims, protests of award, source evaluation or other matters
of a contractual nature. Matters concerning violation of statute are to be referred to such Federal, State or local
authority as may have proper jurisdiction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Codes of conduct. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The recipient shall maintain written standards of conduct governing the performance of its employees engaged in
the award and administration of contracts. No employee, officer, or agent shall participate in the selection, award,
or administration of a contract supported by Federal funds if a real or apparent conflict of interest would be involved.
Such a conflict would arise when the employee, officer, or agent, any member of his or her immediate family, his or her
partner, or an organization which employs or is about to employ any of the parties indicated herein, has a financial
or other interest in the firm selected for an award. The officers, employees, and agents of the recipient shall neither
solicit nor accept gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors, or parties to subagreements.
However, recipients may set standards for situations in which the financial interest is not substantial or the gift
is an unsolicited item of nominal value. The standards of conduct shall provide for disciplinary actions to be applied
for violations of such standards by officers, employees, or agents of the recipient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Competition. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All procurement transactions shall be conducted in a manner to provide, to the maximum extent practical, open and
free competition. The recipient shall be alert to organizational conflicts of interest as well as noncompetitive
practices among contractors that may restrict or eliminate competition or otherwise restrain trade. In order to
ensure objective contractor performance and eliminate unfair competitive advantage, contractors that develop
or draft specifications, requirements, statements of work, invitations for bids and/or requests for proposals
shall be excluded from competing for such procurements. Awards shall be made to the bidder or offeror whose bid or offer
is responsive to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the recipient, price, quality and other factors considered.
The other factors shall include the bidder's or offeror's compliance with Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development
Act of 1968 (12 U.S.C. 1701u), hereafter referred to as ``Section 3.'' Section 3 provides that, to the greatest extent
feasible, and consistent with existing Federal, State, and local laws, and regulations, economic opportunities
generated by certain HUD financial assistance shall be directed to low- and very low-income persons. Solicitations
shall clearly set forth all requirements that the bidder or offeror shall fulfill in order for the bid or offer to be
evaluated by the recipient. Any and all bids or offers may be rejected when it is in the recipient's interest to do so.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) All recipients shall establish written procurement procedures. These procedures shall provide for, at a minimum,
that paragraphs (e)(1)(i), (e)(1)(ii) and (e)(1)(iii) of this section apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Recipients avoid purchasing unnecessary items. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Where appropriate, an analysis is made of lease and purchase alternatives to determine which would be the most
economical and practical procurement for the recipient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Solicitations for goods and services provide for all of the following. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) A clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for the material, product or service to be procured.
In competitive procurements, such a description shall not contain features which unduly restrict competition.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Requirements which the bidder/offeror must fulfill and all other factors to be used in evaluating bids or proposals.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

required, including the range of acceptable characteristics or minimum acceptable standards.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) The specific features of ``brand name or equal'' descriptions that bidders are required to meet when such items
are included in the solicitation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

resources and protect the environment and are energy efficient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Positive efforts shall be made by recipients to utilize small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's
business enterprises, whenever possible. Recipients of Federal awards shall take all of the following steps to further
this goal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Ensure that small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises are used to the fullest
extent practicable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Make information on forthcoming opportunities available and arrange time frames for purchases and contracts
to encourage and facilitate participation by small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Consider in the contract process whether firms competing for larger contracts intend to subcontract with small
businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Encourage contracting with consortiums of small businesses, minority-owned firms and women's business enterprises
when a contract is too large for one of these firms to handle individually. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Use the services and assistance, as appropriate, of such organizations as the Small Business Administration
and the Department of Commerce's Minority Business Development Agency in the solicitation and utilization of small
businesses, minority-owned firms and women's business enterprises. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The type of procuring instruments used (e.g., fixed price contracts, cost reimbursable contracts, purchase
orders, and incentive contracts) shall be determined by the recipient but shall be appropriate for the particular
procurement and for promoting the best interest of the program or project involved. The ``cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost''
or ``percentage of construction cost'' methods of contracting shall not be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Contracts shall be made only with responsible contractors who possess the potential ability to perform successfully
under the terms and conditions of the proposed procurement. Consideration shall be given to such matters as contractor
integrity; compliance with public policy, including, where applicable, Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development
Act of 1968 (12 U.S.C. 1701u); record of past performance; financial and technical resources or accessibility to
other necessary resources. In certain circumstances, contracts with certain parties are restricted by agencies'
implementation of E.O.'s 12549 and 12689, ``Debarment and Suspension,'' as set forth at 24 CFR part 24. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Recipients shall, on request, make available for the Federal awarding agency, pre-award review and procurement
documents, such as requests for proposals or invitations for bids, independent cost estimates, etc., when any of
the following conditions apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A recipient's procurement procedures or operation fails to comply with the procurement standards in HUD's implementation
of Circular A&hyph;110. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The procurement is expected to exceed $100,000 or the small purchase threshold fixed at 41 U.S.C. 403 (11), whichever
is greater, and is to be awarded without competition or only one bid or offer is received in response to a solicitation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The procurement, which is expected to exceed the small purchase threshold, specifies a ``brand name'' product.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The proposed award over the small purchase threshold is to be awarded to other than the apparent low bidder under
a sealed bid procurement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) A proposed contract modification changes the scope of a contract or increases the contract amount by more than
the amount of the small purchase threshold. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Cost and price analysis. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some form of cost or price analysis shall be made and documented in the procurement files in connection with every procurement
action. Price analysis may be accomplished in various ways, including the comparison of price quotations submitted,
market prices and similar indicia, together with discounts. Cost analysis is the review and evaluation of each element
of cost to determine reasonableness, allocability and allowability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Procurement records. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Procurement records and files for purchases in excess of the small purchase threshold shall include the following
at a minimum: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Basis for contractor selection; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Justification for lack of competition when competitive bids or offers are not obtained; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Basis for award cost or price. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Contract administration. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A system for contract administration shall be maintained to ensure contractor conformance with the terms, conditions
and specifications of the contract and to ensure adequate and timely follow up of all purchases. Recipients shall
evaluate contractor performance and document, as appropriate, whether contractors have met the terms, conditions
and specifications of the contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Contract provisions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The recipient shall include, in addition to provisions to define a sound and complete agreement, the following provisions
in all contracts. The following provisions shall also be applied to subcontracts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Contracts in excess of the small purchase threshold shall contain contractual provisions or conditions that
allow for administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances in which a contractor violates or breaches
the contract terms, and provide for such remedial actions as may be appropriate.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) All contracts in excess of the small purchase threshold shall contain suitable provisions for termination by
the recipient, including the manner by which termination shall be effected and the basis for settlement. In addition,
such contracts shall describe conditions under which the contract may be terminated for default as well as conditions
where the contract may be terminated because of circumstances beyond the control of the contractor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Except as otherwise required by statute, an award that requires the contracting (or subcontracting) for construction
or facility improvements shall provide for the recipient to follow its own requirements relating to bid guarantees,
performance bonds, and payment bonds unless the construction contract or subcontract exceeds $100,000. For those
contracts or subcontracts exceeding $100,000, HUD may accept the bonding policy and requirements of the recipient,
provided HUD has made a determination that the Federal Government's interest is adequately protected. If such a determination
has not been made, the minimum requirements shall be as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A bid guarantee from each bidder equivalent to five percent of the bid price. The ``bid guarantee'' shall consist
of a firm commitment such as a bid bond, certified check, or other negotiable instrument accompanying a bid as assurance
that the bidder shall, upon acceptance of his bid, execute such contractual documents as may be required within the
time specified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A performance bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price. A ``performance bond''
is one executed in connection with a contract to secure fulfillment of all the contractor's obligations under such
contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A payment bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price. A ``payment bond'' is one executed
in connection with a contract to assure payment as required by statute of all persons supplying labor and material
in the execution of the work provided for in the contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Where bonds are required in the situations described herein, the bonds shall be obtained from companies holding
certificates of authority as acceptable sureties pursuant to 31 CFR part 223, ``Surety Companies Doing Business
with the United States.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) All negotiated contracts (except those for less than the small purchase threshold) awarded by recipients shall
include a provision to the effect that the recipient, HUD, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their
duly authorized representatives, shall have access to any books, documents, papers and records of the contractor
which are directly pertinent to a specific program for the purpose of making audits, examinations, excerpts and transcriptions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) All contracts, including small purchases, awarded by recipients and their contractors shall contain the procurement
provisions of Appendix A to this rule, as applicable.

Purpose of reports and records. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section set forth the procedures for monitoring and reporting on the recipient's financial
and program performance and the necessary standard reporting forms. They also set forth record retention requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Monitoring and reporting program performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Recipients are responsible for managing and monitoring each project, program, subaward, function or activity
supported by the award. Recipients shall monitor subawards to ensure subrecipients have met the audit requirements
as delineated in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;84.82(e). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Federal awarding agency shall prescribe the frequency with which the performance reports shall be submitted.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(6) of this section, performance reports shall not be required more frequently
than quarterly or less frequently than annually. Annual reports shall be due 90 calendar days after the grant year;
quarterly or semi-annual reports shall be due 30 days after the reporting period. The Federal awarding agency may
require annual reports before the anniversary dates of multiple year awards in lieu of these requirements. The final
performance reports are due 90 calendar days after the expiration or termination of the award. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If inappropriate, a final technical or performance report shall not be required after completion of the project.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) When required, performance reports shall generally contain, for each award, brief information on each of the
following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A comparison of actual accomplishments with the goals and objectives established for the period, the findings
of the investigator, or both. Whenever appropriate and the output of programs or projects can be readily quantified,
such quantitative data should be related to cost data for computation of unit costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Reasons why established goals were not met, if appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Recipients shall not be required to submit more than the original and two copies of performance reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Recipients shall immediately notify HUD of developments that have a significant impact on the award-supported
activities. Also, notification shall be given in the case of problems, delays, or adverse conditions which materially
impair the ability to meet the objectives of the award. This notification shall include a statement of the action taken
or contemplated, and any assistance needed to resolve the situation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) HUD may make site visits, as needed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Retention and access requirements for records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) This paragraph (c) sets forth requirements for record retention and access to records for awards to recipients.
Federal awarding agencies shall not impose any other record retention or access requirements upon recipients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Financial records, supporting documents, statistical records, and all other records pertinent to an award shall
be retained for a period of three years from the date of submission of the final expenditure report or, for awards that
are renewed quarterly or annually, from the date of the submission of the quarterly or annual financial report, as
authorized by HUD. The only exceptions are the following. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If any litigation, claim, or audit is started before the expiration of the 3-year period, the records shall be retained
until all litigation, claims or audit findings involving the records have been resolved and final action taken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Records for real property and equipment acquired with Federal funds shall be retained for 3 years after final
disposition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) When records are transferred to or maintained by the Federal awarding agency, the 3-year retention requirement
is not applicable to the recipient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Copies of original records may be substituted for the original records if authorized by HUD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) HUD shall request transfer of certain records to its custody from recipients when it determines that the records
possess long term retention value. However, in order to avoid duplicate recordkeeping, HUD may make arrangements
for recipients to retain any records that are continuously needed for joint use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) HUD, the Inspector General, Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives,
have the right of timely and unrestricted access to any books, documents, papers, or other records of recipients that
are pertinent to the awards, in order to make audits, examinations, excerpts, transcripts and copies of such documents.
This right also includes timely and reasonable access to a recipient's personnel for the purpose of interview and
discussion related to such documents. The rights of access in this paragraph (c)(5) are not limited to the required
retention period, but shall last as long as records are retained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Unless required by statute, HUD shall not place restrictions on recipients that limit public access to the records
of recipients that are pertinent to an award, except when HUD can demonstrate that such records shall be kept confidential
and would have been exempted from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) if the records
had belonged to HUD.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (1) Awards may be terminated in whole or in part only if paragraphs (a)(1)(i), (a)(1)(ii), or (a)(1)(iii) of this
section apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) By HUD, if a recipient materially fails to comply with the terms and conditions of an award. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) By HUD with the consent of the recipient, in which case the two parties shall agree upon the termination conditions,
including the effective date and, in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) By the recipient upon sending to HUD written notification setting forth the reasons for such termination, the
effective date, and, in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated. However, if HUD determines
in the case of partial termination that the reduced or modified portion of the grant will not accomplish the purposes
for which the grant was made, it may terminate the grant in its entirety under either paragraphs (a)(1)(i) or (a)(1)(ii)
of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If costs are allowed under an award, the responsibilities of the recipient referred to in &sect;84.87(a)(1),
including those for property management as applicable, shall be considered in the termination of the award, and provision
shall be made for continuing responsibilities of the recipient after termination, as appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If costs are allowed, the cost principles in &sect;84.27 apply, even though the award was made on a lump-sum basis.
Alternatively, a termination settlement may be reached by prorating the grant amount against the percentage of completion
or by some other method as determined by the Grant Officer, as long as the method used results in an equitable settlement
to both parties.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. If a recipient materially fails to comply with the terms and conditions of an award, whether stated in a Federal statute,
regulation, assurance, application, or notice of award, HUD may, in addition to imposing any of the special conditions
outlined in &sect;84.14, take one or more of the following actions, as appropriate in the circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Temporarily withhold cash payments pending correction of the deficiency by the recipient or more severe enforcement
action by HUD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the current award. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Hearings and appeals
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In taking an enforcement action, HUD shall provide the recipient an opportunity for hearing, appeal, or other administrative
proceeding to which the recipient is entitled under any statute or regulation applicable to the action involved.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Effects of suspension and termination
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Costs of a recipient resulting from obligations incurred by the recipient during a suspension or after termination
of an award are not allowable unless HUD expressly authorizes them in the notice of suspension or termination or subsequently.
Other recipient costs during suspension or after termination which are necessary and not reasonably avoidable are
allowable if paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (b)(3)(ii) of this section apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The costs result from obligations which were properly incurred by the recipient before the effective date of suspension
or termination, are not in anticipation of it, and in the case of a termination, are noncancellable.

standard workweek is permissible provided that the worker is compensated at a rate of not less than 11/2 times the basic
rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours in the workweek. Section 107 of the Act is applicable to construction
work and provides that no laborer or mechanic shall be required to work in surroundings or under working conditions
which are unsanitary, hazardous or dangerous. These requirements do not apply to the purchases of supplies or materials
or articles ordinarily available on the open market, or contracts for transportation or transmission of intelligence.
