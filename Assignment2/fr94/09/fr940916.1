SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The National Wool Act of 1954, as amended (Wool Act), requires the Secretary of Agriculture (Secretary), through
the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), to make loans and payments available to producers of wool and mohair through
December 31, 1995. This proposed rule would amend the regulations to set forth the support levels for shorn wool, wool
on unshorn lambs, and mohair for the 1995 marketing year.

Section 703(a) of the Wool Act provides that the Secretary shall, through the CCC, make loans and payments available
to producers of wool and mohair through December 31, 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 703(b) of the Wool Act provides that the support price for shorn wool for each of the marketing years 1991 through
1995 shall be 77.5 percent of an amount which is determined by multiplying 62 cents (the support price in 1965) by the
ratio of: (i) The average of the parity index (the index of prices paid by farmers, including commodities and services,
interest, taxes, and farm wage rates) for the three calendar years immediately preceding the calendar year in which
such support price is being determined and announced to (ii) the average parity index for the three calendar years
1958, 1959, and 1960, rounding the result to the nearest full cent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on current reported parity indices, the calculation for the 1995 shorn wool support price (grease basis) is
as follows:

Section 703(c) of the Wool Act provides that the support prices for pulled wool and for mohair shall be established
at such levels, in relationship to the support price for shorn wool, which is determined to maintain normal marketing
practices for pulled wool, and which is determined necessary to maintain approximately the same percentage of parity
for mohair as for shorn wool. Section 703(c) further provides that the support price for mohair must be within a range
of 15 per centum above or below the comparable percentage of parity at which shorn wool is supported. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 704(a) provides that payments shall be such as the Secretary determines to be sufficient, when added to the
national average price received by producers, to give producers a national average return for the commodity equal
to the support price level, and that, in the case of the 1995 marketing year, the payments shall be 50 percent of the amount
otherwise determined in accordance with such section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 703(e) of the Wool Act provides that, to the extent practicable, support price levels for wool and mohair shall
be established and announced sufficiently in advance of each marketing year, as will permit producers to plan their
production for such marketing year. Accordingly, the following methods for calculating the support prices for wool
on unshorn lambs and for mohair for the 1995 marketing year are being proposed.

The support price for wool on unshorn lambs for the 1995 marketing year cannot be determined until the 1995 national
average market price for shorn wool is calculated. This will occur by April 1996. It is proposed that the method for
calculating the support price for wool on unshorn lambs shall be as follows: Once the 1995 national average market
price for shorn wool is determined, the support price for wool on unshorn lambs will be determined by multiplying 80
percent of the difference between the 1995 support price for shorn wool and the 1995 national average market price
for shorn wool by 5 pounds (the average quantity of wool on an average 100-pound unshorn lamb). Historically, this
formula has provided equitable support for wool on unshorn lambs relative to shorn wool and has helped to maintain
normal marketing practices for pulled wool. In accordance with section 704(a) of the Wool Act, the 1995 marketing
year payment for wool on unshorn lambs shall be 50 percent of the amount otherwise determined in accordance with such
formula.

It is proposed that the support price for mohair for the 1995 marketing year shall be determined based on the October
1994 parity prices for mohair and shorn wool. The following percentages of parity at which shorn wool is supported
are being considered in the final computation of the mohair support price: 85, 100, and 115 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The support programs conducted pursuant to the Wool Act are subject to the provisions of the Balanced Budget and Deficit
Reduction Act of 1985, as amended. As a result, the proposed program support levels announced in this rule may be recalculated
to comply with this Act.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) proposes to amend its regulations concerning the frequency at which medical
examinations are required to ensure the safe use of respiratory protection equipment. Section 10 CFR 20.1703 (a)(3)(v)
currently requires the determination by a physician prior to initial fitting of respirators, and at least every 12
months thereafter, that the individual user is physically able to use the respiratory protection equipment. The
proposed revision would require determination by a physician prior to initial fitting of respirators and either
every 12 months thereafter or periodically at a frequency determined by a physician, that the individual user is medically
fit to use the respiratory protection equipment.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The requirement for an annual medical examination to ensure safe use of respiratory equipment has been in the regulations
for some time. The need for these examinations was reconfirmed by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI)
in ANSI Z88.2&hyph;1992. However, considerable experience with implementation of the requirement has indicated
that the annual frequency of medical examinations is costly and could be reduced significantly with no adverse impact
on health and safety. The NRC Regulatory Review Group reviewed the existing requirement and concluded that the frequency
of medical examinations could be reduced without adverse impact on worker safety. This change was recommended to
the Commission as a candidate for licensee burden reduction in SECY&hyph;94&hyph;003 and supported by the Commission
by memorandum from Samuel J. Chilk to James R. Taylor dated February 14, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ANSI reviewed this issue and, in ANSI Z88.6 1984, published a recommendation that the frequency of medical examination
should be determined by a physician and should be reduced based on age of the worker. ANSI recommended an examination
every 5 years up to age 35, every 2 years up to age 45, and annually thereafter. ANSI also recommended special additional
evaluations after prolonged absence from work for medical reasons or whenever a functional disability has been identified.
These ANSI recommendations were reconfirmed in ANSI Z88.2&hyph;1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consideration was given to changing the time of medical examination to before first field use instead of before initial
fitting of respirators, to provide additional relief of regulatory burden. Consideration was also given to codifying
the ANSI frequencies as the minimum acceptable frequencies for reexamination. Comment is specifically requested
on these considerations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would provide for periodic medical examinations at either the 12-month interval as currently required
or optionally at a frequency determined by a physician. Under this proposed rule, licensees could elect to have the
physician include in the initial medical examination or at the next 12-month reexamination, a determination of when
each individual would need to be reexamined. Part 20 requires written procedures for use of respiratory protection
equipment. Consequently, current procedures and license conditions likely include the annual frequency and a change
in procedures or license conditions would be needed to implement a change in frequency of reexamination. The recommended
frequencies contained in the ANSI standard may provide guidance on determining an appropriate frequency of reexamination
which may be useful to physicians in determining frequency of reexamination. However, the Commission is not endorsing
this standard. Rather the Commission believes that the frequency of reexamination should be determined by the examining
physician. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule uses the terminology ``medically fit'' rather than ``physically able'' to use a respirator. This
terminology has been substituted because it more accurately reflects the purpose of the medical examination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ANSI Z88.6&hyph;1984 provides guidelines for the scope of an examination which would demonstrate that a worker was
medically fit to use respiratory protection devices. The guidelines include consideration of pulmonary function,
cardiovascular factors, neurological and psychological conditions, among others. The NRC staff believes that
these guidelines provide an acceptable working definition of the term ``medically fit.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The proposed amendment would apply to all NRC licensees. Agreement States must establish and maintain compatible
regulations and programs. Although the radiation protection provisions in 10 CFR Part 20 are normally Division I
matters of compatibility, this rulemaking defines minimum procedures needed to ensure health and safety. As such,
an Agreement State should have the flexibility to keep the 12-month frequency or to impose an alternate frequency
of examinations if considerations in their State warrant such an approach. The proposed rulemaking is therefore
a Division II matter of compatibility. The proposed change was not provided to the Agreement States in advance of this
notice because the change has nominal impact on materials licensees and because the change is a relaxation of the current
regulatory requirement. However, this proposed rulemaking was discussed with representatives of Agreement States
at the Organization of Agreement State Managers Workshop and Public Meeting on Rulemaking in Herndon, VA, on July
12, 1994. No comments or objections were offered by the States. Agreement States have the opportunity to comment on
this proposed change during the public comment period.

Description
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The provisions of 10 CFR Part 20.1703 (a)(3)(v) would be changed to require determination by a physician prior to initial
fitting of respirators, and periodically thereafter, either every 12 months or at a frequency determined by a physician,
that the individual user is medically fit to use the respiratory protection equipment. Frequency of reexamination
is changed from ``at least every 12 months,'' to ``either every 12 months thereafter or periodically at a frequency
determined by a physician,'' with guidance from ANSI on recommended frequencies provided in this statement of considerations.
Guidance on the scope of the medical examinations is provided in ANSI Z88.6&hyph;1984.

Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Commission believes that these proposed changes will constitute a reduction of regulatory burden and an increase
in flexibility for licensees, without any significant reduction in worker health or safety. The medical profession
contributed significantly to development of the reduced frequencies recommended by ANSI and it is therefore expected
that physicians performing examinations will be guided by the ANSI recommendations. ANSI recommended a frequency
of reexamination based on age: every 5 years up to age 35; every 2 years up to age 45; and annually thereafter. A change
in procedures or license conditions would likely be needed to implement a change in frequency of reexamination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The respiratory use medical examination is estimated to cost approximately $150 per examination. The number of examinations
performed during an outage at a nuclear power plant is estimated to be 500. If 60 plants have outages each year, the current
cost for annual medical examinations is at least $4,500,000. An examination of the demographics of the nuclear workforce
(1/2 &lt;35 years; 1/3 >35 but &lt;45; 1/6 >45) suggests that the number of medical examinations could easily be halved
thus saving $2.25 million each year just during maintenance or refueling outages at nuclear power plants. Clearly,
considerable savings can be realized by this change freeing resources for more effective health and safety efforts.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certain materials licensees such as fuel cycle facilities, some research facilities including broad scope academic
licensees and some manufacturing groups also have respiratory protection programs. The impacts on these licensees
are minimal because the number of respirator users is small. The proposed rule is expected to result in a reduction
in costs due to a reduced frequency of medical reexamination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although some costs would be incurred by licensees in making revisions to procedures and license conditions, these
costs would be offset by the increased flexibility and savings resulting from reduced reexamination frequency.
Income to the medical profession would be reduced somewhat in those areas where significant respiratory programs
are in place.

Finding of No Significant Environmental Impact: Availability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The NRC has determined under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, and the Commission's regulations
in Subpart A of 10 CFR Part 51, that this rule, if adopted, would not be a major Federal action significantly affecting
the quality of the human environment and therefore, an environmental impact statement is not required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC has not prepared a separate draft environmental assessment. The following discussion in conjunction with
the regulatory analysis which follows constitutes the assessment. Performing a medical examination to determine
that a worker is medically fit to use respiratory protection equipment generates minimal waste, results in small
recordkeeping burden, and has no other identifiable environmental impact. The effect of this rulemaking would be
to allow a reduction in the frequency of such examinations, thus reducing any conceivable environmental impact even
further.

The annual medical examination requirement has been in place for a number of years, and is considered by the NRC staff
to provide adequate health and safety to workers. However, the annual requirement consumes considerable resources
with little demonstrated improvement in worker health or safety when compared to longer examination intervals.
The ANSI committee and an extensive public review of the proposed standard Z88.6 (1984) found no reasons for not reducing
the frequency of medical examination. Thus, it would appear that the frequency of medical examination can be significantly
reduced at considerable savings and with no adverse impact on worker health and safety. The ``no-action'' alternative
is not preferable in view of the cost of compliance relative to the minimal risk reduction observed.

Regulatory Guidance

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The alternative of modifying the guidance in Regulatory Guide 8.15 is not considered a viable alternative for providing
regulatory relief because the existing rule is very specific, and requirements in the regulations cannot be revised
by modifying a regulatory guide.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the problem is a specific requirement in a rule, the most effective solution providing regulatory relief
is to modify the rule. Other alternatives such as issuance of an order, modifying license conditions or discretionary
enforcement were considered. These alternatives are usually interim and are used when immediate action is deemed
necessary. Because a permanent correction is desired and since there is no reason for immediate action, these other
alternatives were not selected.

Licensees that have respiratory protection programs will continue to be required to provide medical examinations
to workers. The only proposed change is to permit reducing the frequency at which the examinations are required based
on determination by a physician. This action would constitute a reduction in burden and costs. Although minor changes
in procedures or license conditions may be needed, the related costs are a one time cost that would be offset by the savings
in medical reexamination costs.

Workers would be subject to medical examinations for respirator use less frequently. As found by the ANSI review,
experience with the annual respiratory medical examination requirement has shown that less frequent examinations
for younger workers, with special examinations if conditions change, would be adequate to identify any medical reasons
for not using respirators. The proposed action would not impact medical examination requirements adopted by licensees
for other reasons. Licensees would continue to be required to conduct medical examinations. Thus, the health and
safety of workers would not be impacted.

Based upon the information available at this stage of the rulemaking proceeding and in accordance with the Regulatory
Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the NRC certifies that, if promulgated, this rule will not have a significant economic
impact upon a substantial number of small entities. The proposed amendments would apply to all NRC and Agreement State
licensees. Because these amendments would reduce burden, they are considered to have no adverse economic impact
on any large or small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the NRC is seeking comments and suggested modifications because of the widely differing conditions under
which small licensees operate. Any small entity subject to this proposed regulation which determines that, because
of its size, it is likely to bear a disproportionate adverse economic impact should notify the NRC of this in a comment
that specifically discusses the following items_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The licensee's size in terms of annual income or revenue, number of employees;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) How the proposed regulation would result in a significant economic burden upon the licensee as compared to that
on a larger licensee;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) How the proposed regulation could be modified to take into account the licensee's differing needs or capabilities;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The benefits that would be gained or the detriments that would be avoided by the licensee if the proposed regulation
was modified as suggested by the commenter; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) How the regulation, as modified, would still adequately protect the public health and safety.

Backfit Analysis

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because 10 CFR Part 20 applies to all NRC licensees, any proposed changes to this part must be evaluated to determine
if these changes constitute backfitting for reactor licensees such that the provisions of 10 CFR 50.109 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply. The following discussion addresses that evaluation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 10 CFR 50.109 definition of ``Backfit'' includes any modification of the procedures required to operate a facility
resulting from an amended provision in the Commission's rules. Because this proposed rule would permit but not require
nuclear power reactor licensees to modify their procedures regarding the frequency of respiratory medical examinations,
the NRC staff believes that the proposed change does not constitute a backfit. In addition, the effect of these proposed
changes is to increase flexibility and reduce the frequency at which medical examinations for respiratory use are
required. It is estimated that this rule change would save the nuclear power industry and other NRC and state licensees
several million dollars per year with no adverse impact on worker health and safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Some minor changes in procedures or license conditions could be necessary if a more flexible frequency of examination
is adopted. However, the costs would be offset by the savings in reduced frequency of examination. Thus, the NRC believes
that the modifications proposed are not backfits.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 9, 1994, the Office of the Secretary of Transportation and the FAA published a notice of proposed rulemaking
(NPRM) entitled, ``Rules of Practice for Federally Assisted Airport Proceedings.'' The recently enacted Federal
Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994 requires that DOT and FAA, in the handling of a complaint by an airline
that an airport fee is not reasonable, use certain procedures that are substantially different from the procedures
proposed in the NPRM. This notice revises the proposal in the NPRM by withdrawing proposed Subpart J, the special procedures
for the handling of airport fee complaints, and extends the comment period for commenting on the remaining proposal.
DOT will propose separate procedures to implement the airport fee provisions of the new legislation.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 9, 1994, the Office of the Secretary of Transportation (OST) and the FAA issued two related notices on the subject
of Federal policy on airport rates and charges. A notice of proposed policy entitled ``Proposed Policy Regarding
Airport Rates and Charges,'' (Proposed Policy) listed and explained the principles that the OST and the FAA believe
define Federal policy on the rates and charges that an airport proprietor can charge to aeronautical users of the airport.
(59 FR 29874). Notice 94&hyph;18, a notice of proposed rulemaking entitled ``Rules of Practice for Federally Assisted
Airports,'' proposed detailed procedures for the filing, investigation, and adjudication of complaints against
airports for alleged violation of Federal requirements under the airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982, as amended,
and the Anti-Head Tax Act provisions of the Federal Aviation Act (59 FR 29880). The NPRM provided a comment period extending
until August 8, 1994, and was extended until September 15, 1994 (59 FR 41192; August 10, 1994).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subpart J of the proposed rule provided special procedures for complaints by airlines involving the fees charged
by an airport proprietor. In brief, Subpart J provided an expedited formal investigation that included an evidentiary
investigative hearing presided over by a designated FAA employee. The presiding officer would issue a report of investigation
to the Assistant Administrator for Airports generally within 90 days of the complaint. Within 120 days of the complaint,
the Assistant Administrator would issue an initial determination of whether the airport fee at issue violated Federal
requirements that fees be fair and reasonable and not unjustly discriminatory. An initial determination would be
subject to final decision by the Administrator as a result of direct written appeal or, in certain circumstances,
of appeal from the initial decision of an FAA hearing officer in an adjudicatory hearing requested by the respondent.

The FAA Authorization Act of 1994, Public Law 103&hyph;305 (1994 Authorization Act) was signed into law on August
23, 1994. Section 113 of the 1994 Authorization Act included specific provisions for the resolution of airport-air
carrier disputes concerning airport fees. To a substantial degree, those provisions are different from and inconsistent
with the Subpart J procedures proposed earlier by the OST and the FAA. Section 113 in its entirety reads as follows:

Rulemaking To Implement Section 113

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OST and the FAA are in the process of reviewing the provisions of Section 113. Because the rules previously proposed
are in many respects not consistent with Section 113, the OST and the FAA are considering new regulations to implement
the new law, and currently intend to publish a proposed rule for public comment as soon as the review is complete. Notwithstanding
the 90-day period prescribed in the 1994 Authorization Act to complete rulemaking, the OST and the FAA will provide
an opportunity to comment on the proposal, although commenters can expect a relatively brief period for public comment
in view of the 90-day period for rulemaking provided in the legislation. We anticipate publication of proposed regulations
by October 15, 1994 with a comment period of approximately 15 days.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In consideration of the differences between the rules proposed in the NPRM and the provisions of Section 113 of the
1994 Authorization Act, the OST and the FAA believe that there is no further reason to seek public comment on the special
provisions in the NPRM for air carrier complaints related to whether airport fees are reasonable. At the same time,
the remaining procedures proposed in the NPRM, which would apply to the various other kinds of complaints filed against
airports relating to Federal requirements, are not affected by the 1994 Authorization Act. Accordingly, the OST
and the FAA are withdrawing Subpart J of the rule proposed in the NPRM, and are continuing the proposal of all remaining
provisions of the NPRM. In order to permit additional time for commenters to consider the proposal as revised by the
withdrawal of Subpart J, the OST and the FAA are extending the comment period. Comments on the proposed rule are now
due on or before December 1, 1994.

The NPRM proposed the adoption of a new procedure for the filing, investigation, and adjudication of complaints against
airports for violation of certain statutes administered by the FAA. The new procedures would be substituted for existing
procedures under 14 CFR part 13. With the exception of the deletion of the procedure for resolution of complaints by
airlines regarding airport fees, the rule proposed in the NPRM has not changed. Accordingly, as stated in the NPRM,
the expected economic impact of this proposed amendment would be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation is not
warranted.

Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the reasons discussed in the preamble, the FAA has determined that this change to the proposed regulation is not
economically significant under Executive Order 12866. However, due to the public interest in this rulemaking, this
proposed rule is considered significant under the Executive Order. The FAA certifies that this proposal, if adopted,
will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under
the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. This proposal is considered significant under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1978).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On April 5, 1994, OSHA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking addressing indoor air quality issues, including environmental
tobacco smoke in the workplace. 59 FR 15968. On June 14, 1994 OSHA issued a supplemental notice giving parties until
August 13, 1994 to submit comments; until August 5, 1994 to file notices of intention to appear; and until August 13,
1994 to submit testimony and evidence. The hearing was scheduled to start September 20, 1994. 59 FR 30560. These dates
have 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 been changed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A large number of persons have asked to testify at this hearing. Consequently, OSHA has extended the length of the hearing
as specified above. OSHA has also scheduled the first four days of the hearing at a larger auditorium as specified above.
The location of subsequent days will be announced. Persons who filed notices of intention to appear have already been
notified of the initial change by mail. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Clarifications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some of the persons who filed notices of intention to appear and have been scheduled to testify have indicated uncertainty
about OSHA's intentions with respect to parts of the proposal. In order to permit hearing participants to focus their
testimony on the relevant issues, OSHA is clarifying certain aspects of the proposed rule and directing participants
to the relevant preamble discussion on other points. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA wishes to clarify that it is not proposing to regulate smoking or indoor air quality in private homes, and does
not intend to do so. The scope provisions in the proposal cover only ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
work
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 environments'' and ``indoor or enclosed 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
workplaces
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.'' However, some of the comments indicate uncertainty on this matter. OSHA intends to develop even clearer language
on this point for use in a final regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA's intention on this issue is consistent with its longstanding practice. For example, a statement of policy set
forth at 29 CFR 1975.6 provides that domestic service employment in a private home is not subject to the requirements
of the OSH Act.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Similarly, OSHA does not intend its proposal to apply to private vehicles. OSHA has no authority to regulate smoking
in cars and trucks used privately or for commuting. The objective of this proposed rule is to protect nonsmoking employees
from the effects of passive smoke. Therefore, OSHA also does not intend to limit smoking in any type of work vehicle
where the only employee(s) present are smokers. OSHA does not intend to regulate taxis and limousines, which are pervasively
regulated by state and local governments. Also, such regulation could pose serious feasibility problems if the proposal
were applicable. However, OSHA expects comment on whether the standard should regulate smoking in other kinds of
employer-owned work vehicles when nonsmoking employees are present. Similar scope issues arise as to other forms
of transportation such as ships, trailers, and busses used as offices, etc. Witnesses may wish to discuss this matter
so that OSHA's consideration of the issue will include additional relevant evidence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some participants have expressed uncertainty as to the extent to which a final standard would preempt state and local
regulation of smoking and other indoor air quality issues. It is OSHA's intent that state and local laws consistent
with this standard shall remain in effect to the full extent permissible. As OSHA pointed out at 59 FR 16033, Section
18 of the OSH Act expresses Congress' intent to preempt state rules that establish occupational safety and health
standards with respect to issues covered by OSHA standards, unless the state rules are part of an approved state plan.
But Section 18 does not preempt state or local laws of general applicability that do not conflict with OSHA standards
and that regulate the conduct of workers and non-workers alike. See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

v. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
National Solid Wastes Management Association, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
112 S. Ct. 2374 (1992). Such laws regulate workers simply as members of the general public. OSHA recognizes that many
state and local governments have enacted provisions designed to protect the health of their residents by addressing
indoor air quality issues, including exposure to ETS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, OSHA notes that it proposed that the final standard not take effect until 14 months after its publication.
Specifically paragraph (i) stated that the effective date would be 60 days after the date of the publication of a final
rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and that all provisions would be implemented by one year after that date. 59 FR 16038. OSHA requested comment and testimony
on whether those dates, or longer or shorter dates were appropriate or whether the start-up dates should vary by provision.
59 FR 16033. Hearing participants may also wish to address whether the start-up dates should vary by type of establishment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Participants have also raised the issue whether the start-up dates for the ventilation provisions of the standard
should take account of the contract provisions of leases and the ventilation provisions' impact on lessors and lessees.
It has been suggested, for example, that it might be appropriate to relate the dates at which employers must comply
with the ventilation provisions to the renewal dates of their commercial leases so that the lessor and lessee may negotiate
the financial impact of these provisions. Witnesses may wish to testify further on this issue, including its health
implications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA noted in the summary to the proposal that it might be appropriate to publish subsequent 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notices after considering the views presented by the public. 59 FR 15968. OSHA has now received in excess of 100,000
comments and will be receiving extensive testimony at the hearing. In light of the intense interest in the rule, the
large volume of evidence presented, and the complexity of the issues, OSHA will carefully consider whether it is appropriate
to issue a further proposal in the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory
Planning and Review).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12778
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that, to the extent allowed by law, this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections
(a) and (b) of that section. However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory
programs and program amendments since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM.
Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1253 and 1255) and 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions
on proposed State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by OMB under the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507

Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon corresponding Federal regulations for which
an economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements
previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule
would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the corresponding
Federal regulations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM is announcing receipt of a proposed amendment to the Indiana regulatory program (hereinafter referred to as the
``Indiana program'') under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The proposed amendment
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->

I. Background on the Indiana Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 29, 1982, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Indiana program. Background information
on the Indiana program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the conditions of approval
can be found in the July 26, 1982, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (47 FR 32071). Subsequent actions concerning the conditions of approval and program amendments can be found at 30
CFR 914.10, 914.15, and 914.16.

II. Discussion of the Proposed Amendment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated January 4, 1993 (Administrative Record Number IND&hyph;1193), Indiana submitted a proposed amendment
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
93&hyph;1) intended to address the required program amendments concerning revegetation at 30 CFR 914.16 (i), (j),
(k), (l), and (m). See 57 FR 41869 (September 14, 1982), and 57 FR 22653 (May 29, 1992) for background on these required
amendments. The amendments submitted on January 4, 1993, were reviewed and approved by the Director on August 2, 1993
(58 FR 41039).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letter dated August 11, 1994 (Administrative Record Number IND&hyph;1392), Indiana submitted formal program
amendment 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
94&hyph;3. The proposed program amendment concerns the performance standards for restoring soil productivity
for surface coal mining and reclamation operations under IC 13&hyph;4.1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its submittal of this amendment, Indiana stated all of the rules, except 310 IAC 12&hyph;4&hyph;16, were submitted
in a previous package (amendment 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
93&hyph;1) and their amended language was approved by OSM at 58 FR 41039 (August 2, 1993). In addition, 310 IAC 12&hyph;5&hyph;145,
which was part of amendment 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
93&hyph;1 has been excluded from this submittal. Indiana stated that as a result of ongoing Federal litigation over
the language of the previously-submitted subsection (c) of 310 IAC 12&hyph;5&hyph;145, the Indiana Division of
Reclamation feels that this rule, as printed at 15 Indiana Register (IR) 2167, is adequate and effective, and that
310 IAC 12&hyph;5&hyph;145 will not be resubmitted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Only those provisions which differ from those amendments approved by OSM in the August 2, 1992,

Indiana is proposing to delete subsection 145(c) which was approved by OSM on August 2, 1994 (58 FR 41039). Deleted
subsection 145(c) contains the following language: ``Soil reconstruction shall be carried out in accordance with
the specifications of the Soil Conservation Service of the United States Department of Agriculture establishing
prime farmland soil reconstruction specifications for Indiana.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its submittal of this amendment Indiana stated that the language quoted above was omitted because of ongoing litigation
concerning the language of subsection 145(c). The litigation to which Indiana referred in its submittal of

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory
Planning and Review).

Executive Order 12778
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that, to the extent allowed by law, this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections
(a) and (b) of that section. However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory
programs and program amendments since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM.
Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1253 and 1255) and 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions
on proposed State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon corresponding Federal regulations for which
an economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements
previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule
would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the corresponding
Federal regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard will hold a public meeting to discuss strategies for converting Coast Guard regulations in titles
33, 46, and 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations to the metric system. The Coast Guard is converting to the metric system
because this system of measurement has been designated as the preferred system of measurement for the United States
under Executive Order 12770 and the Omnibus Trade and Competitive Act of 1988.

Executive Order 12770 (E.O. 12770), signed on July 25, 1991, and the Omnibus Trade and Competitive Act of 1988 (Pub.
L. 100&hyph;418) both designate the metric system as the preferred system of measurement for U.S. trade and commerce.
E.O. 12770 requires Federal departments and agencies to use the metric system in their activities, including procurements,
grants, regulations, and agency programs and functions related to trade, industry, and commerce. Metric usage must
be in accordance with section 3 of the Metric Conversion Act (Pub. L. 94&hyph;168, 89 Stat. 1007), as amended by section
5164(b) of the Omnibus Trade and Competitive Act of 1988.

Federal departments and agencies may claim an exemption from the requirement to convert, if use of the metric system
would be impractical or likely to cause significant inefficiencies or loss of markets to U.S. firms. Proposed exceptions
to metric usage must follow an effective process of review by heads of departments and agencies.

The U.S. Coast Guard's Metric Transition Plan, as required by E.O. 12770, is specified in COMDTINST 5711.2. The Chief
of the Office of Marine Safety, Security and Environmental Protection has established the strategy and procedures
for metrication in the ``Procedures for Metrication in the Office of Marine Safety, Security and Environmental Protection,''
dated February 26, 1993. A future rulemaking will implement a portion of that strategy.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The ``soft'' conversion method is also known as ``exact mathematical conversion.'' It is used to obtain an exact change
in measurement units only. The metric equivalent to an English unit is determined by multiplying by the appropriate
conversion factor. It is then rounded off to the degree of precision reflected by the original English value. For example,
a soft conversion of 55 miles per hour (mph) yields 89 kilometers per hour (km/hr).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The ``hard'' metric conversion method is known as ``size substitution.'' Using this method, an English unit is replaced
with an accepted metric standard size used for a particular purpose. Where possible, this method is used to convert
an English unit to a metric unit that conforms to an internationally recognized standard. For example, a hard conversion
of the 55 mph yields a speed of 90 km/hr.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The ``dual'' system of measurement and weights is also known as ``adaptive conversion.'' It changes a magnitude in
one system to a magnitude in another that is reasonably equivalent. This process should result in conversions to magnitudes
that are meaningful and practical in application. Thus, an adaptive conversion of 55 mph equates to 89 km/hr. With
the dual method, an equivalent English unit would be placed in parenthesis after the metric unit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Coast Guard also is considering a fourth method of metric conversion called the ``hybrid'' method which combines
both the hard and dual conversion methods. Using the hybrid method, all English units would be converted to metric
using the hard conversion method. Additionally, an English unit of approximate equivalency, typically the English
standard measurement, would be placed in parenthesis after the metric unit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When converting the regulations, existing English standards will be replaced with metric standards where possible.
When industry consensus standards are used, the Coast Guard will attempt to incorporate by reference industry standards
which use standard metric sizes that are equivalent to the original English standards. The Coast Guard also will encourage
organizations that establish standards to convert English standards that are currently incorporated into Coast
Guard regulations to metric. All conversions will be made so that the final values are within the original safe limits
or constraints of the engineering equation. Conversions will be made so that vessels will not be required to meet a
different set of standards or new requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some statutes under which the Coast Guard operates contain measurements in English units. In such cases, the Coast
Guard would apply a direct mathematical conversion so that use of the metric measurement would not change the statutory
measurement. For example, 79 feet would be converted to 24.3 meters. This soft conversion method would also be implemented
where adoption of the hard conversion method might cause a change in magnitude and inadvertently result in application
of a different regulatory standard. The Coast Guard does not intend conversion to the metric system to result in the
application of different compliance standards.

Request for Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Coast Guard is interested in obtaining information on the impacts on commercial ship operators, shipyards, and
marine suppliers of converting its regulations to metric units and dimensions. The Coast Guard is especially interested
in the public's evaluation of the impacts of metric conversion on vessel design and personnel safety, and the economic
feasibility of converting to the metric system for all segments of the marine industry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard requests additional information on costs, required retooling or replacement of equipment or materials,
extra work requirements, current metric system usage, and the impact of metrication on small entities. The Coast
Guard also requests comments on which system of metric conversion is most appropriate for the type of vessel and its
trade, or any other appropriate considerations. The Coast Guard is concerned that conversion to the metric system
using specific conversion methods may result in industry's converting without the necessary training for its personnel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To adequately address the issues and obtain additional information, the Coast Guard will hold a public meeting at
the time and place indicated in this notice. Responses to the following questions would be particularly useful in
developing a future notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
At the request of the Sarasota/Manatee Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) and the Florida Department of Transportation
(FDOT), (the bridge owner), the Coast Guard proposes to change the regulations governing the Siesta Key Drawbridge
on SR758, Gulf Intracoastal Waterway mile 71.6, across Roberts Bay at Sarasota, Sarasota County, Florida. This change
is intended to relieve highway congestion while still meeting the reasonable needs of navigation.

Background and Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This drawbridge presently opens on signal except that from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekends and holidays, the draw opens
only on the hour, quarter-hour, half-hour and three quarter-hour. The MPO and FDOT requested that the bridge open
only on the hour and half-hour during certain periods of each day to help reduce traffic delays, particularly during
morning and afternoon commuter hours and on busy weekends. A comparison of highway traffic volumes between 1985 and
1993 indicated there has been an overall increase in traffic volume with current levels exceeding highway capacity
(LOS F_parking lot conditions) on weekday afternoons during the winter season without any bridge openings. The number
of bridge openings continue to average less than two per hour with a maximum of 4 openings per hour being experienced
periodically during the winter season. Based on analysis of the highway traffic and bridge opening data provided
by FDOT on June 28, 1993, the Coast Guard determined that most of the weekday delays were caused by back to back bridge
openings which did not allow accumulated vehicle traffic to clear before the next opening.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We concluded that a 30 minute opening schedule was not warranted, but, as a compromise, tested a 20 minute opening schedule
which would limit openings to 3 times per hour daily, year around. This test was conducted from January 1, 1994, to February
23, 1994. The results demonstrated that strong cross winds, heavy currents and shallow water adjacent to the channel
near the bridge create holding conditions for northbound vessels that could become unsafe for navigation if the opening
schedule is extended to 30 minutes. A daily 20 minute schedule would help reduce traffic delays without significantly
increasing the danger to vessels caused by the potentially unsafe holding conditions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Discussion of Proposed Amendments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed change would limit the maximum number of openings to 3 per hour with a 20 minute opening schedule. Since
the highway traffic data shows roadway congestion starts to increase in mid morning, the regulated period will be
from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily. This change should reduce traffic delays without unreasonably impacting navigation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulatory Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an
assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by
the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies
and procedures of DOT (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979) is unnecessary. We conclude this because the rule exempts tugs
with tows.

Small Entities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal, if adopted, will have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are
not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small
Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). Because it expects the impact of this proposal to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies
under section 605(b) that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of
small entities.

of a Federalism Assessment.

EPA is proposing to approve revisions to the California State Implementation Plan (SIP) which concern the control
of volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from surface coasting of metal parts and products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The intended effect of proposing approval of these rules is to regulate emissions of VOCs in accordance with the requirements
of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA or the Act). EPA's final action on this notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM)
will incorporate these rules into the federally approved SIP. EPA has evaluated each of these rules and is proposing
to approve them under provisions of the CAA regarding EPA action on SIP submittals, SIPs for national primary and secondary
ambient air quality standards and plan requirements for nonattainment areas.

On March 3, 1778, EPA promulgated a list of ozone nonattainment areas under the provisions of the Clean Air Act, as amended
in 1977 (1977 CAA or pre-amended act), that included the following eight air pollution control districts (APCDs):
Fresno County APCD, Kern County APCD,
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 Kings County APCD, Madera County APCD, Merced County APCD, San Joaquin County APCD, Stanislaus County APCD, and Tulare
County APCD. 43 FR 8964, 40 CFR 81.305. Because some of these areas were unable to meet the statutory attainment date
of December 31, 1982, California requested under section 172(a)(2), and EPA approved, an extension of the attainment
date to December 31, 1987.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 On May 26, 1988, EPA notified the Governor of California, pursuant to section 110(a)(2)(H) of the pre-amended Act,
that the above districts' portions of the California SIP were inadequate to attain and maintain the ozone standard
and requested that deficiencies in the existing SIP be corrected (EPA's SIP-Call). On November 15, 1990, the Clean
Air Act Amendments of 1990 were enacted. Public Law 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399, codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q.
In amend section 182(a)(2)(A) of the CAA, Congress statutorily adopted the requirement that nonattainment areas
fix their deficient reasonably available control technology (RACT) rules for ozone and established a deadline of
May 15, 1991 for states to submit corrections of those deficiencies.

At that time, Kern County included portions of two air basins: the San Joaquin Valley Air Basin and the Southeast Desert
Air Basin. The San Joaquin Valley Air Basin portion of Kern County was designated as nonattainment, and the Southeast
Desert air Basin portion of Kern County was designated as unclassified. See 40 CFR 81.305 (1991).

On March 20, 1991, the San Joaquin Valley Unified Air Pollution Control District (SJVUAPCD) was formed. The SJVUAPCD
has authority over the San Joaquin Valley Air Basin which includes all of the above eight counties except for the Southeast
Desert Air Basin portion of Kern County. Thus, Country Air Pollution Control District (KCAPCD) still exists, but
only has authority over the Southeast Desert Air Basin portion of Kern County. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 182(a)(2)(A) applies to areas designated as nonattainment prior to enactment of the amendments and classified
as marginal or above as of the date of enactment. It requires such areas to adopt and correct RACT rules pursuant to pre-amended
section 172(b) as interpreted in pre-amended guidance.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 EPA's SIP-Call used that guidance to indicate the necessary corrections for specific nonattainment areas. APCDs
found in the San Joaquin Valley Basin (now collectively known as the SJVUAPCD) are classified as serious;
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 therefore, these areas were subject to the RACT fix-up requirement and the May 15, 1991 deadline. KCAPCD was subject
to EPA's SIP-Call, but was not subject to the RACT fix-up requirement and the May 15, 1991 deadline.

KCAPCD was not subject to the RACT fix-up requirement and the May 15, 1991 deadline because the Southeast Desert Air
Basin portion of Kern County was not a pre-enactment nonattainment area, and thus, was not automatically designated
nonattainment on the date of enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. (See sections 107(d) and 182(a)(2)(A)
of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.) However, the KCAPCD is still subject to the requirements of EPA's SIP-Call
because the SIP-Call included

the rules being acted on in this document. This document addresses EPA's proposed action for SJVUAPCD Rule 4603, Surface
Coating of Metal parts and Products and KCAPCD Rule 410.4, Surface Coating of Metal Parts and Products. SJVUAPCD adopted
Rule 4603 on May 20, 1993 and KCAPCD adopted Rule 410.4 on July 12, 1993. These submitted rules were found to be complete

Both rules control the emission of VOCs from the surface coating of metal parts and products. VOCs contribute to the
production of ground level ozone and smog. The rules were adopted as part of each district's efforts to achieve the
National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone and in response to EPA's SIP-Call and the section 182(a)(20(A)
CAA requirement. The following is EPA's evaluation and proposed action for these two rules.

EPA Evaluation and Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In determining the approvability of a VOC rule, EPA must evaluate the rule for consistency with the requirements of
the CAA and EPA regulations, as found in section 110 and part D of the CAA and 40 CFR part 51 (Requirements for Preparation,
Adoption, and Submittal of Implementation Plans). The EPA interpretation of these requirements, which forms the
basis for today's action, appears in the various EPA policy guidance documents listed in footnote 3. Among those provisions
is the requirement that a VOC rule must, at a minimum, provide for the implementation of RACT for Stationary sources
of VOC emissions. This requirement was carried forth from the pre-amended Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the purpose of assisting state and local agencies in developing RACT rules, EPA prepared a series of Control Technique
Guideline (CTG) documents. The CTGs are based on the underlying requirements of the Act and specify the presumptive
norms for what is RACT for specific source categories. Under the CAA, Congress ratified EPA's use of these documents,
as well as other Agency policy, for requiring States to ``fix-up'' their RACT rules. See section 182(a)(2)(A). The
CTG applicable to Rules 4603 and 410.4 is entitled,

3. In general, these guidance documents have been set forth to ensure that VOC rules are fully enforceable and strengthen
or maintain the SIP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SJVUAPCD's submitted Rule 4603 will replace the existing surface coating of metal parts and products rules of the
eight APCDs of the SJVUAPCD and KCAPCD's submitted Rule 410.4 will replace the existing rule for the southeast desert
portion of Kern County. Both rules were adopted to control emissions from surface coating of metal parts and products
through regulation of VOC content in coatings, storage and cleanup requirements, and other administrative procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SJVUAPCD Rule 4603 includes the following revisions from the current SIP rules:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The compliance schedule was updated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has evaluated the two submitted rules and has determined that they are consistent with the CAA, EPA, regulations,
and EPA policy. Therefore, SJVUAPCD Rule 4603 and KCAPCD Rule 410.4 are being proposed for approval under section
110(k)(3) of the CAA as meeting the requirements of section 110(a) and Part D.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any further request

SIP approvals under sections 110 and 301 and part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the federal SIP-approval does not impose any
new requirements, it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature
of the federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute
Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning
SIPs on such grounds.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is proposing to approve revisions to the California State Implementation Plan (SIP) which concern the control
of volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from Architectural Coatings, Leaks from Synthetic Organic Chemical
and Polymer Manufacturing, Storage of Petroleum Products, Organic Liquid Loading, and Can Coating. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The intended effect of proposing approval of these rules is to regulate emissions of VOCs in accordance with the requirements
of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA or the Act). In the Final Rules Section of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the EPA is approving the state's SIP revision as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views
this as a noncontroversial revision amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for this
approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to this proposed rule,
no further activity is contemplated in relation to this rule. If EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule
will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed
rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this document. Any parties interested in commenting on
this action should do so at this time.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On April 21, 1993, EPA published final Retrofit/Rebuild Requirements for 1993 and Earlier Model Year Urban Buses
(58 FR 21359). The retrofit/rebuild program is intended to reduce the ambient levels of particulate matter (PM) in
urban areas and is limited to 1993 and earlier model year (MY) urban buses operating in metropolitan areas with 1980
populations of 750,000 or more, whose engines are rebuilt or replaced after January 1, 1995. Operators of the affected
buses are required to choose between two compliance options: Option 1 sets particulate matter emissions requirements
for each urban bus engine in an operator's fleet which is rebuilt or replaced; Option 2 is a fleet averaging program
that sets out a specific annual target level for average PM emissions from urban buses in an operator's fleet. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A key aspect of the program is the certification of retrofit/rebuild equipment. To meet either of the two compliance
options, operators of the affected buses must use equipment which has been certified by EPA. Emissions requirements
under either of the two options depend on the availability of retrofit/rebuild equipment certified for each engine
model. To be used for Option 1, equipment must be certified as meeting a 0.10 g/bhp&hyph;hr PM standard or as achieving
a 25 percent reduction in PM. Equipment used for Option 2 must be certified as providing some level of PM reduction that
would in turn be claimed by urban bus operators when calculating their average fleet PM levels attained under the program.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Option 1, additional information regarding cost must be submitted in the application for certification, in
order for certification of that equipment to initiate (or trigger) program requirements for a particular engine
model. In order for the equipment to serve as a trigger, the certifier must guarantee that the equipment will be offered
to affected operators for $7,940 or less at the 0.10 g/bhp&hyph;hr PM level, or for $2,000 or less for the 25 percent
or greater reduction in PM. Both of the above amounts are based on 1992 dollars and include life cycle costs.

II. Application for Certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Engelhard Corporation has applied for certification of equipment applicable to petroleum fueled diesel engines
used in urban buses for the 1993 and earlier model years. The application states that the candidate equipment provides
a 25% or greater reduction in emissions of particulate matter (PM). Life cycle costs for operators are stated to be
less than $2000 (in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1992 dollars) for all affected operators. The use of the equipment by transit operators to meet program requirements
is discussed further below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The equipment being certified is a catalytic converter that also functions as the muffler and takes the place of the
original muffler installed in the engine exhaust system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The application indicates that the equipment is applicable to all 1993 and earlier model year 2-stroke and 4-stroke
petroleum fueled diesel engines that are used in urban buses and are not equipped with after treatment devices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Engelhard Corporation presents data from testing the equipment on a 2-stroke 1985 model year Detroit Diesel 6V92TA
engine documenting PM emissions reduction under two different scenarios. In the first case, the baseline test was
performed on the engine prior to rebuild. Then the catalytic converter was added to the exhaust system and another
test was performed. When the results of the two tests were evaluated, the test on the engine which was equipped with
the catalytic converter indicated a 41% decrease in PM emissions compared to the baseline test. This test also showed
that hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions were within the applicable emission
standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the second test sequence, the baseline test was performed on the engine after rebuild. Then, as in the first test
sequence, the catalytic converter was added and a comparison test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was performed. When the results of these tests were evaluated, the test on the engine with the catalytic converter
installed indicated a 29% reduction in PM emissions when compared with the test results for the baseline engine. The
HC, CO, and NOx emissions for this test were also within the applicable emission standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Engelhard would like to certify this equipment for use on all 2-stroke and 4-stroke heavy duty urban bus engines. The
test data presented in the certification application are from tests on the DDC model 6V92TA heavy duty engine only.
Additionally, some data from tests run on a 4-stroke medium duty engine are also included. If the application is approved
as written it would apply to all 2-stroke and 4-stroke urban bus engines manufactured by all manufacturers during
the affected model years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Engelhard Corporation provided smoke emission measurements for this engine in the rebuilt condition with the catalytic
converter installed. These measurements indicated that the engine complied with the applicable smoke standards
when rebuilt with the Engelhard catalytic converter installed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information submitted by Engelhard Corporation shows that this equipment achieves a 25% or greater reduction
in PM emissions within the $2,000 life cycle cost ceiling. If EPA approves the request for certification of this equipment,
urban bus operators will be required to use this equipment or other equipment certified to provide 25% or greater equivalent

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reductions to comply with Option 1 of this regulation beginning six months after certification approval. This requirement
will continue unless other equipment which reduces PM emissions to 0.10 g/bhp-hr is certified at or below the $7,940
life cycle cost ceiling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Engelhard's application does not indicate that urban bus operators in any part of the country would be unable to retrofit
their urban buses for less than the cost ceiling. Therefore, this application would apply to all urban bus operators
nationwide that are subject to the urban bus rebuild/retrofit program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If EPA approves Engelhard's certification request, urban bus operators who choose to comply under Option 2 of this
regulation may also use the Engelhard equipment. If certification is approved by EPA, the emission levels of the Engelhard
rebuild kit will be used to modify the Option 2 post rebuild levels in July 1996 for engine rebuilds scheduled for 1997
and thereafter, unless other rebuild kits with life cycle costs below the life cycle cost ceiling and lower PM emission
levels are certified before July 1996. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The date of this notice initiates a 45 day period during which EPA will accept written comments relevant to whether
or not the equipment described in this application should be certified. Interested parties are encouraged to review
this application, and provide comments related to whether or not the equipment described in it should be certified
pursuant to the urban bus retrofit/rebuild program. Comments should be provided in writing to the address listed
under ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency will review this application, along with comments received from the interested parties, and attempt to
resolve or clarify issues as necessary. During the review process, EPA may add additional documents to the docket
as a result of the review process. These documents will also be available for public review and comment within the 45
day period.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA has proposed to require additional precautionary labeling relating to the flammability of total release fogger
pesticides (59 FR 18058, April 15, 1994). EPA expects that the additional flammability label warnings will reduce
the potential for fires and explosions by alerting consumers to the dangers of total release fogger and providing
specific directions for proper use of these products with minimal cost to industry or consumers. The comment period
on this proposed rule expired on June 14, 1994. Based on a request from S.C. Johnson Son, EPA is reopening the period
for comment on this proposed rule for 90 days in order to receive as much input as possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 Several parties have requested that EPA extend the comment period for the July 27, 1994 mercury-containing lamps
proposal (59 FR 38288). Because EPA believes that the mercury-containing lamps issue is very complex and that the
quality of a final rule may be greatly improved if all interested parties are able to fully explore the many issues raised
in the proposal prior to submitting comments, the Agency has determined that an extension of 60 days is appropriate.

officers; and to rewrite the guidance to make it easier to read and understand. The Director of Defense Procurement
intends to provide for an exchange of ideas and information with Government and industry personnel by publishing
this notice, soliciting public comments, and holding a public meeting. All interested parties are invited to provide
written suggestions/comments for this rewrite. In addition, all interested parties will be given an opportunity
to express their views at the public hearing prior to the proposed FAR revisions being drafted.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This initiative to rewrite FAR Part 45 is sponsored by the Director of Defense Procurement, Department of Defense.
The existing FAR guidance on government property has undergone numerous revisions over the years to respond to concerns
voiced by Congress, the GAO, the DoDIG, OMB, military audit agencies, and industry. The focus has been on storage of
property; property accountability and reporting; storage of excess property; allowability of profits; contractor
access to the DoD Supply System; property rollover from contract to contract; and so on. It is now appropriate to review
these policies and procedures in the aggregate and to determine what improvements can be made in managing government
property.

This proposed rule amends the Department of State Acquisition Regulation (DOSAR) to reflect numerous miscellaneous
changes, additions and deletions dealing with Department of State (DOS) internal or administrative matters. This
rule also sets forth policies and procedures for procurement integrity requirements, the DOS standardization program,
implementation of the metric system for DOS procurements, the Governmentwide commercial purchase card, implementation
of an affirmative procurement program for recovered materials, Defense Base Act insurance requirements, and alternative
dispute resolution. Finally, it raises the threshold for major systems acquisitions from $10,000,000 to $30,000,000.

II. Other DOSAR Revisions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Numerous other revisions have been made to update the DOSAR to implement FAR changes that have occurred; to indicate
appropriate approving officials as required by the FAR; to delete obsolete DOSAR passages and clauses; and, to reflect
current organizational designations and language. These changes do not affect the relationship between a Department
of State organization and a contractor or potential contractor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several DOSAR clauses have been deleted, as they are obsolete. They are: 652.202&hyph;70, Definitions; 652.214&hyph;70,
Language Version (superseded by FAR 52.214&hyph;34, Submission of Offers in the English Language); 652.214&hyph;72,
Authorization to Perform; 652.232&hyph;70, Invoice Requirements and 652.232&hyph;71, Method of Payment (Electronic
Funds Transfer) (both superseded by FAC 94&hyph;20 which clarified that Prompt Payment Act requirements apply to
overseas contracts; therefore, FAR clauses 52.232&hyph;25, Prompt Payment and 52.232&hyph;28, Electronic Funds
Transfer Payment Methods, will be used).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following new DOSAR clauses have been added, in addition to those mentioned in I. above: 652.206&hyph;70, Competition
Advocacy/Ombudsman (to provide potential offerors with a contact point if they believe that a solicitation is particularly
restrictive of competition); 652.216&hyph;71, Price Adjustment (to allow overseas contractors to be able to adjust
their prices if the host country government enacts laws affecting actual costs of direct service labor); 652.232&hyph;70,
Payment Schedule and Invoice Submission (Fixed-price) and 652.232&hyph;71, Voucher Submission (Cost-Reimbursement)
(to provide clauses pertaining to the submission of invoices/vouchers); 652.237&hyph;70, Compensatory Time Off
(to allow for personal services contractors to be given compensatory time off for overtime work); 652.237&hyph;71,
Identification/Building Pass (to ensure that contractors who work in Department of State facilities are properly
cleared and have an identification pass); and, 652.237&hyph;72, Observance of Legal Holidays and Administrative
Leave (for contracts where contractor personnel will be working on-site in any Department of State facility).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following Department of State forms have been added: DS&hyph;1918, Purchase Order File; DS&hyph;1919, Delivery
Order File; DS&hyph;1910, Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) File; DS&hyph;1921, Award/Modification of Interagency
Acquisition Agreement; and DS&hyph;1910, Small Business/Labor Surplus Agency Review_Actions Above the Small
Purchase Limitation. These forms are all for internal Department or Government use; since they do not affect contractors
or potential contractors, they are not being printed in this

to exceed the thresholds indicated below, the contracting officer shall forward the proposed contractual action
to A/OPE for review. For contract modifications, the contracting officer shall submit such actions in accordance

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) For domestic contracting activities, all actions over $5,000,000. There is no review threshold when the contracting
activity's quality assurance plan has been approved by A/OPE;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For overseas posts with contracting officers who have been issued standard name warrants, all actions over $250,000,
with the exception of those actions for local guard services, which require review at $100,000 and above; and,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) A/OPE shall document the scope and extent of the review and shall submit written recommendations to the contracting
officer on each proposed contract action reviewed. In the event the contracting officer and the reviewer cannot reach
agreement on the recommendation(s), the contracting officer shall prepare an appeal file to be transmitted to the
Procurement Executive. The appeal shall be approved by an individual one management level above the contracting
officer prior to its transmission to the Procurement Executive. A resolution shall be worked out between the contracting
activity and the Procurement Executive. For purposes of this section, the officer who may transmit the appeal file
to the Procurement Executive shall not be the same individual who will sign the contractual document. For overseas
posts, where the contracting officer is the head of the contracting activity, the approval authority shall be the

. Under certain conditions, waiver of the requirement to publish in the CBD notices of proposed procurement actions
is necessary for acquisitions by overseas posts when these acquisitions are made from sources outside, and work is
performed outside the United States, its possessions and Puerto Rico. This policy is pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 416 et seq.
and 15 U.S.C. 637 et seq. This policy applies only to DOS contracts and any contracts awarded in behalf of other Federal

(ii) If the head of the contracting activity determines that publication of a CBD notice is inappropriate or unreasonable,
that official may waive the CBD notice requirements of FAR Subpart 5.1. Delay, due to poor acquisition planning, is
not a sufficient reason to waive the CBD notice. This determination shall be in writing and made in consideration of
such factors as overseas delivery, installation, maintenance or replacement requirements, special product or
performance specifications, and security clearance requirements. The determination and findings shall be included
in the contract file. Competition in such acquisitions, including the use of written solicitations, shall be obtained
in all cases to the extent feasible and consistent with FAR Part 6 and DOSAR Part 606. If there are known U.S. firms or
firms with U.S. affiliations in local residence capable of supplying the required supplies or services, the contracting
activity shall ensure that those firms are included in the source list for the acquisition.

National security.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) This subsection applies to all acquisitions involving national security information, regardless of dollar
amount.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) It is the policy of the Department of State that individual acquisitions or classes of acquisitions involving
national security information be handled in accordance with the laws and regulations regarding classification
and control of classified information. Executive Order 12356, National Security Information (April 2, 1982), prescribes
a uniform system for classifying declassifying, and safeguarding national security information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c)(1) The Department's requirements personnel, reviewing officials, the contracting officer, and the approving
official shall jointly confer on using this authority and the extent to which national security pertains to the acquisition(s).
The Department shall examine the acquisition in its totality, including any antecedent and/or consequent acquisitions
and related actions, to make these determinations. The Director, Diplomatic Security Services, Bureau of Diplomatic
Security, is the authority for the determination that specific information should not be released on all proposed
acquisitions funded by the Department of State that involves national security information. The Chief, Controls
Division, Office of Intelligence Liaison Directorate for Coordination, Bureau of Intelligence and Research, is
the approval authority for such acquisitions derived from or funded by other agencies. The requirements office is
responsible for obtaining the approval of the appropriate official and ensuring that all documentation necessary
for the decision is accurate and complete with respect to information that should not be released.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In accordance with FAR 5.202(a)(1), acquisitions involving national security information shall be publicized
if identification of the individual acquisition or class or acquisitions would not compromise national security.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The contracting officer is responsible for soliciting offers from as many potential sources as is practicable
under the circumstances. However, given the sensitivity required for acquisitions involving national security
information, it is expected that requirements offices will work closely with the contracting officer in maximizing
competition.

(a) It is the Department's policy to promote full and open competition in all procurement actions. The authority at
41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) shall be used with respect to standardization when only specified makes and models of equipment
will satisfy the Department's needs and only one source is available. This policy applies to all acquisitions involving
standardization, regardless of dollar amount.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Contracts awarded under the authority at 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) shall be supported by the written justification
described in FAR 6.303. The contracting officer, requirements office, procuring activity competition advocate,
and the Procurement Executive shall approve all Justifications for Other than Full and Open Competition that cite
standardization of technical equipment as justification to restrict competition. The Administrative Officer
at each post is the procuring activity competition advocate for that post and the requirements office at post is the
embassy functional office responsible for identifying the need to contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Procurement of specified makes and models of technical equipment and systems, for which there is only one source
of supply, is considered other than full and open competition. Such procurements shall be supported by an approved
Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition. The justification shall include the content requirements
of FAR 6.303&hyph;2 and DOSAR 606.303&hyph;2. The justification shall also address potential cost savings in areas
such as inventory, operations, training, maintenance, repairs, and administrative and management support. Areas
of consideration for potential cost savings shall be supported by detailed estimates as attachments to the justification.
Justifications shall specify an effective period, which shall bear a reasonable relationship to the life of the technical
equipment. The effective period shall not exceed six years with a review at the end of the first three years. Periodic
reviews shall be made during the standardization period to determine whether the standardization should be continued,
revised or canceled.

example, an engine with internal parts in metric dimensions and external fittings or attachments in inch-pound dimensions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Procedures
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (1) DOS contracting activities shall implement the metric system in a manner consistent with Pub. L. 100&hyph;418.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) All DOS contracting activities shall use the metric system in procurement consistent with security, operations,
economic, technical, logistical, training and safety requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The Department shall encourage industry to adopt the metric system by acquiring commercially available metric
products and services that meet the Department's needs whenever practical. Toward this end, solicitations for DOS
acquisitions shall:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) State all measurement sensitive requirements in metric terms whenever possible. Alternatives to hard metric
are soft, dual and hybrid metric terms. The Metric Handbook for Federal Officials regarding the selection of proper
metric units and symbols is available from the National Technical Information Service (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
PB89&hyph;226922); and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Contracting officers shall return all statements of work/specifications that are not expressed in some form
of metric terms to the requirements office that prepared the documents, if the contract is expected to exceed $500,000,
unless the requirements office has forwarded to the contracting activity for approval, in a waiver format prescribed
by the head of the contracting activity, a justification for the use of non-metric specifications/statements of
work. Option year prices shall be considered when computing the $500,000 threshold.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) Waivers are not required when ordering from Federal Supply Schedules, or if the contract is not expected to exceed
$500,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Valid justifications for non-metric specifications/work statements include, but are not limited to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Existing specifications and standards in inch-pound units unless conversion is necessary or advantageous to
the Government. Unnecessary retrofit of existing systems with new metric components shall be avoided if the total
cost of the retrofit, including redesign costs, exceeds $25,000;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) When metric is not the accepted industry system with respect to a business-related activity, soft metric, hybrid
or dual system may be used during transition to hard metric; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) When the use of metric is impractical or is likely to cause significant inefficiencies or loss of markets to United
States firms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The contracting officer shall review and, if acceptable, approve the waiver prepared by the requirements office
prior to the release of a solicitation that incorporates a specification that is not written in some form of metric,
if the resultant contract is expected to exceed $500,000. The waiver shall be placed in the contract file. If the waiver
is not approved, the contracting officer shall return it to the requirements office with an explanation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) The Department's direct in-house operating metric conversion costs shall be handled as normal operating expenses
rather than as special one time costs or included as a budget line item. However, these costs are to be identified. Identification
includes, but is not limited to, the cost of metric aids, tools, equipment, training and increased cost to develop
metric specifications. All contracting activities and requirements offices shall maintain a record of any costs
and/or savings brought about by metric conversion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Bulk (loose, unpacked) materials shall be specified and purchased in metric or dual units.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) Measuring devices, shop and laboratory equipment shall be purchased in metric or dual units.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) Shipping allowances, bills of lading and other shipping documents shall be expressed in metric or dual units.

It is the Department's policy to incorporate its current fiscal year goals as negotiated with the SBA into all pertinent
Department solicitations, in addition to the standard subcontract clauses. Incorporation of the goals does not
require that large business prime contractors must subcontract, but does require that to the extent they plan to subcontract,
specific goals be established for doing business with small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned firms. Where
funds are available, an incentive clause such as that found in FAR 52.219&hyph;10, Incentive Subcontracting Program
for Small and Small Disadvantaged Business Concerns, is encouraged.

Purpose.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section establishes the Department of State's Affirmative Procurement Program for Recovered Materials in
accordance with Section 6002 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) (42 U.S.C. 6962, Pub. L. 94&hyph;580).
Section 6002 requires that each agency develop an affirmative procurement plan to assure that items composed of recovered
materials will be purchased to the maximum extent practical and which is consistent with Federal procurement law.
It requires that preference be given in procurement programs to the purchase of items containing recycled materials
identified in guidelines promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Executive Order 12780, Federal
Agency Recycling and the Council on Federal Recycling and Procurement Policy, directed implementation of cost effective
affirmative procurement programs for recycled items.

Applicability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The affirmative procurement program is applicable to all domestic acquisition of items currently designated by
an EPA guideline or by future guidelines promulgated by EPA. The requirements of this section are not applicable to
acquisitions made and/or performed outside the United States or its possessions.

Affirmative procurement program 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
is a program which ensures that items composed of recovered materials will be purchased to the maximum extent practicable,
consistent with Federal procurement law. There are four components to an affirmative procurement program:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A preference program;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A promotion program; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Procedures for requiring, obtaining and verifying estimates and certifications of recovered materials content;
and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) An annual review and monitoring.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Designated item
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is an item that has been designated in an EPA procurement guideline as an item that is or can be produced using recovered
materials whose procurement will advance the purpose of RCRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Minimum-content standard 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
is the minimum content of recovered materials that a designated item must contain pursuant to specifications implementing
the Department's preference program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Postconsumer recovered materials 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
are waste materials recovered from retail stores, office buildings, homes and so forth after they have passed through
their end usage as a consumer item. Waste paper includes all items from the first two categories above in addition to
forest residues, and manufacturing and other wastes.

Procurement guidelines 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
are guidelines issued by the EPA pursuant to Section 6002 of RCRA:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Identifying items that are or can be produced with recovered materials and where procurement will advance the
objectives of the Act; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Providing recommended practices for the procurement of such items.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Recovered materials 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
are waste materials and by-products that have been recovered or diverted from solid waste, not including those materials
and by-products generated from, and commonly reused within, an original manufacturing process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Unreasonable price 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
is the price for products containing recovered materials which exceeds alternatives made with virgin materials
by 10 percent or more, and which the requirements office initiating the acquisition substantiates as exorbitant.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The requirements office initiating an acquisition is responsible for determining whether recovered materials
should be included in the specifications. Requirements offices may purchase items subject to the guidelines containing
other than recovered materials only if:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The price of items with recovered materials is unreasonable;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The requirement for items produced with recovered materials results in inadequate competition or adversely
affects small business or the Department's metrication program;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Obtaining items with recovered materials results in unusual and unreasonable delays; or,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Items produced with recovered materials do not meet all reasonable performance specifications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) If the requirements office chooses to procure designated items that do not contain recovered materials, a written
justification must be submitted to the contracting officer.

(a) It is the Department's policy that acquisitions for services, including construction but excluding personal
services contracts, which require contractor personnel to perform work outside of the United States, shall include
the contractual obligation for coverage under the Defense Base Act (42 U.S.C. Sections 1651&hyph;1654, as amended).
For the purpose of this section only, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
contractor personnel
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 includes individuals who are either:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) United States citizens, or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Hired in the United States or its possessions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The Department of State has entered into a contract with an insurance broker and carrier to provide Defense Base
Act insurance, at a fixed rate for services and construction, to cover DOS contracts which will require performance
overseas by United States citizens or those employed in the United States. In countries where local nationals and/or
third country nationals will be employed to perform the contract, such countries may be waived by the Secretary of
Labor. Whenever such insurance is required under the contract, the contracting officer shall insert:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The clause at 652.228&hyph;71, Worker's Compensation Insurance (Defense Base Act)_Services;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(3) The clause at 652.228&hyph;73, Waiver of Defense Base Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Upon award of a contract which requires Defense Base Act insurance, the contracting officer shall notify the successful
offeror of the name of the insurance broker from which the contractor should acquire insurance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The authority to request a waiver from the Secretary of Labor of a particular country, as set forth in FAR 28.305(d),
is reserved to the Secretary of State.

(a) The State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956, as amended (22 U.S.C. 2696 (e)), allows funds from annual appropriations
to extend beyond the fiscal year in which the acquisition was funded. This authority may be used for acquisitions of
supplies or services, regardless of dollar amount or contract type. Use of this authority requires that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The acquisition normally would be considered severable (i.e., the services are repetitive and can be started
or stopped any time; would normally be funded and performed within a fiscal year; and are not services integral to the
creation of an end product. An example is janitorial services.);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The base performance period is twelve months, begins in the current fiscal year, and crosses into the next fiscal
year; and,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Full funding for twelve months is available in the current year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) If the acquisition involves more than one source of funds, the contract shall be priced to identify the source of
funds (by allotment) with the relevant portion of the total supplies or services. For current Department contracts,
bilateral modifications are authorized where necessary to convert to a performance period that crosses fiscal years,
as long as the requisite funding is available as described in paragraph (a), and provided that the total contract length
does not increase.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Use of this authority shall be documented in the contract file and be included as part of the Advance Acquisition
Plan and Price Negotiation Memorandum. If neither document is relevant to the acquisition, the contracting officer
shall prepare a written document to the file indicating compliance with this subsection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) For acquisitions conducted by overseas posts that are funded by another agency, the contracting officer shall
ensure that funding for the full twelve-month period is available at time of award if the authority in 22 U.S.C. 2696(e)
will be used.

Policy.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department's goal is to resolve contract disputes before the issuance of a contracting officer's final decision
under the Contract Disputes Act. Contracting officers shall consider all possible means of reaching a negotiated
settlement, consistent with the Government's best interests, before issuing a final decision on a contractor claim
under the process outlined in FAR 33.206 through 33.211.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Factors favoring ADR.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Contracting officers should consider using ADR in those cases where:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Only facts are in dispute;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The facts are clearly not favorable to the Government;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The anticipated costs (in time and money) are less than the anticipated costs of litigation;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Settlement attempts have reached an impasse;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) ADR techniques have been used successfully in similar situations;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) There is a need for independent expert analysis; or,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) The claim has merit but its value is overstated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Factors disfavoring ADR.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The following circumstances do not favor use of ADR:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Cases involving disputes controlled by clear legal precedent, making compromise difficult;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The resolution will have a significant impact on other pending cases or on the future conduct of Department business;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The dispute is primarily over issues of law;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) A decision of precedential value is needed;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) A significant policy question is involved;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) A full public record of the proceeding is important;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) The outcome could significantly involve persons who are not parties to the contract;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) The costs of pursuing an ADR procedure (in time and money) exceed the cost of litigation;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ix) The nature of the case may cause ADR to be used merely for delay or discovery; or,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(x) The case involves criminal violations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Initial action.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Immediately upon receipt of a claim, the contracting officer shall send a letter acknowledging receipt of the claim
and soliciting the contractor's views on submitting this claim for ADR. In every dispute, the first step toward resolution
shall be unassisted negotiations, in which the parties try to work out the disagreement among themselves. If this
fails, before issuing a final decision, the contracting officer shall consult first with the head of the contracting
activity, and contract the Office of the Legal Adviser and A/OPE to determine whether the disagreement appears susceptible
to resolution by ADR. Consideration shall be given to pursuing additional factfinding or designating a neutral expert
in the disputed issue to provide an advisory opinion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Methods of ADR.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If the initial action to resolve the dispute fails, and the contracting officer issues a final decision which is appealed,
ADR may still be feasible. The ASBCA issues a notice regarding ADR to all contractors who file appeals under the Contract
Disputes Act. This notice describes the following ADR techniques, which contracting officers are urged to discuss
with contractors at any time:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Settlement judge.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A settlement judge is either an administrative judge or hearing examiner who is appointed by the parties in dispute
for the purpose of facilitating settlement. The agenda is flexible and based on the specifics of the individual dispute.
By holding a frank, in-depth discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of each party's position, the settlement
judge may be able to foster a settlement of the dispute. The settlement judge may meet with the parties jointly or individually,
and the settlement judge's recommendations are not binding. Typically, the settlement judge's opinions, based
on his or her experience in handling prior disputes, will help the parties realize whether their arguments have merit
or not.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Minitrial.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A minitrial is not an actual trial but rather a flexible, expedited, but structured procedure in which each party presents
an abbreviated version of its position both to a neutral advisor (who may be appointed by the ASBCA) and to principals
of the parties who have full contractual authority to conclude a settlement. The parties mutually decide on the form
of presentation without regard to traditional judicial proceedings or rules of evidence. An advance agreement by
the parties specifies the procedure to be followed in making presentations, as well as the role of the neutral advisor.
Upon conclusion of the presentations, settlement negotiations are conducted. The neutral advisor may assist the
parties in negotiating settlement, including making non-binding recommendations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Summary trial with binding decision.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A summary trial with binding decision is a procedure in which the scheduling of an appeal is expedited and the parties
try their appeal informally before an administrative judge or panel of judges. The length of the trial and the time
for presentation and decision are tailored to the needs of the particular case. Trial procedures and rules applicable
to appeals are modified or eliminated to expedite resolution of the appeal. The parties must agree, however, that
all decisions, rulings, and orders by the judge(s) are final, conclusive, and not appealable, and may not be set aside,
except for fraud. A summary ``bench'' decision is issued at the conclusion of the trial or a summary written decision
will be issued within ten (10) days of either the trial's conclusion or receipt of a trial transcript.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Mediation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Mediation is a process in which a neutral and impartial third party assists the Government and the contractor in conflict
to negotiate an acceptable settlement of contested issues. The mediator is jointly selected and is asked by the disputing
parties to assist them to reach a voluntary agreement. The mediator has no decisionmaking authority and cannot impose
a decision. Mediation assistance involves working with the parties to improve their communications, clarify or
interpret data, identify key issues to be discussed, design an effective negotiation process, generate settlement

Arbitration.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Non-binding arbitration is a process in which a dispute is jointly submitted by the Government and a contractor to
an impartial and neutral person or panel who provides a written, non-binding opinion used as a guide for negotiations
toward a settlement. Although the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;552) allows agencies
to use binding arbitration, the law provides that the agency head may vacate any arbitration award within 30 days after
it is served on all parties. For this reason, non-binding arbitration is preferable. Additional information is available
in Army Corps of Engineers IWR Pamphlet 91&hyph;ADR&hyph;P&hyph;2, Non-Binding Arbitration, September 1990,
available from A/OPE.

Partnering.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Partnering involves an agreement in principle to share the risks involved in completing a project, and to establish
and promote a partnership environment. Partnering itself is not a contractual agreement and it does not create any
legally enforceable rights, but instead partnering seeks to create a new cooperative attitude in completing Government
contracts. The three basic steps in partnering are:

ADR procedures. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ADR method shall be selected voluntarily by both the Government and the contractor. Both parties shall agree on
the procedures to be followed, including the agenda and amount of time allowed for each party to present its case. The
parties may choose not to have a written transcript or hearing on the record, as this might inhibit settlement. Also,
the decision rendered, if any, should not be considered to establish any precedent for future litigation unless the
parties agree otherwise. In cases where the parties agree to pay jointly for a third-party neutral advisor, it is recommended
that the parties and the advisor agree on a fair and reasonable price. The Government would then issue a simplified
acquisition (if the dollar amount does not exceed the simplified acquisition limitation) for 50% of the agreed price,
and the advisor would submit separate invoices (each for 50% of the price) to the Government and the contractor.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 FRA proposes revisions to regulations governing train and locomotive power braking systems. The proposed revisions
are designed to achieve safety by better adapting the regulations to the needs of contemporary railroad operations
and better facilitating the introduction and use of advanced technologies. These proposed revisions are being issued
in order to comply with recently enacted legislation, to respond to petitions for rulemaking, and to address areas
of concern derived from experience in the application of existing standards.

), by adding a new subsection related to power brake safety which states:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(r) POWER BRAKE SAFETY._(1) The Secretary shall conduct a review of the Department of Transportation's rules with
respect to railroad power brakes, and not later than December 31, 1993, shall revise such rules based on such safety
data as may be presented during that review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In carrying out paragraph (1), the Secretary shall, where applicable, prescribe standards regarding dynamic
brake equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3)(A) The Secretary shall require 2-way end of train devices (or devices able to perform the same function) on road
trains other than locals, road switchers, or work trains to enable the initiation of emergency braking from the rear
of the train. The Secretary shall promulgate rules as soon as possible, but not later than December 31, 1993, requiring
such 2-way end of train devices. Such rules shall at a minimum_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) set standards for such devices based on performance; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) prohibit any railroad, on or after the date that is one year after promulgation of such rules, from acquiring any
end of train device for use on trains which is not a 2-way device meeting the standards set under clause (i); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) require that such trains be equipped with 2-way end of train devices meeting such standards not later than 4 years
after promulgation of such rules; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) provide that any 2-way end of train device acquired for use on trains before such promulgation shall be deemed
to meet such standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The Secretary may consider petitions to amend the rules promulgated under subparagraph (A) to allow the use of
alternative technologies which meet the same basic performance requirements established by such rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) In developing the rules required by subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall consider data presented under paragraph
(1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The Secretary may exclude from the rules required by paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) any category of trains or rail
operations if the Secretary determines that such an exclusion is in the public interest and is consistent with railroad
safety. The Secretary shall make public the reasons for granting any such exclusion. The Secretary shall at a minimum
exclude from the requirements of paragraph (3)_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) trains that have manned cabooses; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) passenger trains with emergency brakes; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) trains that operate exclusively on track that is not part of the general railroad system; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) trains that do not exceed 30 miles per hour and do not operate on heavy grades, except for any categories of such trains
specifically designated by the Secretary; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) trains that operate in a push mode. Pub. L. No. 102&hyph;365, &sect;7; 45 U.S.C. 431(r).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 31, 1992, FRA published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) concerning the possible revision
of the power brake regulations (57 FR 62546). The ANPRM provided background information and presented questions
on various subjects including: the use and design of end-of-train (EOT) telemetry devices; the air flow method of
train brake testing; the additional testing of train air brakes during extremely cold weather; the training of employees
to perform train brake tests and inspections; computer-assisted braking systems; the operation of dynamic brakes
on locomotives; and other miscellaneous subjects relating to conventional brake systems as well as information
regarding high speed passenger train brakes. The questions presented in the ANPRM on the various topics were intended
as fact-finding tools and were intended to elicit the views of those persons outside FRA charged with ensuring compliance
with the power brake regulations on a day-to-day basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following publication of the ANPRM, FRA conducted four days of technical workshops in early 1993 to elicit information
and views. Workshops were conducted in Kansas City, Missouri on February 17; in Chicago, Illinois on March 2 and 3;
and in Newark, New Jersey on March 9. These workshops were attended by at least seventeen railroads, three organizations
representing railroads, four labor organizations and various individual members of the organizations, four manufacturers
of train brake-related equipment, and several governmental agencies. Written comments were received from most
of these parties or their individual members. In addition to the written comments received from the parties that attended
the workshops, written comments were also received from one other railroad, one state public utilities commission,
one state transit authority, and one private citizen. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA has carefully considered all of the oral and written comments offered by the various parties. The resulting Notice
of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) is based on these comments as well as FRA's experience with enforcing the current power
brake regulations.

Prologue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA's institutional experience in locomotive and train braking safety extends backwards in time to creation of the
Department of Transportation in 1967 (at which time the Bureau of Railroad Safety and its functions were transferred
from the Interstate Commerce Commission), to the passage of the Power or Train Brakes Safety Appliance Act of 1958,
and ultimately to the passage of the original Safety Appliance Act 100 years ago. Current FRA personnel have, during
prior years, served in a variety of capacities on every major railroad. Each of them has been exposed_in their combined
Federal and private sector careers_to a vastly richer panorama of American railroading than most railroad employees
will enjoy in a lifetime. These railroad safety inspectors, supervisors, and managers contribute daily to the rulemaking
judgments ultimately expressed by the Federal Railroad Administrator, and the agency has made a special effort in
this proceeding to tap the knowledge that these individuals possess to ascertain the means by which public and employee
safety may be secured. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The experience of the agency yields the following broad findings. These finding are based upon hundreds of accident
investigations, tens of thousands of days of inspection activity, and hundreds of thousands of contacts with railroad
employees, supervisors, and managers, as well as the comments to this docket: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;In general, locomotive and train brake safety is good. Investments in improved technology offer the possibility
of further progress in the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;However, exceptions to this rule are numerous and persistent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Exceptions often derive from railroads' attempts to speed the provision of efficient transportation services.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The current structure of the regulations tends to impede efficient provision of transportation services,
while creating incentives to evade the regulations and imposing certain requirements that are not effective in practice.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Accordingly, continuation of the current regulatory structure_which with every passing year becomes less
well adapted to the current realities of the industry_is likely to erode safety over time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Train Brake Inspections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The principal problems addressed in this notice concern the safety of conventional freight trains. In particular,
the current regulations focus great attention on intensive and often repetitive train brake inspections conducted
at departure from major terminals and at fixed intervals en route. Under these circumstances, tremendous incentives
exist to ``overlook'' or fail to inspect rigorously for what may be viewed as minor defects on individual cars. In some
cases, personnel have been instructed to disregard defective conditions in order to move trains, after which FRA
has often been required to resolve (or attempt to resolve) disputed claims of responsibility in the context of enforcement
actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This system encourages railroads to assign inspection duties to train crews who_while notably competent and alert
in their normal duties_have often received little training in inspection of increasingly diverse power brake arrangements
and other safety-critical components of freight equipment. As a result of this and other factors,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the number of qualified mechanical personnel employed by the railroads and the number of locations at which such personnel
are deployed have declined rapidly. In a system that ensures minimum economies of scale, repair trucks equipped with
an increasing array of equipment are then used to provide spot-repair capability at outlying points in cases where
cars cannot be moved safely prior to repair (or where, as in the case of the statutory power brake requirements, movement
is prohibited by law). Although this process of consolidation and adaptation may have been both necessary and healthy
in its earlier stages, it now threatens to leave the railroads short of qualified mechanical forces and excessively
dependent on contract repair facilities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA is intimately familiar with other factors that complicate this analysis. In particular, the competitive environment
fostered by deregulation of the motor carrier and railroad industries has led to intensive cost cutting through rationalization
of plant, more effective utilization of equipment, substitution of automated information systems for manual systems,
and reduction of payrolls through reductions in force and contracting out of work previously performed by railroad
employees. For the railroads, reducing employment has become an imperative that threatens to drive itself out of
control. For instance, the Railroad Retirement System depends upon employer contributions on behalf of less than
275,000 employees to support over 372,000 retirees. With every employee removed from the rolls, the likelihood increases
that further increases in Railroad Retirement Taxes will be required_creating further perceived incentives to
reduce employment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A long-term shift in car ownership has also affected railroad employment decisions. Approximately 40 percent of
the freight car fleet is now privately owned, including virtually all tank cars used in revenue service.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Adequate deployment of mechanical employees will remain necessary for the foreseeable future, both to foster power
brake safety and to ensure that other components of locomotives and cars are adequately inspected and maintained.
Federal regulations should encourage this process through reasonably structured incentives while avoiding any
attempt at micromanagement of business decisions. This notice embodies a strategy to achieve safety in the short
term_train by train_while encouraging adequate deployment of mechanical personnel to provide the eyes, hands and
minds necessary for effective maintenance of railroad rolling stock.

General Revision of Standards for Freight and Passenger Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters in this proceeding have noted, and FRA agrees, that the current regulations fail to adequately delineate
between requirements for conventional freight braking systems and the more diverse systems for various categories
of passenger service. FRA also agrees that the regulations should be updated to recognize contemporary electronic
systems that are used to control elements of power brake systems. Finally, FRA has learned over years since passage
of the Power or Train Brakes Safety Appliance Act of 1958, which required adoption of the Association of American Railroads'
(AAR) recommended practices as regulatory text, that improvements in clarity are badly needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, FRA proposes a comprehensive revision of the regulations that preserves useful elements of the current
system in the framework of an entirely new document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The resulting proposed changes balance the concerns of rail labor and management and would increase the effectiveness
of the regulations. The NPRM includes significant incentives to the railroads to encourage the use of qualified mechanical
forces to conduct train brake system tests at major terminals where long-haul trains originate. The NPRM also proposes
requirements to check abuses in the single car test program. The overall regulatory proposal focuses on safety performance
rather than micromanagement of the railroads. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In developing this proposal FRA engaged in a systems approach to the power brake regulations. FRA considered all aspects
of a railroad operation and the effects that the entire operation has on the train and locomotive power braking systems.
Therefore, these proposed requirements not only address specific brake equipment and inspection requirements,
but also attempt to encompass other aspects of a railroad's operation which directly affect the quality and performance
of the braking system, such as: personnel qualifications; maintenance requirements; written procedures governing
operation, maintenance, and inspection; record keeping requirements; and the development and integration of new
technologies. Consequently, FRA views this proposal as an organic whole, with any one of its individual requirements
being necessary to ensure the effectiveness of the others. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As an additional aspect of this systems approach, FRA considered the role that shortline railroads have in today's
freight industry. FRA believes that the current marketplace requires Class I railroads and shortline railroads
to operate as an integrated system. Many of today's shortlines rely on Class I railroads for the training of their employees
and the maintenance of their equipment. In addition, many shortline railroads and Class I railroads interchange
and operate each others equipment. Therefore, except in limited circumstances, it is impossible, from a regulatory
standpoint, to separate shortline railroads from Class I railroads. Therefore, in order to ensure the safety and
quality of train and locomotive power braking systems throughout the entire freight industry, this proposal generally
imposes a consistent set of requirements on shortline and Class I railroads as a group. Although FRA recognizes that
many of the operational benefits created by this proposal are not available to most shortline operations, FRA feels
that the integrated nature of the freight industry requires that universally consistent requirements be imposed
on both shortline and Class I railroads. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule is justified on the basis of operating cost savings to the industry as a whole. Cost savings due to
accident/incident prevention were quantified to some extent but were not included in the cost impact analysis. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 49 CFR &sect;225.5. Although significant accident/incident reduction will occur due to the proposed rule, the benefits
were not fully quantified because of the need to proceed with satisfaction of the statutory mandate, the already positive
benefit to cost ratio, and the difficulty associated with quantifying the effectiveness of some of the proposals
prior to further public comment. A detailed discussion regarding the quantifying of benefits derived from accident/incident
reduction is provided in the Regulatory Impact section of the preamble and in the Appendix to the Regulatory Analysis.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA recognizes that some of the provisions contained in this proposal may affect other FRA regulations currently
in existence. For example, the provisions regarding Special Notices for Repair for freight cars and locomotives
contained at Part 216 of this chapter do not address nonconformity with the requirements proposed in this part. Other
FRA regulations that may be affected by these proposed requirements are the Freight Car Safety Standards, the signal
inspection standards, and the Locomotive Engineer Qualification Standards contained at Parts 215, 236, and 240
of this chapter respectively. Consequently, after issuance of a final rule, FRA will make whatever conforming or
clarifying changes to FRA's other regulations that are deemed necessary.

Discussion of Comments and General FRA Conclusions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of discussion, the comments may be grouped in four categories by origin: (1) Railroad labor organizations
and their individual members, (2) railroad management representatives, (3) manufacturers of train brake equipment,
and (4) other commenters. FRA noted both the common themes expressed by members of these groups and the many variations
on, and exceptions to, those themes. Discussions follow with respect to the primary issues addressed by the commenters.

I. EOT Telemetry Devices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the advent of EOT devices, technological advances have been made to incorporate ``two-way communication''
into the system. The two-way EOT device, in addition to the features of the one-way EOT device, has the ability of transmitting
from the controlling locomotive an emergency brake application that begins at the rear of the train. This is a desirable
feature in event of a blockage in the brake pipe that would prevent the pneumatic transmission of the emergency brake
application throughout the entire train. In 1986, FRA concluded that mandating the installation of two-way EOT devices
was not warranted. However, at that time FRA made a public commitment to monitor developments in EOT device technology
and to review the subject periodically. 51 FR 17300, 17301 (May 9, 1986). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since 1986, significant advances have been made in the development of two-way EOT devices, and they are now commercially
available in the market place from two manufacturers. In addition, FRA has received recommendations from the National
Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and petitions from the United Transportation Union, the Brotherhood of Locomotive
Engineers, the Oregon Public Utilities Commission, the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission, and
the Montana Public Service Commission to require two-way EOT devices on all cabooseless trains operating in certain
territories. Furthermore, 49 U.S.C. &sect;20141, formerly contained at Section 7 of the RSERA, which amends the
FRSA by adding a new subsection dealing with power brakes, mandates that the Secretary of Transportation promulgate
rules requiring two-way EOT devices. Section 20141, formerly Section 7 of the RSERA, sets out various minimum requirements
that any promulgated rule must contain. Consequently, based upon the advances in technology, the recommendations
and petitions received, and the statutory mandate, FRA requested comments from interested parties regarding the
exception of certain operations from any two-way EOT device requirements, the operational characteristics of the
devices, the en route failure of the devices, and the costs associated with equipping trains with the devices. 57 FR
62546, 62550&hyph;62551 (Dec. 31, 1992).

A. Exceptions and Definitions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The AAR and several individual railroads recommended that remote control operations and operations with helper
locomotives located near the end of the train be excepted from any two-way EOT device requirements. The commenters
contended that in these types of operations the purpose of the two-way EOT device, to initiate an emergency brake application
commencing at the rear of the train, disappears since either a crew has control of the brakes or the locomotive placed
near the end of the train is able to initiate a brake application from other than the head end of the train. Union Pacific
Railroad Company also recommended an exception for all empty trains, loaded trains used in short turnaround service
of sixty miles where grade is not a factor, and trains with less than 4,000 trailing tons. One commenter also sought
an exception for trains equipped with secondary, fully independent brake systems that would require the development
of a unique EOT device to initiate an emergency application from the rear of the train. One railroad suggested that
no exception should be given to any trains currently using one-way devices and that all trains except those operating
with an occupied caboose should be equipped with two-way EOT devices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In defining ``mountain grade'' The American Short Line Railroad Association (ASLRA) and other commenters recommended
that the definition should be based on a variety of factors including tonnage, length of grade, speed, percent of grade,
and grade distance. The ASLRA felt that a definition based on these factors would be consistent with the intent of Congress
not to require every small railroad to fall under the legislation. Several other railroad representatives recommended
that the definition of mountain grade be based on both the gradient and distance. Many of the railroad commenters proposed
definitions of 1.5&hyph;2 percent grades for a distance of five miles. Two commenters addressed the definition of
``heavy tonnage,'' stating that it should be defined as any train weighing over 100 tons per operative brake. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Railroad representatives suggested that the effective date of any regulation requiring the use of two-way devices
should be extended for the full four years permitted under the Act. The commenters felt that the later the effective
date, the fewer the number of one-way devices that would have to be discarded and the longer the time for railroads to
spread out the costs of the new two-way devices. Railroad commenters also recommended a grandfather clause for any
two-way equipment purchased prior to the issuance of a final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Labor representatives recommended that two-way devices should be required on all cabooseless trains that are not
specifically excepted in the RSERA. However, these commenters also admitted that grade situations are probably
the area where the devices are most useful. Two labor representatives suggested requiring the use of the devices on
grades of one percent or greater. The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers (BLE) wanted ``mountain grades'' defined
as areas with one percent grades for two miles. One individual conductor felt that two-way devices should be mandatory
on all trains in which the rear is unoccupied, with a weight in excess of 2,000 tons, and a length of greater than 3,000
feet. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FRA Conclusions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on consideration of Congress' purpose in enacting &sect;7 of the RSERA and after review of the comments received
and the accidents relied on for support of the use of two-way EOT devices, FRA feels that the devices should be required
on trains that operate at speeds in excess of 30 mph and on trains that operate in mountain grade territories. However,
FRA believes that certain operations, other than those specifically listed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;7 of the RSERA, should also be excepted from the requirements regarding two-way EOT devices. FRA recognizes
that the safety concerns for requiring two-way EOT devices are less prevalent in operations (i) of trains having the
ability to initiate a brake application from other than the front end and (ii) of trains equipped with fully independent
secondary braking systems. FRA further agrees with several of the commenters that the definition of ``mountain grade''
must be based on some formula that takes into account not only the percent of grade but also the length of grade and the
speed of the train. FRA thinks that a definition based on these factors would sufficiently limit the number of areas
covered by the definition, so as not to be overly burdensome to the industry, and yet would include those areas that
would most benefit from the added safety provided by the two-way devices. Furthermore, in order to provide the industry
time to acquire a sufficient number of two-way EOT devices and to ease the economic impact of acquiring the devices,
FRA proposes to mandate compliance with any final regulation requiring the use of two-way EOT devices as of January
1, 1997. Requiring earlier compliance is not warranted by the marginal safety benefits, and later compliance would
not be consistent with the spirit of the RSERA (even if, as is possible, FRA is unable to issue a final rule by December
31, 1993).

B. Operational Characteristics
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Burlington Northern Railroad (BN) reported that it has used two-way EOT devices for seven years and has had no reports
of an emergency being initiated from the front end. Although BN experienced some problems with undesired emergencies
in the beginning, they were due to start-up problems. CP Rail Systems reported that it has about 700 two-way devices
in service since 1989 and has had no undesired emergencies due to faulty operation of the equipment, nor has it had occasion
to use the devices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several railroads that currently use either one-way or two-way EOT devices stated that they have experienced effective
communication between the head and rear units in trains as long as 1.5 and 2 miles. However, these railroads also reported
that they have experienced communication problems in several circumstances, such as the following: when trains
are split by an overpass or viaduct; when trains operate in some mountain or tunnel locations; and when trains are in
a major yard where bridges, power lines, towers, and industrial structures are more prevalent.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Other railroads that have some experience with the devices stated that the current two-way EOT devices have many optional
features to provide information from the rear to the front units, such as the distance from front to rear units, monitoring
of end- car brake-pipe pressure, motion status, marker light status, battery status, loss-of-communication alarm,
automatic and manual communication test, and rear-of-train emergency braking. The AAR as well as seven of its railroad
members commented that these additional features should not be required, but that each individual railroad should
be allowed to determine which options are best suited for its particular operations. These parties also stated that
the statute merely requires that the rear end of a train be able to initiate an emergency brake application when activated
from the front and that there is no evidence available to support the need of requiring the transmission of other information.
Several railroads expressed concern over requiring these additional features noting that such features reduce
the battery life of the device, create additional enroute failure problems, add to the cost of the device, and may be
eliminated or relocated as technology advances. One railroad recommended that failure of any optional feature,
other than the ability to initiate an emergency brake application, should not be treated as an enroute failure. This
same railroad also recommended that FRA consider replacing the ``flashing lights on EOT devices'' with retro-reflectorized
material such as that used in Canada. The railroad suggested that such a change could significantly alter the cost
of two-way devices, reduce battery requirements, and reduce failure rates. One railroad commented on the battery
life of current two-way devices, indicating that it is about 80 percent that of one-way devices. This party also indicated
that inspection of the battery must be made at initial terminal brake inspections. The AAR commented that the telemetry
battery life of EOT devices operating in conditions from 40 degrees below zero to 150 degrees above zero is about 100
hours for one-way devices and 80 hours for two-way devices. The AAR also stated that the light flasher battery life
is about 50 hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several railroad representatives commented that two-way EOT devices need to be ``secured system'' types, which
means that an emergency application should be obtainable only by someone in the cab of the locomotive on that train.
These commenters stated that current devices are designed so that the front and rear units can be linked together by
use of a specific code which prevents outside tampering. Once the two units are linked, no other front unit will communicate
with the rear unit. One commenter stated that it would require 38 hours of constant contact to get the proper code needed
to obtain access to the device. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Individual members of the Brotherhood of Railway Carmen (BRC) commented that the current one-way devices are unreliable
and are not receiving proper maintenance. These individuals stated that the gauges used to calibrate the devices
need to be tested. Several carmen commented that transmissions from current one-way devices have been affected by
high tension wires, bridges, and foggy conditions. Labor representatives as well as individual members stated that
they would like to see as many of the additional features now available with two-way devices required. These commenters
felt that any additional information that could be made available to train crews regarding the condition of the train
would be beneficial. One individual conductor suggested that the batteries on EOT devices should be checked at all
brake tests and at all crew change points. This individual also felt it should be required that batteries have at least
a 75-percent charge before the train departs a terminal and that the devices be operational at all crew change points.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A conductor for BN provided information on a new safety device invention that would address the problem of trainline
blockage and turned angle cocks and would be used in connection with EOT devices. The device is coupled to the end of
the brake pipe and would continuously exhaust air at a predetermined rate, which would be compensated for by the locomotive
air source. Thus, if the trainline is blocked, the locomotive air source will not replenish the depleted air, and a
brake application will take place. The engineer will be warned of the loss in pressure at the rear of the train by the
EOT device and will be able to take corrective action. One manufacturer of EOT devices commented that the EOT devices
are limited to two watts of power by the Federal Communications Commission and that depending on the site, such as when
a train is half in a tunnel and half out of a tunnel, trains may experience brownouts or complete blackouts. The manufacturer
stated that many of these problems can be eliminated with installation of a repeater feature that continuously repeats
the transmitted message every few seconds. In addition, the manufacturer noted that when an emergency application
is requested the transmission signal is increased to 8 watts, which probably will overcome any site interference.
Another manufacturer of the devices commented that it did not know of any interference due to power lines, but stated
that it has received comments about losing transmissions in mountainous areas.

FRA Conclusions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 FRA recognizes the benefits provided to the train crew by the additional features currently available on two-way
EOT devices and highly recommends that railroads obtain as many of these optional features as they can when purchasing
the devices. However, as long as the devices meet the minimum operating standards required to initiate an emergency
brake application from the rear of the train, FRA believes that each individual railroad is in the best position to
determine the type of optional features that are best suited for their operations. In addition, FRA does not want to
prevent any technological advancements which might improve or modify many of the optional features currently available.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several parties commented on the loss of transmission between the front and rear units at various locations. Based
on the comments and information provided by the manufacturers of the devices, FRA believes that railroads should
be required to automatically check the communication status between the two units on a periodic basis in order to alert
train crews of any transmission problem. FRA suggests that those railroads that experience transmission problems
consider the installation of a repeater feature recommended by the manufacturers, which continuously repeats the
transmitted message every few seconds. FRA also notes, as one manufacturer commented, that the transmission signal
requesting an emergency brake application is sent at a higher wattage than normal transmissions and should be sufficient
to overcome any site interference. Furthermore, in order to prevent vandalism and avoid the possibility of a train
accidentally being placed in emergency by an outside transmission, FRA believes that the front and rear units should
be linked together so that the rear unit will only respond to an emergency command from its associated front unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA elects not to comment, at this time, on one railroad's suggestion that reflectorized material be allowed to be
used in place of the flashing lights on EOT devices, since this issue would be more appropriately addressed under a
revision of 49 CFR Part 221 regarding rear end markers.

however, FRA encourages continued testing and development of the device.

C. En route Failures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The AAR and several of its member railroads commented that a train that experiences enroute failure of its two-way
EOT device should be allowed to continue without delay and without imposition of a speed limit. These parties base
this position on the fact that little data exists that shows the preventive effect of the devices and no railroads currently
using the devices have reported an incident where the device was used. Some railroad commenters suggested that trains
that experience en route failure should be allowed to continue to destination, whereas other railroads suggested
that the trains be allowed to continue to the next forward point for repairs or replacement, just as any other enroute
failure. Several railroads also contended that if a speed limit were imposed on trains with en route failures the cost
to the industry would be devastating and would hurt the industry's competitiveness due to multiple train delays,
missed deliveries, and loss of business. Several commenters also suggested that imposing speed limits for en route
failures would actually increase safety risks due to undesirable speed differentials with trailing trains and because
these slower trains would have to take to sidings to let faster trains pass and, thus, the likelihood of vandalism is
increased. CP Rail Systems noted that Canada requires speed to be reduced to 30 mph when failure of the devices occurs
en route. This commenter also noted that two-way devices have a low failure rate, only about 1 in every 400 crew starts.
One railroad suggested that a 30 mph speed limit be applied only to trains departing from an initial terminal with inoperative
device. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FRA Conclusions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 FRA believes that, if a train equipped with a two-way EOT device has an en route failure that causes the train to lose
the ability to initiate an emergency brake application from the rear of the train, the speed of that train should be
limited. FRA recognizes the railroads' concerns that a speed limitation may cause train delays, missed deliveries,
and a possible increase in safety risks; however, FRA believes that the railroads are overstating these problems.
The railroads themselves conceded that the EOT devices are very reliable and can operate for two to three years without
a problem. In fact, two railroads commented on the low failure rate of the devices, indicating a failure rate of less
than one percent. One railroad also mentioned that Canada requires speed to be reduced to 30 mph on trains which experience
enroute failure of the two-way device; however, this commenter did not contend that Canada's requirement has produced
the problems cited by the railroads. Thus, FRA feels the concerns raised by the railroads regarding a speed limitation
for en route failures of the devices are not justified. Furthermore, allowing trains to continue with inoperative
two-way EOT devices, at speeds that FRA feels require the added safety benefits provided by the devices, would expose
both railroad employees and the public to potential harm that might be averted if this relatively new technology is
available to the train crews. FRA also believes that attaching a material operational limitation to a failure of the
device will materially increase the likelihood that such failures will be prevented through improved design and
maintenance.

D. Costs and Maintenance
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Both railroad and labor organizations agreed that the cost of new two-way EOT devices will be approximately $7,000
per unit, which includes both the front and rear units. The AAR and several railroads also stated that the cost of current
one-way units is approximately $3,700 per unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AAR estimates that the total cost to the industry to replace currently used one-way devices with devices that have
two-way capabilities will be approximately $150 million. Railroad representatives stated that existing rear units
of one-way devices could not be upgraded to two-way capabilities, and although the front units of the one-way devices
could be upgraded it was not cost effective. However, one railroad did state that it could retrofit its 1,500 existing
front-end radio units at a cost of $740 each, for a total cost of $1.1 million, but stated that retrofitting the rear
units was not feasible. Various railroad commenters provided approximate figures for equipping their fleets with
two-way devices: Union Pacific estimated initial costs at $21 million and $2.4 million per year for replacement units;
BN estimated the cost to replace its 1,400 one-way devices at $15 million; CSX Transportation estimated a cost of $17
million to acquire approximately 1,867 rear units and 2,687 front end receivers; Conrail estimated the cost to replace
its 1,100 existing one-way devices at $10 million; Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe estimated the cost to upgrade front
units and replace 650 rear one-way units at $5.6 million; and Norfolk Southern estimated its cost to convert to two-way
devices at $2.7 million.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The AAR estimated the maintenance costs of two-way devices to be twice the costs of maintenance on current one-way
devices. Based on figures presented by one railroad, the AAR stated that in 1989 maintenance costs of one-way devices
were approximately $2,000 annually per device; thus, expected maintenance costs for two-way devices will be about
$4,000 per year per device. The AAR as well as seven railroads commented that current regulations regarding one-way
EOT devices are adequate except that the current calibration period of 92 days is based on outdated technology. All
of these commenters stated that they have used the devices for years and have had little if any problems with them. One
commenter stated that the most frequent cause of failure of these devices is battery failure during periods of extreme
cold, which could be cured by replacing the batteries at initial terminals. The commenters stated that they have rarely,
if ever, found one of the devices out of calibration within the 92-day period and believe that an annual calibration
requirement would be more realistic, with all related tests being performed at that time. Several railroads also
commented that based on the performance of current one-way devices there is no reason to require calibration of the
two-way devices every 92 days. These commenters believed that the 92-day calibration requirement for one-way devices
was based on the fact that there was little experience with their operation at the time. Since that time, experience
with the devices has shown that a calibration period of one year is more than adequate. One railroad stated that its
current one-way devices operate for two to three years without a problem, and that in 1992 it replaced only about 20
of its 1,400 units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several members of the BRC commented on the need to have interchangeable battery packs for all the different types
of two-way devices currently available because at present some railroads are unable to charge the devices that come
onto their lines from other railroads. Various carmen also presented written comments reiterating their concerns
that the current one-way devices are unreliable, that maintenance is not being performed, and that the gauges used
to calibrate them need to be tested.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FRA Conclusions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 FRA generally agrees with the cost figures presented by the commenters. FRA also believes that the 92-day calibration
period currently imposed on one-way EOT devices is outdated. FRA agrees with several of the commenters that the 92-day
requirement was established at a time when there was little experience with these types of devices. Since that time,
FRA has received no evidence indicating that calibration of the devices is difficult to maintain. Furthermore, several
railroads attested to the reliability of the one-way and two-way devices stating that they rarely find the devices
out of calibration after 92 days and that the failure rates of the devices are very low. Consequently, FRA believes
that the calibration period for all EOT devices could be extended to one year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA further believes that one of the major factors affecting the reliability of two-way EOT devices is the failure
of the batteries on the devices while a train is enroute. As several commenters stated, battery failure is often the
result of a failure to inspect the battery charge prior to departure or the inability of one railroad to charge the batteries
of the devices belonging to another railroad which are used on its line. Consequently, in order to ensure that the batteries
on a two-way EOT device are sufficiently charged to operate the device throughout a train's movement and to encourage
the development and use of interchangeable batteries or battery chargers, FRA proposes to prohibit a train equipped
with a two-way EOT device from departing from a point of origin with the batteries of such device charged to less than
75 percent of watt-hour capacity.

II. Air Flow Method 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The air flow method (AFM) of train air brake testing monitors the rate of air flow through the automatic brake valve
to the brake pipe by the means of a brake pipe flow indicator. The AFM of brake testing is a more comprehensive test than
the present leakage test. The leakage method only measures the amount of leakage from the brake and branch pipes, whereas
the AFM tests the entire brake system including the reservoirs and control valves. In addition, the leakage method
does not test the capability of the pressure-maintaining feature of the 26L brake equipment. The AFM, on the other
hand, tests the brake system just as it is operated, with the pressure-maintaining feature cut in. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AFM of qualifying train air brake systems has been allowed in Canada as an alternative to the leakage test since
1984. In addition, several railroads in the United States have been using the AFM since 1989 when the AAR's petition
for a waiver of compliance was granted allowing the AFM as an alternative to the leakage test. In order to determine
if the AFM of train air brake testing should be included as an alternative to the leakage test, FRA in the ANPRM (57 FR
62552) requested comments from interested parties regarding the operating history of the AFM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AAR and several railroads commented on the operating experience of using the AFM. These commenters reported that
the AFM is an effective and reliable method of qualifying train brakes and that the greatest benefit of the method is
the information it provides to the train crew. CP Rail reported that testing on the AFM started in Canada in 1975 and
became an alternate method of qualifying train brakes in 1984. CP Rail as well as several other railroads stated that
they have experienced no problems with the method. Conrail commented that, although it initially experienced problems
with sticking pointers, defective check valves, and protruding screws on the air flow meters, these problems have
been eliminated. Conrail also stated that use of the AFM has indicated a slight reduction in undesired emergencies.
Several railroads commented that the AFM provides information to the train crew regarding the brake pipe that is not
provided by the leakage test. Two railroads responded that in all the years they have used the AFM they have experienced
no instance where a train had to stop because the air flow could not be maintained. The AAR maintained that the failure
rate of the air flow indicators is less than 1 percent. In fact, Conrail stated that it performed 9,000 air flow indicator
calibrations in 1992 and found only 90 defective indicators. Several railroads commented that they currently calibrate
the air flow meters on a 60-day to 92-day basis and have no problem with current calibration procedures. Two railroads
noted that they initially had problems calibrating the devices due to orifice sizes but have since cured this problem.
One railroad mentioned that it had problems calibrating the devices in extremely cold weather until it applied condition
eight of FRA's waiver to the calibration of the gauge on the locomotive as well as the test orifices. (``The air flow
indicator calibration test orifice shall be calibrated at temperatures of not more than 20 degrees Fahrenheit.'')

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Railroad representatives unanimously opposed any requirement that would make using the AFM mandatory or the sole
method of qualifying brake systems. All railroad commenters supported the adoption of the AFM as an alternative to
the leakage test for qualifying braking systems. Most of these commenters suggested that the use of either method
is an economical or operational decision that should be made by each individual railroad. One railroad recommended
that trains qualified under the AFM should be requalified with the leakage test if the air flow indicator fails enroute.
The cost figures presented by the AAR and several railroads for equipping locomotives with air flow meters range from
$350 to $1,450 per unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amtrak and two other passenger and commuter railroads commented that due to the short length of passenger trains the
AFM is not a beneficial means of qualifying the braking systems. They felt that the flow rate of 60 cubic feet per minute
(CFM) was inappropriate for passenger trains because it would allow these shorter trains to operate with excessive
brake pipe leakage since the AFM measures the ability to maintain pressure, not brake pipe leakage. However, these
commenters did support the use of the AFM as an alternative to the leakage test for freight operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both the Railway Labor Executives' Association (RLEA) and the BRC as well as several individual carmen opposed the
adoption of the AFM as an alternative method of qualifying brake systems. The parties felt that the leakage test is
the only reliable method for determining the integrity of the air brake system and for identifying leaks. These commenters
stated that the AFM only determines whether the brake pipe is compensating for existing leaks and does not identify
the severity of the leak, and thus, trains would be allowed to operate with leaks over 5-psi, which is dangerous especially
in cold weather and could result in an emergency application or derailment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Westinghouse Air Brake Company (WABCO) responded stating that both the leakage test and the AFM combined with the
15-psi gradient restriction are effective and acceptable methods of qualifying braking systems. WABCO commented
that the 60&hyph;CFM limit required by the AFM and the 5-psi limit required by the leakage test are both conservative
figures in view of today's braking system capabilities, and that the 5-psi limit was derived long before today's pressure
maintaining feature which is an integral part of all locomotive brake valves. WABCO stated that front-to-rear gradient
is the most important element of braking performance and that long trains with a 15-psi gradient can be operated with
no problem. This commenter also mentioned that the 60&hyph;CFM limit of the AFM would allow higher leakage on shorter
trains but nothing that would cause a problem in brake operations if the 15-psi gradient is maintained.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FRA Conclusions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA believes that if a train contains a locomotive equipped with 26L freight locomotive brake equipment and the train
is equipped with an EOT device, that train should be allowed to be qualified using the AFM. FRA also agrees with several
commenters that the AFM should not be permitted as a means of qualifying braking systems on commuter and passenger
trains. Due to the shorter length of these types of trains the use of the AFM to qualify their brake systems might allow
these trains to operate with excessive brake pipe leakage. The AFM would be an alternative to the leakage test for qualifying
properly equipped freight train brake systems. FRA recognizes the concerns of several labor organization commenters
opposing the adoption of the AFM; however, FRA believes these commenters' apprehension is based on their unfamiliarity
with the method. As FRA pointed out in the ANPRM (57 FR 62551) and as several commenters confirmed, the AFM is a much more
comprehensive test than the leakage test. The AFM tests the entire brake system just as it is used, with the pressure-maintaining
feature cut in. The method has been allowed in Canada since 1984 without any problems. Based on the comments from several
railroads and information obtained during the method's testing from 1981 to 1988, FRA feels the AFM is an effective
and reliable alternative method of qualifying train brakes. Although FRA is not mandating the use of the AFM, FRA does
encourage railroads to use the method on all trains, not necessarily for qualifying the brake systems, but as a means
of providing additional information regarding the brake system to the train crew. FRA further believes that calibration
of the air flow indicators should be performed at least every 92 days, based on the fact that it is the calibration period
required by the current FRA waiver granted to the AAR and because most railroads stated that they already calibrate
the air flow indicators every 60 to 92 days and gave no indication that the period should be altered. See 54 FR 5195 (Feb.
1, 1989).

III. Testing in Cold Weather and on Steep Grades 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA has received a recommendation from the NTSB and petitions from the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, the United
Transportation Union, and the Montana Joint Rail Labor Legislative Council to require additional train air brake
system testing in extremely cold weather and mountain grade territory. These parties cite concerns regarding existing
practices of some railroads in these areas and the general problem of assuring sufficient brake pipe pressure during
train operations in extremely cold weather and on steep, descending grades. In the ANPRM (57 FR 62553), FRA sought
comments from interested parties regarding the need for additional testing of train air brakes in these circumstances
and the type of additional testing required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AAR and a variety of other railroads opposed the mandating of additional testing in cold weather or in mountain
grade territory. They stated that the accidents that have occurred in cold weather and on heavy grades are due to failure
of individuals to comply with existing procedures and not due to inadequate testing, procedures, or equipment. These
commenters felt that current brake tests and operating procedures are sufficient as long as they are followed and
performed properly. Several railroads commented that they have installed air dryers on their locomotives in order
to eliminate the use of alcohol in cold weather, which is very detrimental to the rubber components of the braking system.
In addition, several railroads contended that improved equipment, such as welded fittings and ferrule-clamped
air hoses, have negated the effects of cold weather on leakage and braking. Several railroads also suggested that
running tests should not be required in mountain grade territory since the performance of such tests only results
in the depletion of the reserve air supply, and thus, jeopardizes the effectiveness of the brake system by requiring
a train to approach a grade with less than a fully charged brake system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addressing the issues of ``feed valve braking'' and use of the ``Passenger'' position of the 26C brake valve in freight
service, the AAR stated that the individual railroads have operating rules that address these forms of braking and
since no safety issue has arisen regarding their use there is no justification for removing the railroad's discretion
in establishing rules appropriate for their operations. At least four railroads stated that use of the ``Passenger''
position in freight service can be performed safely and may be needed and wanted in certain circumstances, and that
there should be no regulation prohibiting its use. Although several railroads stated that they do not allow or recommend
``feed valve braking,'' they all believed that the current operating rules of the individual railroads sufficiently
address the issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two labor organizations and several of their members commented that additional tests are not required but that good
initial and intermediate terminal brake tests are needed. Counsel for the TCU suggested that the railroads should
consider placing a carman on each train. The BRC and several of its carmen commented on the widespread use of alcohol
and methanol in the trainline during cold weather and mentioned the degenerative effect it has on the rubber components
of the brake system. These commenters felt that the use of these materials in the trainline should be addressed by FRA.
The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers (BLE) suggested that the allowable front-to-rear gradient be reduced in
cold weather from 15-psi to 10-psi. One organization recommended a regulation requiring locomotive engineers to
test the brake pipe pressure prior to passing the summit on a mountain grade. The BLE stated that the burden of establishing
the safety of ``feed valve braking'' and the use of the ``Passenger'' position of the brake valve should be borne by
the railroads rather than using BLE members as test pilots. However, one individual engineer felt that both methods
should continue to be allowed in limited circumstances to address unusual conditions that arise from either undesired
emergencies or faulty maintaining features of the 26C or 30A-CDW brake valves. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two brake equipment manufacturers commented that no additional testing requirements are needed. They stated that
the industry has taken dramatic steps to reduce leakage in cold weather by installing and using welded pipe fittings,
wide lip hose couplings, and ferrule clamps. These commenters felt that if brake equipment is properly maintained
and good terminal brake tests are performed, there is no need for additional regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NTSB commented that cold weather operations impose additional problems regarding brake system leakage due to
shrinkage of the brake components in extreme cold. This commenter stated that it would like to see some type of additional
testing to assure that excessive leakage is not occurring. The Board acknowledged that, since the original recommendation,
the railroads have added equipment that performs better in cold weather conditions.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FRA Conclusions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 FRA recognizes that few, if any, of the commenters supported the mandating of additional testing in cold weather or
in mountain grade territory. FRA agrees that the development and use of welded pipe fittings, wide lip hose couplings,
and ferrule clamps has greatly reduced the effects of cold weather on the air brake system. However, FRA believes that
there are several extreme operating conditions that involve added safety risks and that need to be further addressed
by the railroads. These include cold weather and mountain territory operations as well as the operation of long and
heavy trains. FRA feels that each railroad needs to develop detailed operating procedures for these types of operations,
tailored to the equipment and territory of each railroad. Furthermore, FRA believes that the use of chemicals in the
trainline must be eliminated in order to prevent untimely damage and wear to the brake system components. Therefore,
FRA feels that most trains operating in cold weather should be equipped with air dryers. Several railroads commented
that they have already equipped their locomotives with these devices in order to curb the use of alcohol and other foreign
substances in the trainlines.

IV. Training of Test and Inspection Personnel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, the regulations require that the initial terminal test and inspection be performed by a qualified employee
but does not provide any guidance as to what type of knowledge these individuals should possess. See 49 CFR &sect;232.12(a)(1).
An increasing number of train brake tests and inspections are being conducted by train crews and FRA has concerns whether
or not all personnel performing these duties are truly qualified. Consequently, FRA sought comments and information
from interested parties regarding the type of training that is currently provided to individuals charged with inspecting
and testing train brake systems, and suggestions on the type of training these individuals should receive. See 57
FR 62553. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AAR and several railroads commented that employees performing air brake tests and inspections are adequately
trained to perform these tasks. However, many of the railroads admitted that they could do a better job of training
their employees. Several railroads presented information regarding their individual training programs. The training
provided by these commenters ranged from several days to several weeks, a portion of which is dedicated to air brake
tests and inspections. Most of the major railroads stated that their training includes annual testing of the employees
upon completion of the formal training classes and that employees must pass these tests with scores of 85&hyph;90
percent. Several railroads also mentioned that their training involves a certain amount of on-the-job training
in addition to the formal classroom training and that unannounced site checks are conducted by their supervisory
personnel. The ASLRA commented that most shortline railroads engage in cross-training of their employees so they
can perform all functions of the operations and that these railroads rely heavily on the Class I railroads' training
facilities and video tapes. Several railroads stated that some type of list of those employees that are considered
qualified to perform tests and inspections is maintained either in the form of a formal list or a list of employees who
have received the necessary training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AAR and all the other railroads providing comments believed that there is no need for FRA to impose training or certification
requirements. These commenters felt that training is the responsibility of the carriers and that carriers are in
best position to determine the type of training needed for their operation. The AAR contended that the decline in train
accidents, derailments, fatalities, and injuries over the last ten years is a testament to the adequacy of current
training provided by the railroads. The AAR and several railroads also insisted that there is no reason to require
those employees performing air brake tests and inspections to be as highly trained as a carman and that something more
reasonable is sufficient. These parties also felt that merely being a member of a particular craft should not automatically
make a person qualified, and the AAR added that any reference contained in the regulations designating a particular
craft to perform the inspections should be eliminated. Many of these commenters also stated that there is no need for
FRA to certify qualified persons and that such a scheme would merely increase the costs to railroads without improving
the performance of those individuals conducting the tests and inspections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several labor organizations commented that the current training provided by the railroads to the individuals performing
the air brake tests and inspections is insufficient. The BLE and various members of the United Transportation Union
(UTU) stated that the training they have received is inadequate to prepare them for making the air brake tests and inspections
they are currently required to perform. Representatives of the BRC and several of its individual members stated that
train crews lacked the experience and training necessary to perform inspections and tests of the air brakes. These
individuals also contended that only carmen are qualified by training and experience to perform these tasks based
on the fact that they have completed two- to three-year apprenticeships and have completed numerous written exams.
These commenters stated that elimination of various tests and inspections, such as the elimination of cleaning,
oiling, testing, and stencilling (COT&amp;S) requirements and run-through inspections, and the increase of permissible
piston travel have placed primary importance on the initial terminal inspection, which is not being performed properly
because train crews are not qualified to perform the tasks. Several members of the BRC recommended that carriers be
required to have carmen perform all initial and intermediate inspections and any other tests or inspections required
by the FRA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Every commenting labor organization and several of their individual members recommended that FRA designate qualified
inspectors by specifying the experience and training that are required for these individuals rather than leaving
these matters in the railroad's discretion. Most of these commenters also suggested that FRA certify those employees
that are deemed to be qualified to perform these tests and inspections. Two labor organizations also suggested that
FRA require railroads to maintain a list of those individuals deemed qualified in order to assure compliance with
the regulations.

FRA Conclusions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA believes that the current training provided to the individuals charged with performing the required brake tests
and inspections should be improved in order to ensure that these tests and inspections are performed properly. Several
labor organizations and their individual members explicitly commented that they are not sufficiently trained to
perform the inspections and tests required of them. In addition, several railroads affirmed that the training they
currently provide could be improved. Increasing reliance on train crews to conduct train air brake tests, as a result
of the consolidation of mechanical forces, means that it is more important than ever before that each person responsible
for power brake safety be thoroughly trained in the functions which that person is called upon to perform. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA recognizes that many railroads are attempting to improve their training programs; however, FRA thinks that minimum
training and experience guidelines need to be established to assure that brake inspections and tests are being properly
performed in order to protect both the public and railroad employees from the operation of equipment not meeting FRA
requirements. Although there has been a decline in the number of train accidents, derailments, fatalities, and injuries
over the last ten years, FRA believes that the number of these incidents will be further reduced if inspections and
tests of the brake system are performed by individuals who have been instructed in accordance with these minimum training
and experience guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, FRA proposes broad performance-based qualification requirements for individuals that perform
brake system inspections and tests; individuals that inspect, test, and maintain the electronic and mechanical
parts of the brake system; and individuals that supervise the work of the aforementioned personnel. FRA will supplement
these performance-based qualification standards by issuing minimum training and experience guidelines that will
aid the railroads in developing training programs sufficient to ensure that individuals are capable of meeting the
performance-based qualification standards. FRA believes that each railroad should be allowed to develop and implement
a program to train, qualify, and issue credentials to these individuals in accordance with these minimum requirements
based on each railroad's own unique operating conditions and equipment. Furthermore, in order to insure that quality
inspections, tests, and maintenance are continually being performed, FRA believes that periodic spot checks of
inspections and maintenance should be performed by qualified supervisory personnel.

V. Electronic Brake Systems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Railroad power brake systems are moving into the computer age, and recently, several innovative electronic brake
systems have been adopted into train service. These electronic brake systems include blended brakes, locomotive
speed limiters, and microprocessor-controlled brakes. Although these braking systems meet present Federal regulations,
the regulations may be silent in certain areas that need to be addressed in order to ensure that braking systems which
incorporate versions of this new technology maintain the same level of safety as conventional power brakes. In order
to determine the type of regulation that might be needed to assure the ``fail-safe'' nature of these types of braking
systems FRA requested comments from experienced parties regarding the operation of electronic braking systems,
the sensors utilized by the systems, and the maintenance requirements of such systems. See 57 FR 62554. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of passenger and commuter railroads, one State transit authority, and several freight carriers commented
that technology for electronic braking systems is advancing quickly and that performance standards need to be developed
to address these types of systems. Several commenters stated that a power failure in these electronic braking types
of systems will result in a full service brake application being applied through the entire train, with the emergency
brake valve available to initiate an emergency application at any time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AAR and several railroads discussed the sensors that are, or may be, used with these types of systems. Amtrak felt
that the reliability of the sensors is a key issue for these systems because nothing is gained if they fail as often as
the equipment being monitored. These parties stated that sensors currently manufactured are fairly reliable, with
advertised reliability rates of 14.6 years or failure rates of once every 35&hyph;38 million miles of operation.
One commenter stated that sensors have not yet been developed that would indicate when disc brake pads are worn to condemning
limits. Commenters also contended that sensors that could be used to assist in brake tests to determine proper piston
travel or whether brakes are applied would be very expensive at this time and difficult to install and maintain. One
commenter suggested that the only way to monitor whether brakes are applied would be to install a sensor on every brake
head, which would be very impractical. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters stated that the computer software used with these systems is designed to continually self-test
not only the software controlling the brake system but also the hardware every time it is used. Therefore, the parties
contend that there is no need to require daily testing since the system will identify any defects or reduction in performance
each time it is used. These commenters also suggested that the need for time based COT&amp;S with these systems is unnecessary
since the computer will indicate when attention is needed. Two railroads stated that complete air brake tests should
be performed when a system component is replaced, whereas other railroads recommended following the manufacturer's
recommended practice or at a minimum running a normal system check to verify the repair. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two manufacturers of brake equipment suggested that whatever regulations are developed they need to allow for technological
development. They stated that systems are being developed that will be able to monitor all sorts of things and will
eliminate the need for time-based maintenance and cleaning of brake equipment. These parties believed that in the
next five years systems will be available that can be self-diagnostic and able to report on their operational capabilities.
Expected future capabilities are: advanced train control system (ATCS) compatibility, distributed power, simplicity
of design, maintainability, accuracy of pressure control, and adaptability to complete electronic or radio control
throughout freight train operation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to allow for and encourage the development of new technology, FRA proposes to provide guidelines regarding
the tests and procedures required for introducing new brake system technology. These guidelines would require the
submission of design and test plans as well as subsequent operational plans for the introduction of new technology.
Parties would also be allowed to petition the FRA to convert some of the brake system design and maintenance requirements
into performance-based standards to accommodate the use of electronic braking systems.

As the result of the Southern Pacific Transportation Company accident at San Bernardino, California on May 25, 1989,
the NTSB made the following two recommendations to FRA concerning dynamic brakes: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Study, in conjunction with the AAR, the feasibility of developing a positive method to indicate to the operating
engineer in the cab of the controlling locomotive unit the condition of the dynamic brakes on all units in the train.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Revise regulations to require that if a locomotive unit is equipped with dynamic brakes that the dynamic brakes
function.

Dynamic brakes were developed as a ``free'' by-product of the diesel-electric drive train. By engaging the dynamic
brake, the normally powered traction motors on each axle are changed to generators, and the power generated is dissipated
through resistance grids. The effect is similar to that of shifting an automobile to a lower gear when descending a
steep grade. The additional hardware needed to outfit a locomotive with dynamic brakes includes the grids and the
controls and switches. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The primary selling point of dynamic brakes has been to save on freight car brake shoe wear. The dynamic brake is also
useful in controlling train slack in lieu of using the locomotive independent brake. Furthermore, use of the dynamic
brake in controlling train speed in lieu of power braking, where the train brake is applied with the locomotive under
power, is a major factor in fuel savings. Due to these benefits, railroads currently emphasize and encourage the use
of dynamic brakes. In order to determine the types of requirements or standards that should be developed regarding
the design and use of dynamic brakes, FRA requested comments from interested parties regarding the reliability,
testing, and cost of dynamic brakes as well as the types of information that are or could be provided to the engineer
regarding the availability and operation of the devices. See 57 FR 62555.

The AAR and a number of railroads commented that dynamic brakes are not safety devices but are economical devices and
their operation should be governed by the railroads' operating rules and not federal regulations. Every railroad
commenting on dynamic brakes stated that they are not the primary brake and are not used to stop a train. The parties
considered the devices optional features used to save fuel and reduce wear and tear on brake equipment. Therefore,
the commenters felt that any decision to equip a locomotive with dynamic brakes and any specific handling instructions
as to their use should be left to each individual railroad since their installation and use must be based on an individual
economic analysis. Several commuter and passenger railroads commented that they operate with blended brakes on
MU cars and, thus, feel that any regulations regarding dynamic brakes need to separate these types of operations from
conventional freight service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters also stated that dynamic brakes do not have a fail-safe feature and can fail at any time. The most
common failures reported by these parties occur in brake resistors, traction motors, grid systems, blowers, and
control modules and contactors. However, the railroads reported that dynamic brakes are relatively dependable
and trouble free. Two railroads stated that they had failure rates of less than three percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters stated that the reliability of dynamic brakes is influenced by the degree of maintenance they
receive. Several railroads reported that they perform routine preventive maintenance every 92 days. One railroad
stated that their routine maintenance includes visual inspection of equipment, inspection of grid blower brushes,
verification of trainline continuity, check of MU jumper cable wiring, check of main generator voltage regulation,
and verification of previous dynamic brake operation via recording system playback. This railroad and one other
carrier also stated that at major servicing facilities set up of the dynamic brakes is verified. In addition, these
railroads commented that dynamic brakes are part of the daily inspection and that if enroute failure of dynamic brakes
occurs the train crew is to complete a form, contained in the locomotive, detailing the problem. With regard to pre-departure
testing of the dynamic brakes, the AAR and several railroads stated that, due to the operating efficiency of dynamic
brakes, a standing test of the devices would merely let the engineer know if the dynamic brakes set up, but would not
inform him as to whether they will work, and that in order to completely test the devices the train must be moving. However,
these commenters also discouraged the use of running tests since such a test would require at least a 10-mph speed,
whereas most facilities have 5 mph speed limits and because creation of slack in a train is inadvisable at some locations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AAR and a number of railroads commented that there is no equipment available today to monitor the dynamic brakes
on trailing locomotives. These parties also stated that the monitoring of trailing units is really rather useless
due to the fact that dynamic brakes can fail at any time. One railroad commented that a prototype device capable of monitoring
the dynamic brakes on trailing locomotives has been developed but no production model is available and the cost of
the device would be $10,000&hyph;$15,000 per locomotive. The AAR also provided an approximate figure of $100,000
as the cost to retrofit an individual locomotive with dynamic brakes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The RLEA recommended that dynamic brakes be employed on all trains, be in working order, and be tested before all departures
and that training be provided on their usage. The RLEA would also like mandatory installation of a device that would
monitor the dynamic effort on trailing locomotives. The BLE and BRC did not think that dynamic brakes could be monitored
and felt that even if they could, it would probably not be that effective since dynamic brakes tend to fail while in use.
The BLE did recommend that railroads be required to maintain the equipment. In addition, the BRC and BLE recommended
that if dynamic brakes are present a running test should be required, even if performed at less than 10 mph since such
a test would at least indicate whether the dynamic brakes are functioning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) commented that the railroads are improperly describing dynamic
brakes as a luxury. The NTSB stated that railroads preach and encourage the use of the dynamic brake and, thus, should
ensure at least from the initial terminal that the system will work.

FRA Conclusion.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The RSERA requires FRA to issue standards for locomotive dynamic brakes, ``where applicable.'' It is clear from this
qualification and the history of the legislation that it imposes no requirement that locomotives be equipped with
dynamic brakes. Nor do we understand the RSERA to supersede the Act of March 2, 1893, which forbids a railroad to ``run
any train *&blank;*&blank;* that has not a sufficient number of cars in it *&blank;*&blank;* equipped with power
or train brakes that the engineer on the locomotive drawing such train can control its speed without requiring brakemen
to use the common hand brake for that purpose.'' This provision clearly requires that the train brake system (which,
after 100 years is still pneumatically operated in the case of conventional freight equipment) bear the burden of
providing a sound and serviceable first-order safety system capable of controlling train speed and arresting the
movement when required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is pertinent to ask why, against this background, FRA is now required to address the issue of locomotive dynamic
brakes. The mandate for dynamic brake safety standards emanated from the investigation, by the National Transportation
Safety Board, of an accident in which normal precautions for use of the primary train air brake system were cast to the
wind. In brief, excessive tonnage and excessive speed cresting the grade led to a train out of control. This, together
with the disastrous consequences, resulted in examination by the Board of whether the availability of fully operational
dynamic braking, as a secondary safety system, might have saved the day. Report No. RAR&hyph;90&hyph;02 (National
Transportation Safety Board, 1990). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is conceded by most serious observers that locomotive dynamic brakes do 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 offer the technical capability to serve as a primary train braking system, since_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) they provide braking force only on powered locomotive axles and are incapable of controlling in-train forces
in the same manner as the automatic braking system; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) they are effective only within a narrow speed range and have no capability to actually stop a train; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) they can fail without prior warning; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) their failure mode is characterized by loss of braking force (as opposed to the automatic brake, which, properly
employed, initiates an emergency brake application upon loss of system integrity). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA thus views as unfortunate, and potentially reckless, the increasing number of train handling and power brake
instructions issued by freight railroads that emphasize use of dynamic brakes without including prominent warnings
that such systems may not be relied upon to provide the margin of safety necessary to stop short of obstructions and
control points or to avoid overspeed operation. Such instructions, while not yet affirmatively misleading to seasoned
locomotive engineers, threaten to overcome the good judgment of safety critics and regulators by leading to excessive
reliance upon these systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While FRA is not persuaded that dynamic brakes warrant emphasis as the primary safety system, the agency recognizes
that the statute communicates a valid safety concern, properly construed. That is, to the extent significant emphasis
is placed on dynamic brakes_either by the railroads as a legitimate means of limiting fuel consumption, undesired
emergency brake applications, and wear to freight car components, or by safety critics who do not foresee that hazard
of reliance on such systems_engineers may in fact be encouraged to make errors in judgment that take them beyond prudent
safety margins. At such a critical point, proper functioning of any secondary safety system_however subject to failure_is
greatly to be wished. Further, dynamic brakes offer a redundant safety feature should the engineer make a mistake
in judgment leading to excessive speed under the prevailing conditions of grade, tonnage, and weather. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA believes that dynamic brakes have become, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a second-order safety system where employed. While from the point of view of logical priorities, dynamic brakes ``back
up'' the automatic train brake system, in sequence of operational procedures the priority is reversed. Stated differently,
either the proper functioning of these systems, or the provision of reliable information concerning degraded functioning
of these systems, should prevent locomotive engineers from operating trains in a manner that might make recovery
through use of the automatic brake impossible. As between these two alternatives, proper functioning is marginally
preferred, since communication, perception, and comprehension of information is not a uniformly successful enterprise.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To summarize, although FRA will not require that locomotives be equipped with dynamic brakes, FRA does believe that
Congress, in &sect;20141 (formerly &sect;7 of the RSERA), intended for FRA to develop meaningful and enforceable
standards regarding the safe use and operation of dynamic brakes. Furthermore, FRA believes that if the devices are
available, they should be maintained, and engineers should be informed on their safe and proper use and be provided
with information regarding the amount of dynamic braking effort that they have available. Further, FRA believes
that railroads operating braking systems that include dynamic brakes should have written operating rules, tailored
to the specific equipment and territory of each railroad, governing the safe handling procedures for the use of dynamic
brakes under all operating conditions, including procedures covering the loss of dynamic brakes. FRA also proposes
to require railroads to inform engineers of the total dynamic brake retarding force available on all outbound trains
equipped with dynamic brakes. As several commenters stated, in order to completely test dynamic brakes the train
must be moving. Thus, FRA believes that running tests of the dynamic brake should be performed whenever the motive
power or engine crew is changed so that the availability, or lack of availability, of the device can be rechecked. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, the operating rules of most railroads contain limits on the amount of dynamic braking force that may safely
be used depending on the dimensions of the train involved. Most railroad operating rules express these limits in terms
of the number of axles that engine consists are permitted to use in dynamic braking. Railroads generally will cut out
the dynamic brakes on trailing locomotives, when the train is made up, in order to avoid the possibility of excessive
dynamic braking force being applied, which could result in the buckling of the train. However, some operating rules
also express dynamic braking limits for operating through turnouts, crossovers, and curves in terms of dynamic brake
amperes, yet, there is currently no way for engineers to know the amount of dynamic brake amperage on their train or
the amperage they are using. Furthermore, although running tests of dynamic brakes, as proposed by FRA, provide information
to the locomotive engineer regarding the availability of dynamic brakes, such tests are limited to the specific moment
they are performed. Thus, running tests do not provide continuous information on the current status of the dynamic
brakes to the locomotive engineer. Because dynamic brakes could fail at any time, FRA feels there should be some way
for engineers to continuously monitor the operation of their available dynamic brakes. Consequently, based on Congress'
mandate contained in &sect;20141 (formerly &sect;7 of the RSERA), requiring meaningful standards to address the
safe use of dynamic brakes, FRA believes that locomotives built after January 1, 1996, and equipped with dynamic brakes,
should be able to (i) test the electrical integrity of the dynamic brake at rest and (ii) display the total train dynamic
brake retarding force, at certain speed increments, in the cab of the controlling locomotive.

In the ANPRM (57 FR 62555), FRA requested comments from the industry on possible methods of providing information
regarding the status of dynamic brakes to the engineer in the cab of the controlling locomotive. The only workable
option presented to FRA in the comments received was the equipping of locomotives with a dynamic brake display. Although
FRA recognizes that the technology for dynamic brake displays with the ability to provide the type of information
sought by FRA is not readily available today, several commenters suggested that it is currently being developed.
FRA believes that the benefits of such an indicator would be to alert engineers that they have diminished or excessive
dynamic capabilities, thus permitting the engineer to control the braking of their train in the safest possible manner.
However, in order to fully evaluate the viability of this proposal, FRA seeks comments from all interested parties
regarding the following specific issues: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) What is the status on the future availability of dynamic brake indicators capable of providing the information
required by this proposal? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Are FRA's cost estimates regarding this proposal accurate? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) What quantitative and/or qualitative operational or safety benefits can be derived from the use of these devices?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) What alternative methods are available for providing the same information that a dynamic brake indicator would
provide to a locomotive engineer?

VII. Miscellaneous Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Brake Pipe Reduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Present regulations require brake-pipe reductions of either 15 pounds, 20 pounds, or full service depending on which
of the required train air brake test is being performed. 49 CFR 232.12, 232.13. In the ANPRM (57 FR 62556), FRA sought
comments from interested parties to determine if it is feasible and beneficial for FRA to establish one standard brake-pipe
reduction for all required train air brake tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AAR and several railroads recommended that some type of performance standard be established so that each railroad
could determine the amount of reduction that best suits its operation. The AAR also suggested that if the reduction
amounts were left in the discretion of the individual railroads, it would be receptive to a requirement that the railroad
indicate what reduction rates it would use at different locations. Several railroads commented that one standard
reduction should be required for all tests and inspections and that the standard should not require an increase to
a full service reduction because such a practice could cause undesired releases. These commenters also noted that
one standardized reduction for all tests would simplify air brake tests and make it easier for the railroads to train
and instruct their employees. Most of the commenting railroads suggested a 20-psi reduction if a specific amount
were established. Two commuter railroads stated that they are unable to comply with 49 CFR 232.12 as currently written
because they are unable to make a service rate reduction on some of their equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two labor organizations recommended that one standard reduction be established by FRA rather than allowing each
individual railroad to determine their own reductions. This recommendation was based on the commenters' concern
that varying reduction standards among the railroads would cause confusion for train crews since many railroads
swap trains and operate crews over each other's lines. These commenters also felt that one standardized reduction
would make training easier. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FRA Conclusions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 FRA agrees with many of the commenters that a standardized brake pipe reduction of 20 psi is sufficient for the performance
of all required brake inspections and tests. FRA believes that the adoption of one standard reduction will simplify
both the performance of the required inspections and the training of employees charged with performing these inspections.
Under the proposal FRA would no longer require full service reductions for any of required inspections in order to
avoid the possibility of undesired releases. FRA feels that the suggestion of several commenters to allow each railroad
to determine its own brake pipe reduction is not viable. It is not uncommon to find train crews operating in several
different locations or to find the train crew of one railroad operating the equipment belonging to another railroad
or operating over the lines of another railroad. Thus, if various reductions were established by different railroads
or by one railroad in different locations, it would merely cause further confusion in both the performance of the inspections
and the training of personnel.

B. Performance of Brake Inspections
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To determine whether regulations should be developed specifying how certain brake inspections should be performed
and whether certain currently required inspections are necessary, FRA requested comments from interested parties
regarding the current methods of performing the various required brake inspections and sought comments on how current
inspections could be improved or eliminated. See 57 FR 62556. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AAR and a number of railroads recommended that the specific method of performing the various required inspections
should be left to the discretion of each railroad since the type of inspection required depends on the equipment involved
and the operating conditions existing at various locations. Many of these commenters stated that experience has
shown that vehicle inspections do not detract from inspections and that such inspections are adequate depending
on the location performed. These parties also stated that their employees are instructed to get off their vehicle
if they are unable to see the brake equipment from the vehicle. Several commenters also endorsed the use of roll-by
inspections at least to determine release of the brakes. Most of the commenters also recommended that inspection
of five-pack equipment (articulated cars) needs to be looked at since this equipment utilizes several different
types of braking systems, many of which cannot be viewed from one side of the car. Several railroads stated that they
were in the process of developing specific training for the inspection of five-pack equipment. One commenter suggested
that if the brakes fail to apply on one of the sets of brake equipment contained on multi-platform cars with multiple
brake systems, the car should be considered operable and permitted to continue to the first terminal where repairs
could be made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amtrak commented that the use of package, or unit, brake actuators on most modern passenger trains requires an inspection
of both sides of the train. This commenter also stated that the enshrouding of brake actuators, the existence of high-level
platforms, and the presence of wayside electric power systems make inspection of brake systems on passenger trains
dangerous. Amtrak recommended an alternative to the initial terminal inspection that would allow passenger trains
making multiple turns in a 24-hour interval to perform a set and release after a leakage test is performed at all subsequent
departures after a complete initial terminal brake inspection if the train remains charged and the consist is not
broken. The AAR and one railroad stated that the use of carside indicators is a reliable method for determining the
condition of brakes when brake equipment is enshrouded or mounted in-board or when a train is next to a high-level platform
or other obstruction. Two other passenger railroads suggested that FRA develop a list of parameters that each initial
terminal test must address and then allow each passenger railroad to submit its test procedures, based on its individual
operations, to FRA for approval. A number of passenger and commuter railroads also commented that many of the current
inspection requirements contained in the regulations are not applicable to multiple unit (MU) cars, specifically
noting the leakage test requirement, the piston travel regulations, and the requirement to keep equipment charged
when adding cars. These parties recommended that provisions regarding MU cars be separated from provisions on freight
locomotives and cars. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AAR and a number of railroads provided comments on specific inspections currently required and on specific elements
of various inspections. Several of these commenters suggested that the inbound brake equipment inspection contained
at &sect;232.14 be eliminated. These commenters stated that this inspection requires the ``bottling of air'' (the
angle cock to be closed following a 20-psi reduction), which is contrary to most railroads' operating rule requiring
the brake pipe to be left open on standing cars. The parties felt that the current requirement could result in the train
being put in emergency, which wastes time because then the train must be recharged, and is potentially dangerous because
it could cause a train to roll away due to a brake release.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several parties also mentioned that current piston travel requirements are no longer necessary due to the use of automatic
slack adjusters, which are designed to keep piston travel within certain tolerances. Some commenters felt that if
slack adjusters were required, noting that most cars operating today are already equipped with them, the need to constantly
measure piston travel would be eliminated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters also suggested that railroads have the option of performing a thorough inbound inspection together
with a set-and-release departure inspection in lieu of performing an initial terminal inspection, since initial
terminal inspections can be an obstacle to moving goods quickly because the removal of bad ordered cars once the train
is assembled can cost considerable time. These parties also recommended that cars found with sticking brakes during
the departure inspection be cut out and tagged and allowed to continue to destination as long as the tonnage per operable
brakes did not exceed a specified amount. One railroad also requested revision &sect;232.12(i) to allow the yard
test device to be placed at any location in the train, rather than at the end of the train nearest the hauling road locomotive,
since the results of such a test are not affected by location of the device. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AAR and several railroads also suggested that the 85 percent requirement contained at &sect;232.1 should be changed
to a performance standard based on tonnage per operative brakes. These parties stated that it is almost impossible
to remake a train while enroute to disassociate those cars with inoperative brakes from the rest of the train. However,
none of these commenters had any major problem with the 85 percent requirement, and all of them stated that retaining
the standard is acceptable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One air brake manufacturer agreed with the railroads that the problem of excessive piston travel has been addressed
by the development of slack adjusters. This commenter stated that slack adjusters automatically adjust piston travel
to prevent excessive travel and that if slack adjusters are reliable there is no need to measure for piston travel.
The commenter suggested that new technology is being developed to monitor the brake cylinder and that any new regulation
needs to allow for technology that may do away with measuring piston travel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Labor organization representatives and several individual members believed that FRA should specify how inspections
are to be performed. Several members of the BRC commented that the only proper inspection is a walking inspection on
both sides of the train with a set and release. However, these commenters suggested that if a walking inspection is
performed on both sides of a train during a set, then a roll-by inspection for the release would be acceptable. Several
commenters stated that on some cars an adequate inspection could be made from one side of the train but that on other
cars such as multilevel stack cars only 50 percent of the brake equipment can be observed from any one side of the cars.
Members of both the BRC and the UTU strenuously recommended that inspection of five-pack cars not be performed from
moving vehicles because it is very difficult to observe the brake equipment on these cars. A BRC representative also
stated that if slack adjusters have eliminated the need to measure piston travel then the railroads should have no
problem complying with a seven-to nine-inch piston travel limit. This commenter also stated that unless there are
regulations governing the proper setting and operation of slack adjusters, piston travel must continue to be monitored
and measured. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several labor organizations and their individual members stated that train crews are not qualified to perform initial
terminal inspections. Various individual carmen commented that many of the initial terminal inspections that are
currently being performed are inadequate because the employees performing the inspections are not adequately trained.
The BRC maintained that the initial terminal inspection could not be separated from the pre-departure inspection
required under Part 215 and both must be performed by carmen. The BRC also mentioned that because the initial terminal
inspections are not being performed by qualified individuals trains are departing without 100 percent operable
brakes, and thus, believes that the 85 percent rule contained at 232.1 should be increased to 90 or 100 percent. This
party also supported an increase in the 85 percent requirement based on the fact that heavier and longer trains are
being run today, and therefore, better braking is needed. The BLE commented that they do not see a problem on today's
railroads regarding inoperative brakes and felt that unless there was some technical evidence that the requirement
should be reduced, the 85 percent requirement should remain.

FRA Conclusions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA agrees with several of the railroad commenters that it would be practically impossible and far too intrusive for
FRA to mandate the specific methods for performing various inspections on various equipment. FRA feels that each
individual railroad is in the best position to determine the best method for performing the various required inspections
based on their operating conditions and equipment. However, the method of inspection that is chosen by a railroad
should ensure that all required equipment is properly inspected and is functioning as required by the regulations.
FRA will continue to allow the use of roll-by inspections of the brake release if train speed does not exceed 10 mph.
FRA feels that roll-by inspections made at greater speeds would not permit sufficient visual inspection of the brake
equipment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA recognizes the unique characteristics of some commuter and passenger trains that repeat the same trip several
times a day without breaking up the consist. Because the trains in these types of operations are not broken up and remain
connected to an air supply continuously, it is unlikely that their air brake equipment would deteriorate beyond federal
requirements in one day if they were in proper working order at the beginning of the day. Thus, FRA believes that trains
that repeat the same trip more than once a day need only be required to have an initial terminal brake test, performed
by a qualified individual, prior to the first departure for that train each calendar day. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA also agrees with several commenters that the MU equipment, currently used by many commuter operations, is unable
to conform to many of the standards established for freight operations. Consequently, FRA believes that commuter
railroads operating MU equipment should develop and enforce written inspection, maintenance, and test procedures
for this equipment to ensure the systems will operate as intended. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA further recognizes that the inbound inspection required pursuant to &sect;232.14, which requires the bottling
of air, is contrary to most railroads' operating procedures requiring the brake pipe to be left open on standing cars.
FRA feels that this requirement is unnecessary in present-day operations and could actually cause a train to roll
away due to a brake release. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although several parties commented that piston travel requirements are no longer necessary due to the development
and use of automatic slack adjusters, FRA believes that piston travel still is an important component that must be
kept within certain operating limits. If automatic slack adjusters function properly, then the railroads should
have no problem maintaining piston travel within the required limits. Currently, the only way to ensure that a slack
adjuster is working correctly is to measure the component it is adjusting. If a device is developed that can reliably
monitor the brake cylinder, as one manufacturer indicated, then parties can petition the FRA for a change in the standards
at that time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA will continue to require 100-percent functional train brake systems at initial terminals. As there were no major
objections raised, FRA proposes to retain the ``85-percent'' requirement previously contained at &sect;232.1.
The BRC was the only party which requested that the percentage be increased, based on their contention that initial
terminal inspections were not being performed by qualified individuals. However, FRA believes that the qualification
standards proposed below, adequately address this party's concern. Furthermore, as previously stated, FRA does
not feel railroads are currently performing initial terminal inspections as well as they should be and, thus, we do
not believe it would be appropriate, at this time, to allow alternatives to the initial terminal inspections as requested
by several commentators.

C. COT&amp;S Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Prior to January 1, 1992, railroads and car owners were required to maintain freight brake equipment in accordance
with a periodic clean, oil, test, and stencil (COT&amp;S) schedule. This schedule varied from 10 to 16 years, depending
on type of brake control valve. At the conclusion of the equipment changeout, a single car test was performed to verify
the integrity of the entire brake system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to 1982, this same single car test was required on each car when on a shop or repair track and the date of test so stencilled
on the car. This was known as an ``In Date Test'' or IDT. Cars which had been last tested in less than 90 days were excluded
from the test requirement. In 1982 the IDT was abolished, and only a simple application and release test of the brakes
was required when on the shop or repair track. Certain brake (sticking, inoperative, etc.) and wheel defects (overheated,
built-up tread, etc.) did require the single car test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1990, several improvements were made in test procedures to reduce the incidence of undesired emergency brake applications
and leakage which could cause wheel damage. These improvements were incorporated into the full single car test and
in a new abbreviated test, identified as a ``Repair Track Air Brake Test.'' At that time the repair track test was required
each time a car was on a shop or repair track. The full single car test is required when the brake control valves are replaced.
As these comprehensive tests were phased in, the COT&amp;S requirements were abolished. The effectiveness of these
new tests was evident by the increased replacement of brake components which were determined to be defective. Leakage
at angle cocks and cutout cocks was the primary source of problems. In order to determine whether there is a need for
time-based COT&amp;S requirements, FRA sought comments, in the ANPRM (57 FR 62556), from interested parties regarding
the problems associated with the elimination of the COT&amp;S requirements for freight equipment and whether COT&amp;S
requirements are necessary for passenger equipment or are alternatives available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AAR and several of its member railroads contended that the new single car test is much better than the old time-based
COT&amp;S and turns up many more defects due to the increase in air pressure to 90 pounds. The AAR stated that their studies
show that a car is on the repair track 1.7 times a year and, thus, on average every car will receive a single car or repair
track test at least one to two times a year. The AAR also stated that in 1992 1.1 to 1.4 million single car or repair track
tests were performed by the railroads and that three times as many brake valves were changed out in 1992 as compared
to 1991. In addition, the AAR reported that the railroads spent in excess of $7.5 million to upgrade their equipment
to perform the enhanced single car test. Several railroads provided figures on the number of cars in their fleets receiving
single car and repair track tests, and provided data comparing the number of brake components that were changed out
in 1992 with the number of components changed out in 1991 under the old COT&amp;S requirements. In all cases the data
showed an increase in the number of components changed out, which the railroads attributed to the improvement of the
single car test and were presented as support for their contention that the improved single car and repair track tests
are more effective than the old, time-based COT&amp;S requirements. Several railroads also commented that there
is no need for FRA to establish brake maintenance requirements separate from those established by the AAR. These commenters
stated that significant improvements in brake maintenance have been made by the AAR without increased regulation.
These parties also noted that the AAR has its own engineering staff and laboratories and has expertise of all the railroads
and, thus, is in the best position to determine the best practices for maintaining the brake systems.

Amtrak and two other passenger and commuter railroads provided comments regarding COT&amp;S requirements for passenger
cars. These commenters felt that the brake equipment on passenger cars can be maintained by criteria other than time-based
COT&amp;S. The parties proposed the possibility of requiring that a single car test be performed each time a car is
on the repair track or each time the car comes in for preventive maintenance, about every 120 days. These parties would
prefer to conduct periodic testing rather than changing out valves on a periodic basis. These commenters felt that
the current three-year COT&amp;S requirement on 26C-based systems is too restrictive. Amtrak also commented that
the six-year COT&amp;S requirement it employs for freight-type brake valves on its passenger cars should be considered
an internal Amtrak policy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The BRC and several of its individual members admitted that the new single car test may be very valuable, but contended
that the railroads are circumventing its use. These commenters stated that railroads are eliminating repair tracks
all over the nation in order to avoid performing these single car tests. Several individuals presented examples of
how the single car test and repair track test are being circumvented, such as making repairs in the field or moving cars
to expediter tracks for repairs rather than to repair tracks. Therefore, the BRC recommended that some type of in-date
testing or attention must be reinstated, preferably somewhere in the seven- to eight-year range. The RLEA also recommended
that periodic attention be reinstated, contending that acceptance of AAR's unilateral change in the maintenance
requirements allows the AAR to establish regulations without public comment. The BRC and several of its members also
commented on the three-year COT&amp;S requirement for passenger cars, contending that the requirement should be
maintained due to condensation building up in the trainlines and the fact that compressors are not being maintained.
The BRC also recommended that any change made by the AAR in their recommended maintenance practices should be approved
by FRA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One manufacturer strongly endorsed the new single car test and repair track test as the most comprehensive tests ever
performed. This commenter felt that these tests will ensure more effective brake maintenance than the previous application-and-release
test and the 16-year COT&amp;S requirement.

FRA Conclusions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 FRA agrees that the new single car test, which has been used industry-wide since January of 1992, is a much better and
more comprehensive method of detecting and eliminating defective brake equipment and components than the old, time-based
COT&amp;S requirements. FRA believes that performance of the single car test will significantly reduce the number
of defective components currently found and will dramatically increase the reliability of brake equipment. Thus,
use of the single car test will greatly improve the safety of both railroad employees and the general public since brake
equipment will be in better and safer condition. However, in order to fully benefit from the advantages of the single
car test, cars must receive the test. Several labor commenters admitted that the new test was very valuable, but stated
that the test is being circumvented by the railroads. These commenters provided various examples of how the tests
are being avoided. Therefore, in order to ensure that all cars receive the new single car test, FRA proposes to require
the performance of the test on a timely basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA feels that the single car test should be conducted on any car that is on a repair or shop track for various wheel or
brake equipment defects and that at a minimum freight service equipment should receive the test every one or two years
depending on whether the equipment is high-utilization or non-high-utilization equipment, as defined below, and
that commuter and passenger service equipment should receive the test at least every six months. Freight railroad
representatives reported that on average a car is currently on the repair track 1.7 times a year and, thus, receives
a full single car or repair track test at that time. Commuter and passenger railroad representatives reported that
their cars are on a shop or repair track every 120 days. Therefore, FRA does not feel that requiring the single car test
to be performed at the proposed time periods would be overly burdensome on the industry since, by its own admission,
most cars will be on a repair or shop track within these time limits. Furthermore, parties would be allowed to request
a change in the time interval for performing the single car test by monitoring their single car tests and conducting
a statistical analysis of the results. The procedure for requesting a change in the time interval is further discussed
in the section-by-section analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to ensure that the single car tests are properly performed, FRA believes that only qualified brake system
inspectors should conduct the tests and that the single car testing devices should be tested at least once a day and
receive maintenance at least every 92 days. Furthermore, in order to ensure proper maintenance of brake equipment,
FRA believes that each railroad should develop and enforce written maintenance procedures for all types of brake
systems it operates which meet or exceed current industry standards and all federal train brake system safety requirements.
The maintenance required by these procedures should only be performed by individuals qualified as mechanical or
electronic brake system inspectors. Spot checks of both the single car tests and the maintenance procedures should
be conducted by qualified supervisory personnel to make sure the procedures are being followed and the tests are properly
performed.

D. Charging of Air Brake System. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Present regulations for air brake testing basically require that cars that have previously been tested in accordance
with the regulations either ``be kept charged until road motive power is attached'' or be retested. 49 CFR 232.12(i).
Based on longstanding administrative interpretation and practice, FRA presumes that a brake system is no longer
adequately charged if disconnected from the charging device (supply of pressurized air) for more than two hours before
coupling of locomotives; otherwise, retesting is required. In the ANPRM (57 FR 62556), FRA requested comments from
interested parties regarding the viability of this interpretation and sought information for developing alternative
procedures that would not jeopardize safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AAR and several railroads stated that there is no reason to assume that once a train is charged and tested and then
left standing without being provided with a source of compressed air that the brake system would become defective.
These parties suggested that leakage on standing trains has been greatly reduced through the use of welded brake piping
and fittings and ferrule-clamped air hoses. These commenters felt that FRA's interpretation of allowing trains
to sit without air for only two hours is from an era when this new equipment was not used. They also stated that FRA's current
interpretation costs the industry money, fuel, and time and creates pollution because trains must be either reinspected
or left with a locomotive attached and idling in order to avoid performing a full initial terminal test. Several railroads
suggested that trains could be off air indefinitely if the consist is not altered, or at least as long as 24 hours, and
remain in the same condition. Several commenters recommended that if a set of cars is off air for an extended period,
all that should be required is a set-and-release test to assure the continuity of the brake pipe. CP Rail Services mentioned
that there is no such two-hour rule in Canada and stated that in Canada if cars are off air for any length of time a set-and-release
continuity test is required. Every commenting railroad felt the current two-hour interpretation is onerous and
unrealistic. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The BLE, BRC, and several individual carmen felt that the current interpretation is reasonable. Most of these commenters
expressed concern for the integrity of the brake system if a consist were left standing for longer than two hours. These
concerns were aimed at the effect that climate might have on the equipment and the increased possibility of vandalism
to the equipment if consists sat without air for longer periods. One conductor recommended returning to a four-hour
limit as a minimum.

FRA Conclusions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA agrees that our longstanding administrative interpretation, that requires the retesting of cars disconnected
from a charging device for longer than two hours, was established prior to the development of new equipment that has
greatly reduced leakage problems, such as welded brake piping and fittings and ferrule-clamped air hoses. However,
contrary to several railroads' assertions FRA does not believe that cars should be allowed to be off air for extended
periods of time without being retested. FRA believes that the longer cars sit without air attached the greater the
chances are that the integrity of the brake system will be compromised. The longer cars sit the more susceptible they
may be to weather conditions or even vandalism, as some commenters suggested. Consequently, based on today's equipment,
operating practices, and overriding safety concerns, FRA feels that cars should not be disconnected from a supply
of pressurized air for longer than four hours without being retested.

E. Specifications for Power Brake Systems for Freight Service
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, Appendix B of Part 232, entitled ``Specifications and Requirements for Power Brakes and Appliances for
Operating Power-Brake Systems for Freight Service'', contains the specifications for AB valves, as were adopted
in the early 1930's, and has not been modified since, although several deviations have been permitted. No improvements
or new features, as reflected in present-day control valves, have been added to the appendix. Consequently, FRA sought
comments from interested parties as to how the specifications and requirements contained in Appendix B could be updated
and changed. See 57 FR 62556. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AAR and several railroads recommended that Appendix B be eliminated and a reference made to the appropriate AAR
specifications. These parties felt that the AAR specifications are far more stringent than those contained in Appendix
B. One railroad suggested that if Appendix B were to be rewritten it should encompass operating parameters of brake
performance, such as transmission speed of service and emergency reductions and time periods in which control valves
should respond to these signals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New York Air Brake Company (NYAB) also recommended that Appendix B be deleted and reference made to the appropriate
AAR specifications, which require performance that is far above that contained in the appendix. Westinghouse Air
Brake Company felt that Appendix B as currently written is too restrictive and detailed to allow for technological
development. This commenter stated that newer valves are being developed which are above and beyond the specifications
contained in the appendix and suggested that more flexibility be incorporated into the specifications to allow for
the development of new equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The BRC recommended the possibility of adding some type of addendum to Appendix B regarding new technology without
eliminating the minimum requirements contained in the appendix.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Contrary to several commenters' views, FRA feels that many of the requirements contained in Appendix B for power brake
systems are still necessary. FRA does recognize that some of the requirements are outdated and should be eliminated.
Consequently, FRA proposes to eliminate Appendix B and incorporate those requirements that it feels are still relevant
to today's equipment directly into various sections of the revised regulation. Furthermore, in order to address
the concerns of several parties that the requirements contained in Appendix B are too restrictive to allow the development
of new technology, FRA proposes to permit parties to petition the FRA to convert some of the train brake system specification
and design requirements into performance-based safety requirements.

F. The 1,000-Mile Inspection
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA's current regulations require intermediate brake inspections at points not more than 1,000 miles apart. These
inspections are far more limited than the currently required initial terminal inspections in that the railroad is
required only to determine that brake pipe leakage is not excessive, the brakes apply on each car, and the brake rigging
is secure and does not bind or foul. 49 CFR 232.12(b). In the 1982 revisions to the power brake rules, FRA extended the
distance between such inspections from 500 miles to 1,000 miles. The industry now suggests that modern freight trains
can operate at least 5,000 miles without a brake test. Consequently, in order to determine whether a change in the current
1,000-mile inspection requirement should be adopted, FRA requested comments from interested parties regarding
evidence to support any increase in the current requirement, the costs and delays involved with performing these
inspections, and any safety concerns inherent in increasing the distance beyond what is currently permitted. See
57 FR 62556. Several railroads, together with the AAR, commented that the current 1,000-mile inspection interval
should be increased to as much as 5,000 miles. (See &sect;232.12(b).) These parties relied on several factors in recommending
such an increase, which include the new technology and improved equipment since 1982, the 1985 study conducted by
the AAR, which they contended establishes that trains receiving proper initial terminal tests could be operated
within regulation limits for over 5,000 miles, and the fact that since 1982 the number of brake-related accidents
and derailments and the failure rates of brake equipment have declined dramatically. The majority of these commenters
also stated that the key to increasing the limit is quality initial terminal inspections. One railroad commented
that in Canada en route inspections are required at 1,500-mile intervals and felt that these en route inspections
do not enhance safety. This railroad also stated, based on a small sampling, that only one-half of a percent of its cars
receiving intermediate inspections are found with defective brakes. The AAR also commented that the statistics
presented by labor organizations, regarding the number of defects they are finding at various locations, are meaningless
unless presented in terms of their effect on safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AAR and several railroads also provided information regarding the costs of performing these inspections. These
parties estimated that the current 1,000-mile inspection requires the industry to perform these inspections on
15 percent of the total number of road trains, which amounts to about 240,000 intermediate inspections annually.
They estimated the total cost of performing these inspections at approximately $90-$130 million. One railroad estimated
the cost at $550 per inspection. Another railroad estimated that if the distance required for these inspections were
increased to 2,000 miles the industry would save $47 million. Several railroads also commented that if FRA reinstated
a 500-mile inspection their costs and the industry's cost of performing intermediate inspections would at least
double. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Labor organizations and individual members opposed any increase in the 1,000-mile intermediate inspection interval
and argued that FRA should reinstate the 500-mile requirement. The RLEA stated that labor's agreement to extend the
intermediate test to 1,000 miles in 1982 was based upon a promise by the railroads that complete and perfect initial
terminal tests would be performed. The RLEA contends that the performance of initial terminal inspections has been
terrible and that they are being performed by unqualified operating crews. The BRC, the UTU, the BLE, and several individual
carmen reiterated RLEA's contention that proper initial terminal inspections are not being performed. These parties
also stated that the inspections being performed at 1,000 miles are also inadequate. They stated that many of these
inspections are being performed by train crews that are not qualified to conduct these inspections properly. The
BRC and several of its individual members contended that numerous defects are being found at the 1,000-mile inspections
and that the main reason for this is that quality initial terminal inspections are not being performed. These commenters
also provided statistics as to the number of defects being found at various 1,000-mile inspection points. They claim
that their members have found approximately 50,000 defects per year at these locations and that the statistics used
by the carriers to support an increase to 5,000 miles are faulty. These parties feel that independent data needs to
be developed before any increase in the distance is considered.

FRA Conclusions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1982, when FRA extended the 500-mile inspection interval to 1,000 miles, FRA intended that quality initial terminal
brake inspections would be performed by the railroads. FRA feels that railroads have not conducted the excellent
initial terminal inspections that were contemplated in 1982. Furthermore, contrary to the railroads' contention,
FRA feels that many initial terminal brake inspections are being performed by individuals who are not sufficiently
qualified or trained. FRA recognizes that since 1982 new technology and improved equipment have been developed that
allow trains to operate for longer distances with fewer defects. However, the key to achieving this improved capability
is to ensure the proper operation and condition of the equipment at initial terminals. The best way of ensuring the
proper operation and condition of equipment is to perform quality initial terminal brake inspections and to conduct
proper equipment maintenance. Consequently, in order to ensure that a train is in safe and proper condition to travel
a prescribed distance without further inspection, FRA believes that a sliding-scale approach should be adopted
that bases the allowable distance a train may travel on a variety of factors including the quality of the initial terminal
brake inspection, the maintenance practices of the railroad, and the type of equipment operated and installed on
the train.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA proposes to establish a power brake inspection scheme in which various stated factors determine the distance
that a freight or passenger train is allowed to travel without additional inspection. These factors include: the
qualifications of the employee performing the initial terminal brake inspection; the extent of performance of supervisory
spot checks of maintenance and inspection activity; the presence or absence of a single car test program on the railroad;
the power brake defect ratio on outbound trains for the railroad; and the type of equipment used and installed on the
train. Based on the conditions that are satisfied by the railroad, a train may be allowed to travel anywhere between
500 and 3,500 miles from the point of initial terminal without additional power brake tests or inspections. Furthermore,
in order to ensure that initial terminal brake tests are being performed, FRA proposes to require railroads to maintain
a record of all initial terminal tests that shall contain the name of the person who conducted the test, when appropriate.
The factors and mileage limits mentioned above will be discussed in more detail below.

VIII. High Speed Passenger Train Brakes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
High speed passenger trains (up to 200 mph) require braking systems which far exceed the capabilities of those presently
installed on North American trains. The energy required to be dissipated in a stop from 200 mph is well over one billion
foot-pounds. To achieve this braking capability, more advanced methods of train braking must be utilized; such as,
electro-pneumatic braking systems, microprocessor-controlled braking, or advanced train speed control systems.
In the ANPRM (57 FR 62557), FRA requested comments, information, and suggestions regarding the operation of these
types of advanced braking systems, the equipment required for their operation, and the kinds of regulatory requirements
that are needed to ensure the safe operation of trains equipped with these advanced braking systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AAR and several passenger railroads provided information regarding high speed passenger operations. These
commenters suggested that any specifications developed for these types of operations need to be performance standards
based on stopping distances for specified speeds. Amtrak stated that the hardware exists today that can probably
be used at speeds of 150 mph or below, such as a combination of disc, tread, and blended brakes. Amtrak also mentioned
that in order to operate at speeds in excess of 180 mph a regenerative-type braking system is probably required combined
with a friction-type system. This commenter also suggested that operations of over 150 mph need to be dedicated systems
where the train and track are designed as a unit. Amtrak said it would like to form a committee to work with FRA to develop
regulations and specifications for these types of systems. Another railroad recommended that any passenger service
operating over 90 mph should operate on separate dedicated rights of way, physically removed from any freight service
traffic. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AAR and two commuter railroads suggested that if economical and reliable sensors can be developed they will be
essential in monitoring these systems, but should not be applied in high shock areas that would make them vulnerable
to failure. These commenters also stated that diagnostic programs incorporated into computer software must be used
to monitor the braking systems. They also stated that these programs would eliminate the need for time-based maintenance
since they would continuously monitor the system's components and store information on any operating defects occurring
while a train is in use. These commenters also felt that back-up or stand-by computers were unnecessary because the
systems are designed to stop the train if a failure occurs and a mechanical override would be sufficient to allow movement
of the consist.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FRA Conclusions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA feels that passenger trains that operate at speeds in excess of 125 mph should be classified as high speed operations.
FRA recognizes the unique designs and features that the braking systems of these types of operations may incorporate.
FRA agrees with several of the commenters that the types of train brake systems used by these operations should be controlled
by some type of automated computer system. These computer systems should be able to run diagnostic programs capable
of self-testing the brake system and detecting faults in the system and should have the ability of either alerting
the engineer of these faults or taking automatic corrective action. In addition, the computer software of these systems
should be analyzed to determine the safety impacts of software failures and to ensure the software is fail-safe and
functions as intended. FRA also believes that if these types of trains are equipped with on-tread brakes they should
be designed to prevent application of the tread brakes at speeds greater than 80 mph. Furthermore, in order to allow
technological advances in this area of train braking, railroads may petition FRA to convert some of the train brake
system design and maintenance requirements into performance-based safety requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Due to the unique characteristics of brake systems for these types of trains, FRA believes that operators of high speed
passenger trains should develop train brake system inspection, maintenance, and test plans tailored to the specific
train brake systems they use. These plans would become part of the safety standards for the operation of the trains
and equipment to which the plans apply and would be enforceable by FRA. Due to the complex designs and operations of
these types of brake systems, FRA feels that all maintenance and that initial terminal train brake tests should be
conducted by qualified mechanical and electrical train brake inspectors. FRA also believes that the various designs
of these pieces of equipment may require inspectors to occupy dangerous positions in order to inspect them directly.
If that is the case, FRA feels that the brake systems should be equipped with sensors that give a reliable indication
of the application and release of the brakes, visible to an inspector on the platform or along the side of the track.

Section-by-Section Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA contemplates dividing this rule into subparts, each of which would contain multiple sections. This proposal
contains all of the anticipated subparts, including those that are being reserved for future proposals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Subpart A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This subpart of the proposal contains the general provisions of the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 232.1.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This section contains a formal statement of the proposed rules' purpose and scope. FRA intends the rules to cover all
brake system requirements, including those relevant to non-steam locomotives previously contained in Part 229
of this chapter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 232.3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a general matter, FRA proposes that these rules apply to all railroads that operate on the general railroad system
of transportation. In addition, FRA proposes that many of these rules apply to non-insular passenger railroads operating
outside the general railroad system of transportation. Consequently, FRA proposes that many of these proposed regulations
apply to non-insular tourist, excursion, and scenic railroads. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA's regulatory authority permits it to amend the current applicability sections of its various regulations so
as to expand or contract the populations of railroads covered by a particular set of regulations. FRA has had jurisdiction
over all railroads since the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 was enacted. There is a very wide range of operations
that could be considered tourist, excursion, or scenic railroads under the broadest reading of the term ``railroad.''
Tourist, excursion, and scenic railroads have written several letters to members of Congress questioning the basis
for FRA's assertion of jurisdiction. Additionally, FRA recently received a petition from the Berkshire Scenic Railway
Museum, Incorporated on behalf of tourist, excursion, and scenic railroads requesting the need for legislative
and regulatory action for new regulations tailored specifically to the tourist rail industry. Pursuant to FRA's
letter of September 28, 1993, in response to that petition, FRA has considered the suggestions made by those parties
to the extent they pertained to power brakes in drafting these proposed regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In an effort to clarify the proper extent of the exercise of FRA's jurisdiction, FRA recently settled on several principles
that will be used as current FRA guidelines. FRA will exercise jurisdiction over all tourist, excursion, and scenic
railroads, whether or not they operate over the general railroad system, except those that are (1) less than 24 inches
in gage and/or (2) insular. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To determine insularity, FRA looks at various criteria that measure the likelihood that a railroad's operations
might affect a member of the public. FRA has concluded that a tourist, excursion, or scenic railroad is insular if its
operations are limited to a separate enclave in such a way that there is no reasonable expectation that the safety of
any member of the public (except a business guest, a licensee of the tourist operation or an affiliated entity, or a
trespasser) would be affected by the operation. A railroad is 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 considered insular if one or more of the following exists on its line: (a) A public highway-rail crossing that is in
use; (b) an at-grade rail crossing that is in use; (c) a bridge over a public road or waters used for commercial navigation;
or (d) a common corridor with a railroad, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 its operations are within 30 feet of those of any railroad. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, the mere fact that the trackage of a railroad is not connected to the general system does not make the railroad
insular under these criteria. While these criteria tend to sort out the insular theme parks and museums, a need to do
case-by-case analysis in certain close situations still exists.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Therefore, FRA has concluded that the requirements contained in this part should apply to a non-general system, non-insular
passenger railroad that confines its operations to an installation that is not part of the general system (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, it is a stand-alone with no freight traffic but has one or more features that preclude its being considered insular).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;232.3(b), FRA proposes to except various train operations from the requirements of this part. These exceptions
are taken directly from &sect;6 of the Safety Appliance Acts (45 U.S.C. &sect;6, recodified at 49 U.S.C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;&sect;20301, 21302, and 21304). It is noted that the word ``freight'' has been added to the exceptions in order
to remain consistent with Congress' intent when the statutory exceptions were created. At the time Congress provided
an exception from the requirements of the Acts, Congress did not and could not envision that the equipment used in these
operations would be modified for the purposes of hauling passengers, which FRA has discovered with regard to four-wheel
coal cars. Consequently, FRA will only except freight operations which employ the types of equipment contained in
this paragraph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 232.5. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section contains an extensive set of definitions to introduce the regulations. FRA intends these definitions
to clarify the meaning of important terms as they are used in the text of the proposed rule. The proposed definitions
are carefully worded in an attempt to minimize the potential for misinterpretation of the rule. Several of the definitions
introduce new concepts or new terminologies which require further discussion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed definitions classify trains by their maximum operating speed. Trains with a maximum operating speed
of 79 mph or less are defined as ``conventional trains.'' Trains with a maximum operating speed of more than 79 mph but
less than or equal to 125 mph are defined as ``intermediate speed trains.'' Trains with a maximum operating speed greater
than 125 mph but less than or equal to 160 mph are defined as ``high speed trains.'' FRA proposes these definitions because
as the operating speed of a train increases a greater variety of safety-related conditions and equipment need to be
addressed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of ``excursion train'' is intended to encompass those trains operated by what are referred to in the
industry as ``tourist,'' ``excursion,'' and ``scenic'' railroads. When the term ``excursion train'' is used in
these proposed rules, it is intended to refer to those non-insular tourist, excursion, and scenic railroads as explained
in the discussion of &sect;232.3. For purposes of these proposed rules, FRA feels that the trains operated by these
types of railroads can be sufficiently dealt with as a group. FRA defines ``train brake system'' to encompass any and
all of the components involved to apply a retarding force to decelerate a train. This definition is a key to FRA's approach
to treat train brakes as a complex system of inter-related components that must function in harmony to safely slow
and stop a train. The definition clearly includes computer programs or other forms of software used to control or test
braking functions as part of the train brake system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of ``train brake information system'' introduces a new concept. FRA proposes to require railroads
to develop and implement a set of procedures to ensure that as train crews take responsibility for a train they have
accurate and timely information on board the train, which includes the recent brake test history of the train and the
current status of the brakes on all locomotives and cars comprising the train. FRA feels that this information is necessary
to allow trains to proceed for greater distances between required train brake system tests. FRA concludes that this
information is essential in order for railroads to know if their trains are in compliance with federal safety regulations.
Furthermore, placing the information in the hands of the train crew increases railroad safety because the train crews
are in the best position to make decisions based on the information to eliminate or reduce brake-related safety problems.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The definition of ``train brake system monitoring'' also introduces a new concept. FRA proposes to require railroads
to develop and implement procedures to be used by the engineer to monitor the en route performance and status of the
train brake system. FRA believes that these procedures will encourage railroads to take advantage of new sensor technology
that can both increase safety and reduce operating costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of ``power brake defect'' is critical to a railroad's ability to take advantage of the incentives allowing
trains to travel greater distances between required train brake system tests. For purposes of &sect;232.311 ``power
brake defect'' is intended to be any condition of equipment not in compliance with this Part that could cause the retarding
force applied by the power brake system of the train to be reduced that is found by FRA or state inspectors on a train declared
ready for departure by the operating railroad. Power brake defects include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Brake rigging that binds or fouls; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) A brake that does not apply or does not release; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Piston travel that is outside limits; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) A brake shoe or pad that is worn past limits; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) A brake shoe or pad that is damaged or missing; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) A brake shoe or pad that is over-ridden; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) An end-of-train device that is not installed or not functioning correctly; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) A car that is past due for a scheduled periodic freight brake test or single car test; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A failure to perform a Class 1 or Class 2 brake test when required. One defect for each car on which the test was not
performed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Understanding the way FRA defines ``power brake defect ratio'' for the purpose of these proposed rules is crucial
to railroads wishing to take advantage of the proposed incentives to allow trains to travel greater distances between
required train brake system tests. The testimony provided by the railroads reflected a strong plea to FRA to develop
train brake system performance requirements. However, this appeal was invariably general. No railroad proposed
specific performance requirements for train brake systems. The definition of ``power brake defect ratio'' forms
the basis for a strong performance-related incentive to the railroads. If railroads can limit their power brake defect
ratio to specified levels, they may be allowed to operate trains greater distances between required train brake system
tests. FRA proposes that a movement of the train need not take place for the power brake defect to be counted against
the power brake defect ratio used to qualify the railroad to operate trains longer distances between required brake
system tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of ``mountain grade territory'' attempts to address the opinions of several commenters that mountain
grade is a function of both grade percentage and grade distance. In addition, FRA believes that the definition of ``mountain
grade territory'' should become more stringent as the speed of the train increases. Thus, FRA developed an empirical
relationship to define mountain grade territory, which takes into account all three factors. An explanation of the
formula to be used in determining mountain grade territory and a graph illustrating its application are contained
in Appendix C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definitions of ``Class 1'' and ``Class 2 train brake system tests'' introduce new terminology. The FRA proposes
the Class 1 test to fulfill the intent of the existing initial terminal test and the Class 2 test to fulfill the intent
of the existing intermediate terminal test. See 49 CFR 232.12, 232.13. This proposed new terminology attempts to
eliminate controversy over what is an initial or intermediate terminal. The new terminology allows the tests to be
easily imposed at points other than terminal points. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Minimum qualifications for supervisors, mechanical and electronic forces, and train crew members responsible
for safe operation of train brake systems are another key feature of FRA's proposal. The definitions offered for qualified
personnel introduce this important requirement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 232.7. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section sets forth the procedures for seeking waivers of compliance with the requirements of this rule. Requests
for such waivers can be filed by any interested party. In reviewing such requests, FRA conducts investigations to
determine if a deviation from the general criteria can be made without compromising or diminishing rail safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 232.9. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
General compliance and recordkeeping requirements are stated in this section. In accordance with the ``use or haul''
language contained in the Safety Appliance Acts and with FRA's general rulemaking authority under the FRSA, FRA proposes
that a train, railroad car, or locomotive will be considered ``in use'' prior to departure but after it receives or
should have received the necessary tests and inspections required for movement. FRA would no longer necessarily
wait for a piece of equipment with a power brake defect to be hauled before issuing a violation, a practice frequently
criticized by the railroads. FRA believes that this approach will increase FRA's ability to prevent the movement
of defective equipment that creates a potential safety hazard to both the public and railroad employees. FRA does
not feel that this approach increases the railroads' burden since equipment should not be operated if it is found in
defective condition in the pre-departure tests and inspections, unless permitted by the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This section also clarifies FRA's position that the requirements contained in the proposed rules are applicable
to any ``person,'' as broadly defined in &sect;232.11, that performs any function required by the proposed rules.
Although various sections of the proposed rule address the duties of a railroad, FRA intends that any person who performs
any action on behalf of a railroad or any person who performs any action covered by the proposed rule is required to perform
that action in the same manner as required of a railroad or be subject to FRA enforcement action. For example, private
car owners and contract shippers that perform duties covered by these proposed regulations would be required to perform
those duties in the same manner as required by a railroad.

This section contains the penalty provisions of the proposed rule, stating that all persons who violate the standards
of the proposed rule or cause the violation of such standards are subject to a civil penalty, and explains the circumstances
under which an individual may be assessed a penalty. The definition of ``person'' incorporates the expanded language
contained in section 9 of the Rail Safety Enforcement and Review Act, which amended the definition of ``person'' contained
in the Safety Appliance Acts and the FRSA. The clarified definition of ``person'' includes, but is not limited to,
such entities as manufacturers and lessors of railroad equipment and independent contractors. Congress' purpose
in amending the definition of ``person'' was to clarify the Secretary's existing power over entities whose activities
relate to rail safety by explicitly defining that authority.

Section 232.15. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section contains general requirements that are applicable to all train brake systems. FRA proposes to specifically
include basic train brake system practices and procedures that form the foundation for the safe operation of all types
of trains. Some of these basic principles are so obvious that they have not been specifically included in past rules.
The most basic safety requirements for all train brake systems include the ability to stop a train within signal spacing,
establishing an integral train brake communication line, and having the train brake system respond as intended to
signals from the brake communication line. Several of the general requirements contained in this section are addressed
in later sections of this proposed rule and will be discussed in further detail in those sections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA proposes to continue the requirement that prior to departure from an initial terminal point all trains shall have
100 percent functional train brake systems. Although a few commenters suggested the departure of trains from initial
terminals with less than 100 percent functional brakes, based on a standard of tons per operative brake, none of the
commenters provided any further guidance for developing such a standard. Furthermore, FRA and most of the commenters
agree that having 100 percent functional brakes at initial terminal points is necessary for allowing trains to travel
long distances between brake system tests. Since FRA is proposing incentives to allow railroads to increase the distances
trains may travel between train brake system tests, this basic requirement takes on even greater importance in the
proposed new rule. Requiring 100 percent functional brakes prior to departure from an initial terminal point sets
the proper tone for the quality and thoroughness FRA expects from the industry on train brake system inspections,
maintenance, and tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA proposes a clear and absolute prohibition on train movement if more than 15 percent of the cars in a train have their
brakes cut out or have otherwise defective brakes. This has long been an industry interpretation of the hauling-for-repair
provision of 45 U.S.C. 13, recodified at 49 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;20303, 21302, and 21304, and has withstood the test
of time. No major objections to this limitation on the hauling of cars with power brake defects for repair were raised
by any of the commenters.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA also intends to prohibit the movement of cars with cut-out or ineffective brakes beyond points where repairs to
the defective condition could be made. FRA will consider a car's brakes ineffective if the piston travel exceeds 1.5
inches less than the total possible piston travel for that car. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA plans to require each railroad to develop a formal program to train and to qualify personnel, including contract
personnel, responsible for the inspection, testing, and maintenance of train brake systems. The detailed requirements
are stated in Subpart C of the rule text. The contemplated program is similar to programs being instituted voluntarily
by several of the major railroads. The vast majority of the comments and the experience of FRA inspectors support the
contention that many of the people inspecting and testing train brake systems do not have the training and background
to understand what they are doing and why they are doing it. As part of these programs, railroads will be required to
notify employees and contractors of their current qualification status and to require periodic requalification.
Railroads will be expected to update their training programs as they introduce new train brake system technology.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA proposes that first-line supervisors should be required to perform frequent and random spot checks of train brake
system inspections, maintenance, and tests. FRA intends to get supervisors out of the office on to the shop floor,
outside to repair tracks and repair points, and off site to locations where train brake system inspections are performed.
Only by active involvement can these supervisors improve the quality and effectiveness of their railroad's train
brake system inspection, maintenance, and test program. Performing and keeping records of these spot checks are
required if a railroad wishes to take advantage of the flexibility built into the proposed rule to allow trains to travel
much greater distances between train brake system tests. Requiring spot checks is a means that FRA will use to ensure
supervisors are jointly responsible with the employees they supervise for the correct performance of safety critical
train brake system inspection, test, and maintenance tasks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on FRA experience and the statements of several commenters, it is evident that the use of chemicals in the trainline
causes untimely wear and tear to brake system components and has a long-term detrimental effect on train air brakes.
Comments provided to FRA indicate that air dryers on locomotives are very effective in improving the performance
of train brake systems particularly under cold weather conditions and generally eliminate the need to use alcohol
and other foreign substances in the trainline. Several railroads commented that they have already equipped their
locomotives with air dryers in order to curb the use of chemicals in the trainline. Furthermore, several railroads
frequently operating under extreme cold weather conditions commented that they have prohibited chemicals from
being placed in brake air systems to prevent freeze-up. These railroads stated that they have been able to operate
trains in cold weather without resorting to chemicals, such as alcohol. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on these comments and experiences, FRA intends to ban the use of anti-freeze chemicals in train air brake systems.
In addition, FRA proposes that all new and rebuilt locomotives be equipped with air dryers with a capacity that can
be achieved by current commercially available equipment, unless the new or rebuilt locomotive will not be operated
in cold weather conditions, will power only trains limited to 30 mph or less, or will power only trains of 20 cars or less.
FRA believes that exception from the requirement to equip new and rebuilt locomotives with air dryers for these types
of operations is warranted based on the comments received and on FRA's experience that moisture in the brakeline in
these types of operations has never been a problem. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments received by FRA heavily favored the single car test as an effective tool for ensuring the safe operation of
railroad equipment. Rail labor representatives acknowledged the value of the single car test, but suggested that
railroads are establishing special expediter or light repair tracks in place of repair tracks to avoid the current
requirement to perform single car tests. The experience of FRA inspectors in the field supports this contention.
Consequently, FRA proposes to require single car tests whenever any one of a specific list of components of the air
brake system on a car is removed, repaired, or replaced. FRA also plans to require periodic freight brake tests and
single car tests at calendar intervals. These requirements are independent of the type track or facility where the
cars are worked on. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Experience of FRA indicates a proliferation of equipment with other than standard ten-inch brake cylinders. As a
result, mechanical forces and train crew members performing brake system inspections often do not know the acceptable
range of brake piston travel for this non-standard equipment. In an attempt to improve this situation, FRA intends
to require badge plates or stencilling of cars with the acceptable range of piston travel.

Section 232.17.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 These proposed conditions for the movement of equipment with defective brakes without civil penalty liability incorporate
the stringent conditions stated in the proviso to &sect;13 of the Safety Appliance Acts (45 U.S.C. 13, recodified
at 49 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;20302, 20303, 21302, and 21304). Except for cars or locomotives having their brakes cut
out en route and except for defective locomotives moving lite or dead within a yard at less than 10 mph, FRA proposes
that all cars or locomotives found with defective braking equipment be required to be tagged as bad ordered and determined
safe for movement by a qualified person. An important clarification has been made in an attempt to eliminate misinterpretation
of the regulation. FRA clearly states that equipment with defective brakes shall not pass a location where repairs
to the defective condition can be made. Consequently, if a car or locomotive is found with defective brakes during
a Class 1 or Class 2 inspection and that inspection is performed at a location where repairs of the type that are needed
can be performed, that car or locomotive may not be moved from that location until such repairs are performed. However,
if repairs to the defective condition cannot be performed at the location where the defect is discovered, or should
have been discovered, this proposal will require a railroad to drop off the equipment with defective brakes at the
nearest point on its line where the defective brakes could be repaired. A location that has been visited within the
last 365 days by a repair truck or vehicle, capable of making repairs of the type required, will be considered the nearest
point where repairs could be effectuated.

This section also provides specific restrictions on the movement of equipment with defective brakes onto the line
of a connecting railroad. Hence, the delivery of defective equipment in interchange would be covered by these restrictions.
In addition to fulfilling the other requirements set out in this section, the railroad seeking relief from civil penalty
liability must show that the connecting railroad has elected to accept the non-complying equipment and that the point
of repair on the connecting railroad's line, where the equipment will be repaired, is no further than the point where
the repairs could have been made on the line where the equipment was first found to be defective.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This section contains general design standards that apply to all trains and equipment. The railroad industry expressed
a strong desire for FRA to develop future safety regulations based on performance requirements rather than having
specific design requirements specified by the regulations. FRA recognizes that requirements based on specific
design standards may be overly restrictive. Furthermore, FRA has no objection to performance-based requirements
as long as the performance requirements contribute to improve safety, and are able to be measured and enforced. Unfortunately,
the railroad industry had little to offer in the way of specific and enforceable performance requirements for train
brake systems either at the public workshops or in the written comments preceding this proposal. However, in &sect;232.901(c),
FRA has made an attempt to move toward performance-based safety requirements by encouraging railroads and equipment
developers to submit proposed performance requirements to FRA for new train brake system technology. FRA feels that
developing performance standards for designs already in production would be a backward approach and believes that
it is much easier to develop and implement these types of standards for newly developed designs. FRA has also attempted
to integrate performance standards into several of these proposed regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA believes that Interstate Commerce Commission Order 13528, as amended (codified in existing &sect;232.3 and
Appendix B to Part 232), is no longer completely relevant or necessary. FRA proposes to revoke the Order and incorporate
its relevant portions into this section. Therefore, proposed &sect;232.101(c) contains a list of equipment to which
the Order's specifications and requirements for operating power-brake systems for freight service do not apply.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;232.101(e), FRA proposes to require that all new equipment built after January 1, 1995 be designed and constructed
so that an individual inspecting the equipment can observe brake actuation and release from a safe position beside
the equipment. This proposed requirement stems from the brake system design of double-stack equipment. Several
parties commented that the functioning of the brakes on this type of equipment cannot be observed without inspectors
placing themselves in potentially dangerous positions. In addition, a complete inspection of the brake equipment
and systems used on double-stack equipment is time consuming. Consequently, inspectors are reluctant to conduct
a complete brake inspection test on departing trains that contain this type of equipment. FRA feels that double-stack
equipment is becoming a mainstay of the freight railroad industry and that this design deficiency must be corrected.
FRA has attempted to make this a performance requirement by simply specifying how the equipment must function and
allowing the industry to determine the method of compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;232.101(f), FRA proposes to require that all train brake systems have an emergency application feature
that increases the train's deceleration rate by 15 percent over the rate of a full-service application. Most existing
train brake systems already meet this requirement. The intent of FRA is to ensure that this practice, which time has
proven effective, continues into the future. This is also a performance standard since the method of achieving the
desired increase in deceleration rate is left entirely to industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Regarding proposed &sect;232.101(g)&hyph;(h), wheel cracks due to thermal overstress are a dangerous consequence
of extreme wheel heating by the operation of friction brakes. Wheels with on-tread brakes are particularly vulnerable.
Research performed by the John A. Volpe National Transportation System Center and the AAR indicates that wheels with
on-tread brakes will form thermal cracks if the wheel tread surface temperature remains above 600 degrees F. As a result,
FRA proposes to require that future train brake systems with on-tread brakes be designed so that wheel-tread surface
temperature does not exceed 600 degrees F during normal applications of the brake. FRA also intends to require that
future train brake systems that include disc brakes be designed so the disc-pad rotor surface temperature does not
exceed 750 degrees F during a normal brake application. This requirement is also supported by research data from the
AAR and the John A. Volpe National Transportation System Center. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;232.101(i)&hyph;(j), FRA proposes to require that all locomotives be equipped with automatic wheel slip/slide
detection systems and with handbrakes. Wheel slip/slide systems are required because they tend to maximize the retarding
force available to stop the train. Handbrakes are required to minimize the chance of a car or locomotive moving while
unattended.

 This section contains design standards for conventional locomotive air brakes. The intent of this proposed section
is to preserve the time-proven performance of the conventional locomotive air brake. Most of the design standards
contained in this section were copied directly from &sect;&sect;229.47 through 229.57 of this chapter. Those provisions
of Part 229 that are incorporated into this part will be removed from Part 229. Since these design standards apply totally
to existing systems, they are very specific and leave little room for flexibility based on performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The language regarding the emergency brake valve previously contained in &sect;229.47 is changed to permit the brake
pipe valve to be located under the console and to be operated manually by the use of an extension. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 232.103(e) proposes a significant new design standard requiring that after January 1, 1996, certain new
and rebuilt locomotives and yard air sources be equipped with air dryers. As noted in the discussion of cold weather
operations and the analysis of &sect;232.15(j), several parties commented on the widespread use of methanol and
other alcohols in the trainline during cold weather operations. Although most railroads have operating rules banning
the use of such chemicals, it is apparent that there is frequent use of these chemicals. Based on FRA experience and
the statements of several commenters, it is evident that the use of chemicals in the trainline causes untimely wear
and tear to brake system components and has a long-term detrimental effect on train air brakes. Consequently, FRA
in &sect;232.15(j)(2) proposes to ban the use of chemicals in the train air brake system. Furthermore, based on the
comments of several parties, FRA believes that phasing in the use of air dryers in cold weather conditions will generally
eliminate the perceived need to use alcohol and other foreign substances in the trainline and improve the performance
of air brake systems in cold weather. Several railroad commenters indicated that air dryers are very effective in
improving the cold weather performance of train air brake systems. In addition, several railroads commented that
the benefits of air dryers justified making them standard on all their locomotives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As the accumulation of water in the air brake system has not been a problem with shorter trains, trains operated at lower
speeds, or trains operated in warmer climates, FRA intends to except from the requirements of this section new and
rebuilt locomotives that power trains and yard air sources that service trains operated exclusively in service that
meets any of the following criteria: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The locomotive powers or the yard air source services only trains limited to speeds of 30 mph or less; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The locomotive powers or the yard air source services only trains of 20 or fewer cars; or

Shortline and excursion railroads rarely, if ever, purchase new locomotives and rebuild very few locomotives that
operate outside the exceptions noted above. Furthermore, based on the information gathered by FRA, there are virtually
no shortline railroads that use or possess any yard air sources which service trains not excepted by this requirement.
Due to the limited number of cars transported by most shortline railroads, these types of operations tend to use locomotives
in their yards to charge the trainlines of cars awaiting transportation. Consequently, the economic impact of this
requirement on shortline and excursion railroads is mitigated substantially. The performance required of the air
dryer is within the performance capabilities of commercially available air dryers. In order to further develop and
evaluate this proposal, FRA seeks comments from all interested parties regarding the following specific issues:

 This section contains design standards for conventional train air brakes except for trains propelled by MU locomotives.
FRA intends to preserve the basic conventional train air brake technology that has long been an industry standard.
Several commenters recommended that the specifications and requirements for power brake systems for freight service
contained in Appendix B to Part 232 be eliminated because they are too restrictive and detailed to allow for technological
development. Contrary to these commenters' views, FRA feels that many of the requirements contained in Appendix
B for power brake systems are still necessary. FRA does recognize that some of the requirements are outdated and should
be eliminated. Therefore, as previously stated in the discussion of &sect;232.101, FRA proposes to eliminate Appendix
B and incorporate those requirements that it feels are still relevant to today's equipment directly into various
sections of the revised regulation. Consequently, this section contains the general requirement that air brake
system components be adequately sealed to prevent contamination by foreign material and also contains provisions
regarding the control valve's compatibility with other air brake systems. Furthermore, in order to address the concerns
of several parties that the requirements contained in Appendix B are too restrictive to allow the development of new
technology, FRA in &sect;232.901 proposes to permit parties to petition FRA to grant waivers or convert some of the
train brake system specification and design requirements into performance-based safety requirements.

 This section contains design standards for blended brakes. Blended brakes are becoming increasingly prevalent,
particularly in passenger and commuter operations. Blended brakes combine the retarding forces of dynamic brakes
and friction brakes to produce the desired overall braking effect. FRA proposes to require that the blending of the
two retarding forces be done automatically and that the friction portion of the braking system be capable of safely
stopping the train in the event of a power loss or other failure of the dynamic portion of the train brake system. Most,
if not all, existing blended braking schemes meet these two requirements.

 This section involves design standards for dynamic brakes. Most, if not all, of the railroads that provided comments
stated that they do not consider dynamic brakes to be a safety device. However, these same commenters stated that they
promote and encourage the use of dynamic brakes for purposes of fuel efficiency and to avoid wear to brake components.
Due to this encouragement, dynamic brakes are relied on to control train speed and to provide assistance in controlling
trains on heavy grades. Contrary to the comments of several labor representatives, FRA does not feel that locomotives
should be required to be equipped with dynamic brakes, FRA believes that the decision to equip a locomotive with dynamic
brakes is mainly an economic one, best determined by each individual railroad. However, in order to prevent accidents
and injuries that may result from an over-reliance on the dynamic brake, which may fail at any time, FRA believes that
if the devices are available, engineers should be informed on their safe and proper use and be provided with information
regarding the amount of dynamic braking power actually available on their respective trains. FRA believes that by
providing an engineer with as much information as possible on the status of the dynamic brakes on a train, a railroad
better enables that engineer to operate the train in the safest and most efficient manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As previously discussed, the operating rules of most railroads currently contain limits on the amount of dynamic
braking force that may safely be used depending on the dimensions of the train involved. Most railroad operating rules
express these limits in terms of the number of axles that engine consists are permitted to use in dynamic braking. Railroads
generally will cut out the dynamic brakes on trailing locomotives, when the train is made up, in order to avoid the possibility
of excessive dynamic braking force being applied, which could result in the buckling of the train. However, some operating
rules also express dynamic braking limits for operating through turnouts, crossovers, and curves in terms of dynamic
brake amperes, yet, there is currently no way for engineers to know the amount of dynamic brake amperage on their train
or the amperage they are using. Furthermore, although running tests of dynamic brakes, as proposed by FRA, provide
information to the locomotive engineer regarding the availability of dynamic brakes, such tests are limited to the
specific moment they are performed. Thus, running tests do not provide continuous information on the current status
of the dynamic brakes to the locomotive engineer. Because dynamic brakes could fail at any time, FRA feels there must
be some way for engineers to continuously monitor the operation of their available dynamic brakes.

In &sect;7 of the RSERA, recodified at 49 U.S.C. 20141, Congress mandated that the Secretary ``prescribe standards
regarding dynamic brake equipment.'' FRA interprets this mandate to require the development of meaningful and enforceable
standards to address the safe use of dynamic brakes. As stated previously, FRA believes that any meaningful standards
regarding dynamic brakes must include provisions for providing the locomotive engineer with continuous information
on the current status of the dynamic brakes. Currently, the only means of providing this continuous information to
the engineer is some type of dynamic brake display in the cab of the locomotive. Consequently, in order to comply with
Congress' mandate requiring meaningful standards to address the safe use of dynamic brakes, FRA proposes that locomotives
built after January 1, 1996, and equipped with dynamic brakes, be able to (i) test the electrical integrity of the dynamic
brake at rest and (ii) display the total train dynamic brake retarding force, at certain speed increments, in the cab
of the controlling locomotive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the ANPRM (57 FR 62555), FRA requested comments from the industry on possible methods of providing information
regarding the status of dynamic brakes to the engineer in the cab of the controlling locomotive. The only workable
option presented to FRA in the comments received was the equipping of locomotives with a dynamic brake display. Although
FRA recognizes that the technology for dynamic brake displays with the ability to provide the type of information
sought by FRA is not readily available today, several commenters suggested that it is currently being developed.
FRA believes that the benefits of such an indicator would be to alert engineers that they have diminished or excessive
dynamic capabilities, thus permitting the engineer to control the braking of their train in the safest possible manner.
However, in order to fully evaluate the viability of this proposal, FRA seeks comments from all interested parties
regarding the following specific issues: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) What is the status on the future availability of dynamic brake indicators capable of providing the information

provide to a locomotive engineer? What are the costs?

(5) What are the operating and maintenance experiences of the dynamic brake monitoring devices currently used on
high speed passenger trains?

(6) Would automatic blending between friction and dynamic brakes prevent an engineer from overrelying on dynamic
brakes and provide the same safety benefit as monitoring the status of the dynamic brake?

This section proposes design standards for intermediate speed and high speed train brakes. FRA recognizes that much
of the equipment covered by these proposed standards is still in the developmental stages of existence; however,
FRA recognizes that the operation of higher speed trains will occur in the near future. FRA feels, therefore, that
steps need to be taken now to ensure the safe operation of this type of equipment. In addition, most of the proposed standards
are either general in nature or are performance-oriented and, thus, would not impede the development of new technologies.
Furthermore, the proposed standards would not apply to intermediate speed passenger equipment that entered service
prior to January 1, 1995. FRA does not intend to disrupt existing passenger service in the Northeast Corridor or in
other high speed corridors; however, as new service is developed or new equipment is put into service on these corridors,
it would become subject to the design requirements proposed in this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA feels that trains that operate at speeds in excess of 79 mph but not exceeding 125 mph should be classified as intermediate
speed operations and that trains that operate at speeds in excess of 125 mph but not exceeding 160 mph should be classified
as high speed operations. Pursuant to the statutory mandate, which requires two-way EOT devices on all trains exceeding
30 mph (with stated exceptions), FRA intends to require that all intermediate speed freight trains be equipped with
two-way EOT devices, with no exceptions. FRA also proposes to require dynamic brakes on all locomotive and power cars
used in intermediate speed or high speed service. FRA feels that as speed increases, the need for retarding force beyond
that available from friction brakes alone also increases. Dynamic brakes also provide a valuable means of decreasing
brake heating of wheels and/or axles. FRA also intends to require a means of monitoring the enroute performance and
status of the dynamic brake on intermediate and high speed trains. Although the technology for this equipment is not
currently available, several commenters suggested that it is in the process of being developed.

FRA feels that, as train speed increases, limiting the number of responses required from the locomotive engineer
will increase overall train safety. As a result, FRA proposes to require that intermediate and high speed train brake
systems be computer controlled. FRA recognizes the unique designs and features that the braking systems of these
types of operations may incorporate and, thus, FRA agrees with several of the commenters that the train brake systems
used by these operations should be controlled by some kind of automated computer system. FRA proposes to require that
these computer systems have the ability to run diagnostic programs capable of self-testing the brake system and detecting
faults in the system and have the ability of either alerting the engineer to these faults or taking automatic corrective
action. In addition, FRA requires that the computer software of these systems be analyzed to determine the safety
impacts of software failures and to ensure that the software is fail-safe and functions as intended. Due to the unique
designs that intermediate and high speed braking systems may incorporate, the inspectors of the equipment may be
required to place themselves in dangerous positions in order to inspect the equipment. If that is the case, FRA feels
that the brake systems should be equipped with sensors that give a reliable indication of the application and release
of the brakes, visible to an engineer in the cab and to an inspector on the platform or along the side of the track. FRA
proposes general design guidelines for several types of train brake system sensors. FRA intends to encourage the
development of brake system sensor technology in order to improve train brake system tests and inspections while
reducing the risk of personal injury.

This section proposes design standards for one-way EOT devices that are largely unchanged from the standards currently
stated in &sect;232.19. Since these standards have proven effective, FRA sees no reason to change them. The only major
change to the current requirements is the extension of the calibration period for all EOT devices from 92 days to 365
days. FRA bases this proposed extension not only on its own experience but also on the comments received from several
parties that the devices are fairly reliable and can operate for years without calibration problems. Although several
labor representatives commented on the unreliability of the devices, these comments generally addressed the failure
of the railroads to properly perform the calibrations or the misuse of the devices. Furthermore, FRA believes that
the 92-day calibration period was established at a time when there was little experience with these devices. Since
that time, not only has calibration of the devices not proven to be a problem, but technology has further improved the
reliability of the devices. These proposed rules result in one-way EOT devices being gradually phased out of use as
they are replaced by two-way EOT devices.

This section provides design standards for two-way EOT devices. No design standards for two-way EOT devices currently
exist; however, the two-way devices currently in production meet the design requirements for one-way EOT devices
and also provide two-way communication and the ability to make an emergency brake application from the rear of the
train. The currently available two-way devices have several optional features that could prove very beneficial
to railroads. Although FRA recommends that railroads obtain as many of the optional features as they can when purchasing
the devices, FRA does not intend to mandate their use and feels that each railroad is in the best position to determine
which features best suit its operation. FRA proposes to apply the one-way device design requirements to two-way devices
as well as a set of specific requirements intended to ensure the existence of two-way communication and the ability
to make an emergency brake application from the rear of the train. In order to prevent vandalism and to avoid the possibility
of a train accidentally being placed in emergency, FRA proposes to require that the front and rear units be linked together
so that the rear unit will only respond to its associated front unit. Although these proposed design requirements
essentially specify a specific two-way EOT device design, FRA encourages the development of alternate equivalent
or better technologies.

properly. Several labor organizations and their individual members explicitly commented that they are not sufficiently
trained to perform the inspections and tests required of them. In addition, several railroads admitted that the training
they currently provide could be improved. FRA recognizes that many railroads are attempting to improve their training
programs; however, FRA thinks that minimum training qualifications need to be established to assure that brake inspections
and tests are being properly performed in order to protect both the public and railroad employees from the operation
of equipment that does not meet Federal standards. Although there has been a decline in the number of train accidents,
derailments, fatalities, and injuries over the last ten years, FRA believes that the number of these incidents will
be further reduced if maintenance, inspections, and tests of the brake system are performed by individuals who have
received this minimum training.

Railroads continue to consolidate mechanical work to fewer and fewer locations on the railroad. This trend places
an increasing premium on the ability of train crews to conduct meaningful inspections and tests of the power brake
system. Although features of this proposal offer incentives for proper deployment of mechanical forces, increases
in train speeds and increased pressure on operating personnel due to growing traffic density will continue to make
it critical for train crews to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discharge their duties with respect to power brake systems both diligently and effectively even under the most optimistic
of scenarios with respect to the operation of incentives.

In this rulemaking FRA proposes to allow significant increases in the maximum distances trains may travel between
brake system inspections where mechanical forces perform the inspection function (including a complete inspection
under 49 CFR Part 215). The latitude that would be provided under this rule would result in fewer inspections per distance
traveled and reduce the number of opportunities that will exist for a serious defect to be found before it could result
in a train accident. It is imperative, therefore, that each inspection be of uniformly high quality. Meaningful and
enforceable qualification requirements for personnel will help raise the overall quality of inspections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Technological change presents an additional reason for placing strong emphasis on qualifications of personnel.
Train crews and mechanical personnel alike are confronted with an increasing variety of power brake arrangements
and features. Recently, the Association of American Railroads has announced an intensified effort to develop and
deploy electronic braking systems on freight equipment. These trends will make it important for personnel to be fully
familiar with the systems that they are required to inspect and maintain. FRA recognizes that although technological
advancements may increase the need for more qualified maintenance forces, they may also reduce the complexity and
extent of the inspecting and testing requirements for certain equipment with the emergence of brake indicators and
sensors or the development of more reliable equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, FRA proposes to establish broad qualification requirements and issue specific training and experience
guidelines based on the type of inspections, maintenance, or tests an individual employee performs. Several railroad
commenters suggested that there is no reason for individuals who solely perform pre-departure air brake tests and
inspections to be as highly trained as a carman. FRA tends to agree with these commenters since carmen perform many
other duties which involve the maintenance and repair of equipment in addition to brake inspections. Therefore,
the proposed training guidelines are less stringent for those individuals that perform only brake inspections and
tests. FRA intends for these training guidelines to apply not only to railroad personnel but also to contract personnel
and personnel in plants that build cars and locomotives that are responsible for brake system inspections, maintenance,
or tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The American Public Transit Association (APTA) suggested that FRA provide broad training and experience guidelines
and allow each railroad to develop its own qualification and certification program, which FRA would then review and
approve if it met the general guidelines. This method provides significant flexibility to each railroad, but would
require complex and timely evaluation of a potentially large number of disparate plans. FRA's experience with this
``review-and-approval'' approach (e.g., the locomotive engineer certification program) indicates that FRA's
limited resources are severely overburdened when FRA is required to approve individual plans for over 600 railroads
and many contract facilities that perform work subject to the regulations. This could result in some plans not being
finally reviewed and approved for several years. While providing latitude for innovation, this approach could also
become a source of costly disputes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA believes that the approach contained in this proposal may avoid many of the problems inherent in an approach similar
to that suggested by APTA while preserving its advantages. FRA intends to propose broad performance-based standards
in the rule text for various individuals depending on the type of brake work they perform. Due to the significant proposed
incentives that are being offered to railroads that use personnel meeting the proposed qualification requirements
for mechanical and electrical inspectors to perform brake work, FRA must be able to determine uniformly if sufficient
training and experience have been afforded to those individuals deemed qualified by a railroad. Consequently, FRA
also intends to issue specific training and experience guidelines that FRA believes, based on its considered judgement,
a railroad's training program must contain in order to ensure individuals possess the minimum knowledge and skills
necessary to perform the duties required of them. FRA believes that this approach will allow each individual railroad
the flexibility to develop and implement a program to train and qualify employees and issue credentials based on its
own unique operating conditions and equipment, while ensuring that a minimum level of competence is maintained throughout
the industry. Although FRA is proposing that specific training and experience requirements be issued as guidelines,
at this time, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA recognizes that the purpose and need for these requirements may be better served if these guidelines were part
of the rule text and will consider this option when drafting the final rule. Therefore, FRA solicits comments from
interested parties regarding not only FRA's proposed approach to this issue and the specific training and experience
guidelines contained therein, but also any comments or opinions as to whether the specific training and experience
guidelines should be contained in the text of the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA also recognizes that there may be other approaches that are equally viable. Consequently, FRA seeks comments
from interested parties regarding alternative methods and approaches for ensuring that properly qualified individuals
are performing brake inspections, tests, and maintenance. Commenters are requested to identify alternative criteria
for training programs and to specify present or planned approaches that might be unduly constrained by the text of
the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA also has some concerns regarding the application of the proposed experience and training guidelines to newly
hired train-service employees. There is a current trend toward the use of smaller train crews, and thus, heavy reliance
will in some cases be placed on a single ground employee with little training and experience. In order to avoid this
pitfall, FRA specifically solicits comments regarding various methods and approaches for structuring training
programs to ensure that the proposed training and experience guidelines can be met by newly hired train-service employees
prior to their being assigned duties for which the training and experience are required.

Section 232.201.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This section contains general requirements regarding the development of formal training programs. FRA proposes
to require each railroad to develop a formal program to train and to qualify personnel, including contract personnel,
responsible for the inspection, testing, and maintenance of train brake systems. The contemplated program is similar
to programs being instituted voluntarily by several of the major railroads. The vast majority of the comments and
the experience of FRA inspectors support the contention that many of the people inspecting and testing train brake
systems do not have the training and background to understand what they are doing and why they are doing it. As part of
these programs, railroads will be required to notify employees and contractors of their current qualification status
and to require periodic requalification. Railroads will be expected to update their training programs as they introduce
new train brake system technology. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order for a railroad to institute a training program without prior FRA approval, a railroad will be required to certify
to FRA that its training program incorporates the training and experience guidelines established by FRA for train
brake system supervisors, mechanical inspectors, electronic inspectors, and train crew members. The specific
training and experience guidelines, contained in the preambles for &sect;&sect;232.205&hyph;232.211 were developed
by FRA based upon its expertise and experience in the railroad industry. They represent FRA's best judgement as to
what is currently necessary in order to meet the broad qualification standards contained in the aforementioned sections
of the rule. If, based on the comments received and after further consideration, FRA elects to adopt the approach proposed
in this notice, the specific training and experience guidelines will be contained in a separate appendix to this part
in the final rule. FRA recognizes that more stringent guidelines may be required or that the guidelines may need to
be specifically contained in the text of the rule. FRA also recognizes that there may be alternative methods of providing
training and experience, not yet known to FRA, that might achieve the same level of skill and knowledge. Consequently,
in order to further develop and evaluate this proposal, FRA seeks comments from all interested parties regarding
the following issues: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Are the guidelines proposed by FRA, in the preamble to this subpart, an accurate assessment of the minimum training
and experience required for individuals to adequately perform the duties required of them? If not, what should the
minimum guidelines include? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Should the proposed minimum training and/or minimum experience guidelines be raised or lowered? Explain. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Should the training and experience requirements proposed to be in guidelines be included in the text of the final
rule instead? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Are there alternative criteria or approaches for ensuring that qualified individuals are performing brake tests,
inspections, and maintenance? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This section also requires that if a railroad develops a training program inconsistent with the training and experience
guidelines established by FRA, the railroad must submit the program to FRA for FRA approval prior to implementing
the program. A program will be considered inconsistent with the training and experience guidelines if it permits
the qualification of any individual with less than the training or experience provided for in the guidelines. Railroads
are encouraged and permitted to develop training programs with more extensive training and experience requirements
without seeking FRA's approval. FRA recognizes that future technological developments and innovations, not yet
apparent to FRA, might result in a reduced necessity for certain training or experience requirements. Thus, a railroad
submitting an inconsistent program for FRA approval must provide detailed information regarding their rationale
for deviating from the proposed training and experience guidelines (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, technological improvements, equipment reliability, innovative or intensive training techniques) and explain
how their programs ensure that qualified individuals will be performing tests, inspections, and maintenance of
brake systems as required by this part. While a program is being reviewed by FRA, the railroad submitting the program
will be unable to take advantage of the incentives offered to railroads for using qualified employees to perform various
tests, inspections, and maintenance of train brake systems, unless the railroad has a training program in effect
which incorporates the specific training and experience guidelines.

Section 232.202.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This section outlines the general qualification requirements for train brake system maintenance personnel. FRA
believes a higher level of knowledge and skill is required to perform brake system maintenance than is required to
perform brake system inspections and tests. Therefore, the general requirements for brake system maintenance personnel
should be more stringent than the requirements for personnel performing only brake system inspections and tests.
FRA considers train brake system maintenance an essential element of overall railroad safety. The knowledge and
skill of the personnel responsible for train brake system maintenance are the keys to an effective maintenance program.
Therefore, FRA proposes a set of general minimum qualification requirements for all personnel, including contract
personnel, responsible for train brake system maintenance.

This section contains the general qualification requirements for train brake system inspection and test personnel.
FRA believes that individuals performing train brake system inspections or tests do not require the depth of knowledge
required of those individuals performing train brake system maintenance. FRA proposes several general requirements
that are aimed at ensuring that individuals performing brake system inspections and tests must, at a minimum, be able
to perform the specific tests or inspections required by Federal regulations on the type of brake systems for which
they are responsible. Broad performance-based qualification requirements for ``mechanical inspectors,'' ``electronic
inspectors,'' and ``qualified train crew members'' are set forth at &sect;&sect;232.207, 232.209, and 232.211,
respectively.

Section 232.205.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This section contains the qualification requirements for train brake system supervisors. The first-line supervisor
of personnel responsible for train brake system inspections, tests, and maintenance must provide much of the quality
control exerted over this work. This makes the train brake system supervisor a central player in the scheme to ensure
the safe operation of trains. The supervisor performs this quality control function by performing spot checks of
the work done by subordinates. To perform effective spot checks, the supervisor must have an extensive background
in the inspections, tests, and maintenance required for train brake systems for which the supervisor is responsible.
Consequently, FRA believes that, in order for a railroad to designate an individual as a qualified train brake system
supervisor, that person must receive instruction in accordance with the following minimum training and experience
guidelines: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Have a minimum of two years' experience testing, inspecting, and maintaining the type of train brake systems for
which he or she is responsible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Have successfully completed 24 hours of training including eight hours of ``hands on'' training within the past
three years on the Train Brake System Safety Standards. ``Successful completion'' means that the supervisor has
been able to pass an examination on the Train Brake System Safety Standards conducted by the railroad. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Have successfully completed 80 hours of training, including 40 hours of ``hands on'' training within the past
three years, and an intensive technical course on the operation, inspection, and maintenance of brake systems typical
of those installed on the type of equipment for which the supervisor has responsibility. ``Successful completion''
means that the supervisor has been able to pass an examination covering inspection, test, and maintenance of the specific
brake equipment with which the employees supervised work. This test shall be conducted by the railroad. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Have a thorough knowledge of the employing/operating railroad's procedures and policies on train brake system
inspection, maintenance, and test.

Section 232.207.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This section addresses the qualification requirements for brake system mechanical inspectors. The ``mechanical
inspector'' is not necessarily qualified to perform only mechanical inspections. For the purposes of these regulations,
the mechanical inspector is considered to have the knowledge and skill necessary to maintain the mechanical components
of train brake systems as well as to perform brake system inspections and tests. The proposed specific training and
experience guidelines represent what FRA considers the minimum necessary for the mechanical inspector to be effective.
Several sections of these new regulations propose incentives for railroads who use qualified mechanical inspectors
to perform train brake system mechanical work. Consequently, in order for a railroad to designate an individual as
a qualified train brake system mechanical inspector, that person must receive instruction in accordance with the
following minimum training and experience guidelines: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Have a minimum of two years' experience testing, inspecting, and maintaining the type train brake mechanical
subsystems on which he or she is assigned to work. One year of experience as a train crew member inspecting and testing
brake systems may count toward one year of the required experience. However, at least one year of experience is required
that includes hands-on maintenance of train brake systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Have successfully completed 24 hours of training including eight hours of ``hands on'' training within the past

able to pass an examination on the Train Brake System Safety Standards conducted by the railroad. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Have successfully completed 80 hours of training including 40 hours of hands on training within the past three
years and an intensive technical course on the operation, test, inspection, and maintenance of brake systems typical
of the type of equipment with which the Inspector works. ``Successful completion'' means that the Inspector has been
able to pass an examination covering inspection and maintenance of the specific brake equipment with which the inspector
works. This test shall be conducted by the railroad.

This section includes the qualification requirements for brake system electronic inspectors. The ``electronic
inspector'' is not necessarily qualified to perform only electronic inspections. For the purposes of these proposed
regulations, the electronic inspector will be considered to have the knowledge and skill to maintain the electronic
components, including computer control components, of train brake systems as well as the ability to perform brake
system inspections and tests. The electronic inspector will play an increasingly important role in train safety
as brake system technology continues to advance. The proposed specific training and experience guidelines represent
what FRA considers the minimum necessary for the electronic inspector to be effective. Several sections of these
new regulations propose incentives for railroads who use qualified electronic inspectors to perform train brake
system electronic work. Consequently, in order for a railroad to designate an individual as a qualified train brake
system electronic inspector that person must receive instruction in accordance with the following minimum training
and experience guidelines: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Have a minimum of three years' experience inspecting, testing, and maintaining the type of train brake electronic

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Have successfully completed 32 hours of training including eight hours of ``hands on'' training within the past

This section contains the qualification requirements for train crew members. Although FRA discourages the practice
of using train crew members to perform brake system inspections and tests, FRA recognizes that situations exist where
railroads must use crew members to perform this work. Numerous comments were provided by several labor organizations
and their individual members to support the position that, on a whole, train crew members are not sufficiently trained
to perform brake system inspections and tests. The experience of FRA inspectors in the field also supports this position.
At the same time, it is clear that most train crew members are capable of acquiring and applying the pertinent knowledge
to perform train brake inspections; and many have demonstrated this capability in the past. Consequently, in order
for a railroad to designate an individual as a qualified train crew member capable of performing train brake system
inspections and/or tests, that person must receive instruction in accordance with the following minimum training
and experience guidelines: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Have a minimum of six months of experience inspecting and testing the type of train brake systems that he or she is

that apply to work performed by that crew member.

This section contains the requirements for maintaining personnel qualification records and for the notification

records for all personnel responsible for the inspection, testing, and maintenance of train brake systems. This
section also specifically requires that railroads maintain these types of records for all contract personnel who
perform brake system inspections, tests, or maintenance. Most railroads already keep records of this type. These
records may be used by FRA to assess the adequacy of a railroad's qualification program determining whether properly
qualified personnel are performing the necessary inspections, tests, and maintenance of train brake systems. As
a means of ensuring that only properly qualified individuals are performing only those tasks for which they are qualified,
FRA proposes to require railroads to promptly notify personnel of changes in their qualification status.

individuals may perform which tasks in order to ensure that only qualified individuals perform brake system work
and to ensure that only high-quality tests, inspections, and maintenance of train brake systems are performed. FRA
has attempted to limit the use of train crew members in the performance of brake system inspections and tests. FRA proposes
to require that train crew members meeting the qualification requirements stated in &sect;232.211 be allowed to
perform Class 1 and Class 2 train brake system tests only on conventional freight trains restricted to 500 miles between
train brake system tests. All other Class 1 tests and all maintenance would be performed by mechanical and/or electronic
inspectors meeting the requirements of &sect;&sect;232.207 or 232.209. FRA also proposes to require that spot checks
of train brake system work be performed only by supervisors that meet the qualification requirements of &sect;232.205.
FRA thinks that the largest improvement railroads can make in safe train operation is ensuring that properly supervised
and trained personnel perform all safety-critical train brake system work.

Section 232.303. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section proposes the inspection and test standards for conventional freight locomotives. As stated previously,
FRA wishes to consolidate all brake-related regulations into Part 232. Consequently, the requirements regarding
periodic, annual, biennial, main reservoir, and leakage tests on locomotive brake components contained in &sect;&sect;229.25
through 229.31 and &sect;229.59 would be removed from Part 229 and incorporated into this section with minor editorial
changes. It should be noted that the requirements concerning aluminum main reservoirs contained in &sect;229.31(d)
would be eliminated since they applied only to a specific reservoirs which are no longer in service. Transducer-driven
air gauge displays would be added to the requirements for testing air gauges since they are considered equal to air
gauges and must be tested at the same frequency. The chart in paragraph (f) of this proposed section displays the intervals
at which various types of equipment are to be cleaned, repaired, and tested. Type 26&hyph;L brake equipment devices
are required to be cleaned, repaired, and tested at least every 1,104 days. This requirement applies only to 26&hyph;L
brake equipment devices that were tested under H&hyph;80&hyph;7 or derivatives of such valves. The following specific
devices are included: 26&hyph;C brake valve, 30&hyph;CDW brake valve, MU&hyph;2A valve, SA&hyph;26 Ind brake valve,
26&hyph;D and 26&hyph;F control valve, F&hyph;1 selector valve, J-type relay valve, A&hyph;1 charging cutoff pilot
valve, No. 8 or KM vent valve, BP strainer, MR safety valve, foot valves, MR check valve, double check valves, magnet
valves, H-type relay air valves, reducing valves, and P&hyph;2&hyph;A brake application valve. FRA recognizes
that the test methods described in this section represent old technology. FRA proposes that the new regulations encourage
the development of new non-destructive test methods as alternatives to the methods described in this section to ensure
brake system components will safely function as designed.

Section 232.305. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section contains general requirements regarding the development of written procedures for conventional freight
train brake system tests. FRA believes that the foundation of any good test and inspection plan is the written procedures
that provide detailed guidance on how to properly conduct the various required tests and inspections. FRA feels that
the thinking process involved in developing written procedures requires a railroad to consider all aspects of the
inspection and testing process, which should result in more efficient and thorough inspections. FRA agrees with
many of the commenters that it would be far too intrusive and practically impossible for FRA to mandate specific methods
for performing the various required inspections on various equipment. FRA feels that each railroad is in the best
position to determine the method of inspection that best fits its operating conditions and equipment. However, the
method of inspection developed by the railroad should ensure that all equipment is properly inspected and functioning
in accordance with these regulations. A railroad is required to develop written procedures that are tailored to the
types of trains and equipment operated by that railroad. The procedures should contain step-by-step instructions
for performing the various train brake system tests required by this proposed rule, which include: Class 1, Class
2, transfer train, and running tests. Written procedures will also be required for the testing and inspecting of equipment
that incorporates new brake system technology. Furthermore, written procedures will be required that explain the
method and means for maintaining records of brake system tests aboard the train.

Section 232.307. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section describes the circumstances that would trigger the requirement to perform a Class 1 train brake system
test. FRA proposes to require that a Class 1 brake test be performed at all initial terminal points for that train. FRA
defines ``initial terminal point'' for a conventional freight train as (i) that point where the train is originally
assembled and (ii) each point where the train is required to have a new Class 1 brake test due to the fact that it has travelled
the maximum permissible distance since its last Class 1 brake test. As will be further explained in the discussion
of &sect;232.309, FRA proposes to eliminate the current 1,000-mile inspection requirement and implement a program
that allows trains to travel anywhere from 500 miles to 3,500 miles depending on such factors as the quality of the inspection
performed on the train. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1,000-mile test, like its predecessor the 500-mile test, has failed to live up to its intended role in the power
brake safety regime. An increasing number of such tests are conducted by train crews. In some cases locations designated
for these tests are on line of haul and not conducive to careful scrutiny of the train braking system. Increasingly,
FRA finds that some railroads appear to alter the location of tests to frustrate enforcement. At the same time, little
evidence has accumulated to support the proposition that the 1,000-mile test is critical to safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA is aware of statistics offered by the BRC indicating that a large number of ``bad order'' cars have been identified
in 1,000-mile inspections conducted at Salt Lake City, Utah and North Platte, Nebraska. FRA recognizes that these
statistics argue against the elimination of 1,000-mile inspections. However, FRA believes many of these ``bad orders''
at 1,000-mile inspections were due to problems that should have been uncovered during the initial terminal brake
test. FRA proposes to address this problem by requiring minimum qualifications for both train crew members and other
employees that perform brake inspections and tests and that these inspections and tests be spot checked by qualified
supervisors. Trains inspected by crew members will be limited to 500 miles of travel between Class 1 brake system tests.
Only trains initially inspected and tested by qualified brake inspectors will be allowed to travel more than 500 miles
between required brake system inspections and tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, many of the problems uncovered at 1,000-mile inspections were not defects under Part 232 and would not
have affected the operation of the train brake system. FRA proposes to address these type problems by requiring a mechanical
safety inspection as part of the Class 1 brake system test for trains that are to travel more than 500 miles between Class
1 brake system tests. FRA believes these proposed provisions of the new regulations eliminate the need for the 1,000-mile
test. Accordingly, FRA believes that reliance should be placed on the more thorough Class 1 test (the functional equivalent
of the current initial terminal test) at whatever point a new inspection of the train braking system is required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This section requires that certain records be maintained by a railroad in order for a train to travel in excess of 500
miles. The method for maintaining these records is not specified because FRA believes that each railroad is in the
best position to determine the most efficient and accurate method for acquiring and storing the information. However,
FRA intends that no matter what method is chosen by a railroad, the required information must be available to FRA upon
request in order to allow FRA to monitor train movement and ensure compliance with these proposed regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This section also requires that a Class 1 brake test be performed on all cars added to a train that have not yet received
a Class 1 brake test and on all cars disconnected from a source of compressed air for longer than four hours. FRA agrees
with several commenters that our longstanding administrative interpretation of only allowing cars to be ``off air''
for two hours was established prior to the development of new equipment that has greatly reduced leakage problems.
Contrary to several commenters' contentions, FRA does not believe that cars should allowed to be ``off air'' for extended
periods without being retested. FRA believes that the longer cars sit without a compressed air supply attached, the
greater the chances are that the integrity of the system will be compromised, either by weather conditions or vandalism.
FRA believes that four hours is the maximum time that cars should be disconnected from a source of compressed air without
compromising safety.

This section details the required tasks comprising a Class 1 brake system test on conventional freight trains. A proper
Class 1 brake test ensures that a train is capable of traveling to its destination with minimal problems enroute. Specific
tasks of the Class 1 brake test include most of the tasks currently required in initial terminal brake tests with some
modification in the interest of standardization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA proposes a standardized brake-pipe reduction of 20 psi for all brake inspections and tests. FRA agrees with both
labor and management commenters that a standard brake-pipe reduction will simplify train brake tests and will make
it easier to train workers. The 20-psi standardized reduction was suggested by both labor and management commenters.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The brake-pipe leakage test would continue to be a valid method of qualifying brake systems. However, FRA proposes
that the air flow method of testing the condition of the brake pipe become an acceptable alternate to the brake-pipe
leakage test. The air flow method would only be an alternative for trains equipped with 26&hyph;L freight locomotive
brake equipment and outfitted with an EOT device. The maximum allowable flow would be 60 CFM. FRA believes that the
air flow method is a much more comprehensive test than the leakage test. Although FRA is not proposing to mandate the
use of the air flow method, it does recommend that railroads use the method when possible, not just to qualify brake
systems, but in order to provide additional information regarding the brake system to the train crew. The air flow
method has been approved for use by AAR member railroads after extensive testing, and the method has been available
in Canada as an alternate means of qualifying train brakes since 1984. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The brake-pipe gradient of 15 psi has been retained for both the leakage and air flow method of train brake testing;
however, the minimum rear-car pressure has been increased to 75 psi, which will require a locomotive brake-pipe pressure
of 90 psi. FRA feels that the added margin of braking power justifies the increase in pressure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments received by FRA indicated a high reliability of the rear-car pressure transducers used in reporting brake-pipe
pressure by an EOT device. Consequently, FRA feels justified in allowing the use of EOT devices in establishing the
rear car pressure for Class 1 brake tests. This proposed Class 1 brake test also requires that EOT devices be inspected.
The pressure display on the front unit would be verified with that of the rear unit at the time of installation on the
train. The emergency function would be tested after installation on the train by closing the angle cock at the rear
car, to isolate it from the train, and then actuating the emergency switch on the front unit. After verifying of the
emergency application on the rear car, the angle cock must be opened to reestablish trainline continuity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA proposes to continue to allow railroads the option of performing a complete Class 1 test or a leakage/application-and-release
test on cars picked up at a point other than a terminal. Cars receiving the abbreviated test shall be given a complete
Class 1 test at the next terminal where facilities are available for such attention. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA proposes to continue to allow ``roll-by'' inspections of the brake release but to limit their speed to 10 mph, since
roll-by inspections made at greater speeds would not permit sufficient visual inspection of the brake equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some pieces of equipment currently being used by railroads that incorporate several different types of brake systems
with piston travel limits which differ greatly from the 7&hyph;9 inch limits found on standard brake cylinders. Inspectors
of this equipment may not know the piston travel limits for this equipment and, thus, may perform a cursory inspection
of the pistons assuming the travel is correct. Therefore, in order to aid inspectors in performing quality inspections,
FRA proposes that the piston travel limits of non-standard brake cylinders be displayed on a badge plate or stencil.

This section contains the guidelines for determining the distance a train is allowed to travel between Class 1 train
brake system tests. The requirements proposed in this section were carefully constructed to enhance safety both
with respect to sound functioning of train braking systems and other mechanical components (particularly of railroad
freight cars). The approach balances the conflicting concerns of railroads and railroad labor organizations. FRA
agrees with railroad commenters, that if the brake systems on today's trains are properly tested, inspected, and
maintained, the trains are capable of safely operating for greater distances between brake system tests than currently
permitted. However, FRA also agrees with the position presented by labor organizations that proper brake system
inspections and maintenance are not being performed by the railroads. Consequently, FRA would provide railroads
with the incentive of permission to travel distances that are in excess of what is currently permitted if quality tests,
inspections, and maintenance are performed. In addition, if a railroad fails to perform the tasks required for extended
movement, by merely performing the minimum required tests and inspections that FRA finds necessary for the safe operation
of a train, then its trains would not be permitted to be moved beyond 500 miles without another Class 1 brake test. FRA
believes that the proposed 500-mile reduction from the 1,000-mile limit currently allowed is justified based on
the fact that the 1,000-mile inspection was extended from 500 miles in 1982 based on a commitment by the railroads to
perform high quality tests and inspections at initial terminals, which based on FRA experience and the comments received,
has not been fulfilled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirements proposed in this section offer the railroads important flexibility while imposing firm requirements.
A railroad may elect to conduct a Class 1 test utilizing train crew members trained in the requirements of the power
brake regulations. In that case, the railroad may operate the train no more than 500 miles.

Alternately, the railroad may utilize more highly skilled and experienced mechanical forces to perform the test,
yielding an important increment of increased quality with respect to detection of brake system problems (including
those that have not yet led to any diminution of train braking effectiveness). Choice of this option must also be accompanied
by use of mechanical personnel to perform a more thorough inspection for other defects under the Freight Car Safety
Standards (49 CFR 215.13(b)). In exchange for the greater investment in inspection effort, and in recognition that
this effort is more likely to be fully effective in ensuring the safety of the movement against both existing and incipient
problems, the railroad would be allowed to move the train for greater distances without an additional train braking
system test. Additional requirements would apply, as discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Freight trains would be allowed to operate distances of up to 1,500 miles between train brake system tests if the operating
railroad complied with the conditions given in paragraph (b) of this section. An important proposed performance
requirement to earn the right to operate trains 1,500 miles or more between tests is a low power brake system defect
ratio on trains inspected by FRA immediately after they have been declared ready for departure by the railroad. This
power brake defect ratio will be calculated by FRA on a quarterly basis as defined in &sect;232.5 (e.g., January 1 to
March 31; April 1 to June 30; etc.). The power brake defect ratio for a particular railroad will be calculated by dividing
the total number of cars found to have power brake defects, as defined in &sect;232.5, by the total number of cars inspected.
FRA estimates that it will take no more than 30 days from the end of any quarter for FRA to assemble and calculate these
defect ratios. Consequently, any limitation on a railroad's ability to operate trains for extended distances, due
to a high defect ratio in a quarter, will not begin until 30 days after the completion of any quarter and will continue
until 30 days after the completion of a quarter in which the railroad has a defect ratio below the prescribed limit.
FRA intends that any restriction on a railroad's ability to operate trains for extended distances only continue until
that railroad can establish a quarterly defect ratio that falls below the prescribed limit. For example, the defect
ratios for the quarter ending on March 31 will not be available until April 30, and thus, any restriction on train movement,
due to a high defect ratio for that quarter, will begin on April 30 and will only apply until July 30 (30 days after the
completion of the quarter ending June 30), if the railroad improves its defect ratio so that it falls below the prescribed
limit during the quarter ending June 30. FRA recognizes the difficulty of drafting enforceable performance-based
standards and realizes that there may be problems connected with this proposed standard which are not immediately
discernable. Consequently, FRA requests comments or advice from interested parties regarding the implementation
or enforcement of this proposed requirement. The 1992 power brake defect ratios for five major railroads are contained
in Graph 1 below.

Other extremely important proposed conditions are that the Class 1 brake test must be performed by a qualified mechanical
or electronic brake system inspector and that a pre-departure freight car safety inspection in accordance with &sect;215.13(b)
must be performed by inspectors meeting the qualifications contained in &sect;215.11. As the distance a train is
allowed to travel increases, the mechanical condition of the equipment is a key factor in ensuring the proper and safe
operation of the train brake system throughout the entire trip. FRA would also require that a record of all brake tests
performed on the train be available to the crew, that frequent spot checks of Class 1 tests are conducted by a qualified
supervisor, and that the railroad have a quality single car test program in place. Furthermore, trains traveling
up to 1,500 miles might add only one block of previously tested cars. The purpose of all these requirements is to ensure
that trains being allowed to operate longer distances are part of proven safety-conscious operation and are in the
best condition possible, from a safety standpoint, prior to departure from their originating terminals.

FRA would offer additional incentive by proposing to allow freight trains to travel up to 2,500 miles between brake
system tests if all the conditions for travelling 1,500 miles between tests are met and the configuration of the train
remains unchanged except for setting out defective cars or changing motive power. As an incentive to encourage the
continued development of improved train brake system technology, FRA proposes to permit trains to travel up to 3,500
miles between train brake system tests if those trains meet all the conditions required of 2,500-mile trains and they
are equipped with the type of new technology or its equivalent described in paragraph (d) of this section.

FRA believes these new and inevitably controversial proposals offer a significant opportunity for railroads and
railroad labor organizations to cooperate to improve both the competitiveness and the safety of the industry. Railroad
employees will benefit from the better training and higher quality brake system inspection, testing, and maintenance
programs they commented were generally lacking in the industry. In addition, if railroads use this proposed flexibility
to become more competitive with other modes of transportation, railroad jobs will be preserved. Furthermore, railroads
will save costs and improve delivery times by the elimination of the 1000-mile inspection and the authorization of
railroads to operate trains longer distances between brake system tests. Other incidental benefits will include
better quality inspections for Freight Car Safety Standard defects. Finally, the public will benefit from better
freight service and improved safety.

Basically, FRA proposes to require the performance of a Class 2 brake test whenever a train changes configuration
that does not require the performance of a Class 1 brake test. This section also proposes to require that a Class 2 brake
test be performed on freight trains that provide repetitive service, such as unit coal trains, after each cycle of
that repetitive service. For purposes of this section, a cycle will be deemed completed when the train returns to the
point from which it started.

 This section proposes the required steps that make up a transfer train brake test. The proposed test requirements
for transfer trains are no different from what is currently required; however, new definitions, in &sect;232.5,
would exclude ``yard trains'' from the definition of ``transfer trains.'' ``Yard train'' would be clearly defined
in proposed &sect;232.5 as a train that only performs switching functions within a single yard complex. Movement
by ``yard trains'' would not require a transfer train air brake test. ``Transfer train'' is defined in &sect;232.5
as a train that travels between a point of origin and a point of destination without intermediate switching. FRA's
determination of whether the movement of cars is a ``train movement,'' subject to the requirements of this section,
or a ``switching movement'' is and will be based on the voluminous case law developed by various courts of the United
States.

FRA's general rule of thumb as to whether a trip constitutes a ``train movement'' requires five or more cars traveling
a distance of at least one mile without a stop to set off or pick up a car and not moving for the purpose of assembling or
disassembling a train. However, FRA may consider movements of less than one mile ``train movements'' if various circumstances
exist. In determining whether a particular movement constitutes a ``train movement,'' FRA conducts a multi-factor
analysis based upon the discussions contained in various court decisions on the subject.

, 249 U.S. 543 (1919). The following factors are taken into consideration by FRA: the purpose of the movement; the distance
travelled without a stop to set out or pick up cars; the number of cars hauled; and the hazards associated with the particular
route travelled (e.g., the existence of public or private crossings with or without crossing protection, the steepness
of the grade, the existence of curves, any other conditions that minimize the locomotive engineer's sight distance,
and any other conditions that may create a greater need for power brakes during the movement). The existence of any
of these hazards would tend to weigh towards the finding of a ``train movement,'' since these are the types of hazards
against which the power brake provisions of the Safety Appliance Acts were designed to give protection.

 This section involves the performance of running tests on trains equipped with dynamic brakes. As discussed earlier,
although FRA does not feel that dynamic brakes should be required, FRA does feel that if the devices are present the
engineer should be informed of their status. In addition, every commenter stated that in order to completely test
dynamic brakes the train must be moving. Consequently, in order to provide the engineer with as much information as
possible on the performance of dynamic brakes, FRA proposes to require that a running test of the dynamic brake be made
when the speed of the train permits on those trains equipped with dynamic brakes. FRA is aware that train handling considerations
may make this difficult or even impossible at certain locations and solicits comments on fashioning a fully practicable
requirement.

 This section proposes the requirements for performing train brake system tests using yard air, which are basically
unchanged from what is currently required. An important factor for maintaining the train brake system in proper condition
is the quality of the air used in charging the train. Since a large majority of train brake systems are charged and tested
from yard air plants, FRA feels that this air should be as free of contaminants as practical. One way to ensure this is
the use of air dryers in the yard system. Consequently, FRA proposes to require that all equipment used to produce yard
air after January 1, 1996 be equipped with air dryers. Furthermore, in order to ensure proper testing when using yard
air, FRA intends to require the periodic calibration of all yard test devices and gauges.

commuter, and excursion train brake system tests. The proposed requirements contained in this section are similar
to those contained in &sect;232.305 regarding conventional freight trains. Consequently, the discussion contained

 This section contains general requirements regarding Class 1 brake tests on conventional passenger trains. Since
these types of trains are responsible for hauling large numbers of members of the general public and because the brake
systems used in these operations tend to be more complex than those used in conventional freight trains, FRA proposes
to require that all Class 1 brake tests on conventional passenger trains be conducted by qualified brake system inspectors.
Consequently, unlike conventional freight trains, brake system tests on passenger trains shall not be conducted
by qualified crew members. FRA intends that a Class 1 brake test be conducted on all conventional passenger trains
prior to departure from an initial terminal point.

 This section outlines the tasks comprising a Class 1 train brake test for conventional passenger trains. Many of the
tasks required in this section are identical to those required for conventional freight trains (see &sect;232.309).
However, FRA has eliminated the air flow method as an alternative method of qualifying brake systems on passenger
and commuter trains. Due to the short length of passenger and commuter trains, the use of the air flow method would allow
these trains to operate with excessive brake pipe leakage. Furthermore, in order to bring the regulation into line
with current industry practice, FRA proposes to require that the minimum rear-car pressure for passenger trains
be increased from 70 psi to 85 psi. In addition, FRA will require that a pre-departure mechanical inspection equivalent
to the freight car inspection required by &sect;215.13(b) of this chapter be performed by qualified inspectors.
As trains are permitted to travel longer distances between brake system tests, FRA believes that the mechanical condition
of a train plays a major role in ensuring that the brake system on a train remains in safe working condition for the entire
distance travelled. FRA also believes that these mechanical inspections are necessary to ensure that these trains,
which are responsible for the movement of large numbers of people, are in quality condition, from a safety standpoint,
prior to departing an initial terminal point.

 This section contains the general requirements regarding the performance of single passenger car or single passenger
train set tests. FRA proposes to eliminate the periodic ``clean, oil, test and stencil'' (COT&amp;S) requirement
for passenger-type brake equipment as was done with freight brakes in 1992. In its stead, FRA proposes that a periodic
single car test be performed no less frequently than every six months. FRA also proposes that a single car test be performed
when certain wheel or brake equipment is removed, repaired, or replaced. The details of these tests will be further
developed in the discussion of the proposed single car testing requirements contained in subpart G. Several passenger
and commuter railroads requested that FRA do away with the time-based COT&amp;S requirement and suggested that in
its place a single car test be required each time a car is on the repair track or each time a car comes in for preventive
maintenance, which they stated was about every 120 days. The proposed single car test requirements are based not only
on those recommendations, but also upon the belief of the industry and FRA that the single car test is a much better and
more comprehensive method of detecting and eliminating defective brake equipment and components than the time-based
COT&amp;S requirement. The various individual tests that FRA proposes as part of any single passenger car test are
derived directly from the current AAR manual covering the performance of single car tests on passenger cars. FRA expects
that operators of passenger cars will establish a preventive maintenance program for the brake equipment that will
coincide with other scheduled maintenance.

 This section outlines the requirements for performing Class 1 brake system tests on repetitive conventional passenger
and commuter trains. FRA recognizes the unique characteristics of some commuter and passenger trains that repeat
the same trip several times a day without breaking up the consist. Because the trains in these types of operations are
not broken up and remain connected to an air supply continuously, it is highly unlikely that their air brake equipment
would deteriorate beyond Federal requirements in one day if they were in safe and proper working order at the beginning
of the day. Therefore, FRA proposes to require that conventional passenger and commuter trains that repeat the same
trip more than once a day need only be required to have an initial terminal brake test, performed by a qualified individual,
prior to the first departure of that train each calendar day. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA intends to require that Class 1 brake tests of repetitive conventional passenger and commuter trains include
requirements for inspection of the same components as those imposed on conventional passenger trains in &sect;232.407.
FRA agrees with the assertions of several commenters that the current power brake regulations do not address the inspection
of MU equipment. FRA also recognizes that many of the trains covered by this section are operated with MU equipment.
Consequently, in order to provide inspection guidance for this type of equipment, FRA proposes specific tasks that
must be performed on the brake systems of MU equipment as part of the Class 1 brake test.

However, this section does contain requirements regarding the performance of Class 2 brake tests on MU equipment.

 This section contains the requirements for performing Class 1 train brake system tests on excursion trains. Although
FRA recognizes the unique operations in which these trains are used and the often limited resources of those operations,
FRA feels that the performance of a Class 1 brake test is necessary for any type of train service to ensure the safe operation
of trains. Consequently, FRA intends to require that Class 1 brake tests on excursion trains include the requirements
applicable to conventional passenger trains contained at &sect;232.407. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA recognizes that some tourist and excursion train operations do not have the resources to obtain personnel with
the qualifications of those employed by passenger and freight railroads. FRA also acknowledges that these trains
do not travel at the speeds or the distances that are maintained by conventional passenger or commuter trains. Thus,
FRA does not intend to impose the minimum personnel qualification requirements contained at subpart C of these proposed
regulations on excursion train operations. However, because the personnel qualification requirements will not
be applicable to these trains and due to the age of the equipment generally operated in these types of trains, FRA proposes
to require that excursion trains not be operated in excess of 30 mph and that such trains receive a Class 1 brake inspection
at least every 250 miles. If a tourist, excursion, or scenic railroad intends to operate its trains in excess of 30 mph,
then those trains will be required to follow all the proposed regulations applicable to conventional passenger trains.

This subpart proposes that railroads be given the flexibility to develop the inspection and test standards for intermediate
speed and high speed trains. These could be performance-based standards that serve the same purpose and provide equivalent
assurance that the brake system will function as intended as the conventional train standards. These standards must
take into account the increased risk of operating trains at higher speeds.

Sections 232.501 through 232.507 contain general requirements for the performance of Class 1 and Class 2 brake tests,
as well as running tests and single car tests. These sections would apply to freight and passenger trains that exceed
79 mph. FRA recognizes that at this time there are a number of passenger and commuter trains that operate at speeds over
79 mph, and up to 125 mph. These types of operations currently employ braking equipment that can be sufficiently regulated
by the proposed standards applicable to conventional passenger trains. Furthermore, neither the industry nor FRA
foresees a significant change in the type of braking technology used by these operations within the next few years.
Consequently, FRA proposes to require that intermediate speed passenger and commuter equipment that entered service
prior to January 1, 1995 adhere to the brake inspection and test standards applicable to conventional passenger contained
at &sect;&sect;232.403 through 232.411. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA also recognizes that presently there are no freight trains operating over 79 mph and that there are very few passenger
or commuter trains currently operating in excess of 125 mph. FRA realizes that the braking systems needed for these
types of operations will most likely require the development of new types of braking systems that are currently unknown
or are merely in the developmental stages at this point. FRA is also aware that advanced braking systems are being developed
for high speed passenger and commuter trains. Thus, in order to allow for the development of this new technology and
ensure its safe operation, FRA proposes to require that railroads that operate either intermediate speed freight
trains, intermediate speed passenger or commuter trains in service after January 1, 1995, or high speed passenger
or commuter trains develop train brake system tests and inspections tailored to the specific technology employed.

Subpart G 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This subpart contains the provisions covering the requirements for the performance of single car tests, periodic
freight brake tests, and single passenger train set tests. As stated earlier, FRA believes that the new repair track
test and single car test, which have been used industry-wide since January of 1992, are a much better and more comprehensive
method of detecting and eliminating defective brake equipment and components than the old, time-based COT&amp;S
requirements. FRA believes that performance of these tests will significantly reduce the number of defective components
currently found and will dramatically increase the reliability of brake equipment. Thus, use of the repair track
and single car tests will greatly improve the safety of both railroad employees and the public since brake equipment
will be in better and safer condition. However, in order to fully benefit from the advantages of these tests, cars must
receive the tests. Several labor commenters admitted that the new tests were very valuable, but stated that the tests
were being circumvented by the railroads. Therefore, in order to ensure that all cars receive the new repair track
test or single car test, FRA proposes to require the performance of the test on any car that receives repairs for various
wheel or brake equipment problems, but in any event, at set intervals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the near future, specialized passenger train sets that have been designed to operate for long periods of time as
a single unit are likely to come into operation. Examples include the X&hyph;2000 and Inter-City Express train sets.
FRA intends to allow railroads operating such train sets the flexibility to develop a single passenger-train-set
test that is equivalent to the single car test, but that allows the train set to be tested as a unit rather than as individual
cars.

test plans and to ensure that employees are provided sufficient guidance for the performance of these tests, FRA intends
to require that railroads develop written, detailed step-by-step procedures for performing these tests. FRA believes
that these written procedures can be an invaluable training tool and can serve as a check list for supervisory personnel
performing spot checks.

Section 232.603.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This section contains a reference to the tasks required in performing these tests. For freight cars, FRA would require
the ``periodic freight brake test'' on a time-based schedule and for deficiencies in certain peripheral brake components.
A ``freight single car test'' is required for certain wheel defects and when brake control valve portions are replaced.
The ``periodic freight brake test'' is essentially what the industry currently refers to as a ``repair track brake
test.'' Periodic freight brake tests would be performed in accordance with AAR Standard S&hyph;486, Section 3.0,
contained in AAR's ``Manual of Standards and Recommended Practices'' as revised in November of 1992. Freight single
car tests would be performed in accordance with AAR Standard S&hyph;486, Section 4.0, contained in the same manual.
For passenger cars, the standard passenger car single car test would be performed in accordance with AAR Standard
S&hyph;044, contained in AAR's ``Instruction Pamphlet No. 5039&hyph;4, Supp. 3'' as revised in April of 1991. FRA
will incorporate these AAR rules as revised on the dates previously specified into the federal rule.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section provides the instances when unscheduled freight or passenger single car tests, periodic freight brake
tests, or single passenger train set tests would be required. FRA proposes to require the performance of an unscheduled
single car test or periodic freight brake test based upon the type of wheel defect involved or the piece of braking equipment
that is removed, repaired, or replaced. FRA has included certain wheel defects as a basis for performing a single car
test because FRA feels that these wheel defects are indicative of some type of braking equipment problem. FRA's rationale
for changing the current standard, requiring a single car test whenever a car is sent to the ``repair track'' for a brake
problem, is that many railroads are avoiding single car tests by calling repair tracks something other than repair
tracks. Consequently, FRA is attempting to close this loophole by basing the requirement to perform the single car
test on the type of defect involved rather than where the defect is repaired. FRA feels that these proposed requirements
will have little or no impact on railroad operations. Although these proposed requirements may increase the number
of single car tests being performed, FRA believes that such an increase will be due to the elimination of the loophole
used by railroads to avoid the performance of single car tests which should be performed even under the current requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 232.607. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section contains the requirements for the performance of scheduled periodic freight brake tests and single
car tests. Under the current scheme for doing repair track or single car tests on freight cars, an individual car can
conceivably go indefinitely without receiving either test. In order to increase the quality of equipment by ensuring
that cars are not used for extended periods without receiving the benefits of these tests, FRA proposes to require
``periodic freight brake tests'' on a timely basis. For freight equipment, this periodic basis will be once every
two years for conventional equipment and once every year for high utilization equipment. The performance of an ``unscheduled
single car test'' will set the clock back to zero for that piece of equipment. Thus, if a car receives a freight single
car test due to having part of its brake equipment removed, repaired, or replaced, that car will not be due for ``periodic
freight brake test'' for two years from that date. The AAR and several of its member railroads estimated that a freight
car currently receives a repair track air brake test or single car test on the average of 1.7 times a year. The proposed
change to require periodically scheduled freight brake tests will not change this average, it will only ensure that
some small number of cars do not continue in service for extended periods of time without receiving a test. Consequently,
FRA predicts that the impact on freight railroad operation will be minimal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA also proposes to require a single car test on equipment used in conventional passenger and commuter trains at least
once every six months. The required interval is reduced to once every four months for equipment used in intermediate
speed trains and to once every three months for equipment used in high speed trains. The interval is reduced as train
speed increases because of the heavier wear and duty cycle imposed on the brake system as train speed increases. FRA
intends for the periodic single car test to replace various COT&amp;S requirements that currently exist for passenger
and commuter equipment. Several passenger and commuter railroads recommended some type of periodic testing in lieu
of the current periodic COT&amp;S, suggesting, in particular, periodic single car tests every 120 days. FRA believes
that the proposed requirement for frequent, comprehensive single car tests will detect and cause to be corrected
the same type of brake system problems that the current COT&amp;S program is designed to prevent. However, due to the
very long COT&amp;S cycles, the periodic single car tests should detect the problems earlier than the current COT&amp;S
program. Replacing COT&amp;S with periodic single car tests has the potential of saving passenger and commuter railroads
a significant amount in operating expenses. Furthermore, the proposed required single car test intervals are not
radically different from what is now the voluntary policy of many passenger and commuter railroads.

This section outlines the requirements regarding the phase-in period for performing ``periodic freight brake tests''
and single car tests. FRA intends to allow a phase-in period for the requirement to perform periodic repair track air
brake tests. The proposed phase-in periods are two years for non-high utilization freight equipment and one year
for high utilization freight and for passenger and commuter equipment. The phase-in period should allow railroads
time to establish an effective and efficient program and to conduct the first required test on each piece of equipment
in their inventory.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section contains the general requirements for changing the required intervals for performing periodic freight
brake tests and single car tests. FRA proposes a statistical process which will allow railroads or other interested
parties a means to justify a change in the period of time between required periodic freight brake tests or single car
tests. FRA intends to provide an incentive for railroads to develop a test, inspection, and maintenance program for
brake systems that keeps failure rates of the periodic freight brake test or single car test below a target value. The
incentive provides a method for increasing the allowable time between required periodic freight brake tests or single
car tests based on a statistical analysis that shows the measured test failure rate for scheduled tests is below the
target value. FRA intends for this statistical analysis to be a two-way process. This means that if the analysis shows
that the target failure rate is being exceeded, the railroad will be required to reduce the time between periodic freight
brake tests or single car tests by the increment of change. Railroads may start to use this statistical process one
year after the phase-in period for required periodic repair track air brake test is completed. Railroads may apply
this process to only their own equipment, or groups of railroads may team and apply the methodology to a larger population.
Appendix B of this proposed rule and the discussion relevant to that appendix provide a more detailed analysis of the
statistical analysis and provide examples of how the method will be applied.

This section contains the qualification requirements for inspectors performing periodic freight brake tests,
single car tests, or single passenger train brake tests. The periodic freight brake test and single car test will become
the main quality control tool to indicate whether brake system repairs to a single car have been made correctly. In
addition, these tests are designed to keep the power brake defect ratio of equipment acceptably low. Consequently,
FRA feels that since these tests are safety-critical they should be performed only by qualified train brake system
inspectors and should be spot checked by qualified train brake system supervisors.

This section contains the recordkeeping and stencilling requirements related to periodic freight brake tests and

brake and single car test programs meet the requirements stated in this subpart. FRA believes that this documentation
should include (i) a certification that the periodic freight brake and single car tests were done by a qualified inspector,
(ii) a certified description of the repairs made to get the car to pass the test, and (iii) a certification that all the
required steps of the appropriate test were completed and that the equipment performed correctly during each step
of the test. Railroads opting to use the statistical process described in &sect;232.611 will need to keep adequate
records of their testing programs in order to obtain the information necessary for completion of the statistical
analysis of the failure rates.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed subpart contains general requirements regarding the development of train brake system maintenance
standards. In &sect;232.701, FRA proposes to require railroads to develop written maintenance procedures for each
of the types of train brake systems operated by that railroad. The purpose of requiring these written procedures is
to force railroads to carefully think through the maintenance process, with an emphasis on those steps that are safety-critical.
FRA feels that these written procedures should be very valuable, both as a training tool to qualify new train brake
system inspectors and as a check list for supervisors performing spot checks of train brake system maintenance work.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA intends for the written procedures to become the railroad's policy for good train brake system maintenance practice.
FRA expects the railroads to follow their written procedures, but FRA will actively enforce only those procedures
identified by the railroad as safety-critical. FRA believes that proper train brake system maintenance is crucial
to overall railroad operating safety. FRA contends that the single most important factor in achieving a quality brake
system maintenance program is the knowledge and skills of the people performing the maintenance. For this reason,
FRA intends to require that all train brake system maintenance work be performed by qualified train brake system inspectors.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA also proposes to require that railroads wishing to use new train brake system technology develop a maintenance
plan that describes how the new system will be inspected, tested, and maintained. Similarly, the purpose of this proposal
is to require a railroad to carefully think through the safety ramifications that the introduction of the new technology
will cause. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA further proposes that these written maintenance procedures be enforced for brake system test, inspection, and
maintenance work performed by contract employees not employed by railroads. FRA will consider the railroad that
contracts out brake system work to be responsible for ensuring that the contractor performs the work in accordance
with the procedures developed by the railroad. FRA recommends that a railroad include their maintenance procedures
in the statement of work for the contractor and closely monitor the performance of the contractor to be sure that the
procedures are followed by the contractor.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed subpart contains operating requirements for train brake systems. Unless otherwise noted, this subpart
is applicable to all trains. Section 232.801 provides a general requirement that railroads develop written, detailed
operating requirements governing the safe operation of train brake systems over their rail lines under all operating
conditions. FRA believes that the development of written standard operating requirements forces a railroad to analyze
the safety impacts of the various ways to handle potentially dangerous situations. For the most part, these operating
requirements formalize what is already being practiced by most railroads. FRA believes that the forethought required
to develop these procedures will preempt many mistakes that cause dangerous situations to occur.

Section 232.803. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section contains the operating requirements for the handling of train information. The purpose of these train-information
handling requirements is to ensure that train crews are given accurate information on the condition of the train brake
system and other factors that affect the performance of the train brake system when they assume responsibility for
the train. This section contains a list of the specific information FRA proposes to require railroads to furnish train
crew members about the train's brake system as they take over the train. FRA believes that train crews need this information
in order to avoid potentially dangerous train handling situations and to be able to comply with various Federal safety
standards. Some of these proposed requirements require railroads to inform the train crew of the operational status
of all dynamic brakes. Although FRA will not require dynamic brakes to be functional on a conventional train equipped
with them, FRA does intend that the train crew be informed at the time they take over the train as to the amount of operational
dynamic brakes they have at that point. Railroads will also be required to provide an estimate of the total retarding
force available from dynamic brakes in five-mph increments for the speed range of the train. Consequently, if only
fifty percent of the dynamic brakes are operational on a train at the time a crew takes over the train, then the train
crew should be given a close estimate of the retarding force available from those fifty percent operational dynamic
brakes in five-mph increments. FRA recognizes that railroads will need some time to develop a system for calculating
this information, and, thus, FRA proposes not to require the conveyance of this information until January 1, 1995.
As with all the requirements in this section, FRA has left the method in which railroads will convey the required information
to the train crews since FRA feels that each individual railroad is in the best position to determine the method in which
to dispense the required information based on the individual characteristics of its operations. However, the means
for conveying the required information will be part of the written operating requirements, and railroads will be
require to follow their own requirements.

Section 232.805. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section contains the operating requirements for monitoring train brake systems. FRA proposes to require that
railroads develop written operating requirements for monitoring the performance of the train brake system while
the train is en route. This section lists several specific monitoring activities that should be included in these
procedures. As brake system sensor technology continues to improve, many more en route monitoring capabilities
will become available to railroads. Procedures need to be developed to take maximum advantage of the ability of this
technology to improve train safety. Close attention to the en route condition of the train brake will allow the train
crew to take action to mitigate the effects of train brake system failures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a)(1) of this section requires an engineer to monitor the air flow rate on locomotives equipped with air
flow indicators. As stated earlier, FRA encourages the use of air flow indicators on all locomotives as a means of providing
additional information regarding the brake system to the train crews. Although FRA is not mandating the use of air
flow indicators in this proposed rule, FRA reserves the right to reconsider the issue when drafting the final rule.
Consequently, FRA requests comments on the costs and benefits of requiring air flow indicators on all locomotives,
especially new or rebuilt locomotives.

This section outlines the operating requirements for air brakes. This section contains general requirements regarding
the setting and releasing of handbrakes prior to releasing the air brake and after the air brake is charged. This section
also imposes on railroads the responsibility for determining maximum air brake system working pressure and maximum
brake pipe pressure. FRA plans to continue to allow individual railroads the wide latitude currently permitted in
determining these pressures.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section details the operating requirements for trains equipped with tread brakes. The intent of these operating
requirements is to minimize the potential for thermal damage to wheels due to continuous or drag braking to counter
the acceleration due to gravity when a train descends a grade. A second set of operating requirements for tread brakes
is given for non-emergency stop braking. These requirements should keep the thermal stresses in wheels caused by
frequent stop-and-start cycles typical of commuter operations below the threshold for the development of thermal
cracks that lead to wheel failure. The maximum average brake horsepower limits were determined by research done at
the Transportation System Center and are in general agreement with the guidelines provided by the AAR to its member
railroads.

Section 232.811. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section contains the operating requirements for trains equipped with dynamic brakes. The operating requirements
contained in this section attempt to address the controversy over the role of dynamic brakes in overall train safety.
Most railroads commented that dynamic brakes are a secondary system that plays no role in train safety. However, most
railroads admitted that dynamic brakes are an integral part of their safe train handling procedures. For the reasons
presented previously in the discussions of &sect;&sect;232.111 and 232.803, FRA does not plan to require dynamic
brakes on conventional trains, nor does FRA plan to require that the dynamic brakes be functional if a conventional
train is equipped with them. However, since railroads have become somewhat dependent on dynamic brakes for normal
train handling procedures, and this dependency gives rise to the likelihood of overreliance, FRA proposes to require
that railroads using dynamic brakes have written operating requirements governing how dynamic brakes are to be used
to safely handle trains under the operating conditions and over the territory covered by that railroad. These operating
requirements must sufficiently cover the loss of dynamic brakes or other non-friction brakes and must be fundamentally
based on the use of friction brakes to safely stop a train under all operating conditions. Consequently, the railroad,
in its operating requirements, can provide for the continuation of such trains to the next point where a Class 1 brake
is required after an en route failure of the dynamic brake or other non-friction brake component. Furthermore, as
explained earlier in the discussion of &sect;232.113, FRA proposes to require dynamic brakes on intermediate speed
and high speed trains due to the need for increased brake system retarding force as train speed increases.

Section 232.813. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section specifies which conventional freight trains are required to be operated with two-way EOT devices. Based
on Section 7 of the RSERA and after review of the comments received and the accidents relied on for support of the use
of two-way EOT devices, FRA proposes that the devices be required on trains that operate at speeds in excess of 30 mph
and on trains that operate in mountain grade territories. (A detailed discussion of mountain grade territory is contained
in the discussion of appendix C.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA proposes to except several types of trains from the requirements regarding the use of two-way EOT devices. In addition
to those trains specifically excluded in the statute, FRA believes that there are other operations that should also
be excepted. FRA recognizes that the safety reasons for requiring two-way EOT devices are less compelling in two types
of operations (i) freight trains having the ability to initiate a brake application from other than the front end and
(ii) trains equipped with fully independent secondary braking systems. In order to provide the industry with time
to acquire a sufficient number of two-way EOT devices and to ease the economic impact of acquiring the devices, FRA
proposes not to mandate compliance with any regulation requiring the use of two-way EOT devices until January 1, 1997.
This section also establishes the calibration and stenciling requirements for two-way EOT devices. FRA agrees with
several of the commenters that the 92-day calibration period currently required for one-way devices is outdated
and was established at a time when there was little experience with these types of devices. Since that time, FRA has
received no evidence indicating that the calibration of the devices is difficult to maintain. Furthermore, several
railroads attested to the reliability of the one-way and two-way devices, contending that the failure rates of the
devices are extremely low. Consequently, FRA proposes that two-way EOT devices be calibrated at least once a year.
In order to ensure timely calibration of these devices, the date the next calibration is due shall be marked on both
the front and rear units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the statutory mandate contained in &sect;7 of the RSERA, recodified at 49 U.S.C. 20141, and after consideration
of Congress' purpose in enacting the provisions contained in that section, FRA finds no safety or public interest
justification at this time to exclude any categories of trains or rail operations, other than those specifically
enumerated in this section, from the requirements regarding two-way EOT devices. Due to the clear statutory mandate
and because there is little data currently available regarding the operational and safety benefits specifically
attributable to two-way EOT devices, FRA has not provided any benefits to offset the cost of this provision in our cost/benefit
analysis. However, FRA is aware of several recent incidents that might have been avoided had the involved trains been
equipped with two-way EOT devices. Among these incidents are the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;On May 17, 1990, near Nampa, Idaho, a Union Pacific train was involved in a side collision, probably due to a crimped
train line hose, resulting in the retardation of the brake pipe pressure reduction and preventing an emergency brake
application throughout the train. The estimated damage of this incident was in excess of $130,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;On September 18, 1991, near Spague, Washington, a Burlington Northern train derailed, probably because a
trespasser closed an angle cock, causing interference with the air brake system. The derailment resulted in the release
of hazardous materials and the evacuation of four people from the area. Damages to railroad property were estimated
at over $3.8 million. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;On March 7, 1992, near Kansas City, Missouri, a Kansas City Southern train was involved in a railroad at grade
crossing accident, probably due to a closed angle cock on the trailing end of the first car in the train resulting in
inadequate braking ability. The incident resulted in the derailment of several locomotives and freight cars, and
damage was estimated at over $930,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;On October 1, 1993, near Keystone, Nebraska, a loaded Union Pacific coal train collided head on with an empty
Union Pacific coal train. The suspected cause of the incident was a closed angle cock at about the 15th car, which prevented
application of the brakes beyond that point. Property damage was estimated at over $2 million, and some members of
the crew sustained serious personal injuries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;On December 25, 1993, near Seward, Nebraska, a Burlington Northern train was involved in a rear-end collision
and the train's crewmen were forced to jump from the moving train. Subsequent investigation of the incident revealed
that the sixth car in the train had a kinked air hose and ice in the hose couplings. Property damage was estimated at over
$1.2 million. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The two most recent incidents cited above involved unit coal trains that encountered blockages in the brake pipe near
the front cars in the trains, resulting in an inability of the brakes to set from those cars to the rear of the train. Due
to these incidents both of the involved carriers are in the process of equipping their unit coal trains with two-way
EOT devices. In the incidents cited above, it appears that the actual damage incurred and the potential damage to life
and property might have been avoided had the trains involved been equipped with two-way EOT devices. Thus, FRA believes
some safety benefits may be achieved by mandating the use of these devices; however, FRA is not able to provide quantifiable
data regarding the safety benefits of the devices. Consequently, FRA requests comments and information from interested
parties regarding other recent incidents that might have been avoided if trains covered by this proposal were equipped
with two-way EOT devices. FRA also requests comments from interested parties detailing the quantitative and qualitative
safety and operational benefits derived from the use of two-way EOT devices.

Section 232.815. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section provides the operating requirements for dealing with en route failures of various train brake system
components. (It should be noted that in order to avoid civil penalty liability, a railroad must also comply with the
limitations stated in &sect;232.17.) The proposed general guiding principles for handling en route failures of
train brake system components are: (i) the railroad shall reduce the maximum operating speed of the train to the extent
necessary to safely compensate for the loss in available retarding force due to the en route failure and (ii) a train
shall not proceed beyond the next point where brake system repairs can be made to restore the full available brake system
retarding force if a train experiences an en route brake system failure that reduces the total available retarding
force. FRA feels adherence to these two general guiding principles will allow railroads to continue to move freight
and passengers safely when brake system failures occur.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA also proposes to require that railroads limit the speed of trains to 30 mph when an en route failure occurs to a two-way
EOT, or equivalent device, that would prevent that device from initiating a brake application from the rear of the
train. FRA's rationale for this limitation is that two-way EOT devices are not required on trains that travel less
than 30 mph. Thus, operating with a non-functional two-way EOT device is the same as not having a device; consequently,
trains operating with failed two-way EOT devices should be subjected to this same limitation. Furthermore, FRA feels
that the concerns raised by several railroads regarding train delays, missed deliveries, and safety are not justified.
The AAR as well as several railroads commented that these devices are very reliable and have an extremely low failure
rate. In addition, Canada currently requires a 30-mph speed limit for an en route failure of these devices, and no one
commented that this requirement has produced the problems raised by the railroads. Consequently, FRA believes that
the concerns of the railroads are outweighed by the potential harm to both the public and railroad employees caused
by trains being allowed to operate without the devices at speeds which Congress and FRA feel require the added safety
benefits provided by these devices.

Section 232.817.

This section contains the requirements for operating in the event of an undesired emergency brake application. FRA
believes that undesired emergency brake applications pose a safety hazard to both the public and railroad employees
that needs to be addressed. Therefore, FRA proposes to require that a train crew attempt to pinpoint the car causing
the undesired application and drop that car off at the next point where repairs can be made to that car's brake system.
FRA recognizes that identifying a car as source of an undesired emergency brake application is not always possible.

Section 232.819. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section contains the requirements for developing operating requirements for extreme meteorologic, topographic,
or other conditions. FRA recognizes that neither railroad or labor representatives supported the mandating of additional
testing in cold weather or in mountain grade territory. FRA agrees that the development and use of welded pipe fittings,
wide-lip hose couplings, and ferrule clamps have greatly reduced the effects of cold weather on the air brake system.
However, FRA believes that there are several extreme operating conditions that involve added safety risks and that
need to be further addressed by the railroads. These include cold weather and mountain territory operations as well
as the operation of long and heavy trains. Although FRA does not intend to mandate additional tests or procedures to
cover these extreme operating conditions, FRA does expect each railroad to develop detailed operating procedures
for these types of operations, tailored to the equipment and territory of that railroad. FRA believes that requiring
the development of written operating procedures will require railroads to go through the thought process necessary
to analyze their operations under these extreme conditions in order to determine the inherent safety hazards involved
and develop procedures to minimize these hazards.

Section 232.821. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section contains operating requirements specific to conventional freight trains. FRA proposes to prohibit
the use of ``feed valve braking,'' in which reductions and increases in the brake pipe pressure are affected by manually
adjusting the feed valve. ``Feed valve braking'' has been recognized by both the railroad industry and FRA as an unsafe
practice. Most railroads already have some type of operating rule prohibiting this type of braking. In addition,
FRA proposes to prohibit the use of the ``passenger'' position on the locomotive brake control stand on conventional
freight trains when the trailing equipment is not designed for graduated brake release. The ``passenger'' position
was intended only for use with equipment designed for graduated brake release. Consequently, use of the ``passenger''
position with other equipment can lead to potentially dangerous situations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA also proposes to prohibit ``bottling the air'' when detaching a locomotive from a train. This procedure involves
closing the angle cock on the standing cars after making a brake application. The purpose in doing so is to save air in
the brake pipe but can lead to an unintentional release of the brakes and a runaway. FRA will require that the brake pipe
be left open on standing cars.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 232.823. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section contains operating requirements specific to intermediate speed freight trains. FRA believes that
the operation of freight trains at speeds in excess of 79 mph will occur in the near future. Although these types of operations
do not yet exist, FRA feels that these proposed regulations are an appropriate context for FRA to establish some general
operating limitations for such operations. FRA proposes to require that an intermediate speed freight train be limited
to a maximum weight of 8,000 tons and a maximum length of 5,000 feet and be made up of zero-slack or limited-slack equipment.
FRA is proposing these limitations in order to counteract the increased safety risk assumed as the speed of a freight
train is increased. FRA would also like to implement specific train make-up requirements for intermediate speed
freight trains that minimize the potential for dangerous train handling situations created by the manner in which
the weight of the train is distributed along the length of the train. As there are no intermediate speed freight trains
currently in operation, FRA requests comments and suggestions from the industry regarding these proposed limitations
and any additional limitations or requirements that may be applicable to these types of trains.

This proposed subpart contains the tests and procedures required to introduce new train brake system technology
into revenue service. Several parties commented that the technology necessary for the introduction of advanced
braking systems is quickly developing. These new technologies include various forms of electronic braking systems,
a variety of braking sensors, and computer-controlled braking systems. In order to allow for and encourage the development
of new technology, FRA proposes guidelines regarding the tests and procedures required for introducing new brake
system technology. These proposed guidelines require the submission of design and test plans as well as subsequent
operational plans for the introduction of new technology. Parties will also be allowed to petition FRA to convert
some of the brake system design and maintenance requirements into performance-based standards to accommodate the
use of electronic braking systems. Comment is urgently sought as to means by which new technology may be qualified
and regulated without the delay normally associated with rulemaking.

system technology that comply with the statutory mandates contained in 49 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;20102, 20301&hyph;20304,

 This section details the requirements for pre-revenue service tests of new brake system technology. The purpose
of requiring pre-revenue service tests is to thoroughly demonstrate in a controlled fashion that new train brake
system technology is capable of operating safely in the railroad environment. FRA proposes to require an extensive
information-exchange and planning period to prepare for pre-revenue service tests of new train brake system technology.
FRA must have adequate information and lead time to determine that the proper safeguards are being taken to conduct
the tests safely. FRA must be assured the tests are designed to adequately and clearly demonstrate the technology
is capable of safe operation in the railroad environment. FRA intends to create a thorough and well documented planning
process that produces not only a plan for pre-revenue service tests, but also an inspection, test, and maintenance
program as well as training and qualification requirements for the new technology.

 This section contains the requirements for introducing new brake system technology into revenue service. Prior
to introducing new train brake system technology to revenue service, FRA proposes to require a thorough analysis
of the pre-revenue service test results. FRA also intends to require that railroads submit proposed performance
standards to serve as the basis of safety regulations for the new technology. FRA views this as a potentially effective
means to move toward the performance-based safety regulations that the industry desires but has been unable to achieve.
In addition, FRA proposes to require the development of detailed and well thought-out operating plans, training
and qualification programs, and inspection, test, and maintenance programs based on the lessons learned during
the pre-revenue service tests. FRA feels this formal process for the introduction of new train brake system technology
will help ensure any safety problems caused by the introduction of the new equipment are not serious.

 This section provides the requirements for following up on new brake system technology introduced into revenue service.
FRA believes that railroads should be required to carefully monitor the performance of new train brake system technology
for the first two years after its introduction to revenue service. The careful planning and caution required by the
process of testing prior to revenue service test and of later introducing the technology to revenue service may not
catch all the safety-related problems with new systems and equipment. Vigilance is required until adequate operating
experience is obtained.

This Appendix contains the proposed procedures for requesting a change in the required time interval for periodic
brake tests. As stated in the discussion of &sect;232.611, FRA proposes to provide an incentive for railroads to develop
quality programs for the test, inspection, and maintenance of brake systems that will keep the failure rate of periodic
freight brake tests and single car tests below a certain target value. The method for increasing the time between the
required tests will be based on a statistical analysis that establishes that the failure rate for these scheduled
tests is below a target value. The target average failure rates, the required confidence bands around these target
value rates, and the increment of change per statistical analysis period are contained in Table 1 below.

FRA has attempted to develop a valid statistical process that is simple and easy for railroads or other organizations
to use to justify a change in the time interval between required periodic freight brake tests for freight equipment
or between required single car tests for passenger or commuter equipment. To keep the process simple, an understanding
of the complex, rigorous statistics that were used to develop the periodic freight brake test or single car test versus
sample size charts given in Appendix B of the rule text is not necessary to use the charts. The rigorous statistical
treatment behind the development of these charts is given in a paper titled ``Statistical Analyses of Inspection
Interval and Quality Control Strategy'' published by the John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The methodology is designed to ensure that over time the measured periodic freight brake or single car test failure
rate approaches the target acceptable failure rate tied to the type of service being provided by the equipment with
a 95 percent degree of confidence. In theory, the better the brake test, inspection, and maintenance program, the
longer the time between required periodic brake tests can be extended. Three examples of how to apply this statistical
analysis follow.

A private car owner operates a fleet of 2,400 double stack cars. Due to the high mileage these cars accumulate each year,
they meet the definition of ``high utilization equipment.'' The private car owner has completed the phase-in period
for his fleet required by &sect;232.609. For a one-year period the private car owner keeps the records of his periodic
freight brake test program required by &sect;232.615 to use the statistical process to justify a change. During this
one-year period a total of 2,400 periodic freight brake tests are conducted, and a total of 133 failures of the freight
control valve to pass the periodic freight brake test are recorded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The failure rate is calculated as 133/2,400=.055. The failure rate of .055 versus the sample size of 2,400 is plotted

For this example, since the plotted failure rate versus sample size falls below the band of no change, the private car
owner would be allowed to increase the time between required periodic freight brake tests by two months, a change from
one year to fourteen months. This is approximately a 17% increase in the time between required tests.

A commuter railroad operates a fleet of 600 passenger cars in conventional service. This fleet of cars has completed
the phase-in period required by &sect;232.609. The commuter railroad keeps the single car test records required
by &sect;232.615 for a period of one year. Since initially conventional passenger equipment is required to receive
a single car test once every six months, the commuter railroad conducts a total of 1,200 scheduled, single car tests
during this period. During this period, the commuter railroad records a total of 48 failures of the brake control valve
or the relay valve to pass the passenger single car test. The test failure rate is calculated as 48/1,200=.040. The
failure rate versus sample size is plotted on Table B&hyph;3 of Appendix B to Part 232. This data is shown in Table 3.

A passenger railroad operates a fleet of 600 cars that are used in intermediate speed service. The phase-in period
required by &sect;232.609 has been completed for this fleet of cars. FRA becomes concerned over the quality of the
brake inspection, test, and maintenance program used by this railroad. As a result, FRA requires the railroad to keep
the records described in &sect;232.615 that are normally optional. FRA monitors the scheduled single car test program
for a period of one year. Since a single car test is required once every four months for cars used in intermediate speed
passenger service, 1,800 scheduled single car tests are conducted by the railroad resulting in 126 failures of the
brake control valve or the relay valve to pass the passenger car single car test. The test failure rate is calculated
as 126/1,800=.07. The failure rate of .07 versus the sample size of 1,800 is plotted on Table B&hyph;5 from Appendix
B to Part 232. This table with plotted results is given as Table 4.

Also included is a graph illustrating application of the definition. Several commenters provided various opinions
on how ``mountain grade territory'' should be defined. Most of these commenters suggested some type of formula based
on a variety of factors including train tonnage, speed, length of grade, percent of grade, and distance of grade. FRA
has developed an empirical relationship to define ``mountain grade territory'' based on train speed, percentage
of grade, and distance of grade. ``Mountain grade territory'' was selected to be an algebraic function of the square
of the grade because grade was determined to be a more important perameter than the distance over which the grade occurs.
The ratio of 30 mph divided by the actual velocity of the train was selected because 30 mph is the threshold speed for
requiring two-way EOT devices and this ratio makes the definition more stringent as the velocity of the train increases.
This relationship is squared because the kinetic energy of the train varies as the square of the velocities increases.
Thus, in actuality the relationship is really a ratio of kinetic energies as opposed to a ratio of velocities. The number
12 was selected because it yields a range of reasonable results for the definition.

This proposed rulemaking has been evaluated in accordance with existing regulatory policies and procedures and
is considered to be significant under DOT policies and procedures (44 FR 11304) because of Congressional and public
interest in promoting rail safety. Consequently, FRA has prepared a regulatory evaluation addressing the economic
impact of the proposed rule. The regulatory evaluation estimates the economic costs and consequences of this proposed
rule as well as its anticipated benefits and impacts. This regulatory evaluation has been placed in the docket and
is available for public inspection and copying during normal business hours in Room 8201, Office of Chief Counsel,
FRA, 400 Seventh Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20590. Copies may also be obtained by submitting a written request
to the FRA Docket Clerk at the above address. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule passes the benefit-to-cost test on the basis of industry cost savings alone. In terms of total costs
and benefits over twenty years (at a 7 percent discount rate for both), FRA estimates that the proposed rule will cost
approximately $1.13 billion while returning benefits of approximately $1.61 billion. Resulting in a benefit-to-cost
ratio to the industry of 1.42 to 1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For freight railroads and Amtrak, the benefits of the proposed rule significantly outweigh its estimated costs.
Shortline, commuter, and excursion railroads will see slightly higher net costs. However, the actual net costs to
many of these operations could be substantially less than that currently calculated by FRA since FRA did not fully
quantify the safety benefits obtained by this proposal, and because the figures used by FRA to calculate the costs
of the proposed single car testing requirements are very conservative. Furthermore, although the net costs to many
shortline operations may increase somewhat due to the fact that most of these types of operations are not able to take
advantage of the operational benefits created by this proposal, FRA feels that the integrated nature of the freight
industry requires that universally consistent requirements be imposed on shortline and Class I railroads as a group.
In some areas of the proposed rule, individual railroads are offered a choice between meeting higher standards and
thereby being allowed to reap major cost savings, or continuing current practices at current costs. The benefit-to-cost
numbers reflect an assumption that railroads, being economically rational, will choose the higher standards/lower
costs option.

Because this proposed rule passes the benefit-to-cost test on operational savings alone, FRA did not fully quantify
the savings that will accrue to the industry due to accidents/incidents that are prevented by the proposed rule. Although
FRA believes that the proposed rule will significantly enhance safety, it is very difficult to quantify that improvement.
However, FRA did develop a method by which such savings could be quantified. The method has been described in the Appendix
to the Regulatory Analysis, and FRA solicits comments and information from the industry on how to improve the method.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA searched the railroad accident/incident data base for the most recent five-year period. The search consisted
of sorting the data base by cause code using a set of causes judged to have high potential for at least some reduction
due to the provisions of the proposed rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

Although some of the causes are not directly related to the brake system. These causes were selected because they are
either an indication of a possible brake system problem or because a better trained brake system inspector (as required
by the proposed rule) conducting a more thorough mechanical and brake inspection (as required by the proposed rule)
should detect more problems with car components that are highly visible during brake system inspections (wheels
and bearings). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For each of these accident/incident causes, FRA used the collective judgment of experienced individuals to estimate
the fraction that would be prevented by the proposed rule. For example, requiring air dryers will reduce the incident
of brake pipe blockage due to ice. Thus, some percentage of the obstructed brake pipe incidents will be prevented.
The percentage estimates ranged from 10 percent to 50 percent, with an average of about 20 percent. A detailed discussion
of this method and its application has been included in the Appendix to the Regulatory Analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its effort to estimate the cost savings that would be produced by an avoidance of a percentage of these accidents/incidents,
FRA's analysis of the accident/incident costs has been limited to data supplied by the industry. The accident/incident
information supplied by the industry under the heading, ``railroad property damage,'' does not include costs such
as wreck clearance, damage to lading, train delay, emergency response, environmental clean-up, or other associated
costs which may be very substantial in some accidents. To the extent that these additional costs are relevant, the
benefits of this proposed rule may be underestimated. Consequently, FRA encourages commenters to provide any information
that they have as to the extent of FRA's underestimation in this analysis, and any suggestions they may have for capturing,
or estimating, the full costs of these accidents/incidents.

) requires a review of proposed rules to assess their impact on small entities. In reviewing the economic impact of
the rule, FRA concluded that it will have a minimal economic impact on small entities. There are no direct or indirect
economic impacts for small units of government, businesses, or other organizations; therefore, it is certified
that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the provisions

This proposed rule contains proposed information collection requirements. Because the policy of the Federal Government
is to minimize the regulatory record keeping burden placed on private industry, a separate analysis of the record
keeping burden resulting from the proposed regulations was performed. The new rules were designed to require only
records that are good business practice that have value to the railroads beyond merely meeting Federal requirements.
Although FRA recognizes that the proposed rules impose a significant record keeping burden on the industry, FRA believes
that the written procedures and record keeping requirements are an integral part of this proposal and are necessary
to its overall effectiveness. FRA feels that it would be impossible to reduce or eliminate any of the proposed written
procedures or record keeping requirements without seriously undermining the entire approach taken by FRA in developing
these proposed rules. Most of the records required are a form of, or supplement to, what is now being kept by the railroads
voluntarily for their own purposes. Many of the requirements to keep records are optional, but are necessary to take
advantage of the financial incentives offered by the new rules.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The analysis of the cost impact done by FRA includes a recommendation for the industry to develop an industry-wide
standard system for record keeping and data reporting. Such a system could provide significant competitive advantages
for the industry, including more efficient utilization of equipment, better knowledge of location of equipment
and freight, more efficient deployment of mechanical forces, more accurate and timely equipment trouble reporting,
and more accurate and timely interchange accounting as well as reducing the cost of regulatory record keeping. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA will submit these information collection requirements to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for approval
under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) All cars added to a train that have not had a Class 1 test as a block or have been disconnected from a charging device
(a source of compressed air) for more than four hours shall be subjected to a Class 1 test when added to the train. A Class
2 test shall then be performed on the entire new train. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The following criteria shall be used to determine when the next new Class 1 test is required for a train: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If a railroad does not maintain adequate records to determine the most stringent criteria that apply to a train,
the train shall not travel more than 500 miles between required Class 1 tests. To be ``adequate,'' these records shall
include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) When and where each block of cars is added to the train.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) A railroad shall develop, implement, and make available to FRA upon request written procedures requiring its
engineers to monitor the performance of the train brake system enroute. At a minimum, the engineer shall: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) On trains equipped with an air flow indicator or a two-way end-of-train device, frequently monitor the brake pipe
pressure gradient, the air flow rate to the brake pipe and the response of the rear car to service brake applications.
If unusual changes occur, the engineer shall investigate the cause. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) On trains equipped with dynamic brakes, monitor the amperage produced or any other indicators of dynamic brake
performance when the dynamic brake is applied. If the amperage produced indicates a less than fully functional dynamic
brake, the engineer shall use appropriate train handling procedures that compensate for the reduced dynamic brake
performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) On trains equipped with wheel-temperature sensors, brake application force sensors, brake pad/shoe thickness
sensors, or other technology that monitors performance of the train brake system, the output of the sensors shall
be displayed in the cab of the controlling locomotive and monitored by the engineer. If the sensors detect a train brake
system problem, the engineer shall take the corrective action required in the railroad's written procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Any problems uncovered by train brake system monitoring shall be reported by the train information handling procedures
described in &sect;232.803.

(5) 1% for high speed passenger equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Procedure.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The following procedure shall be used to perform a statistical analysis to justify a change in the time interval between
required periodic freight brake tests or single car tests of an equipment population: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Define the population to which the analysis applies and notify the FRA in writing of the intent to request a change
in the time interval between required tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The phase in period required by &sect;232.609 shall be completed for the population selected for analysis before
the sampling period starts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The records of the results of required scheduled single car tests or required scheduled periodic freight brake
tests described in &sect;232.615(a) shall be kept. The results of unscheduled tests shall not be included in the analysis.
These records shall be kept for the following minimum sampling period: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Two years for populations of non-high utilization freight equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) One year for high utilization freight equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Six months for all other types of equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) At the end of the sampling period, the total sample size (total number of units tested) and the total number of test
failures (total number of units that failed the periodic freight brake test or single car test) shall be determined.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The failure rate for the sample shall be determined by dividing the total number of units failing the test by the
total number of units tested. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The failure rate versus sample size shall be plotted on one of the following charts: (these charts ensure the required
95% confidence level is achieved) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Chart B&hyph;1 for non-high utilization conventional freight equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Chart B&hyph;2 for high utilization freight equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Chart B&hyph;3 for conventional passenger or commuter equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Chart B&hyph;4 for intermediate speed freight equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Chart B&hyph;5 for intermediate speed passenger or commuter equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Chart B&hyph;6 for high speed passenger equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Determination of New Required Test Interval.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The following method shall be used to determine the new required test interval for the selected population: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The party requesting the change shall submit a summary of the testing and sampling program including the appropriate
completed chart from Part 232 Appendix B (b)(6). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The FRA shall review the summary to determine: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The correct method was used; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The sample was truly random or the entire population was used as the sample; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(iii) The sample size was large enough; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The sample time was sufficient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If the submitted statistical analysis meets the requirements of Part 232 Appendix B (c)(2), the FRA shall determine
it to be valid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) If the plotted result of the valid statistical analysis falls on or between the limits of the control band on the
appropriate chart given in paragraph (b)(6) of this appendix, the time between required periodic freight brake or
single car tests shall remain unchanged for that population of equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) If the plotted result of the valid statistical analysis falls below the control band on the appropriate chart given
in paragraph (b)(6) of this appendix, the time between required periodic freight brake or single car tests for that
population of equipment shall be increased by the following amounts without further rulemaking: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) 3 months for non-high utilization equipment used in conventional freight trains. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 2 months for high utilization equipment used in conventional freight trains. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) 1 month for equipment used in intermediate speed freight trains. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) 1 month for equipment used in conventional passenger or commuter trains. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) 1 month for equipment used in intermediate speed passenger or commuter trains. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) 1 month for equipment used in high speed passenger trains. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) If the plotted result of the valid statistical analysis falls above the control band on the appropriate chart given
in paragraph (b)(6) of this appendix, the time between required periodic freight brake or single car tests for that
population of equipment shall be decreased by the following amounts: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) 3 months for non-high utilization equipment used in conventional freight trains. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 2 months for high utilization equipment used in conventional freight trains.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice proposes to revise the gust load design requirements for transport category airplanes. The proposed
changes would: (1) replace the current discrete gust requirement with a new requirement for a discrete tuned gust;
(2) modify the method of establishing the design airspeed for maximum gust intensity; and (3) provide for an operational
rough air speed. These changes are proposed in order to provide a more rational basis to account for the aerodynamic
and structural dynamic characteristics of the airplane. These proposed changes would also provide for harmonization
of the discrete gust requirements with the Joint Aviation Requirements (JAR) of Europe as recently amended.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), the predecessor of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA), began an inflight gust measurement program in 1933 to assist in the refinement of gust load design criteria.
Using unsophisticated analog equipment, that program resulted in the development of the improved design requirements
for gust loads that were issued in part 04 of the Civil Aeronautics Regulations (CAR) in the 1940's. The corresponding
Civil Aeronautics Manual (CAM) 04 provided a simplified formula from which to derive the design gust loads from the
specified design gust velocities. These criteria were based on an analytical encounter of the airplane with a discrete
ramp-shaped gust with a gradient distance (the distance necessary for the gust to build to a peak) of 10 times the mean
chord length of the airplane wing. An alleviation factor, calculated from wing loading, was provided in order to account
for the relieving effects of rigid body motion of the airplane as it penetrated the gust. With the development of the
VGH (velocity, load factor, height) recorder in 1946, NASA began collecting a large quantity of gust load data on many
types of aircraft in airline service. Although that program was terminated for transport airline operations in 1971,
the data provided additional insight into the nature of gusts in the atmosphere, and resulted in significant changes
to the gust load design requirements. The evolution of the discrete gust design criteria from part 04 through part
4b of the CAR to current part 25 of Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) (which contains the design requirements
for transport category airplanes) resulted in the establishment of a prescribed gust shape with a specific gust gradient
distance and increased peak gust design velocities. The prescribed shape was a ``one-minus-cosine'' gust shape
with a specified gust gradient distance of 12.5 times the mean chord length of the airplane wing. The gust gradient
distance, for that particular shape, was equal to one-half the total gust length. A simplified analytical method
similar to the methodology of CAM 04 was provided along with an improved alleviation factor that accounted for unsteady
aerodynamic forces, gust shape, and the airplane rigid body vertical response.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The increasing speed, size, and structural flexibility of transport airplanes resulted in the need to consider not
only the rigid body response of the airplane, but also structural dynamic response and the effects of structural deformation
on the aerodynamic parameters. Early attempts to account for structural flexibility led to a ``tuned'' gust approach
in which the analysis assumed a flexible airplane encountering gusts with various gradient distances in order to
find the most critical gust gradient distance for use in design for each major component. A tuned discrete gust approach
became a requirement for compliance with the British Civil Airworthiness Requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another method of accounting for the structural dynamic effects of the airplane involved the power spectral density
(PSD) analysis technique which accounted for the statistical distribution of gusts in continuous turbulence in
conjunction with the aeroelastic and structural dynamic characteristics of the airplane. In the 1960's, the Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA) awarded study contracts to Boeing and Lockheed for the purpose of assisting the FAA
in developing the PSD gust methodology into continuous gust design criteria with analytical procedures. The final
PSD continuous turbulence criteria were based on those studies and were codified in Appendix G to part 25 in 1980.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recognizing that the nature of gusts was not completely defined, and that individual discrete gusts might exist outside
the normal statistical distribution of gusts in continuous turbulence, the FAA retained the existing criteria for
discrete gusts in addition to the new requirement for continuous turbulence. The current discrete gust criteria
in Subpart C of part 25 require the loads to be analytically developed assuming the airplane encounters a gust with
a fixed gradient distance of 12.5 mean chord lengths. For application of the current criteria, it is generally assumed
that the airplane is rigid in determining the dynamic response to the gust while the effects of wing elastic deflection
on wing static lift parameters are normally taken into account. The minimum value of the airplane design speed for
maximum gust intensity, V
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
B
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, is also established from the discrete gust criteria.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recent flight measurement efforts by FAA and NASA have been aimed at utilizing measurements from the digital flight
data recorders (DFDR) to derive gust load design information for airline transport airplanes. The Civil Aviation
Authority (CAA) of the United Kingdom has also been conducting a comprehensive DFDR gust measurement program for
transport airplanes in airline service. The program, called CAADRP (Civil Aircraft Airworthiness Data Recording
Program), uses data sampling rates that allow the measurement of a wide range of gust gradient distances. The CAADRP
program is still continuing and has resulted in an extensive collection of reliable gust data.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1988, the FAA, in cooperation with the JAA and organizations representing the American and European aerospace
industries, began a process to harmonize the airworthiness requirements of the United States and the airworthiness
requirements of Europe in regard to gust requirements. The objective was to achieve common requirements for the certification
of transport airplanes without a substantive change in the level of safety provided by the regulations. Other airworthiness
authorities such as Transport Canada have also participated in this process.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1992, the harmonization effort was undertaken by the Aviation Regulatory Advisory Committee (ARAC). A working
group of industry and governmental structural loads specialists of Europe, the United States, and Canada was chartered
by notice in the

 (58 FR 13819, March 15, 1993). The harmonization effort has now progressed to a point where some specific proposals
have been developed by the working group for the discrete gust requirements and these proposals have been recommended
to FAA by letter dated October 15, 1993. The FAA is also considering other proposals for future rulemaking.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The continued evolution of gust design requirements among the various world aviation authorities has resulted in
many separate gust load design criteria with which the transport airplane manufacturer must comply in order to export
its product. Recent efforts between the FAA and the Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) of Europe in cooperation with
the transport manufacturers has resulted in a proposal to refine the criteria and consolidate them into a common set
of gust requirements. A review was made of analytical methods to find a single method that would simulate both discrete
gusts and continuous turbulence and produce design loads that could be used directly for structural analysis. However,
no single method was found to be satisfactory for accounting for both the discrete gust and continuous turbulence;
therefore, separate criteria for these conditions will be retained in the requirements. This notice addresses only
the discrete gust criteria. If revisions to the continuous turbulence criteria are deemed necessary, they will be
proposed in a future notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A tuned discrete gust methodology would replace the current discrete gust requirement of &sect;25.341 in order to
provide a more rational basis that accounts for the aerodynamic and structural dynamic characteristics of the airplane.
This methodology would take into account the expected operation of the airplane by allowing multiplying factors,
based on fuel loading and maximum operating altitude, to be used to adjust the required design gust velocities. This
method is considered to be more rational in that it more accurately reflects the actual conditions experienced by
the airplane and is therefore less likely to lead to either overdesigning or undesigning of structure. An effort has
been undertaken by the industries and governments of the United States and Europe to evaluate the new proposed criteria
and ensure that the provide reasonable design loads for current conventional transport airplanes as well as for new
technology airplanes that may include systems that react in a nonlinear manner. Furthermore, the proposed gust gradient
distance and design gust velocity distributions are believed to represent the best available measurements of the
gust environment in which the airplane is likely to be operated. In this regard, the CAADRP gust measurement data (CAA,
Safety Regulation Group, Research Note Number 74, November 30, 1990, ``Investigation of Derived Gust Velocities
from CAADRP Data'') have been used to support the design gust velocity and gradient distance distributions for the
new proposed discrete gust design criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The method for establishing the minimum value of the design speed for maximum gust intensity, V
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
B
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, which is currently predicated on the discrete gust criteria of the current &sect;25.341, would also be revised.
The proposed tuned gust criteria would replace the static discrete gust criteria of &sect;25.341 which are used in
the calculation of the minimum value of V
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
B
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Therefore, a revised criterion for the minimum V
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
B 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
is also proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal does not include a discrete gust design condition at V
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
B
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, although the speed V
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
B
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 would continue to be used in determining the criteria for continuous turbulence. The design gust velocity and gradient
distances established for the gust design conditions at V
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
C
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, ``structural design cruising speed,'' and V
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
D
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, ``structural design diving speed,'' were developed in consideration of the full operational envelope so that a
specific discrete gust condition at V
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
B 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
is not considered necessary, provided an adequate speed margin is retained between V
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
B
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and V
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
C
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and provided the current practices for operating in severe turbulence are continued. In this regard, it is also proposed
that the recommended operational turbulence penetration speed of &sect;25.1585(a)(8) be based on a new operational
rough air speed, V
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
RA
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, which would be no greater than the V
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
B
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 chosen for structural design. In the interest of developing a common requirement for part 25 and JAR&hyph;25, the
current JAR requirement (JAR 25.1517) for a rough air speed, V
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
RA
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, for which there is a satisfactory service history, would be the basis for the new proposed &sect;25.1517. The FAA
considers the level of safety provided in this notice to be the same as in the current rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several changes are also proposed to other related rules to implement the new criteria and to consolidate the general
gust requirements into a single section. Gust requirements are located in several different sections of part 25 that
pertain to continuous turbulence, lateral gusts, etc. This proposal would consolidate many of these gust requirements
into a revised &sect;25.341. In this regard, several changes to other sections are proposed to transfer requirements
and to revise references to these requirements. These include the relocation of &sect;25.305(d) to &sect;25.341(b)
and the transfer of &sect;&sect;25.331(a)(1) and 25.331(a)(2) to &sect;25.321 ``General'' and changing the title
of &sect;25.331 to ``Symmetric maneuvering conditions.'' Also the lateral gust requirements of &sect;25.351 would
be removed since the proposed &sect;25.341 addresses both vertical and lateral gusts. The gust envelope would no
longer be needed with the proposed criteria so it would be eliminated from &sect;25.333 and the title of this section
would be changed to ``Flight maneuvering envelope.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Changes are also proposed to adapt the tuned gust criteria to the cases of unsymmetrical loads in &sect;25.349 ``rolling
conditions,'' &sect;25.427 ``Unsymmetrical loads,'' and to &sect;25.445 ``Outboard fins.'' These rules would
be revised in order to provide criteria for calculating unsymmetrical external airloads for dynamic discrete gust
conditions and to provide for the effects of lateral gusts acting on auxiliary aerodynamic surfaces such as winglets
and outboard fins. To be more general, it is proposed to change the title of &sect;25.445 from ``Outboard fins'' to
``Auxiliary aerodynamic surfaces.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed changes to Federal regulations must undergo several economic analyses. First, Executive Order 12866 directs
that each Federal agency shall propose or adopt a regulation only upon a reasoned determination that the benefits
of the intended regulation justify its costs. Second, the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires agencies to
analyze the economic effect of regulatory changes on small entities. Third, the Office of Management and Budget directs
agencies to assess the effects of regulatory changes on international trade. In conducting these analyses, the FAA
has determined that this rule: (1) Would generate benefits that justify its costs and is not a ``significant regulatory
action'' as defined in the Executive Order; (2) is not significant as defined in DOT's Policies and Procedures; (3)
would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities; (4) would not constitute a barrier to
international trade. These analyses, available in the docket, are summarized below.

Cost-Benefit Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed changes would have economic consequences. The costs would be the incremental costs of meeting the tuned
discrete gust requirements rather than the current static discrete gust requirements. The benefits would be the
savings from not meeting two different sets of discrete gust requirements, i.e., the requirements in the current
FAR and the requirements in the JAR. In order to sell their transport category airplanes in a global marketplace, manufacturers
usually certify their products under both sets of regulations. Harmonizing these discrete gust requirements would
result in a net cost savings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Industry sources provided information on the additional costs and cost savings that would result from the proposed
rule. Based on this information a range of representative certification costs and savings are shown below. The costs
and savings per certification are those related to meeting discrete gust load requirements, including related provisions
of the proposed rule.

The costs and cost savings of specific certifications may vary from these estimates. In all cases where a manufacturer
seeks both FAA and JAA certification, however, the cost savings realized through harmonizing the requirements would
outweigh the expected incremental costs of the proposal. The FAA solicits information from manufacturers and other
interested parties concerning the costs and savings associated with this proposal.

In addition to the cost savings expected from harmonization, the proposed rule would result in airplane designs that
are based on more rational evaluations of conditions expected in flight.

Regulatory Flexibility Determination
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily
and disproportionately burdened by Federal regulations. The RFA requires A Regulatory Flexibility Analysis if
a proposed rule would have ``a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' FAA Order
2100.14A outlines FAA's procedures and criteria for implementing the RFA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An aircraft manufacturer must employ 75 or fewer employees to be designated as a ``small'' entity. A substantial number
of small entities is defined as a number that is 11 or more and which is more than one-third of the small entities subject
to a proposed or final rule. None of the manufacturers of transport category airplanes qualify as small entities under
this definition. Therefore, the proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities.

International Trade Impact Assessment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The proposed rule would not constitute a barrier to international trade, including the export of American goods and
services to foreign countries and the import of foreign goods and services into the United States. The discrete gust
load requirements in this rule would harmonize with those of the JAA and would, in fact, lessen the restraints on trade.

 Federalism Implications
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship between
the national government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Thus, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal does not have sufficient
federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

Conclusion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Because the proposed changes to the gust design criteria are not expected to result in a substantial economic cost,
the FAA has determined that this proposed regulation would not be significant under Executive Order 12866. Because
this is an issue that has not prompted a great deal of public concern, the FAA has determined that this action is not significant
under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 25, 1979). In addition, since there are no small
entities affected by this rulemaking, the FAA certifies that the rule, if promulgated, would not have a significant
economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory
Flexibility Act, since none would be affected. A copy of the regulatory evaluation prepared for this project may be
examined in the Rules Docket or obtained from the person identified under the caption

(a) In designing the airplane for lateral gust, yaw maneuver and roll maneuver conditions, account must be taken of
unsymmetrical loads on the empennage arising from effects such as slipstream and aerodynamic interference with

(b) The horizontal tail must be assumed to be subjected to unsymmetrical loading conditions determined as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 100 percent of the maximum loading from the symmetrical maneuver conditions of &sect;25.331 and the vertical
gust conditions of &sect;25.341(a) acting separately on the surface on one side of the plane of symmetry; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 80 percent of these loadings acting on the other side.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) For empennage arrangements where the horizontal tail surfaces have dihedral angles greater than plus or minus
10 degrees, or are supported by the vertical tail surfaces, the surfaces and the supporting structure must be designed
for gust velocities specified in &sect;25.341(a) acting in any orientation at right angles to the flight path.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

A. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This FAR case was opened to address issues raised by the OMB SWAT Team concerning the requirement to maintain records
which are in addition to normal records maintained to record lobbying costs under FAR 31.205&hyph;22(f). The proposed
FAR rule would delete 31.205&hyph;22(f) because it conflicts with the recordkeeping requirements in 31.201&hyph;6(c),
31.205&hyph;22(e), and Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) 405, Accounting for Unallowable Costs (48 CFR 9904.405&hyph;50(a)).
In addition, the Councils believe that 31.205&hyph;22(f) is inconsistent with the clause at 52.203&hyph;12, Limitation
on Payments to Influence Certain Federal Transactions, which requires contractors to disclose lobbying activities.
The reporting of such activities must necessarily be based upon certain contractor records which support the disclosures.
The proposed rule also removes the prohibition against reimbursing executive lobbying costs at 31.205&hyph;50
and adds it to the list of specifically unallowable lobbying costs at 31.205&hyph;22(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
B. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within
the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., because most contracts awarded to small entities are awarded on a competitive, fixed-price basis and the cost principles
do not apply. The cost principles apply only to contracts for which cost or pricing data has been submitted. An Initial
Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments are invited from small businesses
and other interested parties. Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will also be considered
in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and should cite 5 U.S.C. 601,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(FAR case 93&hyph;6), in correspondence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Paperwork Reduction Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed changes to the FAR do not impose recordkeeping or information
collection requirements, or collections of information from offerors, contractors, or members of the public which
require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501,

A. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The guidance for determining cost allowability at FAR 31.201&hyph;2 currently does not explicitly state that contractors
must maintain adequate cost records in order to be reimbursed for all claimed costs nor does it specifically state
that the contracting officer has the authority to disallow costs which are determined to be inadequately supported.
This requirement and authority have, heretofore, been considered to be implicit in the cost principles. However,
the Councils are proposing that the FAR explicitly address these issues because the Office of Federal Procurement
Policy SWAT Team on Civilian Agency Contracting in its report of December 3, 1992, ``Improving Contracting Practices
and Management Controls on Cost-Type Federal Contracts,'' found that agencies are having difficulty because the
FAR is silent on these issues. A new paragraph (d) is proposed for FAR 31.201&hyph;2 to explicitly state that costs
claimed for reimbursement must be adequately supported and that the contracting officer may disallow costs which
are inadequately supported.

B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule clarifies a condition of cost allowability for contractors who wish to be reimbursed under Government
contracts subject to FAR 31.2. The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
applies but the rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
because most contracts awarded to small entities are awarded on a competitive, fixed-price basis and the cost principles
do not apply. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments from small
entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will be considered in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 610 of the Act. Such comments

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council are proposing changes
to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to specify the documentation required to support the allowability of
contractors' claimed travel costs. This regulatory action was subject to Office of Management and Budget review
pursuant to Executive Order 12866, dated September 30, 1993.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FAR currently does not specify what documentation is required by contractors in order to support travel costs
incurred under Government contracts. As with other contract costs, the requirement to document travel costs, in
order to determine the allowability of costs incurred, has been implicit and would not normally be specifically stated
in a cost principle. However, the Councils are proposing that specific criteria be incorporated in the cost principle
at FAR 31.205&hyph;46 because the Office of Federal Procurement Policy SWAT Team on Civilian Agency Contracting
in its report of December 3, 1992, entitled ``Improving Contracting Practices and Management Controls on Cost-Type
Federal Contracts,'' found that agencies are having difficulty because the travel cost principle is silent on the
documentation requirements. The report had recommended several changes to the FAR which were viewed to have Government-wide
benefit and which would make the FAR less general with respect to the allowability of certain costs. The Councils also
believe that revising the FAR to include specific documentation criteria will help in achieving consistent treatment
of such costs by contracting officers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The documentation criteria being proposed for the FAR reflect similar requirements already imposed by Section 274
of the Internal Revenue Code for claiming travel costs for Federal tax purposes (26 U.S.C. 274(d)). There would, therefore,
be no additional recordkeeping requirements placed on contractors. The proposed revisions also coincide with guidance
currently contained in the Defense Contract Audit Agency's Contract Audit Manual (CAM) at CAM 7&hyph;1002.2.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
B. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This proposed rule clarifies a condition of cost allowability for contractors who wish to be reimbursed under Government
contracts subject to FAR 31.2. The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
applies, but the rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
because most contracts awarded to small entities are awarded on a competitive, fixed-price basis and the cost principles
do not apply. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments from small
entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will be considered in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 610 of the Act. Such comments
must be submitted separately and should cite 5 U.S.C. 601, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (FAR case 93&hyph;22), in correspondence.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed changes to the FAR do not impose recordkeeping or information
collection requirements, or collections of information from offerors, contractors, or members of the public which
require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501,

The Department of Defense, General Services Administration, and National Aeronautics and Space Administration
have decided to withdraw a proposed rule, FAR case 91&hyph;72, Government Property, without further action in order
to prepare for the substantial effort required to implement the pending Acquisition Streamlining Act and for rewriting
the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) pursuant to the National Performance Review. The case proposes a FAR revision
to alert the contracting officer that facilities contracts should be closed out when Government production and research
property is no longer required for the performance of the instant Government contract or subcontracts. The proposed
rule was published in the
