<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department has received timely requests, in accordance with 19 C.F.R. 353.22(a) and 355.22(a) (1994), for administrative
reviews of the antidumping duty orders on roll-rolled and corrosion resistant carbon steel flat products and certain
cut-to-length carbon steel plate from various countries. The Department's notice initiating those reviews inadvertently
omitted the request of one producer in Australia. Therefore, we are amending the Notice of Initiation of September
8, 1994.

In addition to those disclosures generally permitted under 5 U.S.C. 552a(b) of the Privacy Act, these records or information
contained therein may specifically be disclosed outside the DoD as a routine use pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(3) as
follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To the Department of Veteran Affairs (DVA) to provide military personnel and pay data for present and former military
personnel for the purpose of evaluating use of veterans benefits, validating benefit eligibility and maintaining
the health and well being of veterans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To the Department of Veteran Affairs (DVA) to provide identifying military personnel data to the DVA and its contractor,
the Prudential Insurance Company, for the purpose of notifying members of the Individual Ready Reserve (IRR) of their
right to apply for Veteran's Group Life Insurance coverage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) to register eligible veterans and their dependents for DVA programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) to conduct computer matching programs regulated by the Privacy Act of
1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552a), for the purpose of:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Providing full identification of active duty military personnel, including full-time National Guard/Reserve
support personnel, for use in the administration of DVA's Compensation and Pension benefit program (38 U.S.C. 3104(c),
3006&hyph;3008). The information is used to determine continued eligibility for DVA disability compensation to
recipients who have returned to active duty so that benefits can be adjusted or terminated as required and steps taken
by DVA to collect any resulting over payment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Providing military personnel and financial data to the Veterans Benefits Administration, DVA for the purpose
of determining initial eligibility and any changes in eligibility status to insure proper payment of benefits for
GI Bill education and training benefits by the DVA under the Montgomery GI Bill (Title 10 U.S.C., Chapter 106 &hyph;
Selected Reserve and Title 38 U.S.C., Chapter 30 &hyph; Active Duty). The administrative responsibilities designated
to both agencies by the law require that data be exchanged in administering the programs.

to the DVA, for the purpose of deducting reserve time served from any DVA disability compensation paid or waiver of
VA benefit. The law (10 U.S.C. 684) prohibits receipt of reserve pay and DVA compensation for the same time period,
however, it does permit waiver of DVA compensation to draw reserve pay.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Providing identification of former active duty military personnel who received separation payments to the DVA
for the purpose of deducting such repayment from any DVA disability compensation paid. The law (38 U.S.C. 3104(c))
requires recoupment of severance payments before DVA disability compensation can be paid.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Providing identification of former military personnel and survivor's financial benefit data to DVA for the purpose
of identifying military retired pay and survivor benefit payments for use in the administration of the DVA's Compensation

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Committee on Foreign Medical Education and Accreditation is established under section 481 of the Higher
Education Act of 1965, as amended (20 U.S.C. 1088). This Committee does not have advisory functions but rather carries
out operational activities of the U.S. Department of Education. The Committee evaluates the standards of accreditation
applied to applicant foreign medical schools and determines the comparability of those standards to standards for
accreditation applied to United States medical schools. The morning portion of the September 22, 1994, meeting,
from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon, will be closed to the general public to hold an orientation session for the Committee members.
The afternoon session, from 1:00 p.m. until 5:00 p.m., will be open to the public. It will begin with a general discussion
of the Committee's role and responsibilities and will continue with a discussion of criteria against which comparability
will be determined. This discussion will be continued on September 23, 1994, from 9:00 a.m. until 12:00 noon. This
session also will be open to the public. A reasonable amount of time for public comment, as determined by the Chairman,
will be allowed at the sessions that are open to the public.

stated that Granite State's Rate Schedule LMS service relies on a parallel daily swing service provided by Tennessee
Gas Pipeline Company (Tennessee) under its Rate Schedule LMS&hyph;MA. Granite State further states that the rates
for its Rate Schedule LMS service are identical with and track the rates for Tennessee's underlying service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Granite State proposes in its filing to track the change in the Tennessee rate effective September 1, 1994, rather

Take notice that on September 9, 1994, Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company (Tennessee), tendered for filing as part of
its FERC Gas Tariff, Fifth Revised Volume No. 1, First Revised Sheet No. 25, First Revised Sheet No. 159, and First Revised
Sheet No. 159A.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tennessee states that the purpose of this filing is to comply with the Commission's Fifth Order on Compliance Filing
and Fourth Order on Rehearing in Tennessee's restructuring proceeding. 68 FERC 61,001 at 61,002 (1994). Tennessee
requests an effective date for the above-referenced sheets of October 1, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tennessee states that in the Fifth Tennessee Restructuring Order, the Commission denied Tennessee's request for
rehearing regarding the crediting of revenues from Extended Receipt and Delivery Services because it felt that the
services were essentially interruptible in nature. However, the Commission invited Tennessee to make a limited
Section 4 filing to alter its Extended Receipt and Delivery Services in order to make them true firm services. The instant
filing would require that shippers desiring Extended Receipt or Delivery Service reserve and pay for such capacity
for at least three days. Thus Tennessee states that the proposed sheets comply with the Commission's holdings in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 65 FERC 61,130 (1993) and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ANR Pipeline Co.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 64 FERC 61,140 (1993) as required by the Fifth Restructuring Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tennessee requests a waiver of the Commission's 30 day prior notice requirements in order that the proposed tariff
sheets may go into effect on October 1, 1994. Implementation at this time will allow Tennessee to gain experience in
scheduling the new Extended Receipt and Delivery Service prior to increased system demands that will result from
colder weather. While Tennessee does not believe any additional waivers are necessary, Tennessee respectfully
requests that the Commission grant any waivers it deems necessary for acceptance of this filing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tennessee states that copies of the filing have been mailed to all of its jurisdictional customers and affected state
regulatory commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said filing should file a petition to intervene

in accordance with Sections 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, 18 CFR 385.211 and 385.214.
All such petitions or protests should be filed on or before September 20, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission
in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to this proceeding.

Take notice that on September 7, 1994, Texas Gas Transmission Corporation (Texas Gas) tendered for filing supporting
schedules and working papers in Docket No. RP94&hyph;375, et al. Texas Gas states that this filing is being made to
supplement a filing made on August 30, 1994, and noticed as Docket No. RP94&hyph;375&hyph;000. That filing described
Schedules 1 through 10, which were supposed to be attached in support of Account No. 191 costs to be direct billed by
Texas Gas. Therefore, Texas Gas is submitting Schedules 1 through 10 to correct the inadvertent error caused by not
attaching the schedules to its filing made on August 30, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Texas Gas states that copies of the letter of transmittal and attachments are being mailed to all those receiving the

state commissions, as well as to all parties on the service list in Docket No. RP94&hyph;125.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825
North Capitol Street, NE., in accordance with Rule 211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such protests
should be filed on or before September 20, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate
action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Copies of this filing are on file
with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the Public Reference Room.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In accordance with 10 CFR 205.282(c), notice is hereby given of the issuance of the Decision and Order set out below.
The Decision sets forth the procedures that the DOE has formulated to distribute to eligible claimants $52,092.73,
plus accrued interest, obtained by the DOE under the terms of a Remedial Order that the DOE issued to Sunset Boulevard
Car Wash (Sunset) on October 22, 1980. Under the Remedial Order, Sunset was found to have violated the Federal petroleum
price and allocation regulations involving the sale of refined petroleum products between August 1, 1979 and January
27, 1980 (the Audit period). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OHA will distribute the Remedial Order funds in a two stage refund proceeding. Purchasers of Sunset motor gasoline
will have an opportunity to submit refund applications in the first stage. Refunds will be granted to applicants who
satisfactorily demonstrate they were injured by the pricing violations and who document the volume of gasoline they
purchased from Sunset during the audit period. In the event that money remains after all first stage claims have been
disposed of, the remaining funds will be disbursed in accordance with the provisions of 15 U.S.C. 4501, the Petroleum
Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986 (PODRA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applications for Refund must be postmarked on or before June 1, 1995. Instructions for the completion of refund applications
have been set forth in Section IV of the Decision immediately following this notice. Refund applications should be
mailed to the address listed at the beginning of this notice.

Under the procedural regulations of the Department of Energy (DOE), the Economic Regulatory Administration (ERA)
may request that the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) formulate and implement special refund proceedings. 10
CFR 205.281. These procedures are used to refund monies to those injured by actual or alleged violations of the DOE
price regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this Decision and Order, we consider a Petition for Implementation of Special Refund Procedures filed by ERA on
July 20, 1993. In that Petition, ERA specifically requests that we formulate refund procedures to disburse funds
that had been remitted to DOE by Sunset Boulevard Car Wash (Sunset). The funds at issue in that Petition were obtained
through a Remedial Order (the Order) issued by our Office on October 22, 1980.

The general guidelines that govern OHA's ability to formulate and implement a plan to distribute refunds are set forth
at 10 CFR part 205, subpart V. These procedures apply in situations where DOE cannot readily identify the persons who
were injured as a result of actual or alleged violations of the regulations or ascertain the amount of the refund each
person should receive. For a more detailed discussion of subpart V and the authority of OHA to fashion procedures to
distribute refunds, see

The facts alleged in the Order were undisputed. Sunset was a ``retailer'' of motor gasoline as that term has been defined
at 10 CFR 212.31 and was therefore subject to the provisions of 10 CFR part 210 and 10 CFR part 212, subpart F. The Order
states that from August 1, 1979 to January 27, 1980 (the audit period), Sunset charged prices higher than those permitted
by 10 CFR 212.93(a)(2); levied a cents-per-gallon fee for services associated with the sale of motor gasoline in violation
of 10 CFR 210.62(d)(1) and refused to make its records available for inspection in violation of 10 CFR 210.92(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sunset was ordered to reduce its prices for motor gasoline by specified amounts until a sufficient volume of gasoline
had been sold at reduced prices to remedy the violations.

Sunset objected to the remedial provisions of the MO at every available tier of administrative and judicial review.
As a result, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) affirmed the MO on August 12, 1982. When Sunset renewed
its objections in proceedings before the United States District Court for the Central District of California, the
District Court affirmed the MO. Finally, on March 9, 1993, the Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals definitively
disposed of Sunset's objections.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 24, 1993, we issued a Proposed Decision and Order (PDO) establishing tentative procedures to distribute
the funds that Sunset had remitted to DOE pursuant to the MO. We proposed implementing a two stage refund proceeding
and we stated that purchasers of Sunset motor gasoline would be provided an opportunity to submit refund applications
in the first stage. In the event funds remained after all first stage claims had been considered, we stated that the
remaining funds would be disbursed in the second stage in accordance with the provisions of the Petroleum Overcharge
Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986 (15 U.S.C. 4501) (PODRA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We provided a 30 day period for the submission of comments concerning the proposed procedures. However, we have received
no comments since the PDO was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 more than 30 days ago. The proposed procedures will therefore be adopted in the same form in which they were originally
outlined. Set forth below are the specific considerations that will guide our evaluation of refund applications
during the first stage, as well as, the provisions governing distribution of any remaining funds in the second stage
proceeding.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Refund applications submitted in the Sunset special refund proceeding will be evaluated in exactly the same manner
as applications submitted in other refined product proceedings. In those proceedings, we often adopt rebuttable
presumptions which relate to pricing violations and injury. Such a policy reflects our belief that adoption of these
presumptions permits applicants to participate in refund proceedings in larger numbers by avoiding the need to incur
inordinate expense; and facilitates our consideration of first stage refund applications. 10 CFR 205.282(e). For
those reasons, we have adopted similar presumptions in the present proceeding.

(1) Calculating the Refund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We have presumed that the pricing violations were dispersed equally throughout Sunset's motor gasoline sales during
the audit period. We therefore proposed that each applicant's potential refund should be calculated on a volumetric
basis. Under the volumetric approach, refunds are calculated by multiplying the gallons of refined product each
applicant purchased by the per gallon refund amount (volumetric) established for this proceeding, plus accrued
interest. Applicants believing they were disproportionately overcharged by the pricing violations may present
documentation which supports that claim. Those who succeed in showing they were disproportionately overcharged
by Sunset will be eligible to receive refunds calculated at a higher volumetric. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The volumetric for this proceeding has been set at $.0868 per gallon. This figure was obtained by dividing the remedial
order funds available for distribution by the volume of gasoline Sunset is believed to have sold during the audit period.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
In the absence of precise figures indicating the amount of motor gasoline Sunset sold during the audit period, we estimated
Sunset's total sales using the best available data. Based on sales of 200,000 gallons per month for 6 months, we believe
Sunset sold 1,200,000 gallons of gasoline during the audit period. This figure will be used to calculate the volumetric
refund amount unless the refund applications submitted pursuant to this Decision and Order indicate that our estimate
is inaccurate. In the event the estimate proves to be inaccurate, it may be necessary to reestimate the volumetric.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Eligibility for a Refund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to be eligible to receive a refund in this proceeding, each applicant must (1) document the volume of motor
gasoline it purchased during the audit period; and (2) demonstrate that it was injured by Sunset's overcharges. The
threshold requirement for any applicant is documenting the volume of product it purchased. This requirement is typically
satisfied when the applicant successfully demonstrates ownership of the business for which the refund is sought
and submits documentation which supports the volume claimed in its refund application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The injury showing, however, is a potentially more difficult requirement for applicants to satisfy, especially
those seeking smaller refund amounts. This is true because an applicant must demonstrate that it was forced to absorb
Sunset's overcharges. Our cases have often stated that an applicant accomplishes this by demonstrating that it maintained
a ``bank'' of unrecovered product costs and showing that market conditions would not permit the applicant to pass
through those increased costs. See, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Quintana Energy Corp., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
21 DOE &para;85,032 at 88,117 (1991).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unless simplified application procedures were provided, we recognized that the cost to the applicant of gathering
evidence of injury to support a relatively small refund claim could exceed the expected refund and thereby cause some
injured parties to be denied an opportunity to obtain a refund. Moreover, simplified procedures were needed to minimize
the burden that would be placed on this Office if we found it necessary to analyze a detailed injury showing for large
numbers of small refund applications. In view of these difficulties, we proposed adopting a number of injury presumptions
which simplify and streamline the refund process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) Presumptions of Injury
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each presumption of injury turns on the category of applicant. Set forth below is the presumption of injury that has
been adopted for each class of applicant likely to submit a refund application in this proceeding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Small-claim Presumption
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. We have adopted a small claim presumption of injury for resellers, retailers and refiners whose claim is $10,000
or less, exclusive of interest. A small claim threshold of $10,000 has been adopted, even though we established a lower
threshold amount of $5,000 in many prior proceedings. See, e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Gulf Oil Corporation
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 16 DOE &para;85,381 (1987)(establishing a $5,000 threshold). The $10,000 threshold is more appropriate here because
the volumetric for this proceeding is significantly higher than the volumetric set in Gulf and in most other proceedings.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Id.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If we were to adopt a lower threshold amount for this proceeding, then the high volumetric would increase substantially
the number of very small firms that would be burdened with the requirement to make a detailed injury showing before
they become eligible to receive their full allocable share.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The small claim presumption of injury for this proceeding, exempts applicants whose claims are $10,000 or less, exclusive
of interest, from the requirement to prove injury. Such an applicant need only document the volume of motor gasoline
he or she purchased from Sunset during the audit period in order to be eligible to receive a full refund. See

Mid-range Presumption
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Mid-range applicants; that is, applicants seeking refunds in excess of $10,000 but less than $50,000, excluding
interest, are eligible to receive 40 percent of their allocable share without proving injury. Like small-claim applicants,
these applicants will only be required to document the volume of Sunset gasoline they purchased during the audit period
to be eligible to receive refunds. See

End-user Presumption.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We have presumed that end-users of petroleum products whose businesses were unrelated to the petroleum industry
and were not subject to the regulations promulgated under the Emergency Petroleum Price and Allocation Act of 1973
(EPAA), 15 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;751&hyph;760h, were injured by Sunset's pricing violations. Unlike regulated firms,
end-users were not subject to price controls during the audit period. Moreover, these firms were not required to keep
records that justified selling price increases by reference to cost increases. An analysis of the impact of the alleged
overcharges on the final prices of non-petroleum goods and services is beyond the scope of a special refund proceeding.
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
American Pacific International, Inc.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 14 DOE &para;85,158 at 88,294 (1986). End-users seeking refunds in this proceeding will therefore be presumed to
have been injured by Sunset's pricing violations. In order to receive a refund, end-user applicants need only document
the volume of Sunset product they purchased during the audit period. Meritorious applicants are eligible to receive
their full allocable share. See

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Refunds in Excess of $50,000 and Other Applicants
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Applicants seeking refunds in excess of $50,000, excluding interest, will be required to submit detailed evidence
of injury. These applicants must show that the overcharges were absorbed, not passed through to their customers.
They will therefore be unable to rely upon injury presumptions utilized in many refined product refund cases. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Id.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We do not anticipate that other categories of applicants, such as, regulated firms, cooperatives, indirect purchasers
or spot purchasers, would have obtained products from Sunset. Such applicants may nonetheless submit refund applications
if they purchased motor gasoline from Sunset during the audit period. Any such applicants must demonstrate that they
purchased products from Sunset during the audit period and show they were injured as a result of their purchases to
be eligible to receive a refund in this proceeding. Regulated firms and cooperatives are exempt from the requirement
to show injury. They must, however, show that they will pass through to their customers any refunds they receive.

Under the Privacy Act of 1974, the submission of a social security number by an individual applicant is voluntary.
An applicant who does not wish to submit a social security number must submit an employer identification number if
one exists. This information will be used in processing refund applications. It is requested pursuant to our authority
under the Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986 and the regulations codified at 10 CFR part
205, Subpart V. The information may be shared with other Federal agencies for statistical, auditing or archiving
purposes, and with law enforcement agencies when they are investigating a potential violation of civil or criminal
law. Unless an applicant claims confidentiality, this information will be available to the public in the Public Reference
Room of the Office of Hearings and Appeals.

(2) The applicant should specify the source of its gallonage information. In calculating its purchase volumes, an
applicant should use actual records from the settlement period, if available. If these records are not available,
the applicant may submit estimates of its gasoline purchases, but the estimation methodology must be reasonable
and must be explained.

Any funds that remain after all first stage claims have been decided will be distributed in accordance with the provisions
of PODRA, 15 U.S.C. 4501&hyph;07. PODRA requires that the Secretary of Energy determine annually the amount of oil
overcharge funds that will not be required to refund monies to injured parties in Subpart V proceedings and make those
funds available to state governments for use in four energy conservation programs. The Secretary has delegated these
responsibilities to OHA, and any funds that OHA determines will not be needed to effect direct restitution to injured
customers will be distributed in accordance with the provisions of PODRA.

Pursuant to Sections 302(a) and 301(b) of the Department of Energy Organization Act, Public Law 95&hyph;91, the functions
of the Secretary of the Interior and the Federal Power Commission under Section 5 of the Flood Control Act of 1944, 16
U.S.C. 825s, for the Southwestern Power Administration were transferred to and vested in the Secretary of Energy.
By Delegation Order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No. 0204&hyph;108, effective December 14, 1983, 48 FR 55664, the Secretary of Energy delegated to the Deputy Secretary
of Energy on a non-exclusive basis the authority to confirm, approve and place into effect on an interim basis power
and transmission rates, and delegated to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) on an exclusive basis the
authority to confirm, approve and place in effect on a final basis, or to disapprove power and transmission rates.
Amendment No. 1 to Delegation Order No. 0204&hyph;108, effective May 30, 1986, 51 FR 19744, revised the delegation
of authority to confirm, approve and place into effect on an interim basis power and transmission rates by delegating
such authority to the Under Secretary of Energy rather than the Deputy Secretary of Energy. This delegation was reassigned
to the Deputy Secretary of Energy by Department of Energy (DOE) Notice 1110.29, dated October 27, 1988, and clarified
by Secretary of Energy Notice SEN&hyph;10&hyph;89, dated August 3, 1989, and subsequent revisions. By Amendment
No. 2 to Delegation Order No. 0204&hyph;108, effective August 23, 1991, 56 FR 41835, the Secretary of the Department
of Energy revised Delegation Order No. 0204&hyph;108 to delegate to the Assistant Secretary, Conservation and Renewable
Energy, the authority which was previously delegated to the Deputy Secretary in that Delegation Order. By Amendment
No. 3 to Delegation Order No. 0204&hyph;108, effective November 10, 1993, the Secretary of Energy redelegated to
the Deputy Secretary of Energy, the authority to confirm, approve and place into effect on an interim basis power and
transmission rates of the Power Marketing Administrations. This rate order is issued by the Deputy Secretary pursuant
to said Amendment to Delegation Order No. 0204&hyph;108.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is an interim rate extension. It is made pursuant to the authorities as implemented in 10 CFR 903.22(h) and 903.23(a).

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Southwestern Power Administration (Southwestern) currently has marketing responsibility for 2.2 million kilowatts
of power from 24 multiple-purpose reservoir projects, with power facilities constructed and operated by the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers, generally in all or portions of the states of Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma
and Texas. The Integrated System, composed of 22 of the projects, is interconnected through a transmission system
presently consisting of 138- and 161-kV high-voltage transmission lines, 69-kV transmission lines, and numerous
bulk power substations and switching stations. In addition, contractual transmission arrangements provide for
integration of other projects into the system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The remaining two projects, Sam Rayburn Dam and Robert Douglas Willis, are isolated hydraulically and electrically
from the Southwestern transmission system, and their power is marketed under separate contracts through which the
customer purchases the entire power output of the project at the dam. A separate Power Repayment Study (PRS) is prepared
for each isolated project, and each has a special rate which is not a part of this study. The existing rate schedules
for the Integrated System were confirmed and approved on a final basis by the FERC on September 18, 1991 for the period
October 1, 1990 through September 30, 1994. The FY 1994 Integrated System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PRSs indicate the need for a minor rate adjustment of $726,051 annually, or 0.8 percent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to implementing authority in 10 CFR 903(h) and 903.23(a), the Deputy Secretary of Energy may extend a FERC-approved
rate on an interim basis. The Administrator, Southwestern, published notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on June 14, 1994, 59 FR 30583, announcing a 15-day period for public review and comment concerning the proposed interim
rate extension. In addition, informal meetings were held with customer representatives on January 12, 1994; April
4, 1994; and May 6, 1994. Written comments were accepted through June 29, 1994. No comments on the proposed interim
extension were received.

Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The existing Integrated System rates are based on the FY 1990 PRS. PRSs have been completed on the Integrated System
each year since approval of the existing rates. Rate changes indicated by the PRSs during that period indicated the
need for a minor rate increase or decrease. Since the revenue changes reflected by the PRSs were within the plus-or-minus
two percent Rate Adjustment Threshold established by Southwestern's Administrator on June 23, 1987, these rate
adjustments were deferred in the best interest of the government and provided for the next year's PRS to determine
the appropriate level of revenues needed for the next rate period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FY 1994 PRS indicates the need for a minor rate increase of 0.8 percent. As has been the case since the existing rates
were approved, the FY 1994 rate adjustment needed falls within Southwestern's plus-or-minus two percent Rate Adjustment
Threshold and would normally be deferred. However, the existing rates expire on September 30, 1994. Consequently,
Southwestern proposes to extend the existing rates for a one-year period ending September 30, 1995, on an interim
basis under the implementation authorities noted in 10 CFR 903.22(h) and 903.23(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Southwestern continues to make significant progress toward repayment of the Federal investment in the Integrated
System. Through FY 1993, status of repayment for the Integrated System was $288,259,891, which represents approximately
30 percent of the $971,634,103 Federal investment for the Integrated System. The status has increased almost 47 percent
since the existing rates were placed in effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information regarding this rate extension, including studies and other supporting material, is available for public
review and comment in the offices of Southwestern Power Administration, One West Third Street, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74101.

indicating the revised determination. A formal hearing is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available to challenge any NPDES permit issued under 40 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
124.14 except for a general permit. Persons affected by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general permit may not challenge the conditions of a general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permit as a right in further agency proceedings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
They may instead either challenge the general permit in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
court, or apply for an individual permit under 40 CFR 122.21 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as authorized at 40 CFR 122.28 and then request a formal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing on the issuance or denial of an individual permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(July 11, 1993) &sect;17&hyph;4.244(3)(a) and the terms of this permit. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing for this requirement must conform with Part V of this permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For fresh waters and coastal waters, the pH of the effluent shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not be lowered to less than 6.0 units for fresh waters, or less than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6.5 units for marine waters, or raised above 8.5 units, unless the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permittee submits natural background data in the NOI request 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confirming a natural background pH outside of this range. If 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
natural background of the receiving water, as revealed by sampling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data from the permittee in the NOI request, is determined to be less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 6.0 units for fresh waters, or less than 6.5 units in marine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waters, the pH shall not vary below natural background or vary more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than one (1) unit above natural background for fresh and coastal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waters. If natural background of the receiving water, as revealed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by sampling data from the permittee in the NOI request, is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined to be higher than 8.5 units, the pH shall not vary above 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
natural background or vary more than one (1) unit below natural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
background of fresh and coastal waters. The acceptable pH range 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be included in the letter granting permit coverage and on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DMR. The pH shall be monitored once every month by grab sample, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuously with a recorder. (See item I.B.4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with FAC &sect;17&hyph;302.500(1)(a&hyph;c)(4&hyph;25&hyph;93), the discharge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall at all times be free from floating solids, visible foam, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
turbidity, or visible oil in such amounts as to form nuisances on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surface waters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Samples taken in compliance with the monitoring requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified above shall be taken at the following location(s): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nearest accessible point after final treatment but prior to actual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discharge or mixing with the receiving waters.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All discharges must comply with the following permit requirements: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) If analytical tests of Part I.A.3 reveal excessive benzene and naphthalene concentrations indicative of contamination
from petroleum fuels, and the discharge will occur for thirty (30) days or less, the permittee shall comply only with
the applicable effluent limitations and monitoring requirements in Part I.A.1 or I.A.2 for benzene, pH, and/or naphthalene
and total lead. The commencement of the Part V biomonitoring program and Part I.B.3 EPA method 624 and 625 (one time
analysis) is not required for this short-term activity. One (1) grab sample shall be analyzed per seven (7) days during
the discharge period, and the total volume discharged shall be recorded. For discharges contaminated by petroleum
fuels that last for less than a week, daily monitoring will be required for the applicable parameters. Upon receipt
of written EPA notification of coverage that the NOI request is complete, these short-term discharges may commence.
Discharge Monitoring Reports shall be submitted to EPA within thirty (30) days after termination of the discharge.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) If contamination from sources other than petroleum contamination does exist, as indicated by the results of the
analytical tests required by Part I. A.3 above, the discharge is not covered by this general permit. The operator shall
apply for an individual NPDES permit at least ninety (120) days prior to the date a discharge to waters of the United
States is expected. No discharge is permissible without an effective NPDES permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) If analytical tests reveal no contamination exists from petroleum fuels or sources other than petroleum contamination
as a result of the required analytical screening tests required in Part I, A.3, the permittee can commence discharge
immediately and is covered by this permit without having to submit an NOI request for coverage to EPA, Region IV. A short
summary of the proposed activity and copy of these analytical tests shall be sent to the same address specified in Part
III.A at least (1) one week before discharge begins. These analytical tests shall be kept on site during discharge
and made available to EPA, if requested. Additionally, no Discharge Monitoring Report (DMR) forms are required to
be submitted to EPA, Region IV. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Other Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Any more frequent effluent discharge monitoring required by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection
(FDEP) for the parameters limited in this permit, or different parameters, shall be reported to the Permit Issuing
Authority in accordance with the requirements of Part III of this permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Effluent limitations for combining contaminated groundwater pumped to above-ground storage tanks with contaminated
groundwater from the site's recovery wells: The permittee shall notify FDEP of any intent to combine contaminated
groundwater pumped to above-ground storage tanks with contaminated groundwater from the recovery well. Approval
of this combined effluent discharge by FDEP will constitute approval to apply for coverage under this permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Within sixty (60) days of the effective date of this permit or startup of discharge the permittee shall also submit
the results of the following analyses. These analyses shall be performed on a representative sample of the groundwater
effluent discharge, taken after final treatment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Required analyses (one time only): 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 of 100% or less in a test of 96 hours duration or less, coverage under this general permit will be reviewed for termination
by EPA Region IV Enforcement Section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. If the pH is monitored continuously, the pH values shall not deviate outside the required range more than 1% of the
time in any calendar month; and no individual excursion shall exceed 60 minutes. An ``excursion'' is an unintentional
and temporary incident in which the pH value of discharge wastewater exceeds the range set forth in this permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Test Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cause for modification or revocation and reissuance under 40 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
122.62, the permittee must report such information to the Permit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issuing Authority. The submittal of a new application may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required of the permittee. The filing of a request by the permittee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for a permit modification, revocation and reissuance, or termination, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or a notification of planned changes or anticipated noncompliance, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not stay any permit condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notwithstanding Paragraph A&hyph;4, above, if a toxic effluent standard or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prohibition (including any schedule of compliance specified in such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effluent standard or prohibition) is established under Section 307(a) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Act for a toxic pollutant which is present in the discharge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and such standard or prohibition is more stringent than any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limitation for such pollutant in this permit, this permit shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modified or revoked and reissued to conform to the toxic effluent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard or prohibition and the permittee so notified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->

Section B. Operation and Maintenance of Pollution Controls 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Proper Operation and Maintenance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The permittee shall at all times properly operate and maintain all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities and systems of treatment and control (and related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appurtenances) which are installed or used by the permittee to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieve compliance with the conditions of this permit. Proper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation and maintenance also includes adequate laboratory controls 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and appropriate quality assurance procedures. This provision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires the operation of back-up or auxiliary facilities or similar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems which are installed by a permittee only when the operation is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to achieve compliance with the conditions of the permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Need to Halt or Reduce not a Defense 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It shall not be a defense for a permittee in an enforcement action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that it would have been necessary to halt or reduce the permitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activity in order to maintain compliance with the condition of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Bypass of Treatment Facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a. Definitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Bypass
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means the intentional diversion of waste streams 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from any portion of a treatment facility, which is not a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designed or established operating mode for the facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Severe property damage
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means substantial physical damage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Bypass not exceeding limitations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The permittee may allow any bypass to occur which does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cause effluent limitations to be exceeded, but only if it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Paragraphs c. and d. of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Anticipated bypass. If the permittee knows in advance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if possible at least ten days before the date of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bypass; including an evaluation of the anticipated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality and effect of the bypass. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Unanticipated bypass. The permittee shall submit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice of an unanticipated bypass as required in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section D, Paragraph D&hyph;4 (24-hour notice). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Prohibition of bypass. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Bypass is prohibited and the Permit Issuing Authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may take enforcement action against a permittee for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bypass, unless: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personal injury, or severe and extensive property 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
damage; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such as maintenance of sufficient reserve holding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capacity, the use of auxiliary treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities, retention of untreated wastes, waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hauling, or maintenance during normal periods of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment downtime. This condition is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been installed in the exercise of reasonable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occurred during normal periods of equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The permittee submitted notices as required under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph c. of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Permit Issuing Authority may, within its authority, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse effects, if the Permit Issuing Authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determines that it will meet the three conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listed above in Paragraph d.(1) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

4. Upsets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
``Upset'' means an exceptional incident in which there is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unintentional and temporary noncompliance with technology based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permit effluent limitations because of factors beyond the control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the permittee. An upset does not include noncompliance to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintenance, or careless or improper operation. An upset 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constitutes an affirmative defense to an action brought for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance with such technology based permit limitation if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of 40 CFR 122.41(n)(3) are met. (Note that this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision does not apply to water quality requirements.)

Appropriate flow measurement devices and methods consistent with accepted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scientific practices shall be selected and used to insure the accuracy and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reliability of measurements of the volume of monitored discharges. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
devices shall be installed, calibrated and maintained to insure that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accuracy of the measurements are consistent with the accepted capability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of that type of device. Devices selected shall be capable of measuring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flows with a maximum deviation of less than 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

3. Concentration Measurements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a. The ``average monthly concentration'', is the sum of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentrations of all daily discharges sampled and/or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measured during a calendar month on which daily discharges 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are sampled and measured, divided by the number of daily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discharges sampled and/or measured during such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
month (arithmetic mean of the daily concentration values). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The daily concentration value is equal to the concentration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a composite sample or in the case of grab samples is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
arithmetic mean (weighted by flow value) of all the samples 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collected during the calendar day. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. The ``maximum daily concentration'', is the concentration of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a pollutant discharge during a calendar day. It is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified as ``Daily Maximum'' under ``Other Limits'' in Part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I of the permit and the highest such value recorded during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the reporting period is reported under the ``Maximum'' column 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under ``Quality'' on the DMR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Other Measurements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a. The effluent flow expressed as MGD is the 24 hour average 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flow averaged monthly. It is the arithmetic mean of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
total daily flows recorded during the calendar month. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where monitoring requirements for flow are specified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part I of the permit the flow rate values are reported in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the ``Average'' column under ``Quantity'' on the DMR.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
b. An ``instantaneous flow measurement'' is a measure of flow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taken at the time of sampling, when both the sample and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flow will be representative of the total discharge. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Where monitoring requirements for pH or dissolved oxygen 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are specified in Part I of the permit, the values are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generally reported in the ``Quality or Concentration'' column 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a. Grab Sample: A ``grab sample'' is a single influent or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effluent portion which is not a composite sample. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sample(s) shall be collected at the period(s) most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative of the total discharge. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A calendar day is defined as the period from midnight of one day 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
until midnight of the next day. However, for purposes of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permit, any consecutive 24-hour period that reasonably 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
represents the calendar day may be used for sampling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section F. Application Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a. For expired individual NPDES permits, dischargers desiring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coverage under this general permit are required to submit a notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of intent (NOI) to the Permit Issuing Authority. The NOI shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include (1) The name and address of the person that the permit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be issued to (2) the name, and address of the operation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including county location, (3) the applicable individual NPDES 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number(s), (4) the identification of any new discharge location 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not contained in the expired permit, (5) evidence that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation has obtained approval of a Remedial Action Plan (RAP) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Order from the FDEP, (6) a map showing the facility and discharge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
location (including latitude and longitude), and (7) the name of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the receiving water. Operators having several individual permits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are encouraged to consolidate requests for coverage into one NOI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for all individual permits. The previous submission of the proper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forms in the renewal application does not relieve the permittee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
desiring coverage under the general permit of the requirement to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
file a NOI. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Dischargers with current individual NPDES permits that desire 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coverage under this general permit are required to file an NOI to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Permit Issuing Authority at least thirty (30) days prior to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expiration of their current permit(s). The NOI shall contain the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same information specified in paragraph a above. Permittees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
desiring to renew their individual permit are required to submit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the appropriate application forms at least 180 days before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expiration of their individual permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Dischargers who have not previously obtained an individual NPDES 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permit are required to submit to EPA the FDEP approval order letter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approving the site RAP. The RAP approval order shall be attached 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to an NOI to be covered by the general permit and shall contain the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same information specified in paragraph a above. The application 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by Part I of the permit, within 30-days after commencement of discharge, permittees discharging to fresh
waters, which are surface waters in which the chloride concentration at the surface is less than 1500 milligrams per
liter, shall initiate the series of tests described below to evaluate whole effluent toxicity of the discharge from
the outfall. If more than one (1) outfall exists, separate tests will be performed on each outfall. All test species,
procedures and quality assurance criteria used shall be in accordance with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Methods for Measuring the Acute Toxicity of Effluents to Freshwater and Marine Organisms, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA/600/4&hyph;90/027F, or the most current edition. The dilution/control water used will be moderately hard water
as described in EPA/600/4&hyph;90/027F, Section 7, or the most current edition. A standard reference toxicant quality
assurance test shall be conducted concurrently with each species used in the toxicity tests and the results submitted
with the discharge monitoring report (DMR). Alternatively, if monthly QA/QC reference toxicant tests are conducted,
these results must be submitted with the DMR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. a. The permittee shall conduct 96-hour acute static-renewal multi-concentration toxicity tests using the daphnid
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Ceriodaphnia dubia
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and the fathead minnow (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pimephales promelas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). All tests shall be conducted on one grab sample of 100% final effluent. All tests shall be conducted on a control (0%)
and the following dilution concentrations at a minimum: 100.0%, 50.0%, 25.0%, 12.5%, and 6.25%. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. If control mortality exceeds 10% for either species in any test, the test(s) for that species (including the control)
shall be repeated. A test will be considered valid only if control mortality does not exceed 10% for either species.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The toxicity tests specified above shall be conducted once every month until three (3) valid monthly tests have
been completed, and once every year thereafter for the duration of the permit, unless notified otherwise by the permit
issuing authority. These tests are referred to as ``routine'' tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

in a ``routine'' test, the permittee shall conduct two additional acute toxicity tests in the same manner as the ``routine''
test on the specie(s) indicating unacceptable acute toxicity. For each additional test, the sample collection requirements
and test acceptability criteria specified in Section 1 above must be met for the test to be considered valid. The first
test shall begin within two weeks of the end of the ``routine'' tests, and shall be conducted weekly thereafter until
two additional, valid tests are completed. The additional tests will be used to determine if the toxicity found in
the ``routine'' test is still present. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Results from additional tests, required due to unacceptable acute toxicity in the ``routine'' test(s), must be

3. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The adoption of the State Underground Petroleum Environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Response (SUPER) Act of 1986 set standard procedures for the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Florida's Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their Division of Waste Management's Bureau of Waste Cleanup to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulate during cleanup processes undertaken at all petroleum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contamination sites. The SUPER Act was amended on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
February 20, 1990, and is currently referred to as Chapter 17&hyph;770, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petroleum Contamination Cleanup Criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chapter 17&hyph;770 gives the FDEP authority over cleanup operations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for areas which have been contaminated by fuels from petroleum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage systems. Chapter 17&hyph;770 also provides guidance for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permittees in preparing initial remedial actions (IRA's), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contamination assessment reports (CAR's), and remedial action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plans (RAP's) while assessing and delineating areas where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suspected petroleum contamination has occurred. In order to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilitate the authorization process for the potentially large 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of permittees who would be required to discharge treated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
groundwater to surface waters of Florida, the FDEP requested that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an NPDES general permit be issued to cover these facilities in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Florida. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing a draft permit on August 25, 1988 (53 FR 32442), issued 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a final NPDES general permit on July 17, 1989 (54 FR 29986), to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cover the facilities and similar types of discharges associated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with them. This NPDES General Permit was modified on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
August 29, 1991 (56 FR 42736), to address general dewatering for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uncontaminated discharges of produced groundwater and short term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discharges from facilities with treated groundwater. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modification also changed the number of the permit from FLG040001 to FLG830000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As of June, 1994, EPA has authorized over 350 facilities to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discharge under the general permit, and the FDEP estimates that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there are over 20,000 facilities that have reported suspected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petroleum leaks throughout the State of Florida. The current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permit FLG83000 expired on July 16, 1994, and numerous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities are either discharging under this permit or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitting Notices of Intent for coverage under this general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permit. Therefore, EPA Region IV is proposing to reissue the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NPDES General Permit No. FLG830000 to facilities in the State of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Florida to assist in permitting these types of activities. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for those facilities that were covered by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current NPDES General Permit before July 16, 1994, will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continued in force until reissuance of this general permit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occurs. However, once reissuance occurs, all facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
covered by this permit will be required to submit a NOI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requesting continued coverage under the reissued general permit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within sixty (60) days after reissuance of the general permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Permittees submitting NOI's after July 17, 1994, will not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided with a notification of coverage under the general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permit. These facilities will not be allowed to discharge until 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the date which the reissued NPDES General Permit, FLG830000, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
becomes effective, or until an individual permit is issued to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the facility.

4. General Information for This Florida General Permit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This general permit places limitations on discharges from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment systems which are used to treat common contaminants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found in petroleum fuels and allows the permittee to expedite 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
startup of a hydrocarbon recovery system once a leak has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detected and groundwater has been contaminated. The general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permit also allows general dewatering for uncontaminated sites. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Normally, such a recovery system consists of monitoring wells 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are used for sampling and delineating plume movement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recovery wells, which may be vertical or horizontal, are used to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recover contaminated groundwater in the impacted area. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
placement of recovery wells is generally determined after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration of geologic conditions and groundwater movement in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order to maximize recovery of petroleum hydrocarbons. The rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of movement by the contaminants is affected by the varying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permeability and adsorptive characteristics of the water-filled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pore spaces and depth of the water table. After the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contamination reaches the water table, the free-floating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminant is usually pumped from the recovery wells to an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above ground storage tank. Additionally, vapor recovery systems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are often used to remove volatiles from the soil. The dissolved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organics in the contaminated water are pumped to an air stripper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and treated using packed-tower aeration and, when necessary, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carbon adsorption. Both of these treatment processes have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proven effective in removing up to 99% of the volatile compounds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before discharge into surface waters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Florida FDEP and EPA Region IV estimates that of the sites 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for which a RAP is prepared in any given year, a maximum of 100 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities may propose discharge to surface water under this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general permit. In order to allow hydrocarbon recovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations to be performed without processing individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications for permit issuance, EPA proposes to reissue this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general permit to sources identified within the political 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
boundaries of the State of Florida. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This general permit may be used to authorize discharges of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treated groundwater and storm water incidental to groundwater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cleanup operations. Long term cleanups, over thirty (30) days, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must have an approved remedial action plan (RAP) before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitting a NOI to discharge under this NPDES General permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The RAP Approval Order must be submitted with the applicant's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NOI and is required before authorizing cleanups over thirty (30) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
days. This permit is not limited to cleanup operations funded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the State of Florida, but may cover all such cleanup 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations if the NOI requirements are satisfied.

5. Basis for Final Effluent Limits and Permit Conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The effluent limits for the general permit are based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment technology data obtained from previous individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application requests. The general permit has been written to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require an effluent limit on three (3) chemicals, i.e., benzene, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
naphthalene and lead. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Benzene is a potential carcinogen according to EPA 440/5&hyph;80&hyph;0180 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Florida has adopted a WQS for this parameter. However, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previous technology-based effluent limit of 1.0 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/l is more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stringent than Florida's water quality standard of 71.28 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/l at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(FAC 17&hyph;302.530(9)), dated April 25, 1993; therefore, the more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stringent technology based limit, which is also protective of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water quality, will be included in the reissued permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the ``Ambient Water Quality Document for Benzene,'' this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximum contaminant level for benzene is well below the 10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/l for naphthalene is more stringent than EPA's water quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
document for this parameter and should provide adequate protection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for more sensitive aquatic organisms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The pH requirements were established based on water quality criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at Florida Administrative Code (FAC) 17&hyph;303.530(52)(c), dated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
April 25, 1993. For fresh waters and coastal waters, the pH of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effluent shall not be lowered to less than 6.0 units for fresh 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waters, or less than 6.5 units for marine waters, or raised above 8.5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
units, unless the permittee submits data during the NOI request 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confirming a natural background pH outside of this range. If the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
natural background of the receiving water, as revealed by sampling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data from the permittee in the NOI request, is determined to be less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 6.0 standard units for fresh waters, or less than 6.5 standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
units in marine waters, the pH shall not vary below natural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
background or vary more than one (1) unit above natural background. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If natural background of the receiving water, as revealed by sampling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data from the permittee in the NOI request, is determined to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
higher than 8.5 units, the pH shall not vary above natural background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or vary more than one (1) unit below natural background. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuous monitoring for pH is an option granted to the permittee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and is based on &sect;401.17 of the Clean Water Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The permittee may request an individual permit to seek less stringent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
end-of-pipe effluent limitations for benzene, total lead, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
naphthalene dependent upon resulting instream concentrations during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical low flows of the receiving stream.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The groundwater reporting requirements for the parameters: TOC, pH, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Total Recoverable Metals which include Mercury, Cadmium, Copper, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lead, Zinc, Chromium (Hexavalent), Benzene and Naphthalene, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine if contamination exists from other sources are based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 308(a) of the Clean Water Act. The screening values for TOC, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Benzene, and Naphthalene are based on the final August 29, 1991, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modification (56 FR 42739) and the standards for total recoverable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
metals are based on the most current Florida Water Quality Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for total recoverable metals at FAC Section 17&hyph;302.530 [4&hyph;25&hyph;93]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As with any petroleum fuel, other aromatic compounds will be present 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
once testing has occurred. Other volatiles will be present in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
untreated groundwater in greater concentrations than benzene. Past 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experience in treatment design has shown that these organics can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectively treated before discharging to surface waters. According 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the ``Toxicant Profile for the ALKYL BENZENES,'' (Ethylbenzene, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Isopropylbenzene, Toluene, Xylene) prepared for Florida's DEP by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Center of Biomedical and Toxicological Research at Florida State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
University, levels for these ALKYL BENZENES of 100&hyph;200

m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/l were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended for the protection of aquatic organisms and human health. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These recommendations are below EPA's ``Ambient Water Quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Criteria'' documents recommendation for human health which suggest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels of 1400 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/l for Ethylbenzene and Toluene. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The recommended treatment technology of air stripping and, when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary, carbon adsorption, will reduce the benzene concentration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to below 1.0 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/l. Therefore, EPA will not impose specific limits on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the other pollutants which may occur since meeting the limits set in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this permit should reduce the other pollutants well below those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels allowable based on Florida's water quality standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, the effluent shall not be lethal to more than 50% of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate fish or invertebrate test organism in a 96-hour static 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
renewal test. Whole Effluent Toxicity (WET) monitoring tests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performed by six (6) facilities between May 8, 1991 thru March, 1994 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicated that these effluents were toxic and, therefore, have the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonable potential to violate Florida's water quality standards at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAC Section 17&hyph;4.244(3)(a). Because previous 48-hour static WET 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring tests have revealed that these effluents have the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential of being toxic, toxicity testing requirements as authorized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and required by 40 CFR Section 122.44(d)(1)(iv), and contained in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part I, A.1 and A.2 and in Part V have been included to ensure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the effluent from these facilities conforms with the FAC. An LC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
100% or less in a test of 96 hours duration or less will constitute a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violation of FAC (February 2, 1994) Section 17&hyph;4.244(3)(a) and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terms of this permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the recovery wells in most instances are placed in areas of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
highest contamination, it is reasonable to conclude that the greatest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential for toxicity should occur during the initial startup stages 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of operation. Therefore, an initial frequency of once every month 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for three (3) months is included in these requirements to indicate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxicity and determine treatment performance of these facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediately after commencement of discharge. If no toxicity is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confirmed, the frequency is then reduced to yearly since the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permittee will be required to meet effluent limitations and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential for toxicity is at a minimum. Failure to demonstrate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with the acute toxicity requirement will constitute a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violation of the terms of the permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The sample type for all biomonitoring is ``Grab'' in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part V of this general permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The permittee is required to develop and implement a Best Management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Practices (BMPs) plan in conjunction with development of the Remedial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Action Plan required by FDEP. BMPs are actions or procedures to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prevent or minimize the potential for the release of toxic pollutants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or hazardous substances in significant amounts to surface waters. Additionally, for long term cleanups, the permittee
shall develop a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pollution Prevention Plan which considers alternatives for preventing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and reducing impacts to surface waters in accordance with Part IV.

6. Treatment Technology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
According to EPA's publication entitled ``Treatment of Volatile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Organic Compounds in Drinking Water,'' a drinking water research 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experiment was conducted on spiked water using one organic volatile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and then by combining two volatiles. The experiment used aeration as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the treatment process. It was discovered that no difference was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
observed in treatment efficiency when applying aeration to one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organic chemical or a combination of volatiles. In this particular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experiment an overall efficiency of 92% was obtained. Most petroleum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuels consist of a combination of volatiles and aromatics, each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different, based on additives included during refining of the fuel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In case studies revealed in the Environmental Science and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Engineering's document ESE No. 84&hyph;912&hyph;0300, packed tower aeration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
utilizing different packing materials, varying flow paths and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
air-to-water ratios have been proven effective in removing over 99% 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the volatiles. Some particular compounds are not as easily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
air-stripped as others which would necessitate the need for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combination treatment design used in conjunction with aeration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Carbon adsorption has been proven effective in removing organics from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water until the influent concentration is in equilibrium with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effluent and the organics no longer adhere to the carbon surface. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Adsorption has been used successfully in removing less volatile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compounds of higher molecular weight. Other remediation techniques 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently being deployed include vapor recovery systems and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bioremediation which enhances biological activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to (EPA 570/9&hyph;84&hyph;005) entitled ``Adsorption Techniques in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Drinking Water Treatment'' the efficiency of carbon adsorption was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proven effective during a case study in Hialeah, Florida at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Preston water treatment plant. In this study, groundwater from a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drinking water aquifer was spiked with higher molecular weight 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extractables before treating the water with granular activated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carbon. It was found that more than 90% removal of the spiked 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compounds was obtained. The combination of air-stripping with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adsorption usually extends the adsorptive life of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activated carbon and leads to more efficient treatment, but is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
always required or recommended in every situation.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Communications Commission has expanded the scope of the issues to be reconsidered in its grant of three
applications for authority to resell international switched services of other carriers using a ``call-back'' configuration.
The comments supporting an AT&amp;T petition for reconsideration in this proceeding raised issues involving complex
questions of international law, international comity and the law of foreign countries, including the allegation
that call-back services employing an uncompleted call signaling configuration violate international law. Therefore,
the Commission is seeking additional comments from the parties and members of the public on all of the issues raised
in the comments supporting AT&amp;T's petition. The Commission also is seeking the advice of the Department of State
regarding the issues of international law, international comity, and the laws of foreign countries. Further, in
order to augment the record with respect to AT&amp;T's assertion that uncompleted call signalling violates the Federal
wire fraud statute, the Commission will seek the advice of the Department of Justice on this issue.

By the Commission:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. On May 11, 1994, the Commission granted the above-referenced Section 214 applications of VIA USA, Ltd., Telegroup,
Inc., and Discount Call International Co. to resell international switched services of other carriers using a ``call-back''
configuration.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 This service allows a customer in a foreign country to use foreign facilities to dial a telephone number in the United
States and receive dial tone at a switch at the reseller's U.S. location, which the customer can then use to place a call
via an outbound switched service of a U.S. carrier. The calls originating at U.S. locations are billed at U.S.-tariffed
rates.

2. AT&amp;T petitioned to deny these applications alleging that this service constitutes an unreasonable practice
under Section 201 of the Communications Act (``the Act'') and may constitute wire fraud. We denied AT&amp;T's petition.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 On June 10, 1994, AT&amp;T filed a petition for reconsideration asking us to find that uncompleted call signalling
is an unreasonable practice under Section 201(b) of the Act, is contrary to the public interest standard of Section
214 of the Act, violates Section 202(a) of the Act, and violates the Federal wire fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. 1343.

In order to develop a complete record on the issues raised by AT&amp;T's petition, we extended on our own motion for
30 days the time for the filing of comments. ``Pleading Cycle Extended for Comments on AT&amp;T's Petition for Reconsideration
of Commission Order Authorizing Three International Resale Carriers Proposing to Provide `Call-Back' Services,''

3. We received comments in support of AT&amp;T's petition from MCI Telecommunications Corporation (MCI), Sprint
Communication Company L.P. (Sprint), and The Regional Technical Commission on Telecommunications of Central America
(COMTELCA) and the National Telecommunications Institute of Panama (INTEL) (collectively referred to as COMTELCA/INTEL).
Oppositions to AT&amp;T's petition were filed by VIA USA, Ltd. (VIA USA), Telegroup, Inc. (Telegroup) and the Telecommunication
Resellers Association (TRA).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
4. Both VIA USA and Telegroup filed motions to strike the comments filed by MCI, Sprint and COMTELCA/INTEL. AT&amp;T,
MCI, Sprint and COMTELCA/INTEL opposed the motions to strike the supporting comments. VIA USA and Telegroup argue
in their motions that the comments supporting AT&amp;T's petition are untimely, procedurally defective requests
for the Commission to reconsider its initial grant of Section 214 authority to the above-captioned applicants. In
particular, VIA USA and Telegroup state that Section 1.106(g) of the Commission's Rules only contemplates the filing
of ``oppositions'' to petitions for reconsideration, not comments in support of such petitions. Further, they state
that, in addition to repeating and expounding upon AT&amp;T's arguments in its petition, the COMTELCA/INTEL comments
raise new issues relating to the legality of call-back services under international law and the law of foreign countries.
Alternatively, VIA USA and Telegroup contend that, if we do not grant their motions to strike, we should extend the
reply period several months because COMTELCA/INTEL have raised new arguments not previously raised by any party,
which significantly expand the scope of the proceeding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The comments supporting AT&amp;T's petition raise issues involving complex questions of international law,
international comity and the law of foreign countries. In particular, COMTELCA/INTEL raise the argument that call-back
services employing an uncompleted call signaling configuration violate international law, i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Article 1.5 and 3.3 of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) Regulations.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 In addition, COMTELCA/INTEL's comments also claim that the applicants may not offer uncompleted call signalling
services except pursuant to appropriate operating agreements with foreign telecommunications administrations.
Moreover, COMTELCA/INTEL have submitted evidence as to the effect that our authorization of this service may have
on international comity.

In the initial proceeding, the record did not address the argument that the proposed call-back services violated
international law. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
See VIA USA, Ltd. et al.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
COMTELCA/INTEL further contend that there are other forms of call-back services that raise similar issues under
international law and the law of foreign countries which the Commission did not address in its initial decision. For
instance, COMTELCA/INTEL reference the ``hot line'' method whereby a U.S. reseller continuously places calls to
the telephone of a subscriber located outside the United States. The called party's telephone has a disconnected
ringer. When the called party wants to access a U.S. dial tone to place an international call to a U.S. location or elsewhere,
he or she simply picks up the receiver and ``answers'' one of several thousand continuous calls made to that particular
phone during the day and receives a dial tone at the reseller's U.S. location. COMTELCA/INTEL assert that the international
law and public interest issues raised by this practice should be addressed in this proceeding, or, alternatively,
should be addressed in a rulemaking proceeding that covers the full range of issues raised by the proliferation of
call-back methods used to provide U.S. dial tone to foreign parties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
6. We conclude that the issues raised in the comments supporting AT&amp;T's petition merit examination. Therefore,
we will, on our own motion, seek additional comment from the parties and members of the public on all of the issues raised
in the comments supporting AT&amp;T's petition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Because we have decided on our own motion to expand the scope of this reconsideration proceeding, we find that the
motions to strike the supporting comments of MCI, Sprint and COMTELCA/INTEL are moot. These supporting comments
address the issues which we will be examining, and therefore will be made part of the record. We will, however, grant
VIA USA's and Telegroup's alternative request that we further extend the period for filing comments. In addition,
we will seek the advice of the Department of State regarding the issues of international law, international comity,
and the laws of foreign countries. Further, in order to augment the record with respect to AT&amp;T's assertion that
uncompleted call signalling violates the federal wire fraud statute, we also will seek the advice of the Department
of Justice on this issue. Finally, as noted above, because of the general importance of the issues in this case, we will
entertain additional comments from all interested members of the public as well as from the parties to this proceeding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. This Section 214 proceeding will continue to be conducted as a non-restricted proceeding in which written and oral

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
47 CFR Part 1206.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Accordingly, it is ordered that the comments of MCI, Sprint and COMTELCA/INTEL are accepted into the record of this
proceeding, and Telegroup's and VIA USA's motions to strike the comments are dismissed as moot.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. It is further ordered that this proceeding is opened to the general public and interested persons are invited to
file comments on any of the issues raised in AT&amp;T's petition or the supporting comments by October 14, 1994, and
reply comments by November 14, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. It is further ordered that the Secretary shall serve a copy of this Order on each party to this proceeding by certified
mail.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the terms of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (the Act), the Department of Health and Human
Services is soliciting nominations for three vacancies (seats) on the U.S. Advisory Board on Child Abuse and Neglect
(the Board). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Membership 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board consists of 15 members appointed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary). Thirteen
are appointed from the general public and two from the Federal Government. In making all 15 appointments, the Secretary
is required by the Act to ensure that ethnic and racial minorities and diverse geographic areas are represented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All 15 persons appointed must possess general knowledge about child maltreatment (i.e., policy; prevention; intervention;
treatment; and research). In addition, among the 13 members from the general public, 11 must represent one of the following
areas: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;the legal aspects of child maltreatment; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;the psychological aspects; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;the social services aspects; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;the medical aspects; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;the role of State and local government in the prevention and treatment of child abuse and neglect; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;the role of organizations providing services to disabled persons; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;the role of organizations providing services to adolescents; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;the role of elementary and secondary school teaching; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;the role of parent self-help organizations; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;the role of parents' groups; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;the role of voluntary groups. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to qualify for selection as such a representative, each individual must possess specific knowledge in the
area which he/she represents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Responsibilities and Duties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Among the responsibilities the Act requires the Board to perform is the preparation of an annual report to the Secretary
of Health and Human Services, appropriate committees of the Congress, and the Director of the National Center on Child
Abuse and Neglect. In addition, the Board holds hearings, conducts symposia, and issues position papers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its annual reports, the Board is charged with evaluating the nation's efforts to accomplish the purposes of CAPTA
and developing recommendations about ways that those efforts can be improved. The 1990 report of the Board is entitled,
Child Abuse and Neglect: Critical First Steps in Response to a National Emergency; the 1991 report, Creating Caring
Communities: Blueprint for an Effective Federal Policy on Child Abuse and Neglect; the 1992 report, The Continuing
Child Protection Emergency: A Challenge to the Nation; and the 1993 report, Neighbors Helping Neighbors: A New National
Strategy for the Protection of Children. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board usually meets three times a year, and, occasionally, four times a year. Meetings last three to four days.
Between meetings, much of its work is accomplished by conference call. Service on the Board is extremely demanding
of both time and effort. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Duties of Board members are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;to serve as the Board authority in one or more areas of expertise, keeping current on developments in those areas;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;to be conversant with the extensive array of background information provided to members prior to meetings
and conference calls; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;to attend meetings; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;to participate in conference calls; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;to suggest materials to staff for distribution as background information; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;to author portions of Board publications; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;to edit Board publications; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;to avoid all possible conflicts of interest between Board membership and non-Board activities.

Nomination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is soliciting nominations for the three seats to be occupied by members possessing specific expertise
in: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;the social services aspects of child maltreatment; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;the role of elementary and secondary school teaching; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;an at-large seat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The terms of the three seats will expire on May 29, 1999. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nominations may be made for one's self or for someone else. The same individual may be nominated for a seat in more than
one category. Nominations should be made in the form of a letter which indicates the seat or seats for which the nominee
is being nominated and provides information about the qualifications for office of the nominee. A current curriculum
vita for the nominee should be attached to the letter. (If the nominee is not the person submitting the nomination,
a letter from the nominee indicating a willingness to serve should be attached). All nominations will be evaluated.
To assist in that evaluation, persons submitting nominations may wish to provide the following kinds of information
about the nominee's qualifications: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;What general knowledge about child maltreatment (i.e., policy; prevention; intervention; treatment; and
research) does the nominee possess and how has he/she gained that knowledge? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;What specific knowledge does the nominee possess about the aspect of child maltreatment which he/she is being
nominated to represent on the Board and how has he/she gained that knowledge? (If the individual is being nominated
for more than one seat, separate answers should be provided setting forth the individual's specific knowledge in
connection with each seat). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;What materials has the nominee authored, what presentations has he/she made, what meetings has he/she planned,
et cetera, which shed light on both the general and/or specific knowledge of the nominee? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;What skills does the nominee possess which will allow him/her to contribute substantially to the conduct of
Board business and what highlights and achievements in the nominee's career shed light on such skills? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Does the nominee possess other abilities which are relevant to his/her appointment to the Board? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Will the nominee's schedule permit him/her to devote a significant segment of time to Board activities? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Is the nominee's ethnic or racial background that of an American Indian or Alaskan Native, Asian or Pacific
Islander, African-American, or Hispanic? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each letter of nomination should be accompanied by at least one but no more than three letters of reference attesting
to the nominee's qualifications for office. Authors of reference letters may include but are not limited to: elected
officials (Federal, State, or local); persons in the field of child maltreatment; and persons in the subject area
of the seat being sought. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary will select the three persons to be named to the Board from among those individuals either who are nominated
in response to this announcement or who are otherwise qualified to serve. After the Secretary reaches a decision,
those persons selected to serve will receive a letter of invitation. Service will begin on May 29, 1995, or the first
Board meeting thereafter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nomination packages (letter of nomination; attachment(s); and accompanying letter(s) of reference) must be postmarked
no later than October 31, 1994. Packages received with a postmark later than October 31, 1994 will not be considered.

FDA public advisory committee meetings may have as many as four separable portions: (1) An open public hearing, (2)
an open committee discussion, (3) a closed presentation of data, and (4) a closed committee deliberation. Every advisory
committee meeting shall have an open public hearing portion. Whether or not it also includes any of the other three
portions will depend upon the specific meeting involved. There are no closed portions for the meetings announced
in this notice. The dates and times reserved for the open portions of each committee meeting are listed above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The open public hearing portion of each meeting shall be at least 1 hour long unless public participation does not last
that long. It is emphasized, however, that the 1 hour time limit for an open public hearing represents a minimum rather
than a maximum time for public participation, and an open public hearing may last for whatever longer period the committee
chairperson determines will facilitate the committee's work.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public hearings are subject to FDA's guideline (subpart C of 21 CFR part 10) concerning the policy and procedures for
electronic media coverage of FDA's public administrative proceedings, including hearings before public advisory

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) announces the final program requirements and review criteria
for fiscal year (FY) 1994 Cooperative Agreements for Centers for Medical Education Research. These cooperative
agreements are funded under the authority of section 781, title VII of the Public Health Service Act, as amended by
the Health Professions Education Extension Amendments of 1992, Pub. L. 102&hyph;408, dated October 13, 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 781 authorizes research on certain health professions issues. For this cooperative agreement program,
research focuses on the medical education aspects of this legislation and ``medical education'' is defined as education
provided to individuals working toward the M.D. or D.O. degree, or as post-graduate M.D./D.O. education in an accredited
residency or fellowship program.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 602 of Public Law 102&hyph;585, the ``Veterans Health Care Act of 1992'' (the ``Act''), enacted section 340B
of the Public Health Service Act (``PHS Act''), ``Limitation on Prices of Drugs Purchased by Covered Entities.''
Section 340B provides that a manufacturer who sells covered outpatient drugs to eligible entities must sign a pharmaceutical
pricing agreement (the ``Agreement'') with the Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services, in which the
manufacturer agrees to charge a price for covered outpatient drugs that will not exceed the amount determined under
a statutory formula.

Manufacturers should not be required to provide discounts to outpatient facilities that are included on the Medicare
cost reports of eligible DSHs until the PHS Office of Drug Pricing includes the names of the eligible outpatient facilities
on the master list of eligible covered entities.

When an eligible DSH submits the list of all outpatient facilities (on-site and off-site) included on its Medicare
cost report and Medicaid billing status information to the Office of Drug Pricing and the Office adds these facilities
to the master list of eligible and participating entities during regular quarterly updates, the facilities will
then be able to access PHS discount pricing. This information will be posted on the Electronic Data Retrieval System
(EDRS), maintained by the Office of Drug Pricing. To access this information call (301) 594&hyph;4992.

The proposed guidelines have created a new definition of ``DSH'' which appears to be within the realm of legislating
as opposed to rulemaking.

Section 340B(a)(4) of the PHS Act lists the various groups of entities eligible to receive PHS discount pricing. Section
340B(a)(4)(L) describes a subset of ``hospitals'' as defined in section 1886(d)(1)(B) of the Social Security Act
as eligible to participate in the program. Because section 1886 addresses Medicare payment for hospital inpatient
services only, the scope of the term ``hospital'' has been limited to the hospital inpatient services. However, section
340B deals exclusively with outpatient drugs. Although Congress clearly intends this narrow definition be used
to identify the Medicare disproportionate share hospitals which are eligible for section 340B drug discounts, we
do not believe it is reasonable to use this same definition to limit where the section 340B outpatient drugs can be used.
Some disproportionate share hospitals offer outpatient services in off-site or satellite outpatient facilities.
Further, the movement of nonprofit hospitals in recent years has been to reorganize and offer a variety of services,
other than traditional inpatient hospital services, through separate divisions, lines of business, or entities.
Therefore, for purposes of section 340B drug discounts, a further interpretation of ``hospital'' is needed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In some instances, the Medicare cost report does not include all of the clinics and services which should be eligible
for the PHS discount pricing. For example, hospitals refer patients for specific types of treatments to other hospitals,
such as large teaching hospitals which have specialized equipment and medical personnel. Further, hospitals are
establishing separate primary care services in different areas of the community. These facilities are often free-standing
and not included on the DSH Medicare cost report, but generally are customers of the hospitals and have limited financial
resources.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although it is understandable that the DSH would desire to obtain PHS pricing for these various facilities, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statute clearly states that it is only the DSH that qualifies for discount pricing. We have attempted to define DSH
in a manner consistent with HCFA policy guidelines (Provider Certification, State Operation Manual, section 2024).
Only outpatient facilities which are an integral component of the DSH will be included on the DSH Medicare cost report,
and only these facilities will be eligible for PHS discount pricing.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed guidelines would permit any health care entity, by means of its business relations with other health
care entities, to make itself eligible for PHS pricing. Any clinic, facility, or community hospital affiliated with
a DSH could consolidate its cost reporting requirements and use the Medicare provider number of the DSH to make itself
eligible for PHS pricing. This is not consistent with Congress's intent in precisely defining a list of entities eligible
for the PHS discount pricing.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Congress referred to section 1886 of the Social Security Act (Medicare inpatient hospital payment) for the definition
of DSH; therefore, it is reasonable to utilize existing Medicare rules to determine eligibility for PHS discount
pricing. The proposed Medicare cost report test was developed by Medicare officials and used, in part, to determine
whether a facility is a component of a hospital. If an outpatient facility does not share in the hospital cost report,
it is properly viewed as an independent, free-standing facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When a DSH attempts to certify multiple components as a single hospital for purposes of Medicare certification, it
must follow guidelines developed by HCFA. These guidelines (Provider Certification, State Operation Manual, section
2024) establish tests to determine whether an additional hospital facility, geographically separated but in the
same metropolitan area, is a separate facility from or a component of a single hospital. These tests include: (a) all
components subject to the control and direction of one common owner (i.e., governing body) which is responsible for
the operational decisions of the entire hospital enterprise; (b) one chief medical officer who reports directly
to the governing body and who is responsible for all medical staff activities of all components; (c) integration of
the organized medical staff (e.g., all medical staff members having privileges at all components); and (d) one chief
executive officer through whom all administrative authority flows and who exercises control and surveillance over
all administrative activities of all components. This does not preclude the establishment of a deputy or assistant
executive officer position. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the off-site clinic meets these tests, it would be included in the DSH Medicare cost report. This test clearly determines
whether a facility is an integral part of a DSH hospital, and is an appropriate standard to determine eligibility.
It incorporates Medicare criteria that are not ambiguous and forms an independent and objective basis on which to
determine eligibility.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed guidelines should be applied uniformly to all DSH outpatient facilities, regardless of whether they
fit the common perception of a traditional hospital outpatient clinic (e.g., include facilities that serve prison
inmates, HMOs, home infusion and home health patients). Anything short of this would be extremely difficult to administer
since separating traditional from non-traditional facilities would be a highly subjective and time-consuming
exercise. Further, PHS should include in the final notice a specific definition for eligible ``outpatient facility.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 340B(b) of the PHS Act refers to section 1927(k) of the Social Security Act for the definition of ``covered
outpatient drug.'' This definition does not include any limitations on outpatient settings, and there is no requirement
that the covered drug be used in a ``traditional'' outpatient setting. Any outpatient facility included on an eligible
DSH's Medicare cost report can access PHS pricing if it is included on the master list of eligible entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are certain circumstances which might prevent an otherwise eligible outpatient facility from billing under
the DSH's provider number (e.g., State or local laws requiring a facility or pharmacy to bill all third party payers
directly). In these instances, the facility should be permitted to access PHS discount pricing if the eligible DSH
facility can demonstrate that the pharmacy would meet the proposed Medicare test but for the unique circumstances.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The test used to determine the eligibility of hospital outpatient facilities must incorporate criteria that form
an independent and objective basis. This will provide fair and easy administration. To include a ``but for'' test
would create a difficult standard to administer. If an outpatient facility is not included on the eligible DSH's Medicare
cost report, it will not meet the requirements for eligibility.

purchasing arrangement for covered outpatient drugs, (3) has not billed Medicaid for the covered outpatient drugs
for which retroactive discounts are being requested, and (4) has preserved its right to such discounts by sending
manufacturers a letter requesting such refunds and providing adequate documentation of drug purchases by June 13,

There is no definition of the term ``patient,'' thereby permitting a DSH to distribute discounted drugs to virtually
anyone it can argue is a patient without running afoul of the drug resale prohibition of section 340B(a)(5)(B) of the

(C) DSH Outpatient Facility Guidelines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Set forth below are the final guidelines regarding the inclusion of DSH outpatient facilities: The outpatient facility
is considered an integral part of the ``hospital'' and therefore eligible for section 340B drug discounts if it is
a reimbursable facility included on the hospital's Medicare cost report. For example, if a hospital with one Medicare
provider number meets the disproportionate share criteria and this hospital has associated outpatient clinics
whose costs are included in the Medicare cost report, these clinics would also be eligible for section 340B drug discounts.
However, free-standing clinics of the hospital that submit their own cost reports using different Medicare numbers
(not under the single hospital Medicare provider number) would not be eligible for this benefit.

A DSH, eligible for PHS pricing, must first request that the Office of Drug Pricing include in the PHS drug discount
program the outpatient facilities that are included in its Medicare cost report. A list of these outpatient facilities
along with Medicaid billing status information must be included with the request. Second, an appropriate official
of the DSH must sign a statement that he/she is familiar with HCFA guidelines concerning Medicare certification of
hospital components as one cost center, has examined the list of outpatient facilities, and certifies that the facilities
are correctly included on the DSH's Medicare cost report. When these facilities are added to the master list of eligible
and participating covered entities, the off-site facilities will be able to access PHS discount pricing. On-site
clinics that are not included on the Medicare cost report will not be eligible for PHS discount pricing. This information
will be posted on the Electronic Data Retrieval System (EDRS), maintained by the Office of Drug Pricing, on a quarterly
basis. To access this information, call (301) 594&hyph;4992.

DSHs which have questions concerning this process, or manufacturers which have questions concerning the eligibility
of certain DSH outpatient clinics, should contact Elizabeth Hickey (301&hyph;594&hyph;4353), at the Office of

Section 202(x)(1) of the Social Security Act (the Act) requires SSA to suspend old-age, survivors and disability
insurance benefits of certain prisoners. Section 1611(e)(1)(A) of the Act provides, with some exceptions, that
inmates in public institutions are not eligible for payments under the supplemental security income program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this matching program is to assist SSA in enforcing these provisions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background_What is the Process Reengineering Program?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
SSA began an Agency-wide program of Process Reengineering in the summer of 1993. The Process Reengineering Program
is one way that SSA is seeking to improve its overall delivery of service to the public.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Process Reengineering Program essentially asks the question, ``If SSA had the opportunity today to design its
processes, what would they look like?'' In other words, ``how would we design a process if we were starting over?''
The Program
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
s objective is to fundamentally rethink and radically redesign SSA's processes to achieve dramatic improvements
in critical measures of performance such as quality of service, speed and efficiency. The ultimate goal is to achieve
dramatically improved levels of service from the customer's perspective while enriching and improving the work
lives of employees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Process Reengineering Program is the culmination of an investigation by SSA of the reengineering efforts conducted
by private companies, public organizations, academic institutions, and consulting firms with ``hands on'' experience.
The positive findings from that investigation, combined with concerns about the impact of current and projected
workloads, led SSA to conclude that a disability claims process reengineering effort was critical to its objectives
of providing world-class service to the public and restoring public confidence in its disability programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on analysis of what has worked best in other organizations, SSA developed a customized reengineering methodology.
This methodology used a team approach (composed of SSA and State Disability Determination Service (DDS) employees)
and combined a strong customer focus with classic management analysis techniques to intensely review a single business
process. While the reengineering team was comprised of employees who were knowledgeable about the current disability
process, the methodology focused heavily on obtaining the views of a broad segment of individuals, groups and organizations
involved both internally and externally to the process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
What Does the Disability Reengineering Project Address?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Despite the outstanding efforts of SSA and State DDS employees throughout the country, the Agency continues to have
difficulty providing a satisfactory level of service to claimants filing for disability benefits. The steps in the
current disability process have not changed in any important way since the beginning of the Disability Insurance
program in the 1950s. Yet, case loads, types of disabilities, and the demographic characteristics of individuals
with disabilities who are potentially eligible for benefits have changed radically.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State DDSs make the initial decisions about whether an applicant for Disability Insurance or SSI benefits is disabled.
In Fiscal Year (FY) 1995, it is estimated that SSA will forward 2.9 million initial disability claims to the DDSs for
disability determinations_a 69 percent increase over FY 1990 levels. Similarly, the number of requests for an administrative
law judge hearing on denied claims is expected to increase to 542,000, a 75 percent increase over FY 1990 levels. Recent
management initiatives to improve service through resource reallocations and productivity enhancements have
not been sufficient to deal successfully with the workload demands and it is expected that disability processing
times and backlogs will continue to grow under the present process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The result is that many claimants have to wait much too long at each stage of the process. SSA and State DDS employees
are working longer and harder, while becoming increasingly frustrated about their inability to provide the type
of service the public deserves.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For these reasons, the first SSA reengineering project focused on the process of filing for benefits_beginning with
the initial claim and continuing through the payment of benefits or the final administrative appeal_under both the
Disability Insurance program and the disability portion of the SSI program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The parameters set for this first project restricted the team from proposing any changes to the statutory definition
of disability or the amount of benefits for which individuals are eligible. The project also did not address vocational
rehabilitation, work incentives or continuing disability reviews as these issues are being addressed by SSA in other
ways.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->
How Was the Disability Process Reengineering Project Accomplished?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Disability Process Reengineering Project began in October 1993 when a team of 18 Federal and State employees came
together for the purpose of reengineering the initial and administrative appeals system for determining an individual's
entitlement to Disability Insurance and SSI disability payments. After completing their initial tasks of analyzing
the current process, obtaining process improvement recommendations from over 3,600 individuals and groups internal
and external to the disability claim process, benchmarking with public and private sector organizations to identify
``best practices,'' and modeling theoretical processes via computer, the team presented an initial proposal on
March 31, 1994. (A copy of this proposal was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, Vol. 59, No. 73, on Friday, April 15, 1994.) The team distributed the proposal widely throughout SSA, the State DDSs,
and to interested public and private individuals and organizations and asked the audience for reactions to the proposal,
items of concern, and additional ideas for improvement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the comment period that began on April 1, 1994, and ended on June 14, 1994, the team received over 6,000 written
responses from SSA and DDS employees, employee unions, professional associations, members of the public, claimant
representatives, physicians, State governors, claimant advocacy groups, Federal entities, and other interested
parties. Members of the team read and analyzed every one of the comments so that no idea, reaction or nuance would be
overlooked. Group employee feedback discussions were held in over 80 sites across the country to facilitate dialogue
with almost 2,000 SSA and DDS employees. In addition, team members conducted briefings and spoke with more than 3,000
individuals about their reactions to the proposal during this period. A public forum was also held in Washington,
D.C. A summary of the comments received is provided in Appendix III of the attached plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After considering all comments, the team reviewed the breadth of the initial proposal to determine concepts that
needed to be revised, language that needed to be clarified, and details that needed to be added. On June 30, 1994, the
team submitted its revised proposal to the Commissioner of Social Security. Subsequently, after careful consideration,
on September 7, 1994, the Commissioner released SSA's Plan for a New Disability Claim Process. Accepting all of the
concepts contained in the team's June 30 revised proposal as SSA's plan, the Commissioner released the redesign plan
with the understanding that certain concepts (primarily aspects of the simplified disability methodology) would
require extensive research and testing before determining how quickly they could be implemented.

What Service Improvements Does the Plan for a New Disability Claim Process Offer?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commissioner established five primary objectives against which SSA will measure the success of a redesigned
disability claim process:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_ The process is user friendly for claimants and those who assist them;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_ The right decision is made the first time;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_ Decisions are made and effectuated quickly;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_ The process is efficient; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_ Employees find the work satisfying.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By focusing on these objectives, the redesigned process replaces an existing process that is slow, labor-intensive,
and paper reliant with a seamless claim process that makes better use of technology, eliminates fragmentation and
duplication, promotes more flexible use of resources, and results in dramatic improvements in public service. With
the redesign plan, SSA has embarked on an era of change that will revitalize and streamline the way it delivers disability
claim service to the public to achieve greater quality, speed and efficiency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specific customer focused improvements that the plan will offer include a process that will:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Be a user-friendly, more accessible and customer focused process, that ensures benefits are paid to all eligible
individuals as quickly as possible. Case processing times will be cut in half once the new process is fully implemented;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Provide complete and accurate consumer-oriented information to applicants throughout the process and allow
individuals who are able to be full partners in the processing of their claim;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Utilize modern technology and highly skilled and trained employees to deliver high-quality service in an
accountable, cost-efficient manner;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Implement a comprehensive quality assurance program that continually strives to improve operational excellence
and the level of service that disability applicants receive; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Use education and training opportunities to enrich employees
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
 jobs, increase their job satisfaction and quality of work life.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A detailed description of the redesigned disability claim process is included in the attached plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
What Happens Next?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
SSA will move quickly to begin implementing the redesigned disability claim process. Some new process features,
involving research and changes to regulations and computer systems, necessitate a phased-in approach. Other new
process features can be implemented in the near-term and, when combined with special short-term initiatives to address
case backlogs, will result in better service for individuals currently filing for disability benefits. The goal
is to make near-term, visible improvements while at the same time building for long-term results.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SSA will make an unprecedented effort to conduct a full and open dialogue with both SSA and non-SSA audiences as the
Agency moves through the implementation phase. The Agency will use all appropriate modes of communication to ensure
that necessary information about implementation activities is regularly and widely disseminated and will develop
appropriate feedback channels to permit the meaningful exchange of information.

Social Security Administration's Plan for a New Disability Claim Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It was 10 months ago that I challenged this Agency to restore public confidence in its programs, provide world-class
service to its customers, and ensure a nurturing environment for its employees. While there is much left to be done
to meet these goals, I am proud to say that with the release of this document we have reached a major milestone toward
meeting the challenges I set forth. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This document lays the foundation for the new disability claim process. It is a solid foundation upon which to build_it
provides a broad description of the new process, with the detailed elements of the process to be developed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new design gives us the opportunity to develop relationships with the public and our employees that are based on
open communication, partnership, and the belief that our customers need to be provided as much information as possible
about the process and the program. I believe this new design holds the potential to provide the world-class service
I pledged to furnish the American people_it will be user-friendly, it will ensure the right decision is made the first
time, it will allow decisions to be made and effectuated quickly, and it will be an efficient process. Just as importantly,
the new design will also provide our employees with a nurturing environment through empowerment, education, challenge,
career opportunity, and professionalism. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As the discussions about our reengineering effort and the future of the disability claim process evolved, I listened
to the issues and opinions and the hopes and fears that have been expressed. I heard from SSA and State employees, the
public, members of Congress, representatives of other Federal agencies, State officials, union representatives,
and various experts in the disability field. I believe that everyone wants something better for the American people.
I am convinced that we must be bold in our efforts. Therefore, I have chosen to accept the recommendations of the Agency's
Disability Process Reengineering Team which were presented to me on June 30, 1994, with the full understanding that
certain aspects of the decisional methodology will require extensive research and testing to determine whether
they can be implemented. Because those aspects of decisional methodology that deal with functional assessment,
baseline of work, and the evaluation of age require much study and deliberation with experts and consumers, we are
making no conclusions about their ultimate place in the disability process. Our implementation plans include the
research needed to begin in this area. As more is known, we will reevaluate our planning assumptions. Until then, the
concept of a single person as the disability claim manager for all cases cannot be fully implemented. Instead, we will
seek ways of working in teams to provide claimants with the level of service they seek. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The cost of redesigning our disability claim process will not be inexpensive; however, the tangible savings will
be worth the investment. The workyear savings will allow us to use current staff to accomplish other pressing workloads
and activities of the Agency while avoiding new hiring to replace all those who retire or otherwise leave on their own
accord. Thus, we will be able to do our part to reduce the Federal workforce overall. Additionally, with these savings
will come such intangibles as improved customer service, an empowered and better trained workforce, and increased
public confidence in the process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is now time for us to move forward with concrete actions to begin the actual redesign of the way we do business in our
disability programs. On July 12, 1994, I announced that Charles A. (Chuck) Jones, the Director of the Michigan Disability
Determination Service, had accepted the challenge of managing the implementation of SSA's plan to reengineer the
disability process. In that role, he will be responsible for the overall leadership and coordination of the redesign
implementation. He will establish timelines and priorities and will provide direction to component efforts as well
as to task management teams. As Implementation Manager, Chuck will report directly to me and the Principal Deputy
Commissioner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the discussions of the Team's proposal, I heard several consistent underlying themes about how our new design
should be implemented: we must unify the process; we need enabling information technology; we need to ensure the safety
of employees; we must continuously deliver effective training; we must retain the existing Federal/State relationship;
and we must develop a simpler methodology for making disability decisions. I am absolutely committed to turning these
needs into realities as we move ahead. Some will not be easy, and all will take time and money; however, all will need
to be addressed if we are to achieve the successful outcome of the redesign. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As implementation plans are developed and task teams are brought together, we will continue to assess all related
activities against the five primary objectives of our redesigned process:

is now only a concept. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The next few years will be challenging for all of us as we

build our redesigned process, but that will not be a new

experience for those of you who are employees of SSA and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State DDSs. You have been called upon in the past to rise to the

occasion and have always more than met the challenge; your 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flexibility, resourcefulness, professionalism, and just plain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hard work are legendary. Now more than ever, I will need you to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be bold and help build a better future for those who seek our

Case for Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Overview 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
SSA and the State Disability Determination Services (DDSs) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have always striven to provide high-quality, responsive service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the public. In recent years, the disability insurance (DI) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Supplemental Security Income (SSI) claims workload has been the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency's most challenging problem. SSA has been faced with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unprecedented workload increases in both the DI and SSI programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which have severely strained its resources. Despite improvements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in productivity by employees in field offices, DDSs, hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offices, the Appeals Council and the processing centers over the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
last several years, SSA has had difficulty providing a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfactory level of service to claimants for disability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefits. SSA recognizes that, in an era of spending limitations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and competing social spending priorities, placing more and more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resources into the current process is not a viable alternative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, demographic changes in the general population 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and in the SSA claimant population present challenges as well as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunities as SSA strives to provide world-class service to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its customers. Despite the workload and demographic changes, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
however, the procedures for processing disability claims have not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changed in any important way since the beginning of the DI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program in the 1950's and many of the Agency's current practices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are based, in large part, on procedures begun 40 years ago. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Disability process changes that have evolved over time tend to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflect small, incremental improvements designed to address 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
various pieces of the overall process. It has become increasingly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clear that incremental improvements are no longer sufficient to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieve the level of service that will make a substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difference to disability claimants. Thus, SSA needs a longer-term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
strategy for addressing service delivery problems in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disability claim process.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Over the last several years, as workloads have increased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dramatically, the disability process has been placed under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increasing stress. The upward trend in the number of claims and

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The high workload level is expected to continue and will adversely affect SSA's ability to timely process initial
disability claims and appeals. Recent management initiatives to improve service through resource reallocations
and productivity enhancements have not been sufficient to deal successfully with the workload demands and it is expected
that disability processing times and backlogs will continue to grow under the present process. In FY 1995, it is estimated
that 2.9 million initial disability claims will be forwarded to DDSs for disability determinations_a 69 percent
increase over FY 1990 levels. Similarly, in FY 1995, annual requests for administrative law judge (ALJ) hearings
will rise to 542,000, a 75 percent increase over FY 1990 levels. The average time to process an initial disability claim
(the combined average for both DI and SSI claims) is expected to rise to 154 days in FY 1995; the average time from ALJ
hearing request to decision is expected to rise to 342 days in the same period.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Demographic Trends
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
American society has changed dramatically since the DI program began in the 1950s. This is reflected in an increased
demand for SSA's services, changes in the characteristics of claimants seeking benefits, and new complexities in
claim-related workloads and processes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The demographic character of the SSA disability claimant population has changed as well. The enactment of the SSI
program in the 1970's added individuals who have limited or no work histories, increased the number of individuals
filing based on disabilities such as mental impairments, and provided for eligibility of disabled children. Additionally,
the requirements of the SSI program added complex and time consuming development of non-disability eligibility
factors such as income, resources and living arrangements. The 1990 U.S. Supreme Court decision, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sullivan 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
v. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Zebley, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
resulted in increased claims for children; children comprised 21 percent of all SSI claims in 1992, up from 11 percent
in 1988. Homeless individuals and others with special needs have strained the delivery system. These claimants require
significant intervention and assistance to navigate the disability claim process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A trend in the general population which is reflected in SSA's disability claimant population is the increased number
of people in the United States for whom English is not the native language. Recent national Census data indicate that
1 in 7 people speak a language other than English in the home; this is an increase of almost 38 percent in the last 10 years.
SSA will need to accommodate the special communication needs of these claimants in its ongoing claimant contacts
and in public information vehicles.

Forty percent of claimants filing for disability benefits and polled in a recent SSA survey had filed for or received
benefits from Aid to Families with Dependent Children, welfare or social services within the past year. Approximately
three-fourths of them were granted this assistance and three-fourths of those grantees were still receiving assistance
when they applied for disability benefits. SSA has the opportunity to develop productive relationships with these
social service entities to improve the processing of disability claims for mutual customers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Technological advances such as personal computers, facsimile machines, electronic mail, and videoconferencing
are increasingly available to our claimants, their representatives, medical providers and other third parties
involved in the disability process. SSA can take advantage of these capabilities to offer expanded service options
and to modernize the ways it interacts with providers of claims-related information and evidence.

The Current Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The procedures in the current process have not changed in any significant way since the DI program began in the 1950s,
a time when caseloads, demographic characteristics of claimants, types of disabilities, and available technology
were radically different. In the 1970s, Congress federalized State programs of cash assistance to the aged, blind
and disabled into the SSI program and added this to the responsibilities of SSA. SSA adopted the DI disability determination
procedures for SSI blind and disabled claims.

Slow, Manual Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the current process, a disability claim passes through from 1 to 4 decisional paths to receive a favorable decision.
The initial claim, reconsideration, ALJ hearing and Appeals Council review levels all involve multi-step uniform
procedures for evidence collection, review, and decisionmaking.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The process starts at the initial level when an individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first applies for DI and/or SSI benefits on the basis of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disabling physical or mental condition. An individual calls the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
national toll-free telephone number and is referred to a local 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SSA field office or visits or calls one of 1,300 local field 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offices to apply for benefits. Field office personnel assist with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application completion, obtain detailed medical and vocational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
history and screen nonmedical eligibility factors. Field office 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personnel forward the claim to 1 of 54 State DDSs where medical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence is developed and a final decision is made regarding the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existence of a medically determinable impairment which meets the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of disability. The decision is made by an adjudicative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
team consisting of a disability specialist and a program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physician. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After possible quality assurance review in the DDS or in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SSA regional Disability Quality Branch, the claim is returned to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the field office; denials are retained pending possible appeal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In FY 1993, 39 percent of initial claims were allowed and sent to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1 of 7 processing centers (which include the Office of Disability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and International Operations and the 6 Program Service Centers) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for final processing and storage, as well as adjudication of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claims for dependents. Allowed SSI claims remain in the field 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
office for payment effectuation and folder retention. A sample of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these are reviewed after payment for nondisability quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assurance. According to SSA's computer-based processing time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurements, an initial claim currently takes an average of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about 100 days to process from the time of filing until a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision is made. However, from the claimant's perspective, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
better understanding of how long the process takes comes from a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1993 study conducted by SSA
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
s Office of Workforce Analysis, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
showed that an average claimant waits up to 155 days from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initial contact with SSA until receiving an initial claim 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision notice. During this period, 16 to 26 employees will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handle the claim. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The claimant may request reconsideration of the initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision within 60 days of receiving the denial notice. In FY 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1993, claimants requested reconsideration in 48 percent of denied 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claims. Local field office personnel receive the reconsideration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request, update necessary information, and forward the claim file 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the DDS for review, possible medical development, and a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
medical decision. The reconsideration decision is made by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different adjudicative team than the one that made the initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After possible quality assurance review in the DDS or in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regional Disability Quality Branch, about 14 percent of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claims are returned to the field office for payment and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forwarding to a processing center; the remaining denials are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forwarded to the field office for retention, pending possible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further appeal. According to SSA
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
s computer-based processing time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reports, the average reconsideration takes about 50 days_however, according to the Office of Workforce Analysis
study, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claimant has now been involved with the disability process for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
roughly 8 months from the initial contact with SSA, and up to 36 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different employees could have handled the claim. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A claimant can request a hearing before an ALJ within 60 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
days of receiving an unfavorable reconsideration decision. In FY 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1993, claimants requested an ALJ hearing in about 75 percent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all reconsideration denials. By this time, a claimant has usually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retained an attorney or other representative to assist in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pursuing the claim for benefits. About 75 percent of all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claimants retain a representative at the hearing level. Local 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
field office personnel receive the request for hearing and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forward it with the claim file to one of 132 local SSA hearings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offices. Hearing office personnel review the file for possible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional development, conduct a hearing, and render a decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DI claims allowed at the hearing level are sent to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing center for payment effectuation and adjudication of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claims for dependents, and storage. Allowed SSI claims are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returned to the local field office for income and resource 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development, and payment. Denied claims are forwarded to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appeals Council for retention pending a possible request for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review. According to computer-based reports, the hearing process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
takes about 265 days. However, according to the Office of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Workforce Analysis study, a claimant has been dealing with SSA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for over a year and a half at this point in the process.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If dissatisfied with the hearing decision, a claimant (or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative) may request Appeals Council review within 60 days 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of receiving the ALJ decision. In FY 1993, about 23 percent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing decisions were unfavorable. The Appeals Council considers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about 18 percent of all ALJ dispositions, including cases it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reviews on its own motion. Requests for Appeals Council review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are typically received directly from the claimant's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative. The Appeals Council may deny or dismiss a request 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for review, issue a decision, or remand the claim to an ALJ. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appeals Council remands claims to the ALJ level about 27 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the time for subsequent development and decision. Denied 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claims, representing about 70 percent of the Appeals Council 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dispositions, are held in the Appeals Council for possible appeal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to Federal District court. Allowed claims are sent to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing center or field office for further action as in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing cases. According to processing time reports, this part of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the process takes on average about 100 days; however, according 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the Office of Workforce Analysis study, a claimant has spent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
almost 2 years dealing with SSA since initially contacting the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At least part of the processing time results from the time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
added as the claim moves from one employee or facility to another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(handoffs), and waits at each employee's workstation to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handled (queues). As workloads increase, the amount of time a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claim waits at each processing point grows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Task time'' is the time employees actually devote to working 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directly on a claim, rather than the total amount of time it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
takes for a claimant to receive a final decision. Based on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Office of Workforce Analysis study, a claimant can wait as long 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as 155 days from the first contact with SSA until receiving an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initial claim decision notice_of which only 13 hours of this is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actual task time. The same study reveals a claimant can wait as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
long as 550 days from that initial contact through receipt of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing decision notice_of which only 32 hours is actual task 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Complex, Confusing Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many applicants enter the SSA disability process uninformed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about the process itself and the definition of disability. They 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are unaware of the criteria for establishing disability and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence they will be required to submit. Even third parties and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advocate organizations, often more knowledgeable than the general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public about SSA procedures, experience difficulty obtaining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meaningful information about the status of their clients
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
 claims, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finding that they often are transferred from one employee to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
another. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Disability claimants face a ``one size fits all'' approach to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the intake and processing of their claim, finding themselves 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
answering questions they believe are intrusive and irrelevant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their claim. Front-line employees currently devote hours to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completing forms and obtaining information which may not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary for a finding of disability. Claimants often do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
understand what happens to the claim after initial contact with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SSA and view multiple requests for medical information with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annoyance. Often claimants do not understand how the decision was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made and, therefore, believe that it was reached arbitrarily. If 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the claim is approved, whether at the initial or appellate level, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claimants and their representatives, as well as front-line 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees, are concerned about the complicated procedures and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
length of time it takes to effectuate payment and entitle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible dependents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SSA employees, claimants, and other interested parties all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agree that the current process takes too long to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicants a decision, and leaves them confused about who has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility for their claim, and puzzled about the status of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their claim during various points in the process. Additionally, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nearly all believe that many claimants can and should assume more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility for submitting evidence and pursuing their claim. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most view the reconsideration step as little more than a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rubber stamp of the initial determination, creating additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
work for employees and yet another bureaucratic obstacle for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claimants and their representatives. Some believe a face-to-face 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interview with the decisionmaker is vital to reaching a fair, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accurate determination; others believe just as strongly that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision should be reached on the basis of a paper review, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a face-to-face interview can lead to subjective decisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are not based on objective criteria. Quality reviews and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appeals Council reviews are often mentioned as areas where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunities exist for streamlining and improving the current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Claimants and their representatives have learned their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chances for a favorable decision improve if they appeal their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claim to an ALJ. The public, in particular, believes that it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to hire an attorney to maneuver through the appeals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process, and voices resentment at having to do so. Higher 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowance rates at the ALJ level lead to the perception that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different adjudicative standards apply at the initial and appeals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels. A variety of factors may be contributing to this. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facts of many cases change over time as a claimant
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
s condition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes. ALJs often have access to information not considered at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lower levels in the process because earlier decisionmakers are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not as likely to have face-to-face interaction with the claimant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Contributors to Complexity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The collection of medical evidence presents problems as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
case is developed, accounting for a considerable portion of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
total time involved in disability claim processing. Health care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providers who are a claimant
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
s treating source often do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
understand the requirements for establishing disability, and find 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
medical evidence request forms confusing and repetitive. They 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believe that evidence requests burden them with far too much 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paperwork and offer far too little in the way of compensation for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the time invested. Adjudicators often find that evidence is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
primarily treatment-oriented and fails to provide either the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
highly specialized clinical findings or the functional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information that is required by the regulations. To compensate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for poor or missing medical evidence, DDSs purchase consultative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examinations, devoting substantial resources to scheduling, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purchasing, and processing these examinations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Once the medical evidence has been collected, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methodology used by disability decisionmakers is complex and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controversial. The current sequential evaluation process, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was originally designed to identify and evaluate cases in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
simple, rapid and consistent fashion has grown increasingly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complex as the result of court decisions and changes in medical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technology. This complexity has, in turn, contributed to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increasing difficulty and fragmentation in other portions of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disability process, including intake, evidence collection, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appeals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, the Listings of Impairments was originally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designed to highlight readily identifiable disabling impairments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many of the Listings have since evolved into complex and highly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detailed diagnostic requirements, demanding specialized medical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence that may not be readily available from treating sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some, but not all, of the Listings consider the functional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consequences of an impairment; however functional considerations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vary significantly among the Listings. Additionally, in assessing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an individual
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
s functional abilities at the later steps in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sequential evaluation, adjudicators collect and analyze evidence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from a multitude of different, and often conflicting, sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including: objective clinical and laboratory findings; treating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
source opinions and other third-party statements considered to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with the objective evidence; and the individual
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
s 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
description of his or her limitations. The development of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extensive medical evidence in every case impedes timely and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficient decisionmaking. The varying approaches to assessing a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claimant
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
s functional ability that are required at different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
steps in the sequential evaluation, along with the nature and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
types of evidence that adjudicators may rely on to assess 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
function often lead to different interpretations of the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence by different adjudicators. Vocational rules originally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designed to provide a structured approach to decisionmaking have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grown increasingly complex, leading to varying interpretations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and inconsistent decisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Fragmented Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The fragmented nature of the disability process is driven by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and exacerbated by the fragmentation in SSA's policy making and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policy issuance mechanisms. Policy making authority rests in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
several organizations with few effective tools for ensuring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent guidance to all disability decisionmakers. Different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles exist for conveying policy and procedural guidance to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decisionmakers at different levels in the process. While the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards for disability decisionmaking are uniform, they are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expressed in different wording in the various policy vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Training on disability is not delivered in a consistent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manner, nor is it provided simultaneously to disability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decisionmakers across or among levels in the process. Mechanisms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for reviewing application of policy among levels of the process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are fragmented and inconsistent. Review of DDS decisions is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heavily weighted toward allowances; no systematic quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assurance program is in place for hearing decisions although the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity for feedback from the Appeals Council or from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
courts is heavily weighted toward denials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The organizational fragmentation of the disability process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
creates the perception that no one is in charge of it. SSA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measures the process from the perspective of the component 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organizations involved, rather than the perspective of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claimant. Multiple organizations (field offices, DDSs, hearings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offices, Appeals Council operations, and processing centers) have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jurisdiction over the claim at various points in time, with each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
line of authority managing toward its own goals without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility to the overall outcome of the process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the impact of one component
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
s work product on other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
components is not measured, further contributing to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fragmentation of the process. Each component's narrow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibilities reinforce a lack of understanding among 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
component employees of the roles and responsibilities of other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees in different components.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Concerns about the Agency's business processes generally, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the quality of service in the disability claim process in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular, led SSA leadership to the conclusion that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disability process reengineering effort was critical to the SSA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
goal of providing world-class service to its customers. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National Performance Review, headed by the Vice President, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directed improvement of the SSA disability process as a key 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service initiative for the Federal government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Leading private sector organizations have used process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reengineering to identify and quickly put in place dramatic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improvements in their operations. The objective of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reengineering review is to fundamentally rethink and radically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
redesign a business process from start to finish, so that it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
becomes many times more efficient and, as a result, significantly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improves service to the organization's customers. By focusing on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the disability claim process as a single business process, SSA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hoped to cut across the organizational lines and multiple 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
components that handle the many pieces of the disability process.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A project team composed of 18 Federal and State employees, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the direction of an SSA senior executive, assembled at SSA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Headquarters in October 1993 to conduct the disability claim 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process reengineering review. With the guidance of an Executive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Steering Committee the Team was challenged to fundamentally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rethink the way SSA processes disability claims. The Team's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initial findings and proposal, issued in March 1994, for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
redesigned disability claim process were widely shared during a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
60-day public comment period. Based on the comments received, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Team presented a revised proposal to the Commissioner of Social 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Security on June 30, 1994. After extensive consultation with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals and organizations in the internal and external 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disability community, the Commissioner accepted the Team's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommendations for a redesigned disability process. A summary of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the methodology used to redesign the disability claim process is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

By focusing on these objectives, the redesigned process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replaces an existing process that is slow, labor-intensive, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paper reliant with a seamless claim process that makes better use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of technology, eliminates fragmentation and duplication, promotes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more flexible use of resources, and results in dramatic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improvements in public service. With the redesigned process, SSA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has embarked on an era of change that will revitalize and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
streamline the way it delivers disability claim services to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public to achieve greater quality, accuracy, speed and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiency. A detailed description of the redesigned disability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claim process is presented in the following section.

Claimants for disability benefits under the new process will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be provided a full explanation of SSA's programs and processes at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the initial contact with SSA. Claimants will be offered a range 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of options for filing a claim and conferring with decisionmakers, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using various modes of technology to interact with SSA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Claimants, who are able to do so, along with third parties and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representatives who act on their behalf, will assist in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development of their claims, deal with a single contact point in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Agency, and have the right to a personal interview with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decisionmakers at each level of the process. The number of steps 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be consolidated and the issues on appeal will be focused. If 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the claim is approved, the effectuation of payment to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claimant, eligible dependents and the representative will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
streamlined.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The new process will result in correct decisions at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
earliest possible point in the process. A correct disability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision is one that appropriately considers whether an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual does or does not meet the factors of entitlement for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disability as defined by SSA's statute, regulations, rulings and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policies. Correct decisions in the new process depend on: a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
simplified decision methodology that provides a common frame of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reference for deciding disability at all levels of the process; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent direction and training to all adjudicators; enhanced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and targeted collection and development of medical evidence; an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
automated and integrated claim processing system that will assist 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjudicators in evidence gathering, analysis and decisionmaking; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and a single, comprehensive quality review process across all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels. The goal of the new process is to guide all adjudicators 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at all levels of the process, who will be using the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards for decisionmaking, to making correct decisions in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
easier, faster, and more cost-effective manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A disability claim manager will handle most aspects of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disability claim at the initial level, thus eliminating many 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
steps caused by numerous employees handling discrete parts of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claim (handoffs) and the time lost as the claim waits at each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employee's workstation to be handled (queues). This will reduce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the time needed to rework files and redevelop information from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the same evidentiary sources. Levels of appeal will be combined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and improved, reducing the need to redevelop nonmedical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility factors after a favorable decision because less time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will have elapsed since initial filing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new process will enable the current work force to handle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an increased number of claims, freeing the most highly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specialized staff (physicians and ALJs) to work on those cases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and tasks that make the best use of their talents, and targeting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenditures for medical evidence to those areas most useful in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining disability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Employees will perform a wider range of functions, using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their skills to their full potential, enabling them to meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needs of claimants and minimize unnecessary rework. The new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process will facilitate employees' ability to do the total job by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providing technology and the training and support to use that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technology. [

The disability claim entry and intake processes will reflect

the SSA commitment to providing world-class service to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public. The hallmarks of the process will be accessible, personal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service that ensures timely and accurate decisions. SSA will work 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to make potential claimants better informed about the disability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process and fully prepare them to participate in it. Every effort 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be made to provide services to meet the needs of culturally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diverse, non-English speaking claimants. SSA will also be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flexible in providing modes of access to the claim process that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
best meet the needs of claimants and the third parties and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representatives who act on their behalf. SSA will provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claimants with a single point of contact for all disability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claim-related business. Finally, SSA will ensure that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disability decisionmaking process promotes timely and accurate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decisions.

Making Program Information Available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
SSA will make available to the general public comprehensive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information packets about the DI and SSI disability programs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Disability Program include the Program for those who are blind.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The packets will include information about the purpose of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disability programs; the definition of disability; the basic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of the programs; a description of the adjudication 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process; the types of evidence needed to establish disability; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the claimant's role in pursuing a claim. The packets may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
customized locally to include referral information about other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs and resources for legal representation. The goal is to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
target the information to likely beneficiaries and to ensure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential claimants and other groups involved in the disability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process have a better understanding of SSA disability programs, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their medical and nonmedical requirements, and the nature of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decisionmaking process. This should result in reduction of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general inquiries from members of the public unfamiliar with SSA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disability programs and increase the number of claimants who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enter the disability process knowledgeable and prepared to assume 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility for pursuing their claims. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SSA will make disability information packets commonly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available in the community, both at facilities frequented by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general public (libraries, neighborhood resource centers, post 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offices, the Department of Veterans Affairs offices, and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal government installations) and at facilities frequented by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential claimants (hospitals, clinics, other health care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providers, schools, employer personnel offices, State public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance offices, insurance companies, and advocacy groups or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third-party organizations that assist individuals in pursuing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disability claims). SSA studies have shown that claimants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequently rely on advice from their physicians and from State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public assistance personnel in deciding whether to file a claim 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for disability benefits. Therefore, SSA will make a special 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effort to target its public information activities at these and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other known sources of referrals for claims. SSA will also make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the disability information packets available electronically.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to comprehensive program information, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
packets will describe the types of information that a claimant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will need to have readily available when the individual files a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claim. It will also contain two basic forms: The first, designed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for completion by the claimant, will include general identifying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information and will serve as the claimant's starter application 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for benefits; the second, designed for completion by the treating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
source(s), will request specific medical information about a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claimant's alleged impairments. SSA will encourage claimants who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are able to do so to review the information in the packet and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have the basic forms completed prior to telephoning or visiting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an SSA office to apply for disability benefits. Claimants will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
encouraged to immediately submit starter applications to protect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the filing dates for benefits. The starter application will serve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a claim for both programs, but it will include a disclaimer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should the claimant want to preclude filing for benefits based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
need (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

Claimants Will Choose Mode of Entry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The disability claim entry process will be multi-faceted, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowing claimants and third parties and representatives who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assist them the maximum flexibility in deciding how they will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participate in the process. Claimants may choose to enter the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disability claim process by telephoning the SSA toll-free number, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electronically, by mail, or by telephoning or visiting a local 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
office. Claimants may also rely on third parties to provide them 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance in dealing with SSA. Finally, claimants may formally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appoint representatives to act on their behalf in dealing with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SSA. SSA field managers will also have the flexibility to tailor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the various service options to their local conditions, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considering the needs of client populations, individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claimants, and the availability of third parties who are capable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of contributing to the application process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If an individual submits a starter application by mail or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electronically, SSA will contact the claimant to schedule an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appointment for a claim intake interview or, at the claimant's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
option, conduct an immediate intake interview by telephone. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If an individual telephones SSA to inquire about disability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefits, the SSA contact will explain the requirements of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disability program, including the SSA definition of disability, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and provide a general explanation of evidence requirements. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SSA contact will determine whether the individual has the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disability information packet, and mail it or advise the claimant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding possible means of electronic access. If an individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicates a desire to file a claim at that time, the SSA contact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will complete the starter application available on-line as part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the automated claim processing system to protect the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claimant's filing date and schedule an appointment for a claim 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intake interview. The interview may be in person or by telephone 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the claimant's option. If the individual has no medical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treating sources, the SSA contact will annotate this information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the on-line claim record. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a claimant visits an SSA office, the SSA contact will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refer the claimant for an immediate claim intake interview or, at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the claimant's option, complete the starter application and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
schedule a future appointment for an intake interview. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In all cases, appointments for claim intake interviews will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be made available within a reasonable time period, generally 3 to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5 working days, but no later than two weeks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Local management will determine how to best accommodate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claimants' needs in learning about the disability process and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completing a claim intake interview. Depending on an individual's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances, such accommodation may involve: Referral to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nearest location for obtaining a disability information packet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which can then be mailed in; an immediate telephone or in-person 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interview; arranging for an on-site visit from an SSA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative; or referral to appropriate third parties who can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide assistance. Additionally, depending on the nature of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual's disability, SSA may encourage the individual to file 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in person when it appears that a face-to-face interview will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assist in the proper claim intake and development; however, face- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to-face interviews will not be required in every claim. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Face-to-face interviews, when considered necessary by either the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claimant or SSA, can also be accomplished via videoconferencing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In any case, SSA will make every reasonable effort to meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needs of the claimant in completing the application process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Every effort will be made to provide services to members of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public who have limited knowledge of English. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, local managers will modify the claim entry and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intake process to provide maximum flexibility for representatives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who act on behalf of claimants or third parties who can assist 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claimants in completing the application process. Such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accommodations may include, but are not limited to: (1) Using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
automated means to interact with SSA to protect a claimant's date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of filing (e.g., telephone, fax, or E-mail); (2) providing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appointment slots for third parties to accompany claimants to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interviews or to provide assistance during telephone claims on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claimant's behalf; (3) out-stationing SSA personnel at a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third-party location to obtain applications and/or medical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence, when appropriate; and (4) providing ``open appointment'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scheduling to permit claimants to contact SSA within a flexible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
band of time. Interested third parties will be encouraged to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participate in the development of claims. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Local managers will also conduct outreach efforts that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designed to meet the needs of hard-to-reach populations or assist 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those individuals unable to access the SSA claim process without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considerable intervention. As appropriate, outreach efforts may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be facilitated through videoconferencing, teleconferencing or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other electronic methods of obtaining and processing claim 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information to provide timely service despite claimants' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
geographic or social isolation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Disability Claim Manager 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A disability claim manager will have responsibility for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complete processing of an initial disability claim. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disability claim manager will be a highly-trained individual who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is well-versed in both the medical and nonmedical aspects of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disability programs and has the necessary knowledge, skills, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
abilities to conduct personal interviews, develop evidentiary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records, and adjudicate disability claims to payment. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the disability claim manager will also be able to call on other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SSA resources, including medical and technical support personnel, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to provide advice and assistance in the claim process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Disability claim managers will rely on an automated claim 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing system that will permit them to: Gather and store 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claim information; develop both medical and nonmedical evidence; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
share necessary facts in a claim with medical consultants and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specialists in nonmedical or technical issues; analyze evidence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and prepare well-rationalized decisions on both medical and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonmedical issues; and produce clear and understandable notices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that accurately convey all necessary information to claimants. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
making decisions, disability claim managers will use a simplified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision methodology that effectively streamlines evidence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collection, and will rely on standards for decisionmaking that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are used at all levels of the process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The disability claim manager will be the focal point for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claimant contacts throughout the claim intake and adjudication 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process. The disability claim manager will explain the disability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs to the claimant, including the definition of disability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and how SSA determines if a claimant meets disability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements. The disability claim manager will also convey what 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the claimant will be asked to do throughout the process; what the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claimant may expect from SSA during this process, including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anticipated timeframes for decision; and how the claimant can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interact with the disability claim manager to obtain more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information or assistance. The disability claim manager will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advise the claimant regarding the right to representation and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide the appropriate referral sources for representation. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disability claim manager will also advise the claimant regarding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community resources, including the names of organizations that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could help the claimant pursue the claim. The goal will be to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
give the claimant access to the decisionmaker and allow for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ongoing, meaningful dialogue between the claimant and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disability claim manager.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Scope of Duties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The broad scope of the disability claim manager's duties and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibilities, as outlined above and discussed in more detail 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the following sections, presupposes a well-trained, skilled, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and highly motivated workforce that has the program tools and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technological support to issue quality decisions. Although 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disability claim managers will work exclusively within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disability programs, they will perform multiple tasks instead of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
singular activities, enabling them to experience the direct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relationship between their actions and the final product. Varying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels of job complexity provide the opportunity for personal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development, growth, and learning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In carrying out their duties and responsibilities, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disability claim managers will work in a team environment with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
internal medical and nonmedical experts, who provide advice and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance for complex case adjudication, as well as technical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and other clerical personnel who may handle more routine aspects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of case development and payment effectuation. Where disability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
team members cannot be physically co-located, they can share 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information via the automated claim processing system and remain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in communication using telephones or videoconferencing. Each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disability team member will have at least a basic familiarity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with all the steps in the process and an understanding of how he 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or she complements another's efforts; team members will be able 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to draw upon each other's expertise on complex issues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this team environment, and with the proper training, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program tools (a simplified decision methodology and one set of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards for decisionmaking) and technological support, one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual should be able to handle the duties and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibilities of the disability claim manager. An individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employee as the disability claim manager is basic to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
objective of a single point of Agency contact for claimants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, in the near term, it may be necessary to consider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether the duties of a disability claim manager may be more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriately carried out by more than one individual and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore, whether it is necessary to expand the ``disability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
team'' described above to include additional employees. Claim 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complexity, customer service needs, and service area location may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dictate a need for flexibility in delineating the specific duties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the individuals who comprise the members of the disability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
team. In the near term, apprentice positions will be developed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which employees perform one or more duties of the disability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claim manager while gaining experience and qualifying for greater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility. As the program tools and technological support, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which are the underpinnings of the new process, are fully 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implemented, it is envisioned that team duties and positions will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be modified and consolidated as necessary to fully realize the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
goal of an individual employee as disability claim manager. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Process Flexibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The disability claim manager will conduct a thorough 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
screening of the claimant's medical and nonmedical eligibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors. If the claimant appears ineligible for either disability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program based on the claimant's allegations and evidence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presented or available at the time of the claim intake interview, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the disability claim manager will explain this to the claimant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the decision regarding whether to file an application 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be the claimant's alone and the disability claim manager 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not discourage a claimant from filing an application. If the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claimant decides not to file a claim, the disability claim 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manager will follow existing procedures for closing out an oral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inquiry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the claimant decides to file, the disability claim 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manager will complete appropriate application screens from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
automated and fully integrated (DI and SSI) claim processing and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision support system. Impairment-specific questions will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assist the disability claim manager in obtaining information that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is relevant and necessary to a disability decision. Based on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claimant's statements and the evidence that is available at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interview, the disability claim manager will determine the most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective way to process the claim. If the evidence is sufficient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to decide the claim, the disability claim manager will take 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary action to issue a decision and, if necessary, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectuate payment. The disability claim manager will determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
what additional evidence is required to adjudicate the claim and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will take steps to obtain that evidence. Such steps may include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asking the claimant to obtain further medical or nonmedical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence if the claimant is able to do so, requesting medical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence directly from treating sources, or ordering further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
medical evaluations. As in the current process, SSA will pay for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the reasonable cost of providing existing medical evidence. If 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the claimant has a formal representative, the representative will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have the responsibility to develop medical and nonmedical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The disability claim manager will decide whether to defer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonmedical development (e.g., requesting SSI income and resource 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information, or developing DI dependents' claims) or do it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
simultaneously with development of the medical aspects of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claim. In making this decision, the disability claim manager will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
take into account the type of disability alleged, evidence and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other information presented by the claimant, and other relevant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances, e.g., terminal illness, homelessness or difficulty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in recontacting the claimant. Because the disability claim 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manager maintains ownership of the claim throughout the initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision-making process, the disability claim manager will be in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the best position to choose the most efficient and effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manner of providing claimants with timely and accurate decisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
while meeting claimants' individual service needs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the disability claim manager will be responsible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the adjudication of an initial claim, the disability claim 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manager will call in other staff resources, as necessary. With 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respect to disability decisionmaking, the disability claim 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manager will, in appropriate circumstances, refer claims to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
medical consultants to obtain expert advice and opinion. SSA will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
develop guidelines to assist the disability claim manager in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining when expert medical advice is appropriate. Similarly, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other staff resources will be called upon for technical support 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in terms of certain claimant contacts and status reports; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development of nondisability issues including auxiliary claims or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative payee issues; and payment effectuation. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the disability claim manager will make final decisions on both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the medical and nonmedical aspects of the disability claim.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Throughout the disability claim process, SSA will encourage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claimants to be full partners in the processing of their claims. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many claimants are able to obtain the documentation necessary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
develop their record, either on their own or with the assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a third party. Others have substantial difficulty doing so, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and may have no third party to assist them. Given the range of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claimant capabilities, SSA will retain ultimate responsibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for development of claims when claimants are not formally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
represented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To the extent that they are able, claimants and their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
families and other personal support networks will actively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participate in the development of evidence to substantiate their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claim for disability benefits. SSA will provide assistance and/or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engage third-party resources, when necessary and appropriate. SSA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will keep claimants informed of the status of their claims, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advise claimants regarding what additional evidence may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary, and inform claimants what, if anything, they can do to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilitate the process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the completion of the claim intake interview, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disability claim manager will issue a receipt to the claimant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that will identify what to expect from SSA and the anticipated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
timeframes. It will also identify what further evidence or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information the claimant has agreed to obtain. Finally, it will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide the name and telephone number of the disability claim 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manager for any questions or comments which the claimant may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have, including any difficulty in obtaining the information the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claimant agreed to obtain.

Third Parties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Certain third-party organizations may be willing to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a complete disability application package to SSA. Based on local 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
s assessment of service area needs and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
availability of qualified organizations, SSA will recognize 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third-party organizations who are capable of providing a complete 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application package, including appropriate application forms and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
medical evidence necessary to adjudicate a disability claim. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such claims, SSA will permit the third party to identify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential claimants, screen for medical and nonmedical criteria, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and contact SSA to protect the filing date. The third party will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interview the claimant; complete all applications and related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forms; obtain completed treating source statements; and obtain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional medical evaluations, when appropriate. Using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures agreed on with local management, the third party will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submit claims for adjudication by a disability claim manager. SSA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will monitor such third parties to ensure that quality service is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided to claimants and to prevent fraud. SSA may establish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rules, standards, and procedures for third-party interaction with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claimants and SSA. Third parties may be required to undergo 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
periodic program, procedural or software training, and may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to meet standards for staffing and automation support. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In individual cases, disability claim managers may elect to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contact the claimant for the purpose of verifying identity or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other claim-related issues, as appropriate. SSA will also perform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ongoing document verification on a sample basis to assure the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
integrity of claims submitted by third parties. The automated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claim processing system will facilitate effective monitoring of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the claim-taking and evidence submission practices of third 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parties by permitting random and/or targeted selection of claim 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
files involving specific third parties or specific types of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence.

Personal Interview With Claimant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When the evidence does not support an allowance, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disability claim manager will issue a predecision notice advising 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the claimant of what evidence has been considered and providing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the opportunity to submit further evidence, if any, and/or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity for a personal interview within 10 calendar days. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
predecision notice will further advise the claimant that if he or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
she does not submit evidence or request a personal interview 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the 10 days, the claim will be decided based on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence of record. If the claimant requests a personal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interview, the disability claim manager will conduct the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interview in person, by videoconference, or by telephone, as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disability claim manager determines is appropriate under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances. In appropriate circumstances, this predecision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interview may be held concurrently with the initial intake 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interview. If the claimant identifies further available evidence, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the disability claim manager will advise the claimant to obtain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the evidence if the claimant is able to do so or, as necessary, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assist the claimant in obtaining it. The claimant will be advised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the specified timeframes for submitting additional evidence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In preparing the predecision notice, the disability claim 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manager will rely on existing information available on-line as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part of the automated claim processing and decision support 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system. As part of the evidence gathering process, the disability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claim manager will have previously analyzed all the medical and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-medical information gathered, and entered the pertinent data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into the electronic claim record. The decision support system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will use the accumulated data in the electronic record to assist 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the disability claim manager in producing the predecision notice.

``Statement of the Claim'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The initial disability determination will use a statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the claim'' approach. The statement of the claim will set forth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the issues in the claim, the relevant facts, the evidence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered, including any evidence or information obtained as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result of the predecision notice, and the rationale in support of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the determination. The statement of the claim not only reflects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SSA
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
s commitment to fully explaining the basis for its action but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also recognizes that claimants need clear information about the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis for the determination to make an informed decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding further appeal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As with the predecision notice, much of the information that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will provide the basis for the statement of the claim will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available on-line as part of the automated claim processing and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision support system. Adjudicators will create the statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the claim and whatever supplementary information is necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for a legally sufficient notice to the claimant based on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information in the decision support system. For allowance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decisions, the statement of the claim will be more abbreviated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than for denial decisions; however, it will contain sufficient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information to facilitate quality assurance reviews and/or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuing disability reviews. The statement of the claim will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part of the on-line claim record and will be available to other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjudicators as the basis and rationale for the Agency
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
s action, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if the claimant seeks further administrative review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In making initial disability determinations, disability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claim managers will rely on standards for decisionmaking that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used at all levels of the process. SSA will develop a single 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presentation of all substantive policies used in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination of eligibility for benefits and all decisionmakers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be bound by these same policies. These policies will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Expert systems will be developed to facilitate the development 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and delivery of disability policy as an integrated part of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
automated claim processing system.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
SSA must have a structured approach to disability decisionmaking that takes into consideration the large number
of claims (2.7 million initial disability decisions in FY 1994) and still provides a basis for consistent, equitable
decisionmaking by adjudicators at each level. The approach must be simple to administer, facilitate consistent
application of the rules at each level, and provide accurate results. It must also be perceived by the public as straightforward,
understandable and fair. Finally, the approach must facilitate the issuance of timely decisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As described further below, the goal of the new decisionmaking approach is to focus decisionmaking on the functional
consequences of an individual's medically determinable impairment(s). The new process will assess an individual's
functional ability, assess it once in the process, do it directly rather than indirectly, and rely on standardized
functional assessment instruments to do so. By focusing on function, the new approach will permit both providers
of medical evidence and adjudicators at all levels of the process to use a consistent frame of reference for deciding
disability, regardless of the diagnosis. It will also facilitate evidence collection by lessening the need for voluminous
medical records and, instead, look at the consequences of medical findings, i.e., function. Ultimately, adjudicators
will make correct decisions in an easier, faster, and more cost-effective manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The cornerstone of the new approach is, of course, the statutory definition of disability. Under the statute, disability
(for adults) means the:

Four-Step Evaluation Process for Adults 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The new decisionmaking approach is the foundation on which SSA will base the claim intake process and evidence collection.
The focus will be, first, to document the medical basis for concluding that an individual has a medically determinable
physical or mental impairment. Second, once the evidence establishes a medically determinable impairment(s),
decisionmakers will, in most cases, use additional medical findings to determine the link between the disease or
impairment and the loss of function. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The disability decision methodology will consist of four steps that flow from the statutory definition of disability.
They are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Step 1_Is the individual engaging in substantial gainful activity? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If yes, deny. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If no, continue to Step 2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Step 2_Does the individual have a medically determinable physical or mental impairment? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If no, deny. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If yes, continue to Step 3.* 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Step 3_Does the individual have an impairment included in the Index of Disabling Impairments i.e., an impairment
that clearly restricts functional ability to a degree that the individual is unable to engage in substantial gainful
activity without measuring the individual's functional ability? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If yes, allow.*
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If no, continue to Step 4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Step 4_Does the individual have the functional ability to perform substantial gainful activity? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If yes, deny. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If no, allow.*

will not be disabling for 12 months.

Step 1_Engaging in Substantial Gainful Activity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Any individual who is engaging in substantial gainful activity will not be found disabled regardless of the severity
of the individual's physical or mental impairments. Under the new approach, SSA will simplify the monetary guidelines
for determining whether an individual who is an employee (except those filing for benefits based on blindness) is
engaging in substantial gainful activity. In making this determination, SSA will evaluate the work activity based
on the earnings level that is comparable to the upper earnings limit in the current process (i.e., $500). A single earnings
level will simplify the evidentiary development necessary to evaluate work activity and establish the appropriate
onset date of disability. Additionally, SSA will continue to exclude impairment-related work expenses in evaluating
whether an individual's earnings constitute substantial gainful activity. SSA will continue to evaluate whether
work activity is done under special conditions and/or is subsidized. Finally, SSA will continue to use separate earnings
criteria to evaluate the work activity of blind individuals in the DI program as in the current process.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Step 2_Medically Determinable Impairment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the statute requires that disability be the result of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment,
the absence of a medically determinable impairment will justify a finding that the individual is not disabled. Under
the new approach, decisionmakers will consider whether an individual has a medically determinable impairment or
combination of impairments, but will no longer impose a threshold ``severity'' requirement. Rather, the threshold
inquiry will be whether the individual has a medically determinable physical or mental impairment or combination
of impairments. To establish the presence of a medically determinable impairment, evidence must show an impairment
that results from anatomical, physiological, or psychological abnormalities which are demonstrable by medically
acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Decisionmakers will continue to evaluate the existence of a medically determinable impairment based on a weighing
of all evidence that is collected, recognizing that neither symptoms nor opinions of treating physicians alone will
support a finding that the individual has a medically determinable impairment or combination of impairments. There
must be medical signs and findings established by medically acceptable clinical or laboratory diagnostic techniques
which show the existence of a physical or mental impairment or combination of impairments. Depending on the nature
of an individual's alleged impairment(s), SSA will consider the extent to which medical personnel other than physicians
can provide evidence of a medically determinable impairment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There will be an exception to the requirement that evidence include medically acceptable clinical and/or laboratory
diagnostic techniques. This will occur when, even if SSA accepted all of the individual's allegations as true, SSA
still could not establish a period of disability; under these circumstances, SSA will not require evidence to establish
the existence of a medically determinable impairment. For instance, if an individual describes a condition as one
that will clearly not meet the 12-month duration requirement, (e.g., a simple fracture), SSA will deny the claim on
the basis that even if the allegations were medically documented, SSA could not establish a period of disability.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Step 3_Index of Disabling Impairments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If an individual has a medically determinable physical or mental impairment documented by medically acceptable
clinical and laboratory techniques, and the impairment will meet the duration requirement, the decisionmaker will
compare the individual's impairment(s) against an index of severely disabling impairments. The index will describe
impairments so severely debilitating that, when documented, can be presumed to equal a loss of functional ability
to perform substantial gainful activity without assessing the individual's functional ability. The index will
be consistent with the statutory definition of disability by limiting the presumption of inability to perform substantial
gainful activity, without considering age, education and previous work, to a relatively small number of claims with
the most severe disabilities. Individual functional ability will be assessed in all other cases in a consistent manner
at Step 4 in the process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the index will permit severely disabling impairments to be identified quickly and easily, it will only consist
of descriptions of specific impairments and the medical findings that are used to substantiate the existence and
severity of the particular disease entity. The medical findings in the index will be as nontechnical as possible and
will exclude such things as calibration or standardization requirements for specific tests and/or detailed test
results (e.g., pulmonary function studies or electrocardiogram tracings). The index will be easy to understand
and simple enough so that laypersons will be able to understand what is required to demonstrate a disabling impairment
in the index. Additionally, SSA will draw no conclusions about the effect of an individual's impairments on his or
her ability to function merely because an individual's impairment(s) does not meet the criteria in the index. Finally,
SSA will no longer need the concept of ``medical equivalence'' in relation to the index. Because impairments included
in the index are presumed to limit functional ability so as to preclude substantial gainful activity without reference
to an individual's age, education and previous work, a combination of impairments, or an impairment closely related
to one that is in the index, would be found disabling when an individual's functional ability is assessed. Therefore,
rules for determining equivalence for impairments in the index will not be necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Step 4_Ability to Engage in Any Substantial Gainful Activity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The majority of disability claims will be evaluated using a standardized approach to measuring functional ability
to perform substantial gainful activity. This standardized approach will realistically measure an individual's
functional ability to do the principal dimensions of work and task performance. The approach will be known and accepted
in the medical community. It will be universally used by public and private disability programs in which benefits
are based on the ability to perform work-related duties. Standardizing the approach to assessing individual functional
ability will facilitate consistent decisions regardless of the professional training of the decisionmakers in
the disability process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In using a standardized approach to measuring functional ability, SSA will be assessing the individual's physical
and mental abilities to perform work-related activities. Individualized assessments of functional ability will
also consider the effects of the individual's education. Once the individualized assessment of functional ability
is made, the individual's age will determine whether his or her functional ability is compared against the demands
of the individual's previous work or against a ``baseline'' of occupational demands. The baseline will describe
a range of work-related functions that represent work that exists in significant numbers in the national economy
that does not require prior skills or formal job training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Standardized Measure of Functional Ability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
SSA will develop, with the assistance of the medical and advocacy community and other outside experts from public
and private disability programs, standardized instruments or protocols which can be used to measure an individual's
functional ability. These standardized measures of functional ability will be linked to clinical and laboratory
findings to the extent that SSA needs to document the existence of a medically determinable impairment or combination
of impairments. However, extensive development of all available clinical and laboratory findings will not always
be necessary in evaluating an individual's functional ability to perform basic work activities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Functional assessment instruments will be designed to measure, as objectively as possible, an individual
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
s abilities to perform a baseline of occupational demands that includes the principal dimensions of work and task
performance, including primary physical, psychological, and cognitive processes. Examples of task performance
include, but are not limited to: physical capabilities, such as sitting, standing, walking, lifting, pushing, pulling;
mental capabilities, such as understanding, carrying out, and remembering simple instructions; using judgment;
responding appropriately to supervisors and co-workers in usual work situations; and responding appropriately
to changes in the routine work setting; and postural and environmental limitations. To the extent that current regulations
already set forth guidelines for evaluating an individual's ability to perform certain of these tasks, they will
be utilized in the new process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Functional assessment instruments will be designed to realistically assess an individual
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
s abilities to perform a baseline of occupational demands. To the extent possible, objective measures of function
will be developed. However, a realistic and individualized assessment of function may require, in addition to objective
measures of function, a standardized means or standardized tools for collecting information regarding an individual
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
s perceptions of his or her functioning, the effect of symptoms, including pain, and the individual
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
s activities of daily living. Functional assessment instruments may also require impairment-specific measures
to account for the episodic nature of certain impairments or to meet a more general need for longitudinal information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SSA will be primarily responsible for documenting functional ability using the standardized functional assessments.
In the near term, SSA will solicit information on which to base a functional assessment from treating medical sources,
other nonmedical sources, and from claimants in a manner that is similar to the current process. In the future, the
standardized functional assessments will be widely available and accepted so that functional assessments may be
performed by a variety of medical sources, including treating sources. The SSA goal will be to develop functional
assessment instruments that are standardized, that accurately measure an individual
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
s functional abilities and that are universally accepted by the public, the advocacy community, and health care professionals.
Ultimately, documenting functional ability will become the routine practice of physicians and other health care
professionals, such that a functional assessment with history and descriptive medical findings will become an accepted
component of a standard medical report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Disability insurance payers have incentives to participate in the research necessary to develop standardized functional
assessments and some private insurers have already expressed interest in working with SSA in this effort. Standardized
functional assessments will not only provide SSA with the functional information necessary to make disability decisions;
functional measurements will also assist in developing provider reimbursement levels relating to rehabilitation
and in assuring quality in rehabilitation programs by permitting assessment of the relationship between rehabilitative
interventions and outcomes. Ultimately, the use of the same functional assessment measurements by both SSA and medical
insurance payers will facilitate the cooperation and participation of the medical community in developing, refining,
and implementing them.

Baseline Occupational Demands
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
SSA will use the results of the standardized functional assessment in conjunction with a new standard that SSA will
develop to describe basic physical and mental demands of a baseline of work that represents substantial gainful activity
and that exists in significant numbers in the national economy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To develop the new approach, SSA will conduct research and will work in conjunction with outside experts and consumers
to specifically identify the activities that comprise a baseline of occupational demands needed to perform substantial
gainful activity. The baseline will describe a range of work-related functions that represent work that exists in
significant numbers in the national economy. In establishing the work-related functions that comprise an appropriate
baseline of occupational demands, SSA will ensure that: 1) the functional activities are a realistic reflection
of the demands of occupations that exist in significant numbers in the national economy; and 2) the occupations are
those that can be performed in the absence of prior skills or formal job training.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of Labor
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
s Advisory Panel for the Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT) has made recommendations for developing a new DOT
by 1996 which will be a data base system that collects, produces, and maintains accurate, reliable, and valid information
on all occupations in the national economy. This new system will provide comprehensive occupational data that includes,
but is not limited to: physical demands of work; sensory/perceptual requirements; cognitive job demands; physical
working conditions; and job characteristics such as pace or intensity of work, and the scope of interactions with
others. The development of a national data base with detailed occupational information should assist SSA in conducting
the initial research necessary to identify a baseline of occupational demands that represents work existing in significant
numbers in the national economy. It should also provide a mechanism to ensure that the baseline of occupational demands
remains current and reflects changes in the national economy over time.

Effect of Education
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The statute recognizes that education may play a role in an individual's ability to perform substantial gainful activity.
Experience demonstrates that educational level alone, i.e., the numerical grade level that an individual has attained,
may not be a good indicator of ability to function. For example, completion of a certain educational level in the remote
past, without any practical application of that education in recent work activity, has no positive effect on an individual's
ability to perform substantial gainful activity. Similarly, completion of a certain grade level does not necessarily
represent mastery of the subject matter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In relying on standardized functional assessments, SSA will be measuring an individual's ability to perform the
principal dimensions of work and task performance, including primary physical, psychological, and cognitive processes,
and the positive effects of education will be appropriately reflected in the assessment of an individual's cognitive
abilities. Thus, evaluation of a claimant's educational level will be done as an integral part of establishing the
functional ability of that individual. The baseline of occupational demands will not reference prior skills or significant
formal job training.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The issue of whether literacy and/or specific communication or language skills will be a factor in disability evaluation
depends on the extent to which such skills are occupational demands of work existing in significant numbers in the
national economy. In conducting the necessary research to identify the occupational demands of baseline work that
represents work existing in significant numbers in the national economy, SSA will need to consider whether literacy
or specific communication and language skills are required as occupational demands.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Effect of Age
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The effect of aging on the ability to perform substantial gainful work is very difficult to measure, especially in
the context of today's world when individuals are living longer than preceding generations. Despite this change,
the demographic characteristics of those preceding generations continue to provide the framework for disability
decisionmaking because SSA's approach for deciding disability has changed little since the inception of the DI program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statute recognizes that age should be considered in assessing disability on the assumption that the ability to
make a vocational adjustment to work other than work an individual has previously done may become more difficult with
age. In determining the impact of age, recognition should be given to the changes that occur with each succeeding generation.
Accordingly, in the new process, SSA will establish an age criterion in relation to the full retirement age. The full
retirement age will gradually increase over time, based on the recognition that succeeding generations can expect
to remain in the workforce for longer periods than the preceding generation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In applying age criterion under the new process, an individual who falls within the prescribed number of years preceding
the full retirement age will be considered as nearing full retirement age.'' In establishing what the prescribed
number of years should be, SSA will conduct research and consult with outside experts on the relationship between
age and an individual's ability to make vocational adjustments to work other than work the individual has done in the
recent past.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SSA will rely on the age of the individual in relation to the full retirement age to decide which of two decision paths
to follow as described in the next two sections.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Individuals Not Nearing Full Retirement Age
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For an individual who is not nearing full retirement age, SSA will compare the individual's functional abilities
against the functional demands of the baseline work. The ability to perform the baseline work will represent a realistic
opportunity to perform substantial gainful activity that exists in significant numbers in the national economy
and a finding of disability will not be appropriate.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
However, anyone who cannot perform the baseline work will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered unable to engage in substantial gainful activity, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a finding of disability will be justified. The range of work 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
represented by less than the baseline will be considered so 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
narrow that despite any other favorable factors, such as young 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
age or higher education or training, an individual would not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected to have a realistic opportunity to perform substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gainful work in the national economy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For individuals who are not nearing full retirement age, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ability or inability to perform previous work is not a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant factor. These individuals should be capable of making 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a vocational adjustment to other work, as long as they are

functionally capable of performing the baseline work.

Individuals Nearing Full Retirement Age 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For individuals who are nearing full retirement age, SSA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will compare the individual
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
s functional abilities against the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
functional demands of the individual
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
s previous work. Individuals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nearing full retirement age can not be expected to make a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vocational adjustment to work other than work they have performed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the recent past. However, consistent with the statute, if an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual, even one nearing full retirement age, is capable of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performing his or her previous work, SSA will find that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual is not disabled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For those individuals who have no previous work, SSA will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compare the individual
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
s functional ability to the range of work-related functions that represent work that exists in significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
numbers in the national economy, i.e., baseline work, and a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finding of not disabled will be appropriate if the individual is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capable of performing the baseline work. In such claims, when the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fact that the individual has no previous work is not related to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the existence of his or her impairment(s), a finding of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disability will not be appropriate if the individual retains the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
functional ability to perform a range of work-related functions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that represent work that exists in significant numbers in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
national economy. In contrast, those individuals who have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant functional limitations caused by a medically

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to perform a range of work-related functions that represent work

existing in significant numbers in the economy. Such individuals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be found disabled, as they are today.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
SSA will continue to rely on medical consultants to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expert advice and opinion regarding medical questions and issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that will arise in deciding disability claims. Disability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjudicators at all levels of the administrative review process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will call on the services of medical consultants to interpret 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
medical evidence, analyze specific medical questions, and provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expert opinions on existence, severity and functional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consequences of medically determinable impairments. Additionally, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on a national basis, SSA may identify specific types of issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that may require a medical opinion. If a medical consultant is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
called on to offer expert advice and opinion, the medical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consultant will provide a written analysis of the issues and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rationale in support of his or her opinion. The written analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be included in the record and will be considered with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Childhood Disability Methodology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As with adults, SSA must have a structured approach to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disability decisionmaking in childhood claims that takes into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration the relatively large number of claims and still 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides a basis for consistent, equitable decisionmaking by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjudicators at all levels of administrative review. The approach 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for childhood claims must also derive from the statute. Under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statute, ``an individual will be considered to be disabled for purposes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this title if he is unable to engage in any substantial gainful 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period of not less than 12 months 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(or in the case of a child 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the age of 18, if he suffers from any medically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determinable physical or mental impairment of comparable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
severity).

'' &sect;1614(a)(3)(A) of the Social Security Act) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of course, any decision approach for childhood claims must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be consistent with the Supreme Court
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Four-Step Evaluation Process for Children 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The disability decision methodology for childhood claims 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will consist of four steps that are based on the statutory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of disability. As with adults, the approach is one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that provides accurate decisions that can be achieved efficiently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and cost-effectively, primarily by ensuring that documentation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements are directed toward the ultimate finding of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disability. To the extent possible, the approach for childhood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claims should mirror the adult approach. The four steps are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Step 1_Is the child engaging in substantial gainful activity? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If yes, deny. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If no, continue to Step 2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Step 2_Does the child have a medically determinable physical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or mental impairment? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If no, deny. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If yes, continue to Step 3.* 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Step 3_Does the child have an impairment that is included in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Index of Disabling Impairments? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If yes, allow.* 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If no, continue to Step 4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Step 4_Does the child have an impairment(s) of comparable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
severity to an impairment(s) that would prevent an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adult from engaging in substantial gainful activity? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If yes, allow.* 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If no, deny.

*An impairment must meet the duration requirement of the statute;

disabling for 12 months.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Any child who is engaging in substantial gainful activity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not be found disabled regardless of the severity of his or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
her physical or mental impairments. The guidelines for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining whether a child is engaging in substantial gainful 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activity will be identical to the guidelines for adults. Although 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the issue of work activity will arise infrequently in childhood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claims, the step is warranted for two reasons: 1) the approach 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for adults and children should be as similar as possible; and 2) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a child approaches age 18, it is increasingly likely that work 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activity may be an issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 2_Medically Determinable Impairment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Because the statute requires that disability be the result 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combination of impairments, the absence of a medically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determinable impairment will justify a finding that a child is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not disabled. To establish the presence of a medically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determinable impairment or combination of impairments, evidence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must show an impairment that results from anatomical, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physiological, or psychological abnormalities which are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrable by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diagnostic techniques. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The same guidelines and rules that apply for adults will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply equally for children. SSA will continue to evaluate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existence of a medically determinable impairment based on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weighing of all evidence that is collected, recognizing that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neither symptoms nor opinions of treating physicians alone will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
support a finding of disability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SSA will use the same exception for evidence collection in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
childhood claims that will be applied in adult claims. If a child 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has a medically determinable physical or mental impairment that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is not an exception to further development, SSA will then 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluate whether the impairment(s) is included in the index of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disabling impairments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 3_Index of Disabling Impairments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
If a child has a medically determinable physical or mental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impairment or combination of impairments documented by medically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptable clinical and laboratory techniques and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impairment(s) will meet the duration requirement, SSA will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compare the child's impairment(s) against an index of disabling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impairments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As with adults, the index for childhood claims will function 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to quickly identify severely disabling impairments. The index 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will describe impairments so severely debilitating that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impairment is of comparable severity to an impairment that would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prevent an adult from engaging in substantial gainful activity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without assessing the child's functional ability. As with adults, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual functional ability in childhood claims will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessed in a consistent manner at Step 4 in the process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The index for childhood claims will consist of descriptions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of specific impairments and the medical findings that are used to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantiate the existence and severity of the particular disease 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entity. The medical findings in the index will be as nontechnical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as possible and will be simple enough so that laypersons will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
able to understand what is required to substantiate a disabling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impairment in the index. As with adults, SSA will draw no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conclusions about the effect of a child's impairments on his or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
her ability to function merely because a child's impairment(s) is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not included in the index. Additionally, SSA will no longer use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the concept of ``medical equivalence'' or functional equivalence in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relation to the childhood index. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 4_Comparable Severity to an Impairment(s) That Would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prevent an Adult From Engaging in Substantial Gainful Activity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Consistent with the approach for adult claims, SSA will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
develop, with the assistance of the medical community and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
educational experts, standardized instruments which can be used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to measure a child's functional ability. These standardized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measures of functional ability will be linked to clinical and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laboratory findings to the extent that SSA needs to document the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existence of a medically determinable impairment or combination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of impairments. The functional assessment instruments will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designed to measure, as objectively as possible, a child's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ability to function independently, appropriately, and effectively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in an age-appropriate manner. Ultimately, the course of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documenting and developing for functional abilities in childhood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claims will, to the extent possible, mirror the adult approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, SSA will consider whether it is appropriate to defer the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development of standardized functional assessment instruments for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use in childhood claims until it gains experience in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development, refinement and use of such instruments for adults. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SSA will use the results of the standardized functional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessments to determine whether a child has impairment(s) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comparable severity to an impairment(s) that would prevent an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adult from engaging in substantial gainful activity, as in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current process.

Timely and Accurate Decisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
SSA's ability to provide timely and accurate disability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decisions depends to a significant degree on the quality of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
medical evidence it can obtain and the speed with which it can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtain it. The medical evidence collection process accounts for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considerable portion of the total time involved in processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disability claims. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new process will eliminate multiple, repetitive requests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for information from health care providers. Health care providers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be relieved of requests for information that burden them 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with far too much paperwork and will be compensated for the time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
invested in providing information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Core Diagnostic and Functional Information Focus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The goals of the evidence collection process will be to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
focus requests for evidence on the critical diagnostic and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
functional assessment information necessary for a disability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision and to form a new partnership with the sources of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information so that it can be obtained in the most efficient, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost-effective manner. Medical evidence development will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
driven by the four-step approach used to decide disability. Two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the core elements of that approach are: (1) identifying an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual's medically determinable impairments (including those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that meet the Index of Disabling Impairments criteria); and (2) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessing the functional consequences of those impairments. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decisionmaker will develop medical evidence that is sufficient to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfy the core elements but target evidentiary development to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtain only the evidence necessary to reach an accurate decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the ultimate question of disability.

Treating Source Preference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
SSA will give primary emphasis to obtaining medical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information from treating sources that provides brief, but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific, diagnostic information regarding an individual's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
medically determinable impairments and the functional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consequences of those impairments. Treating source statements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will include diagnostic information about a claimant's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impairments, the clinical and laboratory findings which provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the basis for the diagnosis, onset and duration, response to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment, and the functional limitations that can reasonably be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
linked to the clinical and laboratory findings. Depending on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nature and extent of an individual's impairments and treating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources, statements from multiple medical sources may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate. Once the standardized measurement criteria described 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
earlier are widely available, a standardized functional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment available from a treating source will be accepted as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
probative evidence. Treating sources or another examining source 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may perform the standardized functional assessment at SSA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expense. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->
Standardized Request Form 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
SSA will develop a standardized form which effectively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tailors a request for evidence to the specific diagnostic and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
functional assessment information necessary to make a disability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision. Such information includes but is not limited to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diagnostic information about a claimant's impairments, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clinical and laboratory findings which provide the basis for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diagnosis, onset and duration, response to treatment, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
functional limitations that can reasonably be linked to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clinical and laboratory findings. Treating sources will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
encouraged to submit such information electronically. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standardizing requests for evidence in this manner will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilitate the participation of claimants, representatives and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third parties in the evidence collection process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The form will permit treating sources to provide necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diagnostic and functional assessment information in summary form 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on a single document. In appropriate circumstances, SSA will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accept a treating source's statements on the standardized form as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to history and diagnosis, the clinical and laboratory findings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which provide the basis for the diagnosis, onset and duration, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
response to treatment, and the functional limitations that can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonably be linked to the clinical and laboratory findings, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without resorting to the traditional, wholesale procurement of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actual medical records. In completing standardized forms, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treating sources will certify that they have in their possession 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the medical documentation referred to in the statement and that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
said documentation will be promptly submitted at the request of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SSA. The certification approach does not relieve treating sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from providing objective evidence in support of their diagnoses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and opinions; rather it is designed to streamline the collection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of necessary evidence. The approach is also consistent with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence collection methods used by private disability insurance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carriers, which request specific medical records in individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claims, when necessary and appropriate to the individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances, or at random as part of a quality assurance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Treating source completion of the standardized forms will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitored to prevent fraud. Decisionmakers will verify treating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
source statements by obtaining underlying medical records when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate. The automated claim processing system will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilitate effective monitoring of the evidence submission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practices of individual treating sources by permitting random 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and/or targeted selection of claim files involving that treating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
source for quality assurance and program integrity reviews.

Treating Source Incentives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
As in the current process, SSA will pay for the reasonable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost of providing existing medical evidence. SSA will acknowledge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the value of treating source information by establishing a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
national fee reimbursement schedule for medical evidence. The fee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reimbursement schedule will utilize a sliding-scale mechanism to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reward the early submission of medical information; additionally, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the sliding scale will be adjusted to reflect the quality of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence received. A national, sliding-scale fee schedule will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide incentives for treating sources to cooperate in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidentiary development process and invest quality time to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide medical certifications on behalf of their patients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SSA will provide resources to focus professional educational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efforts and medical relations outreach at the local and/or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regional level to ensure that treating sources are given 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
up-to-date information on program requirements and made aware of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific evidentiary needs or problems as they arise in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjudication process. SSA will conduct educational outreach on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the national level on an ongoing basis with the medical community 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to provide a better understanding of the SSA disability programs, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the medical and functional requirements for eligibility, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
best ways to provide medical information needed for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decisionmaking.

Consultative Examination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
If a claimant has no treating source, or a treating source 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is unable or unwilling to provide the necessary evidence, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there is conflict in the evidence that can not be resolved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through evidence from treating sources, the decisionmaker will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refer the claimant for an appropriate consultative examination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the standardized measurement criteria for assessing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
function will be widely available, consulting sources will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
able to perform functional assessments that, in the absence of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequate treating source information or where there are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unresolved conflicts in the evidence, will be considered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
probative evidence. Depending on the service area, SSA will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider contracting with large health care providers to furnish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consultative examinations for a specified geographic location. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of an ongoing training and medical relations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program, SSA will ensure that providers of consultative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examinations are provided adequate training on disability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements. Those medical providers who conduct consultative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examinations for SSA will also need ongoing training regarding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes in the disability program. SSA will prepare training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs for this audience which will utilize written, audiotape, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
videotape, and computerized training methods.

To eliminate the public perception that multiple, mandatory

appeal steps are obstacles to receiving timely, fair, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accurate decisions, SSA will reduce the number of mandatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appeals steps in the administrative process. Streamlining the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appeals process will not only promote more timely decisions but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also ensure that claimants do not inappropriately withdraw from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the claim process based on a perception that it is too difficult 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or time-consuming to pursue their appeal rights.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Claimants will be able to fully participate in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative appeals process with or without a representative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SSA will ensure that claimants are fully advised of their right 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to representation and SSA will routinely provide the appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
referral sources for representation. SSA will also encourage the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
early participation of a representative when the claimant has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appointed one and will give the representative responsibility for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developing evidence necessary to decide a claim. However, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision whether to appoint a representative must remain with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claimant and SSA will neither encourage nor discourage claimants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in seeking representation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The administrative appeals process will instill public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confidence in the integrity of the system. To instill such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confidence, SSA will provide an initial decisionmaking process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that is thorough and results in fully developed records with fair 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and accurate decisions. Additionally, the claimant will be given 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the basis of a decision in clear and understandable language. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, SSA will ensure that its policies have been consistently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applied at all levels of administrative review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted previously, the initial disability determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will use a ``statement of the claim'' approach which will set forth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the issues in the claim, the relevant facts, the evidence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered, including any evidence or information obtained as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result of the predecision notice, and the rationale in support of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the determination. The statement of the claim will be part of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on-line claim record and will stand as the basis and rationale 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the Agency's action, if the claimant seeks further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative review. SSA will standardize claim file 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparation and assembly, including the use of appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electronic records, at all levels of administrative process until 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such time as the claims record is fully electronic. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

First Appeal Level 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Because the initial determination will be the result of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process that ensures fully developed evidentiary records and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ample opportunity for the claimant to personally present 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional evidence prior to an adverse determination, there will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be no need for any intermediate appeal (e.g., reconsideration) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior to the ALJ hearing. If the claimant disagrees with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initial determination, the claimant may, within 60 days of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receiving notice, request an ALJ hearing.

Adjudication Officer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
When a claimant requests an ALJ hearing, an adjudication 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
officer will conduct an interview in person, by telephone, or by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
videoconference, and become the primary point of contact for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claimant. The adjudication officer will have the same knowledge, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
skills and abilities as the adjudicators who decide claims 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initially. The adjudication officer will also have specialized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
knowledge regarding hearings procedures. The adjudication officer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be the focal point for all prehearing activities but will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
work closely with the ALJ, medical consultants and the disability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claim manager, when appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The adjudication officer will provide the claimant an in-depth understanding of the hearing process, with particular
focus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the right to representation. To prevent delays caused by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lack of understanding of this right, the adjudication officer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will again provide the appropriate referral sources for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representation; give the claimant, where appropriate, copies of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary claim file documents to facilitate the appointment of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative; and encourage the claimant to decide about the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
need for and choice of a representative as soon as is practical. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The adjudication officer will be available to answer the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claimant's questions and concerns regarding the hearing process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The adjudication officer will also identify the issues in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dispute and whether there is a need for additional evidence. If 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the claimant has a representative, the representative will have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the responsibility to develop evidence. If the claimant has a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative, the adjudication officer will also conduct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
informal conferences with the representative, in person or by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
telephone, to identify the issues in dispute and prepare written 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stipulations as to those issues not in dispute. If the claimant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submits additional evidence, the adjudication officer may refer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the claim for further medical consultation and opinion, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The adjudication officer will have full authority to issue a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revised favorable decision if the evidence so warrants. This will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure that allowance decisions are expedited and not delayed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
until a formal hearing before an ALJ. If the adjudication officer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issues a favorable decision, the adjudication officer will refer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the claim to a disability claim manager to effectuate payment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The adjudication officer will consult with the ALJ during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the course of prehearing activities, as necessary and appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the circumstances in the claim. As a preliminary matter, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjudication officer will also routinely schedule a date for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing that is a standard number of days after the hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request. Standardizing the hearing date process will facilitate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claimant understanding and reduce the possibility of non-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appearance at the hearing. It will also enable representatives to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan their schedules when taking on a case. The adjudication 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
officer may exercise discretion in establishing an earlier or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
later hearing date depending on the individual circumstances and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the ALJ's calendar. Electronic access to ALJs' calendars, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established by individual ALJs, will facilitate timely and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate scheduling of hearings. The adjudication officer will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refer the prepared record to an ALJ only after all evidentiary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development is complete and the claimant or a representative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agrees that the claim is ready to be heard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ALJ will retain the authority and ability to develop the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
record. However, use of an adjudication officer realigns most, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not all, prehearing activities so that the burden of ensuring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their completion rests with other members of the adjudicative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
team. With completely developed claims before them, ALJs will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
able to concentrate their efforts on conducting more hearings and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rendering decisions faster.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The ALJ hearing will be a de novo

ALJ considers and weighs the evidence and reaches a new decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de novo
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 hearing is consistent with the role of an ALJ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
envisioned under the Administrative Procedure Act. Under that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scheme, the ALJ is an independent decisionmaker who must apply an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency's governing statute, regulations and policies, but who is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not subject to advance direction and control by the agency with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respect to the decisional outcome in any individual claim. ALJs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are independent triers of fact who perform their evidentiary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factfinding function free from agency influence. At the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time, the Administrative Procedure Act ensures that an ALJ's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision is subject to later review by the agency, thus giving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the agency full authority over policy. Policy responsibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remains exclusively with the agency while the public has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assurance that the facts are found by an official who is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to agency influence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A hearing before an ALJ will remain an informal adjudicatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proceeding as it is under the current process. The claimant will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have the right to be represented by an attorney or a non-attorney 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the decision regarding representation made by the claimant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alone. An informal, nonadversarial proceeding is consistent with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the public's strong preference for a simple, accessible hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process that permits, but does not require, a representative. An 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
informal process facilitates the earlier and faster resolution of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the issues in dispute, thus promoting more timely decisions.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As an independent factfinder in a nonadversarial proceeding, the ALJ will still have a role in protecting both SSA
interests and the claimant
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
s interests, particularly when the claimant is unrepresented. However, an improved initial determination process
with its focus on early and comprehensive evidentiary development, predecision notices and opportunity for personal
interviews, fully rationalized initial decisions, and prehearing analysis of contested issues should ensure that
the Agency position is fully explored and presented to the ALJ. Moreover, the primary burden of compiling an evidentiary
record will be shifted to the representative_if one is appointed_or to the claimant (when able to do so), with assistance
(when necessary) from SSA personnel. This will permit the ALJ, in most circumstances, to close the record at the conclusion
of the oral hearing, deliberate on the issues, and render prompt decisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In making disability decisions, ALJs will rely on the same standards for decisionmaking that are used by the disability
claim managers and adjudication officers. Adjudication officers and other decision writers will assist ALJs in
preparing hearing decisions, using the same decision support system that supports the preparation of initial disability
determinations. A simplified disability decisional methodology, in conjunction with the use of prehearing stipulations
that frame the issues in dispute, will result in shorter, more focused hearing decisions. If the ALJ issues a favorable
decision, he or she will refer the claim to a disability claim manager to effectuate payment.

Final Decision of the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the new process, if a claimant is dissatisfied with the ALJ's decision, the claimant's next level of appeal will
be to Federal district court. A claimant's request for Appeals Council review will no longer be a prerequisite to seeking
judicial review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As under the current process, the Appeals Council will continue to have a role in ensuring that claims subject to judicial
review have properly prepared records and that the Federal courts only consider claims where appellate review is
warranted. Accordingly, the Appeals Council, working with Agency counsel, will evaluate all claims in which a civil
action has been filed and decide, within a fixed time limit whether it wishes to defend the ALJ's decision as the final
decision of the Secretary. If the Appeals Council reviews a claim on its own motion, it will seek voluntary remand from
the court for the purpose of affirming, reversing or remanding the ALJ's decision. The Secretary's authority for
seeking voluntary remand prior to the Secretary's filing of an answer to the civil action is currently provided for
in &sect;205(g) of the Act. Favorable Appeals Council decisions will be returned to the disability claim manager
to effectuate payment. The number of civil actions requiring substantive action by the Appeals Council will be relatively
small because, in the new process, ALJ decisions will be the result of a fully developed evidentiary record where the
factual and legal issues have been focused for final resolution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the Appeals Council will have a role in a comprehensive quality assurance system. As part of the in-line
review component of this system, which is described in greater detail below, the Appeals Council will conduct its
own motion reviews of ALJ decisions (both allowances and denials) and dismissals prior to effectuation. If the Appeals
Council decides to review a claim on its own motion, the Appeals Council may affirm, reverse or remand the ALJ's decision,
or vacate the dismissal. The Appeals Council's review will be limited to the record that was before the ALJ. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency will establish appropriate mechanisms to respond to claimant allegations of ALJ misconduct or bias. To
the extent that the allegations of ALJ misconduct may affect the final decision in a claim, the Agency will consider
whether an appropriate mechanism includes some form of final Agency review at the claimant's request.

System of Agency Accountability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
SSA will be accountable to the public, the ultimate judge of the quality of SSA service, and will strive to consistently
meet or exceed the public's expectations. SSA will have a comprehensive quality assurance program that defines its
quality standards, continually communicates them to employees in a clear and consistent manner, and provides employees
with the means to achieve them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The quality assurance program will have three primary components: 1) substantial resources to ensure that the right
decision is made the first time; 2) comprehensive and systematic reviews of the quality of the decisionmaking process
at all levels; and 3) measures of customer satisfaction against the SSA standards for service.

Investment in Employees

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
SSA's ability to ensure that the right decision is made the first time depends on a well-trained, skilled, and highly
motivated workforce that has the program tools and technological support to issue quality decisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SSA will make an investment in comprehensive employee training to ensure that all employees have the necessary knowledge
and skills to perform the duties of their positions. SSA will develop national training programs for initial job training
and orientation as well as continuing education to maintain job knowledge and skills. Such training will include
general communication skills and how to deal effectively with the public generally, and disability claimants in
particular. National training programs will also address changes to program policy. Consistent program policy
training will be provided to disability decisionmakers at all levels of the process.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to initial program training, continuing education opportunities will be made available to employees
to enhance current performance or career development. These opportunities may be in the form of self-help instruction
packages, videotapes, satellite broadcasts, or non-SSA training or educational opportunities. SSA will ensure
that employees are given sufficient time and opportunity to complete the required continuing education. Employee
feedback on the value of these continuing education opportunities, including the quality of training materials,
methods, and instructors, will be used to continually improve training programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to formal program training, SSA will rely on a targeted system of in-line quality reviews and monitoring
of adjudicative practices for all employees. The elements include a mentoring process for new employees, peer review
for experienced employees and management oversight at key points in the adjudicative process. SSA will create mechanisms
that facilitate peer discussions of difficult claims or issues. Quality reviewers and policy makers will participate
in these types of discussions. Peer reviews and mentoring will not only promote timely and accurate development of
disability claims, but will also foster a spirit of teamwork. They will also promote earlier identification and resolution
of problems with policy or procedures. Managers will be expected to oversee the adjudication process. They will conduct
spot checks at key points in the adjudication process or perform special reviews based on profiles of error-prone
claims. The goal of these reviews is to provide immediate, constructive feedback on identified errors to reduce or
eliminate their possible recurrence. Payment errors on claims detected during in-line reviews will be corrected
before a claimant is notified of the decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted previously, under the Administrative Procedure Act, the ALJ is an independent decisionmaker who must apply
an agency's governing statute, regulations and policies, but who is not subject to advance direction and control
by the agency with respect to the decisional outcome in any individual claim. Accordingly, a system of peer review,
mentoring and management oversight in advance of the ALJ's decisionmaking is inappropriate. However, the ALJ decision
may be subject to final agency review. Therefore, as part of the in-line quality assurance process, ALJ decisions
(both allowances and denials) and dismissals will be subject to review by the Appeals Council on its own motion prior
to effectuation of the ALJ's decision or dismissal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several key features previously described in this plan are critical to ensuring that adjudicators have the necessary
program tools to issue accurate decisions. A single presentation of all substantive policies used in determining
eligibility for benefits must be in place. Additionally, an automated and integrated claim processing system will
provide the necessary technological support for adjudicators at all levels of the administrative process. Expert
systems will be developed to integrate disability policy into the claim processing system. Among other things, the
claim processing system will facilitate claims taking, evidence development, and the preparation of accurate notices
and decisions by providing on-line editing capacity to identify errors in advance and decision support software
to assist in analysis and decisionmaking. The processing system will help to identify errors of both procedure and
substance, and also support routine analysis to aid in avoiding future similar errors. An on-line technical review
will occur each time information is added to the electronic record. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comprehensive employee education and an in-line review system will build quality into the system of adjudication
with the goal of error prevention. SSA must monitor that quality on a systematic, national basis. Accordingly, all
employees (including ALJs) will be subject to and receive continuous feedback from comprehensive end-of-line reviews
as described in the following section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
End-of-Line Reviews 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A second necessary component of quality assurance is an integrated system of national postadjudicative monitoring
to ensure the integrity of the administrative process and to promote national uniformity in the adjudication of disability
claims at all levels of the process. This system of quality measurement will include comprehensive reviews of the
whole adjudicatory process. At a minimum, a comprehensive end-of-line quality measurement system must: be statistically
valid; review both allowances and denials in equal proportion; review the entire disability claim process, both
the medical and nonmedical aspects; and review claims decided at all levels of the adjudicatory process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These end-of-line reviews will focus on whether correct decisions were made at the earliest possible point in the
process. This type of review will not be aimed at correcting errors in individual claims but, rather, will be the means
to oversee, monitor and provide feedback on the application of Agency policies at all levels of decisionmaking. However,
erroneous decisions detected during end-of-line reviews will be subject to existing reopening regulations. Reliance
on an integrated claim processing system will facilitate the selection of a statistically valid sample of claims
at all levels of the process for this review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An integrated claim processing system will permit the selection of other postadjudicative samples of claims as SSA
deems necessary to effectively test new operational procedures or monitor specific procedures in the administrative
process; oversee the implementation of new program policy regulations and initiatives; and monitor both internal
and external claims development practices to prevent fraud. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SSA will use the results from these end-of-line reviews to identify areas for improvement in policies, processes
or employee education and training. SSA will also use the results to profile error-prone claims with the goal of preventing
errors at the front end.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A final component of quality assurance is measuring customer satisfaction. To measure whether SSA has met or exceeded
the public's service expectations, SSA must measure the public's level of satisfaction with the level of service
SSA provides. Customer surveys (including feedback cards) and periodic focus groups will be the most frequently
used methods of determining the public's views on the quality of SSA service. SSA will also survey representatives
and third parties who provide assistance or act on claimants' behalf in dealing with SSA. Survey results will be communicated
to staff on a timely basis, both as Agency feedback and individual feedback, along with any plans to address identified
problems.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
SSA will also seek employee feedback on how well SSA has met their expectations. Employee feedback will be sought on
a wide array of issues including Agency goals and performance indicators, training and mentoring needs, and the quality
of operating instructions. Although formal mechanisms will be used to obtain feedback periodically, each employee
will be encouraged to provide continuous feedback on how to make improvements in the process.

Service Perspective
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
SSA's measures of performances will be revised to assess the performance of the Agency as a whole in providing service
to claimants for disability benefits. Management information regarding the contributions at each step in the process
to the final product, as well as to the work product passed on to other steps will be available. For example, current
component processing time measures will be replaced by a measure of time from the first point of contact with SSA until
final claimant notification. Meaningful, timely management information will be facilitated by a seamless claim
processing system with a common database that is used by all individuals who contribute to each step in the process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other measures, such as cost, productivity, pending workload, and accuracy will be developed or revised to assess
the performance of the Agency as a whole and the participants in the process who contribute to this performance. Measurements
for public awareness, as well as claimant and employee satisfaction, will add to this assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management information will be current and accessible from an intelligent workstation. In addition to routine,
published national reports generated from the management information system, other reports needed by national
or local entities, or individual employees will be preformatted and system-generated on demand. Managers and employees
will have the flexibility to change parameters and to access the full data base, permitting comparisons of performance
and trends analysis. The management information system will also permit customized, ad hoc reports for special studies
or immediate special purpose activities with access to the full data base. Tools including user-friendly report
generator software and statistical forecasting and modeling applications will be available on the intelligent
workstation to assist users in the data analysis.

New Process Enablers
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Reengineering is dependent on a number of key factors that provide the framework for the new process design. Each of
these ``enablers'' is an essential element in the new disability process.

Process Unification
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Social Security Act, the Secretary is granted broad authority to promulgate regulations to govern the disability
determination process. In addition to regulations, SSA publishes: 1) Social Security Rulings, which are precedential
court decisions and policy statements or interpretations that SSA has adopted as binding policy, and 2) Acquiescence
Rulings, which explain how a decision by a U.S. Court of Appeals will be applied when the court's holding is at variance
with the Agency's interpretation of a provision of the statute or regulations. ALJs and the Appeals Council rely on
the regulations and rulings in making disability decisions. However, guidance for decisionmakers at the initial
and reconsideration levels is provided in a series of administrative publications, including: 1) the Program Operations
Manual System instructions which provide the substance of the statute, regulations, and rulings in a structured
format and 2) other administrative issuances which clarify or elaborate specific policy issues. The use of different
source documents by adjudicators fosters the perception that different policy standards are being applied at different
levels of decisionmaking in the disability claim process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure that SSA provides consistent direction to all adjudicators regarding the standards for decisionmaking,
SSA will develop a single presentation of all substantive policies used in the determination of eligibility for benefits.
These policies will be published in accordance with the Administrative Procedures Act and all decisionmakers will
be bound by these same policies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Public and Professional Education
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Public and professional education is essential to ensure that individuals and other groups involved in the disability
process have a proper understanding of SSA disability programs, their medical and nonmedical requirements, and
the nature of the decisionmaking process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SSA will make information widely available for the general population with the goal of reducing general inquiries
from members of the public unfamiliar with SSA disability programs and increasing the number of claimants who enter
the disability process knowledgeable and prepared to assume responsibility for pursuing their claims. Pamphlets,
factsheets, posters, videos, information on diskettes and on computer bulletin board systems will be developed
and presented in a simple, straightforward and understandable manner. Information will be available in many languages
and dialects and will accommodate vision and hearing impaired individuals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SSA will work with national and local groups involved in the disability programs to develop direct lines of communications.
These efforts will be aimed not only at providing information but also at creating ongoing organizational relationships
to maintain a dialogue about the disability process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SSA will also conduct educational outreach with the medical community to provide them with a better understanding
of the SSA disability programs, the medical and functional requirements for eligibility, and the best ways to provide
medical information needed for decisionmaking. In addition to the use of printed materials, SSA will arrange briefings
and training sessions in association with medical organizations and societies at the local, State and national levels,
as well as through hospital staff meetings. Those medical providers who conduct consultative examinations for SSA
will need ongoing training regarding changes in the disability program. SSA will prepare training programs for this
audience which will utilize written, audiotape, videotape, and computerized training methods.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SSA will conduct outreach efforts with the legal community, to ensure that information about the disability programs
is widely available to the organized bar and the Federal judiciary. Policy documents, regularly updated electronically,
and rules of representation will be available at forums sponsored by the organized bar and in initial orientation
and continuing legal education programs designed for Federal judges.

Claimant Partnership
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
SSA's interaction with claimants will focus on enabling their participation in the process. SSA will also work with
third parties, such as family members and community-based organizations, to provide additional claimant support.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Understandable public information materials and comprehensive information packets will be widely available.
Explanations of the programs, the decisionmaking process, and claimant responsibilities will be widely available
and furnished at the point individuals first make contact with SSA. Claimants, who are able to do so, will be asked to
do more to facilitate development of supporting information, particularly with respect to medical evidence. To
encourage the release of evidence by treating medical sources, SSA will network with the treating source community
to overcome the lack of understanding and possible resistance to providing patient information. SSA will encourage
private insurers and public agencies that refer claimants to SSA as a condition of receiving other benefits to provide
medical evidence for these individuals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SSA will develop ongoing relationships with community organizations to ensure that competent third-party resources
are available to assist the claimants. Examples of resources that SSA will help develop include: transportation
and escort services for indigent claimants and those who experience difficulty in getting to consultative examinations;
enhancement of medical provider capacity to identify potentially eligible patients, secure claims and provide
medical evidence; and software with compatible format design which will allow direct input of claim-related information
to SSA. SSA will have an ongoing demonstration program that provides funds for truly innovative projects that test
models for national implementation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to expedite the referral of potentially eligible individuals, SSA will develop productive working relationships
with Federal, State and local programs that serve individuals with disabilities. Other programs will be able to use
SSA-developed decisional support systems to evaluate potentially eligible persons prior to referral and to transfer
information to SSA through compatible databases. Local managers will be encouraged to develop and maintain appropriate
working relationships with local Federal, State and third-party resources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Active participation by claimants, supported by SSA's efforts and the contributions of third parties will result
in a fundamental shift in claimant expectations and satisfaction with the SSA disability process. From the SSA perspective,
the results will be better service to customers through timely, fully supported decisions rendered at all decisional
levels; better use of SSA resources focused on helping those who need assistance; and greater public confidence in
the disability adjudication process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Workforce Maximization
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Teamwork and workforce empowerment are fundamental ingredients in the new process. In carrying out their duties
and responsibilities, adjudicators will work in a team environment with internal medical and nonmedical experts,
who provide advice and assistance for complex case adjudication, as well as with technical and other clerical personnel
who may handle more routine aspects of case development and payment effectuation. The disability claim manager will
be the focal point at the initial claim level, assisted by technical and medical support staff. The adjudication officer
will be the focal point at the prehearing level, relying on technical and medical support staff, as well as interacting
with the disability claim manager and the ALJ, as necessary. The ALJ will be the focal point at the hearing level, receiving
support from technical and medical support staff, and also interacting with the adjudication officer and disability
claim manager, as necessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each team member will have at least a basic familiarity with all the steps in the process and an understanding of how
he/she complements another's efforts. Team members will be knowledgeable but will also be able to draw upon each other's
expertise on complex issues. Communication among team members will encourage consistent application of disability
policy. Improved automated systems will enable members of the team to work together using a shared data base even when
they are not co-located. Handoffs, rework, and non-value steps will be significantly reduced and fewer employees
will be involved in shepherding each claim through the process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Employees will perform multiple tasks instead of singular activities, thus their roles will expand to encompass
more of the ``whole'' job. This will enable employees to experience the direct relationship between their actions
and the final product. Adequate resources and sufficient training and mentoring will allow employees to acquire
the skills they need to process claims from intake through adjudication. Employees will feel more of a sense of ownership
for the services they perform as a member of a team focused on serving claimants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new process will rely heavily on increased employee empowerment, applying information technology and using
professional judgment to complete tasks more effectively and efficiently without constant checking, direction
and micro-management. Recognition and reward processes will be revised to emphasize contributions to team outcomes
and acquisition of knowledge bases. Continuous quality improvement activities will foster ongoing incremental
process change.

Representatives: New Rules and Standards of Conduct
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Social Security Act and regulations have long recognized the representational rights of claimants and have provided
an administrative framework designed to ensure that claimants will have access to the legal community and others
in the pursuit of their claims. Representatives currently have the option for authorization of fees through two procedures:
1) the fee petition method, whereby the representative presents an itemization of services rendered and time expended,
and SSA determines a reasonable fee; and 2) the fee agreement method, whereby the claimant and representative agree
to a fee of 25 percent of the retroactive benefits due or $4,000, whichever is less.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Focus groups of claimants and the general public have indicated that the disability program is too complex to understand
and the process too fragmented and difficult for them to navigate alone. While many claimants resent having to pay
a representative to establish entitlement to government-sponsored benefits, they feel that they have no choice
if they want to be successful in this pursuit. Although the current regulations provide protection for claimants
from fee abuses, these rules fall short of assuring claimants that the representatives they retain are qualified
and will adequately represent their interests.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the new process, SSA will continue to have a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility for monitoring representational activity and for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safeguarding the interests of claimants. The new process will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establish rules of representation and standards of conduct to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure that representatives fulfill their responsibilities and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
serve the needs of the claimants they represent. These new rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will, among other things, ensure that claimants receive competent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representation; establish a code of professional conduct for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representatives in all matters before SSA; and provide sanctions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
against representatives, including suspension and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disqualification from appearing before the Agency in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative capacity, for violating the rules of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representation and standards of conduct. Without disturbing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statutory intent of facilitating claimant access to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representatives, the simplified and user-friendly new process may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
well result in more claimants pursuing their claims without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representation. However, the issue of representation will remain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a matter of a claimant's personal choice. The new rules and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards of conduct provide the framework for assuring that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representatives claimants retain will be qualified, will have the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obligation to fully develop the record on their behalf, will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequately represent their interests, and will be accountable for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
misconduct or dereliction of duty. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SSA will also conduct outreach efforts with the legal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community, to ensure that information about the disability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs is widely available to the organized bar and the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
judiciary. Policy documents, regularly updated electronically, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and rules of representation will be available at forums sponsored

Information Technology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Information technology will be a vital element in the new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disability claim process. To the fullest extent possible, SSA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will take advantage of the ``Information Highway'' and those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technological advances that can improve the disability process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and help provide world-class service. The new process will rely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on seamless, electronic processing of disability claims from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first contact with the claimant to the final decision, including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all levels of administrative appeal. Existing Agency design plans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for Intelligent Workstation/Local Area Network (IWS/LAN) and a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Modernized Disability System will provide an integrated system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the electronic connectivity necessary to support the new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disability process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a seamless electronic environment, all employees will use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the same hardware, the same claim assignment and scheduling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
software, the same decision support software, the same case 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control system, the same fiscal and accounting software, the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
integrated quality assurance functionality, and the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management information system throughout all stages of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process. In this environment, data will need to be input and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
validated once and multiple employees may access a single claim 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
record simultaneously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information technology will be applied to enhance access to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services by claimants, their representatives, and other third 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parties. Claimants will be able to conduct business with SSA via 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
telephone, self-help workstations, kiosks, videoconferencing, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electronic data transfer at SSA facilities and other satellite 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
locations. SSA will conduct forums and produce video and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
computer-based training materials for third parties who wish to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participate in assisting claimants to file applications and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gather medical evidence. Wherever possible, physicians and health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
care organizations, advocates, community counseling services, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other professionals who regularly provide assistance to SSA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claimants will be supplied with SSA software to electronically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complete Agency forms. Data will be transferred to SSA using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreed upon methods. SSA will allow authorized representatives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate access to electronic claim folders. Paper versions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treating source forms will be designed so that the data can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
read by scanning equipment into SSA claim processing systems. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
single vendor payment system will be used to pay certain evidence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providers for information which they provide SSA. To further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paperless processing, SSA will adopt a ``signature on file'' policy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the claimant's evidence release authorization to eliminate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
routing of paper medical release forms.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ability of decisionmakers to conduct thorough interviews 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and evidence evaluation, and timely and accurate claim 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjudication is predicated on the implementation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
functionality provided by the IWS/LAN hardware and software 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
components, and the decision support features of the Modernized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Disability System. Expert system software will be included in SSA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claim processing systems to assist disability decisionmakers in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the analysis and evaluation of complex eligibility factors, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to ensure that the correct procedures for disability evaluation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are followed. While conducting interviews, disability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decisionmakers will rely on decision support features that ask 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impairment-specific questions. The decision support system will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use the accumulated data of the electronic record to assist in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the preparation of the predecision notice, the statement of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claim, and decisions rendered on appeal. Where disability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision team members cannot be physically co-located, they can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remain in communication by using two-way TV and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
videoconferencing technologies. Disability policy will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developed and stored in a format that can be integrated into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
computer systems as the source of context-sensitive help screens 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and decision-support messages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Quality assurance features fully supported by the Modernized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Disability System will be integrated throughout the new process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, the national end-of-line quality review sample will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be electronically selected and automatically routed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate staff. In-line programmatic quality assurance, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enhanced by the use of decision support systems, will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programmed into the computer applications and will help to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identify errors of both oversight and substance, and also support 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
routine analysis to aid in avoiding future similar errors. An 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on-line technical review will occur each time information is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
added to the electronic record. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Quality assurance and productivity measures will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporated in a new, total-process management information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system. Meaningful, timely management information for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disability process is dependent on a seamless data processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system used by all components which affords a common case control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system and a common data base. SSA's claim processing systems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
integrated on an Agency-wide IWS/LAN platform will provide this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seamless environment.

Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
SSA's strategy of coming to closure on an ideal, high-level 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disability process design before undertaking detailed operational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and implementation planning has been consistent from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beginning of the reengineering project. Although this project 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management approach served SSA well, it has made the very 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary task of cost/benefit projections unusually challenging. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following cost/benefit forecasts will need to evolve as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation details are developed. The administrative cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
numbers presented here cannot be applied to SSA's administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
budget without further analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SSA will move forward on all aspects of the process redesign 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan; however, because of the extensive research and development 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required for implementation of the simplified disability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination methodology, we have not considered the effect of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this redesign feature in our cost/benefit planning. In addition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because the ability of a single employee to master the disability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claim manager position is dependent on full adoption of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
simplified disability determination methodology, the impact from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that process redesign feature has also been separated out from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
our cost/benefit planning at this time.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Service to the public, as defined by average processing

time, would improve dramatically_from around 150 days to pay an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initial disability claim today to 60 days after implementation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the new process. Hearing processing time would also improve from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about 550 days to 225 days. These figures were derived from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
running a computer simulation model of the new process.

Under the supposition that SSA's current initial claim and

because SSA is not proposing any changes in the statutory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of disability, the redesigned process in and of itself 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would have no long-term effect on program outlays.

Administrative Costs and Savings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The project life period for implementing disability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reengineering is from October 1, 1994 to September 30, 2000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the full benefits from the redesigned process will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be realized until September 30, 2001. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cumulative administrative costs during the life of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
project are estimated at $148 million. The largest percentage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these costs will be directed to special workforce training on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new process_a critical enabler if the redesign plan is to work. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The redesign will not require additional investments in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information technology spending over current SSA plans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cumulative administrative savings through FY 2001 are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimated at $852 million. The bulk of these savings will come 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from more efficient use of Federal and State workyears to process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the anticipated disability initial claim and appeal workloads 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the project life period. This savings estimate does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factor in Agency resource needs for working existing backlogged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disability cases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subtracting cumulative administrative costs of $148 million 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from cumulative savings of $852 million will result in a pay back 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the government of $704 million through FY 2001. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ongoing administrative cost savings will be over $305 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
million annually, beginning in FY 2001. This figure includes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spending increases for enhanced employee education, better office 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
security, and expanded claimant services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The administrative cost savings associated with this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
project_$704 million during the implementation period, and $305 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
million annually, thereafter_will allow the Agency to reallocate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing resources to give more attention to other important 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
workloads. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SSA's workforce profile, with respect to disability process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
workloads, would include at least the same number of professional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
positions currently employed at the federal and state level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the overall design, if fully implemented with all the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process enablers_especially enhanced automation_would require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fewer clerical and support positions to handle projected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
workloads. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Conclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
SSA is committed to implementing a new disability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination process that will deliver significantly improved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service to the public, remain neutral with respect to program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dollar outlays, and will be more efficient to administer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrative cost savings from the process will allow the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency to reallocate resources to give increased attention to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other important workloads. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the redesigned process cannot be implemented 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without the full funding, development, and installation of a new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
case processing computer system. In addition, unless SSA invests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantially more funds for research and development of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
simplified disability determination methodology, the full 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefits of the redesigned process_including better public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service and the potential for even greater long-term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative efficiencies_will not be possible.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Overview
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The disability process redesign is a high-level process description that provides a broad vision of how a new process
would work but leaves operational, organizational, and other details for later development and implementation.
SSA must now begin to transition from the high-level analysis into this latter phase. As SSA implements the new process,
the five objectives of the redesign effort must continually be kept in the forefront of implementation planning,
execution and assessment: the process will be user-friendly for claimants and those who assist them; the right decision
will be made the first time; decisions will be made and effectuated quickly; the process will be efficient; and the
new process will provide employees with a satisfying work environment. The success of the new process must be measured
against these objectives and emphasis must continually be on overall measurement from the customer's perspective,
and not individual component results. Implementing a process of the magnitude of the new disability claim process
will require a strategy that is comprehensive, creative, and inclusive. The following provides a general framework
for how implementation activity will proceed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Implementation Framework
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Planning for the implementation of the new process vision requires a comprehensive approach that moves forward on
multiple fronts simultaneously. Although the new process will not be fully implemented until FY 2001, SSA must start
on October 1, 1994 (the beginning of FY 1995), to initiate activities, changes and improvements that will establish
the plan and pace for the long-term full implementation of the new process. The goal is to make near-term, visible improvements
while at the same time building for long-term results.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Multiple Track Approach
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Immediate or near-term implementation activities are those that can begin in FY 1995 and will be fully implemented
nationwide by the end of FY 1996, or for which the research and development or site testing can be initiated within the
next two fiscal years. These activities include streamlining and simplification initiatives or other procedural
elements of the new process that can be implemented using existing administrative or regulatory discretion. They
also include client-service activities associated with improving the claimant's access and entry into the disability
claim process; the development and site testing of options for streamlining parts of the administrative appeals
process; the provision of consistent training and direction to disability decisionmakers; and the establishment
of new measures and the testing of new quality assurance mechanisms. Additionally, because the decision methodology
associated with the new process depends on significant amounts of research, consultation, development and refinement,
SSA must identify the specific research needs, develop the appropriate scope of work and award research contracts
as near-term activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Long-range implementation items are those requiring extensive research and development that could not be tested
fully before FY 1999 or could not be fully implemented nationwide before FY 2001. These activities are those associated
with the full development, testing and refinement of a new decision methodology. They also include the implementation
of advanced technology enhancements that provide a single, fully-integrated disability claim processing system
which supports paperless claim processing and provides interactive capabilities for claimants and those who assist
them, and for providers of evidentiary information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The remaining mid-term items or activities are those elements of the new process that can be developed and tested in
FYs 1997 and 1998 and/or fully implemented nationwide by FY 1998. Mid-term activities would include such items as
the phased testing and implementation of new service options; full development, testing and implementation of a
streamlined appeals process; the testing of more advanced technology enhancements; and the activities associated
with developing the decision methodology based on the results of research efforts completed by the end of the near
term.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Flexibility and Testing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
SSA recognizes that full implementation of the new process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vision is an iterative process that requires development, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing, additional information gathering and possible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modification of process changes as they are implemented. Although 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SSA is committed to moving forward quickly to begin implementing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the new process, SSA has embraced an equally strong commitment to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rigorous testing and refinement of process changes before they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are fully or permanently implemented. Testing may include, but is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not limited to, geographic or time-limited site testing, using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``laboratory'' settings, or relying on specific case studies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Formalized testing is most appropriate for process changes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
depend on longer-term research and development, phased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation or major organizational change. In selecting sites 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for initial implementation activity, SSA will take advantage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the interest and capability of different offices, states, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regions to demonstrate the viability of immediate improvements or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identify early successes in improved service or efficiency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implementation sites will, of course, be provided with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary resources to support their efforts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even with extensive testing, the nature of public policy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formulation, as well as sound management principles, dictate that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SSA remain flexible in developing, refining and implementing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific elements of the new process vision. Ultimately, if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results of the iterative process necessitate modifications to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process vision, SSA is prepared to make those modifications. SSA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is committed to change, not for its own sake, but because it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to meet present and future challenges as it strives to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide high-quality, responsive, world-class service to its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
customers.

Employees Will Make Change Happen 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Overall leadership, control, and coordination of all implementation activities are vested in the Implementation
Manager, who will report to the Commissioner and Principal Deputy Commissioner. As part of these responsibilities,
the Implementation Manager, with the assistance of a support team, will establish implementation priorities, develop
specific timelines, and provide oversight to ensure that implementation decisions are consistent with the new process
visions and the five process objectives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the Implementation Manager will be the focal point for all implementation activities, it is the employees
and organizational components in the SSA and DDS communities who will make the new disability claim process a reality.
Front-line employees will be asked to directly participate in the development, testing and implementation of process
changes. They will also provide feedback on the effectiveness of the these changes. Task management teams will be
chartered to address specific implementation issues and their duration will depend on the nature of their issue.
For example, task teams that might be expected to require a longer-term existence are those dealing with decision
methodology or organizational readiness and change management. The task teams will bring together staff from the
affected SSA and DDS components to provide the necessary guidance for actual implementation action by organizational
components. Central office components, working with their Regional office counterparts, will be responsible for
ensuring that necessary implementation actions are effectuated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SSA will rely on an internal Advisory Group, comprised of SSA executives and union and association leaders to provide
advice and guidance on implementation activities and facilitate communication about implementation plans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Non-SSA Experts and Interested Parties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
SSA will use an inclusive process that seeks input from a variety of non-SSA communities including, but not limited
to, disability advocates, physicians, other health care and rehabilitation providers, and the private disability
and health insurers. The goal of this inclusive process is to foster creative relationships with non-SSA experts
so that SSA can have access to specialized expertise and advice as implementation activities progress. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Open Lines of Communication 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
SSA's unprecedented effort to establish new and beneficial communication channels during the various phases of
the disability claim process redesign lays the groundwork for continued communication during implementation.
The internal and external contacts and the avenues of communication established during the public dialogue period
will continue and will be an integral part of the implementation process. SSA will continue open lines of communication
about implementation of the new process with individuals and organizations who have a stake in the disability process,
including front-line employees, representatives from Federal and State employee unions and associations, other
Federal agencies, the Congress, the judiciary, and disability advocates. SSA will use all appropriate avenues of
communication, including written materials, telecommunications, and personal briefings, to ensure that necessary
information about implementation activities is regularly and widely disseminated and to develop appropriate feedback
channels. Additionally, SSA will explore new opportunities and means of communicating with both internal and external
audiences to permit meaningful exchanges of information.

Business Process Reengineering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Process Reengineering Program is the culmination of a rigorous SSA investigation of the reengineering efforts
and methodologies of those companies, public organizations, academic institutions, and consulting firms with
the most ``hands on'' experience in this field. The positive findings from this detailed review, combined with concerns
about existing business processes within SSA and the quality of SSA service to the public, led management to the conclusion
that a process reengineering effort was critical to the SSA objective of providing ``world-class'' administration
and service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based largely on analysis of what has worked best in the private and public sectors, a customized reengineering methodology
was developed within SSA. It uses a reengineering team approach that combines a strong ``customer'' focus with classic
management analysis techniques, and computer modeling and simulation, to intensely review a single business process.
The objective is not to make small, incremental improvements in the various pieces of the process, but to redesign
it as a whole, from start to finish, so that it becomes many times more efficient and, in so doing, significantly improves
SSA service to the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A senior SSA manager was selected to serve as Director of the Process Reengineering Program. The Director leads all
SSA process reengineering efforts, is the primary liaison with the Commissioner and Executive Staff, nominates
topics for examination, chairs project steering committees, and directs a small professional staff and revolving
group of managers/consultants.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
SSA uses special, multi-disciplinary teams of individuals to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conduct reengineering analyses and identify the best ways to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
redesign and significantly improve processes. Teams are comprised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of outstanding employees, all of whom are subject matter experts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in operational, programmatic, policy, systems, administrative, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and other areas relevant to the business process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reengineering teams focus on identifying those procedural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and policy changes to the process that will: make it more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claimant and service oriented; greatly increase productivity and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process speed; take advantage of opportunities offered by new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technology; and improve the empowerment and professional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrichment of the employees who are part of the process. Although 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
teams follow the same basic reengineering protocol, continual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
customization is both expected and encouraged.

development of the disability reengineering process change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal, and to ensure that support occurred at the highest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels of the Agency. The Executive Steering Committee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established the following parameters and expectations for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
project which are driven by targets set forth in the Agency

Parameters and Expectations for Reengineering the Disability Determination Process (9/15/93) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Definition of Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ``process'' to be reengineered is the initial and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative appeals system for determining an individual's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entitlement to Social Security and Supplemental Security Income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disability payments. It includes all actions from an individual's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initial contact with SSA through payment effectuation or final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative denial. The system for determining whether an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual continues to be entitled to receive disability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payments is not part of this ``process.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rationale: The process to be reengineered must be defined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
broadly to increase the opportunity for improvement. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuing disability review system is not included because it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conceptually and practically distinct from the initial disability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Parameters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Every aspect of the process except the statutory definition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of disability, individual benefit amounts, the use of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative law judge as the presiding officer for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative hearings, and vocational rehabilitation for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beneficiaries, is within the scope of this reengineering effort. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, analysis and ideas for change should proceed and be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presented on two tracks: improvements achievable without changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in statute or regulations and innovations that may require such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rationale: The timing of legislative or regulatory change is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beyond SSA's control. Such change could not reasonably be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected to be implemented in less than 2 years. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limiting the reengineering effort to aspects of the process not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requiring change in statute or regulations was rejected as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limiting too greatly the possibility of major 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improvement/innovation in the process. The two-track approach 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides for both shorter term incremental improvements and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
longer term, more radical change.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Unless otherwise specified here, the recommendations for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change should be consistent with the goals and objectives set 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forth in the Agency Strategic Plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Recommendations for change, taken as a whole, should not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cause changes in benefit outlays unless as a necessary result of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improvements in service, such as more timely processing and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment of claims. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Process changes should improve service and/or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
productivity, on a combined basis, by at least 25 percent by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
end of FY 1997 over levels projected in the FY 1994 budget (it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would require about an additional $500 million currently to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
realize such improvement) and decisional accuracy should not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decrease. By FY 2000 additional actions, including any necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statutory and regulatory changes, should provide a further 25 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent improvement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Executive Steering Committee facilitated ongoing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
communications between components and the Team, and communicated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the need and reason for reengineering the disability process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
They were familiar with the current process problems and were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
kept apprised of research completed by the Team. In February, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Executive Steering Committee was expanded to include the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Presidents of the American Federation of Government Employees, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the National Federation of Federal Employees, and the National 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Treasury Employees Union locals, councils and chapters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representing SSA employees; and the Presidents of the SSA and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State Disability Determination Services (DDS) professional and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management associations recognized by SSA as having an interest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in disability issues. A list of Executive Steering Committee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
members appears at the end of this appendix. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 18 members of the Disability Reengineering Team, all of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whom are SSA or State DDS employees, have varied and extensive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
backgrounds in all aspects of the disability program. A list of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Team members appears at the end of this chapter. Team members 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attended a high quality, intensive 3-day SSA reengineering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methodology training session, and completed extensive reading 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assignments on reengineering. Some Team members visited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organizations who had reengineered their business processes to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
learn about successes as well as opportunities for improvement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Team used the following methods to obtain the information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to develop a redesigned disability process.

Briefings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Members of the Team received extensive briefings from staff 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in all SSA components that work with any aspect of the disability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process including experts in SSA policy, quality assurance, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management information, operational, and appellate processes. Dr. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Frank S. Bloch, Professor of Law and Director of the Clinical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Education Center at Vanderbilt, briefed the Team on the results 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of his study comparing disability programs and processes of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
United States, Canada, and Western Europe. His work encompasses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility requirements and program goals, benefit award 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
structure and short-term benefits, administrative organization, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and procedures for claim processing and appeals.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Team's conducted extensive fact-finding visits and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interviews with members of the disability community. Team members 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
visited 421 locations in 33 States and conducted over 3,600 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interviews. Almost 2,900 of these involved front-line employees, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
managers and executives. The Team conducted an additional 111 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interviews by telephone. The Team also interviewed over 750 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parties external to SSA for their views. They also publicized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surface/electronic mail addresses and fax and voice telephone 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
numbers for those who were not contacted or had additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information to provide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Individuals and groups both internal and external to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process were interviewed for ideas about a new process. The Team 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solicited a wide spectrum of opinions about problems with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current disability process and directions for redesign. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition to individuals in the SSA and DDS communities, the team 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
talked to a wide variety of externals including physicians, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health maintenance organizations and hospital officials, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disability advocates, attorneys, professional association groups, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal judges, other Federal agencies, and Congressional staffs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to site visits and contacts, Team members provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals and organizations with general information about the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reengineering effort, key research areas, and some unconventional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ideas about the disability process so that the interviewees would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have an opportunity to think about process issues. The Team 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
encouraged interviewees to provide open and honest opinions, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggestions, and ideas. The interviews provided useful insights 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into the problems confronting the disability program and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommendations for solving these problems.

Focus Groups 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A series of 12 focus groups were held throughout the country 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to obtain input from members of our claimant population and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general public regarding their experiences with and expectations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the SSA disability process. The focus groups provided the Team 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
valuable information about claimants' expectations and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preferences, as well as concerns about the current process. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following is a list of the focus group sites and composition.

Benchmarking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
``Internal benchmarking'' refers to the identification and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
understanding of site-specific best practices that currently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exist within the Agency and is focused on the improvement and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standardization of internal operations. The Team completed this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
phase of benchmarking by reviewing lists of sites engaging in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``best practices'' which were submitted by various SSA components, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and visiting or telephoning as many of these SSA and DDS offices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``External benchmarking'' is essentially the same, except the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
search for best practices and proven process innovations is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expanded to comparable companies and organizations outside of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SSA. It is focused outside the organization and is concerned with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the relative performance of one specific function or process. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
table below identifies the companies/organizations the Team used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as benchmarking partners.

Process Analysis

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Team utilized a document prepared by the SSA Office of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Workforce Analysis in April 1993 which outlines the ``as-is'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disability claim and appeal processes of SSA. The document 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contains a description of claim processing tasks performed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
line-employees in the seven operational components that deal with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the disability claim process. Team members also collected, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reviewed, and researched an extensive amount of existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedural guides, laws/regulations, studies conducted by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
internal and external components, processing time and quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management information, workflows, cost data, etc.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Computer models are close representations of work processes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that, if properly constructed, allow for better understanding, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing or forecasting, and study. Team members worked with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modeling professionals in SSA to build the models used to predict 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the operation of a redesigned process. A model was built to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
represent both the current and proposed processes. The model 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
helped the Team assess the best features and performance of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new disability process; to better judge the magnitude of change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from one process to another; and to do some ``what-if-nothing-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes'' analysis to get a feel for the impact of inactivity. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
summary of the model assumption and results appears in Appendix II.

Release of Initial Team Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The product of the Team's effort was a redesign proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that was presented to the Commissioner and Executive Steering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Committee on March 31, 1994. The proposal provided the Team's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
view of the best process improvement and process innovation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ideas. The proposal is a high-level concept that provides a broad 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
understanding of how a redesigned process would work but leaves 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operational, organizational, and other details for later 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Team distributed the proposal as widely as possible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
throughout SSA, the State DDSs, and to interested public and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
private individuals and organizations with the goal of seeking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactions, items of concern and additional ideas for improvement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copies of a shorter 25-page version of the Proposal were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distributed to all SSA and DDS employees in early April 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copies of the complete 132-page Proposal and Background Report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were also distributed to each SSA DDS facility in sufficient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
numbers to make it easily available to staff. A 30-minute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
videotape containing remarks by Commissioner Chater and a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presentation of the proposal by members of the Reengineering Team 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was distributed for use in all SSA and DDS facilities. Group 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
feedback discussions with SSA and DDS employees were held in all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ten regions and in SSA headquarters components. A survey was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distributed to each SSA and DDS employee to assist employees in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providing comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Proposal and Background Report was published in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on April 15, 1994 (59 FR 18188). A 60-day 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment period was established to invite public comment on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal. A public hearing on the proposal was held in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Washington, DC on May 16, 1994. Team members conducted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extensive briefings on the proposal with interested parties, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including employee unions, professional association groups, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disability advocates, the legal community, other Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies, and Congressional staffs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the comment period that ended on June 14, 1994, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Team received over 6,000 written responses from all interested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parties. The Team reviewed and analyzed each comment received. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
summary of the comments is included in Appendix III. In response 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to reactions received during the comment period, the Team made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes to the original proposal and submitted a revised proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the Commissioner and the Executive Steering Committee on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
June 30, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After extensive consultation with the members of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Executive Steering Committee, SSA senior staff, representatives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from employee unions and associations, disability advocates and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
others, the Commissioner accepted the Team's recommendations for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a redesigned disability process.

The Team worked with modeling professionals in the SSA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Office of Workforce Analysis (OWA) to build computer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representations of both the current and the redesigned disability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processes. The computer model was built using FORTRAN programming 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
language. Data based on assumptions, task times and lapse times 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were input into the model. In making assumptions, the team relied 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on historical data to the extent that such information was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available. The Team also relied on an April 1993 OWA study that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outlines the current disability claim process, including all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative appeals, and describes the tasks performed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
line-employees in the seven operational components that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involved with the disability claim process.

Using a computer model allowed the Team to assess the impact of changing from one process to another. Although the model
did not generate an actual visual simulation of either the current or the redesigned process, the model did generate
comparative data about the relative impact of specific features and expected performance. The sections that follow
provide key comparative information regarding overall processing times and employee work investment based on the
model results.

Overall Processing Times
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the redesigned process, the time from a claimant's first contact with SSA until issuance of a final initial decision
will be reduced from an average of 155 days (as cited in the OWA study) to less than 40 days. Available employees will
be able to process a greater number of claims and devote more time to each claimant, thus providing more personalized
service. The time from a claimant's first contact with SSA until issuance of a hearing decision will be reduced from
an average of a year and a half (as cited in the OWA study) to approximately 5 months.

Listed below are key assumptions, task times and lapse times

that the Team used to model the redesigned process. The task 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
times are shown in minutes and represent the estimated time it

will take an employee to complete the described task. For each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
task time entry, three task time numbers are shown. The middle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number represents the most common task time, while the first and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
last number represent the low and high extremes for that task. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The lapse times are shown in work days, rather than calendar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
days, and represent the number of days between actions or tasks.

Appendix III: Summary of Comments on Reengineering Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Overview 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the comment period that began on April 1, 1994 and ended on June 14, 1994, the Team received over 6,000 written
responses from SSA and DDS employees, employee unions, professional associations, members of the public, claimant
representatives, physicians, State governors, claimant advocate groups, Federal components, and other interested
parties. Fifty-three percent of the written responses came from SSA employees, 21% came from DDS employees, and 26%
came from individuals and organizations external to the SSA/DDS community. Members of the Team read, analyzed, and
collated every one of those 6,210 comments so that no idea, reaction, or nuance would be overlooked. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the commenters who presented written reactions to the overall proposal, 52% were favorable to the overall concept,
39% were unfavorable, and 9% were neutral. Approximately 10% of these commenters believed no reengineering was needed.
Beyond the request for written comments, additional means of gauging reaction to the proposal were also employed:
group employee feedback discussions were held in over 80 sites across the country with almost 2,000 SSA and DDS employees
participating; a public meeting was held in Washington, D.C.; and Team members conducted briefings and spoke with
more than 3,000 individuals and organizations about the proposal during the comment period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There was a very mixed reaction to the proposal. Very few verbal or written responses were totally favorable or unfavorable
toward the proposal_those liking it had concerns about some elements while those generally disliking it found portions
which they believed would be improvements over the current process. Many commenters, regardless of expressing praise
or concern, addressed very limited aspects of the proposal without providing a reaction to the overall proposal.

_SSA received widespread praise for taking on the task of redesigning the disability claim process. The prevalent
belief was that dramatic improvements are needed to provide better service and handle workloads more effectively.
Whether fully supporting the proposal or not, most commenters expressed concern that the system is broken and that
only radical redesign will solve the problems that currently exist.

_Many of the responses centered around how the proposal would be implemented and what organizational changes would
be needed to make the new process work. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_There were concerns about whether the proposal would meet the objective of not increasing or decreasing program
costs with fairly divided opinions about whether the new disability methodology would allow or deny more claims than
the current methodology. Reliance on treating sources as preferred sources of medical evidence and personal bias
resulting from disability claim manager face-to-face meetings with claimants were often cited as the reason for
the belief that there will be an overall increase in allowed claims. The new four-step evaluation process was cited
as the most common reason for the belief that there will be an overall increase in denied claims.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Gen Real Estate and Management Company (Applicant), is seeking an incidental take permit from the Fish and Wildlife
Service (Service), pursuant to Section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, (Act) as amended. The permit
would authorize the take of the Florida scrub jay, Aphelocoma coerulescens coerulescens, a threatened species,
in Brevard County, Florida, for a period of 5 years. The proposed taking is incidental to construction of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
60 single family homes including the necessary infrastructure on approximately 15.1 acres (Project), all of which
contains occupied Florida scrub jay habitat to be permanently altered. The Project is called Bal Harbour, and is located
along State Road A1A south of the city of Melbourne, in the Coconut Point area of Brevard County, Florida. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service also announces the availability of an environmental assessment (EA) and habitat conservation plan (HCP)
for the incidental take application. Copies of the EA or HCP may be obtained by making a request to the Regional Office
address below. This notice also advises the public that the Service has made a preliminary determination that issuing
the incidental take permit is not a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment
within the meaning of Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended. The Finding
of No Significant Impact is based on information contained in the EA and HCP. The final determination will be made no
sooner than 30 days from the date of this notice. This notice is provided pursuant to Section 10(c) of the Act and National
Environmental Policy Act Regulations (40 CFR 1506.6).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
 Aphelocoma coerulescens coerulescens 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
is geographically isolated from other subspecies of scrub jays found in Mexico and the Western United States. The
scrub jay is found almost exclusively in peninsular Florida and is restricted to scrub habitat. The total estimated
population is between 7,000 and 11,000 individuals. Due to habitat loss and degradation throughout the State of Florida,
it has been estimated that the scrub jay population has been reduced by at least half in the last 100 years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The scrub jay survey provided by the Applicant indicates that two families currently use the suitable habitats within
the Project. The Applicant proposes to impact the territories of both families. Initial construction of roads and
utilities and subsequent development of individual homesites may therefore result in death of, or injury to, scrub
jays incidental to the carrying out of these otherwise lawful activities. Habitat alteration associated with property
development may reduce the availability of feeding, shelter, and nesting habitat. To minimize the mitigate the impacts
of the loss of 15.1 acres of scrub jay habitat, the Applicant will purchase 30.63 acres of scrub habitat known to support
the scrub jay, deed the property to Brevard County, and provide a management endowment of $30,630 to ensure management
of the site in perpetuity. Other measures proposed by the Applicant include control of invasive plant species from
the Project, and protection of active nests, if discovered, during the nesting season. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EA considers the environmental consequences of three alternatives, including acceptance of the HCP as submitted,
consideration of management of surrounding publicly-owned lands as mitigation in lieu of offsite purchase, and
no action.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In compliance with the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, section 102(2)(c) of the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969, and The United States Department of the Interior Secretarial Order No. 3087, Section 5, Amendment
No. 1, The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has prepared an Environmental Impact Statement for the Cyprus Tohono Corporation's
proposed mine expansion on the Tohono O'odham Nation, Papago Indian Reservation. The proposed action (Alternate
A) consists of the conversion from in situ to open pit mining operations at Cyprus, the creation of a new overburden
storage site, and a new copper oxide ore heap leach pad. Cyprus proposes production of approximately one billion pounds
of copper during the thirteen year life of the proposal. A description of existing facilities and a detailed proposed
plan of operations is presented in the Mine Plan of Operations for Expanded Open Pit and Heap Leach Operations (Cyprus
Casa Grande Corporation 1993). The project was developed in response to three underlying needs: mining lease compliance,
continued industrial economic support for the Nation, and copper production.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Implementation of Alternative A would result in the disturbance of a total of approximately 1,660 acres, or approximately
0.06 percent of total Nation lands. Alternative A involves the development, operation, performance and maintenance
of the following major project components: open pit mine expansion, overburden disposal area, heap leach pads and
ponds, stormwater collection and recycling, processing facilities, access and service roads, support facilities,
utilities, spill prevention, health and safety plans, and reclamation and closure. There would be increases in royalties
and employment. Scholarships would be established. Each of the major project components re described in the main
body of the Draft EIS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternative B was developed to minimize potential impacts to biological and visual resources. Alternative B includes
the same basic project components as Alternative A, however, some of the components would be moved south of an existing
access road. Movement of the proposed project elements south of the existing mine access road serves to limit disturbance
of natural drainages, reduce potential disturbance to bat colonies north of the site, and to provide a visual screen
of existing mine plant site structures. Alternative B would disturb a total of approximately 1,850 acres.

BACKGROUND:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Authorized in October, 1988, the National Park of American Samoa is to be established when the Governor, acting on
behalf of the village landowners, and the National Park Service have entered into a lease agreement. With the signing
of the lease in September, 1993, the National Park Service is authorized to begin management and operation of the park.
The general management plan will provide long-term guidance for preserving and protecting park resources, maintaining
traditional Samoan customs and uses, providing access, developing appropriate visitor facilities, and dealing
with other important issues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Notice is hereby given in accordance with provisions of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act,
25 U.S.C. 3003(d), of the completion of an inventory of human remains and associated funerary objects in the possession
of the South Dakota State Archaeological Research Center, Rapid City South Dakota.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The detailed inventory and assessment of the human remains and associated funerary objects has been made by the State
Archaeological Research Center (SARC) curatorial staff, contracted specialists in physical anthropology and
archaeology, and representatives of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, Lower Brule Sioux Tribe, Crow Creek Sioux Tribe,
and Standing Rock Sioux Tribe.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The remains of an adult and a child were recovered in 1953 from the Cottonwood Site (39HU43), in Hughes County, South
Dakota. Excavation data suggests the site was occupied by Dakota Sioux between A.D. 1867&hyph;1900. The Cottonwood
Site is located adjacent to the Lower Brule Sioux Reservation. Based on the above mentioned information, officials
of the SARC have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity which
can be reasonably traced between these human remains and the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The remains of two individuals were recovered in 1961 from Sitting Crow Mounds (39BF225), a Woodland and Historic
site in Buffalo County, South Dakota. Objects associated with the adult female and child_including rings, fragments
of fabric and metal, shoes, buttons, a toy revolver, and the remnants of coffins_help date the two burials to the Historic
Period (post 1750). Craniometric measurements are consistent with those of Sioux populations. Sitting Crow Mounds
are located adjacent to the Crow Creek (Sioux) Reservation. Based on the above mentioned information, officials
of the SARC have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity which
can be reasonably traced between these human remains and the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The remains of two individuals were recovered between 1966&hyph;1968 at Fort Manuel (39CO5), in Corson County, South
Dakota. The site is multicomponent, representing Extended Coalescent, historic trading post, and historic Sioux
occupations. The remains of an adult male appear to have been buried in a pit in the cellar following the 1813 abandonment
of the fort. The weathered condition of these remains is indicative of a scaffold burial with secondary interment,
a practice common among the Sioux. Osteological information indicates the child is associated with the Extended
Coalescent component of the site. However, wood fragments associated with these remains may represent remnants
of a historic period coffin. Fort Manuel is located adjacent to the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. Based on the above
mentioned information, officials of the SARC have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship
of shared group identity which can be reasonably traced between these human remains and the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The remains of one individual were recovered in 1979 from the Three Horse Site (39DW35) in Dewey County, South Dakota.
The site is multicomponent, representing Archaic and historic period occupations. The remains of the adult male
were recovered from a disturbed area along a cutbank. Evaluation of the cranial morphology by K. Richard McWilliams
suggests an Archaic or earlier temporal association for the human remains. Physical anthropologists from the University
of Tennessee suggest the human remains are from a Sioux population. The Three Horse Site is located within the exterior
boundary of the Cheyenne River (Sioux) Reservation. Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the SARC
have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity which can be
reasonably traced between these human remains and the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 20, 1994, the above mentioned human remains and associated funerary objects were repatriated to Mr. Sebastian
LeBeau on behalf of the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe, Crow Creek Sioux Tribe, Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, and Cheyenne River
Sioux Tribe. Questions or concerns related to the repatriation of the human remains and associated funerary objects
listed in this notice can be directed to Sebastian (Bronco) LeBeau, Cultural Preservation Officer, Cheyenne River
Sioux Tribe, P.O. Box 590, Eagle Butte, South Dakota 57625, (605) 964&hyph;4155; Michael Jandreau, Chairman, Lower
Brule Sioux Tribe, P.O. Box 187, Lower Brule, South Dakota 57548, (605)473&hyph;5561; Duane Big Eagle, Chairman,
Crow Creek Sioux Tribe, P.O. Box 658 Fort Thompson, South Dakota 57339, (605) 245&hyph;2221; or Charles W. Murphy,

Under 49 CFR 1152.50(d)(2), the railroad must file a verified notice with the Commission at least 50 days before the
abandonment or discontinuance is to be consummated. The applicant, in its verified notice, indicated a proposed
consummation date of October 18, 1994. Because the verified notice was not filed until August 30, 1994, consummation
should not have been proposed to take place prior to October 19, 1994. Applicant's representative has confirmed that
the correct consummation date is on or after October 19, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Near its northern end, CTER's Oasis Line connects with the Indiana &amp; Ohio Railway Company (IORY), a wholly owned
subsidiary of IORC, and, at its northern end, with Conrail. From its northern end, the line runs in a loop south and west
through Cincinnati, OH, where it connects with a line of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Company (N&amp;W). CTER
entered into a track lease agreement with N&amp;W.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
As a result, CTER connects with another carrier, the Central Railroad Company of Indiana (CIND). The Indiana and Ohio
Railroad Company (INOH), also controlled by IORC, has trackage rights over CIND.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Control of CTER by IORC will permit the coordination of the operations and services of INOH, IORY, and CTER. The combined
INOH-CTER-IORY operation will provide a through connection to Conrail that will eliminate the need to rely on an intermediate
switch.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document contains exemptions issued by the Department of Labor (the Department) from certain of the prohibited
transaction restrictions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (the Act) and/or the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986 (the Code). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of the pendency before the Department of proposals to grant such exemptions. The notices set forth a summary of facts
and representations contained in each application for exemption and referred interested persons to the respective
applications for a complete statement of the facts and representations. The applications have been available for
public inspection at the Department in Washington, D.C. The notices also invited interested persons to submit comments
on the requested exemptions to the Department. In addition the notices stated that any interested person might submit
a written request that a public hearing be held (where appropriate). The applicants have represented that they have
complied with the requirements of the notification to interested persons. No public comments and no requests for
a hearing, unless otherwise stated, were received by the Department. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The notices of proposed exemption were issued and the exemptions are being granted solely by the Department because,
effective December 31, 1978, section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1978 (43 FR 47713, October 17, 1978) transferred
the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to issue exemptions of the type proposed to the Secretary of Labor.

In the Notice of Proposed Exemption, the Department invited all interested persons to submit written comments and
requests for a hearing on the exemption. All comments and requests for hearing were due by September 10, 1994. The Department
received two written comments and there were no requests for a hearing. Both commentators were in favor of the exemption
and urged the Department to allow the Employer to make the Advances so that participants could receive distribution
of their Plan benefits.

General Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The attention of interested persons is directed to the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest or disqualified person from certain other provisions
to which the exemptions does not apply and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act,
which among other things require a fiduciary to discharge his duties respecting the plan solely in the interest of
the participants and beneficiaries of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(B) of
the Act; nor does it affect the requirement of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan must operate for the exclusive
benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining the plan and their beneficiaries; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) These exemptions are supplemental to and not in derogation of, any other provisions of the Act and/or the Code,
including statutory or administrative exemptions and transactional rules. Furthermore, the fact that a transaction
is subject to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the transaction is in fact a prohibited
transaction; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The availability of these exemptions is subject to the express condition that the material facts and representations
contained in each application are true and complete and accurately describe all material terms of the transaction
which is the subject of the exemption. In the case of continuing exemption transactions, if any of the material facts
or representations described in the application change after the exemption is granted, the exemption will cease
to apply as of the date of such change. In the event of any such change, application for a new exemption may be made to the
Department.

The Department is considering granting an exemption under the authority of section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code and in accordance with the procedures set forth in 29 CFR part 2570, subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August
10, 1990). If the exemption is granted, the restrictions of sections 406(a) of the Act and the sanctions resulting
from the application of section 4975 of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1)(A) through (D) of the Code shall not
apply to the proposed guarantee by the Bank to an employee benefit plan that retains the Manager as investment manager
for such plan (the Plan) of the value of the Plan's principal investment with the Manager, provided that each of the
following conditions is satisfied: (1) the fiduciaries of the Plan who are responsible for the selection and retention
of the Manager as investment manager for the Plan, and for the selection of the guarantee from the Bank, are independent
of the Manager, the Bank, and their affiliates; (2) no separate fee or remuneration is payable by the Plan or any other
person to the Manager, the Bank, or any of their affiliates for the guarantee; (3) the Plan is entitled to cancel the
investment management agreement with the Manager, and/or the guarantee provided by the Bank, at any time upon reasonable
notice; (4) the Agreement between each Plan and the Manager and the Bank will be amended to provide that, for purposes
of enforcing the Bank's guarantee, the determination of the value of a Plan's assets under the Manager's investment
management at any relevant time shall be made pursuant to objective standards determined jointly by the Manager and
the Plan's custodian, which is the bank or other entity holding the assets of the Plan or other Plan fiduciary responsible
for causing the Plan to enter into the Agreement; (5) however, if the Manager and the Plan's custodian are unable to
agree as to the value of the Plan's account, they will jointly select a qualified appraiser to make this determination;
if they are unable to agree on an appraiser, the Manager and the Plan's custodian will each select a qualified appraiser
and the value will be determined by mutual agreement of such appraisers or, if they cannot agree, by a third qualified
appraiser designated by the two appraisers, and all such appraisers will be independent of the Manager; and (6) the
investment management agreement between each Plan and the Manager and the Bank will provide (a) that income from any
lending from a Plan's account will be credited to the Plan's account and not to the Manager's account, and (b) that no
lending of this type will occur under circumstances where the borrower is a party in interest or disqualified person
with respect to the Plan unless the conditions of Prohibited Transaction Exemptions 81-6 (52 FR 18754, May 19, 1987)
and 82-63 (47 FR 14084, April 6, 1982, as corrected by 47 FR 16437, April 16, 1982)] are satisfied.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of this proposed exemption, the term ``affiliate'' of another person means any person directly or indirectly,
through one or more intermediaries, controlling, controlled by, or under common control with such person, provided
that the Manager shall not be deemed an affiliate of another person solely because the Manager has investment management
authority or discretion over the assets of the other person. For purposes of the foregoing, the term ``control'' means
the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a person other than an individual.
Further, for purposes of this proposed exemption, a Plan fiduciary shall be deemed ``independent'' of a person only
if: (1) the fiduciary is not an affiliate, as defined above, of such person; and (2) the fiduciary has no other relationship
to or interest in such persons that might affect the exercise of such fiduciary's best judgment as a fiduciary.

1. The Bank is a bank organized under the laws of the Republic of France and is a subsidiary of Compagnie Financiere de
Paribas, represented to be one of the world's leading banking and financial groups. The Bank, through its subsidiaries,
branches and offices, operates in over 60 countries, including the United States, spanning the whole range of banking
activities. The Bank's operations are structured in four principal groups: corporate banking, capital markets,
corporate advisory services, and investment management. As of December 31, 1990, the Bank's consolidated assets
totalled approximately FF 568 billion (US $111 billion), with consumer loans totalling approximately FF 176 billion
(US $34 billion) and customer deposits totalling approximately FF 228 billion (US $44 billion).

2. The Manager, a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary
of the Bank, is responsible for defining the Bank's overall investment objectives and managing its pooled investment
products (including specialized country or regional funds, diversified growth and income funds, and fixed income
funds). Worldwide, the Manager and the Bank's institutional management team had total assets under management of
almost FF 55 billion (US $11 billion) at the 1990 year end. The Manager is a registered investment adviser under the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the Advisers Act) and, according to the Applicants, qualifies as an investment manager
under section 3(38) of the Act.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Manager's principal business activity in the United States is the provision of investment management services
for various clients, including the trustees or other fiduciaries of plans governed by the Act. The Manager currently
serves in such capacity with respect to five U.S.-based clients, including three Plans, involving approximately
US $190 million in assets under management (including approximately US $85 million of Plan assets). The investment
media in which the Manager will invest a Plan's assets is generally subject to specific investment guidelines and
restrictions prescribed by the Plan fiduciaries, but may include fixed income instruments (such as bonds, mortgage-backed
securities, Treasury bills, and commercial paper), options on fixed income securities, forward rate agreements,
floating rate notes, and currency hedging instruments. According to the applicant fixed income related instruments
are intended to be used as a hedge or as an alternative to bonds.

3. The Manager and the Bank have entered into investment management agreements with certain non-Plan clients which
provide that the Bank will guarantee the value of the client's initial principal investment, if the client does not
cancel the agreement before the first anniversary of its effective date and not over 50 percent of such investment
has been withdrawn by that date. Mechanically, the Bank would contribute its own funds to the client's account with
the Manager, for distribution to the client, in the event the client elected to cancel the agreement or to withdraw
funds from the account at a time when the value of such account was less than the amount of the client's principal investment
therein. Such agreements terminate after one year, subject to renewal by written agreement of the parties thereto.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The Manager and the Bank would like to offer a similar guarantee to the Manager's Plan clients. The parties to the
investment management agreement (the Agreement) would be the Bank, the Manager, and the Plan client. Section 6.1
of the prototype Agreement provides that the Bank unconditionally guarantees the return to the client at the termination
of the Agreement of an amount equal to the amount invested by the client (the Qualifying Deposit) under the Agreement
(either initially or after the date of any renewal of the Agreement). Qualifying Deposit means any amount invested
by the client not more than half of which is withdrawn before the first anniversary of the date of the Agreement (or,
in the case of a renewal of the Agreement, not more than half of which is withdrawn before the first anniversary of the
date of such renewal). However, pursuant to section 6.2 of the Agreement, the above mentioned guarantee (the Guarantee)
does not apply if the client terminates the Agreement before such first anniversary. The Guarantee does apply, however,
to any principal withdrawn by the client if (and after): (i) the credit rating assigned to the Bank's unsecured unsubordinated
debt securities by either Standard and Poor's Corporation or Moody's Investors Service, Inc. is reduced below AA-
or Aa3, respectively; or (ii) the Manager or the Bank notifies the client that the Agreement will terminate prior to
its agreed upon term. There is no time period limiting the application of the Guarantee with respect to the circumstances
described in (i) and (ii), above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The applicant states that if a client were to deposit additional amounts under the Agreement after the date of the initial
Qualifying Deposit but before the first anniversary of the date of the Agreement (or before the first anniversary
of any renewal of the Agreement), such additional deposits would also be guaranteed by the Bank, but such additional
deposits would be subject to the same one-year holding period requirement (measured from the date of such additional
deposit) for the Guarantee to apply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 6.1 of the Agreement further provides that if, at the termination of the Agreement, the client has not received
an amount equal to its Qualifying Deposit, the Bank shall, upon written demand by the client, pay to the client the entire
unpaid principal balance of such Qualifying Deposit. This section permits the client to withdraw up to half of the
Qualifying Deposit at any time subject to two weeks advance written notice. However, if at the time of such partial
withdrawal the net asset value of the portfolio is lower than the Qualifying Deposit, section 6.1 of the Agreement
provides that the Guarantee shall be reduced by a proportion equal to the amount of such withdrawal divided by the net
asset value of the portfolio at that time. If at the time of the withdrawal the net asset value of the portfolio is higher
than the Qualifying Deposit, the Guarantee shall be reduced by a proportion equal to the amount of such withdrawal
divided by the Qualifying Deposit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The applicant has provided three examples illustrating how the Guarantee operates in the case of partial withdrawals
when the net asset value of the portfolio has (1) decreased, (2) not changed, and (3) increased. All three examples
assume a Qualifying Deposit of $20 million and a withdrawal of $10 million after the one-year period mentioned above.
In the first example, the net asset value of the Qualifying Deposit had fallen to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$15 million at the withdrawal date, leaving only $5 million (in net asset value) after the withdrawal. In this example,
the Guarantee would be reduced by 67% (i.e., $10 million withdrawn divided by $15 million pre-withdrawal net asset
value at time of withdrawal). Therefore, although $5 million would be the total net asset value remaining in the client's
account under the Agreement after the $10 million withdrawal, the Guarantee would apply to $6,666,667 of the Qualifying
Deposit (i.e., 33% of the $20 million Qualifying Deposit).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the second example, the net asset value of the Qualifying Deposit remained at $20 million at the withdrawal date,
leaving $10 million (in net asset value) after the withdrawal. In this example, the Guarantee would be reduced by 50%
(i.e., $10 million withdrawn divided by $20 million pre-withdrawal net asset value at time of withdrawal). Therefore,
$10 million would be the total net asset value remaining in the client's account under the Agreement after the $10 million
withdrawal, and the Guarantee would apply to $10 million of the Qualifying Deposit (i.e., 50% of the $20 million Qualifying
Deposit).

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the third example, the net asset value of the Qualifying Deposit had risen to $25 million at the withdrawal date,
leaving $15 million (in net asset value) after the withdrawal. In this example, the Guarantee would be reduced by 50%
(i.e., $10 million withdrawn divided by the $20 million Qualifying Deposit). Thus, although $15 million would be
the total net asset value remaining in the client's account under the Agreement after the $10 million withdrawal,
the Guarantee would apply to $10 million of the Qualifying Deposit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Income on the account would not be currently distributed to the client. Rather, income would be held in the account
until termination of the Agreement and may become part of a new Qualifying Deposit upon renewal of the Agreement. As
discussed above, it is anticipated most Agreements would have a renewable term of one year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The applicant states that the investment management fee negotiated by the Manager with each of its clients does
not change by reason of the Bank's Guarantee. The applicant represents that the Manager offers the client two management
fees: a combined arrangement or a base fee only. The combined arrangement includes (a) a fixed fee of 0.30% per annum
of the net asset value of the client's portfolio, payable quarterly in arrears based on the net asset value of the client's
portfolio as of the end of the quarter (adjusted for additional withdrawals) and (b) a performance schedule fee equal
to 25% of an amount equal to the aggregate net realized and unrealized appreciation in the value of the assets in the
client's portfolio (including net investment income) in excess of a benchmark (the Benchmark) equal to the U.S. 3-month
Treasury bill rate plus 100 basis points.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The applicant represents that the performance schedule fee component of the combined arrangement will be substantially
the same in all material respects as the performance fee arrangement described in advisory opinion letter 86-21A
issued by the Department on August 29, 1986. That letter concerns the payment of incentive compensation to Batterymarch
Financial Management by employee benefit plans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department expressed its view that, based on the representations contained in the Batterymarch submissions,
the payment of an incentive fee to Batterymarch pursuant to the arrangement described therein would not, in itself,
constitute violations of sections 406(b)(1) or 406(b)(2) of the Act. The Department noted, however, that, because
violations of sections 406(b)(1) and 406(b)(2) could occur in the course of the provision of services by Batterymarch,
the Department was not prepared to rule that the described arrangement, in operation, would not violate those sections.
In any event, the relief provided by this exemption does not extend to the receipt of fees by the Manager pursuant to
the above performance schedule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The performance schedule fee is assessed and billed on the one-year anniversary of the date of the Agreement and at
the end of each calendar quarter thereafter during the term of the Agreement, which may be renewed by written agreement
of the parties. Each assessment of the performance fee is based on the performance of the client's portfolio over the
12 months ending on the last day of the period for which the fee is being paid. If the Agreement terminates at a time other
than at the end of a calendar quarter, the performance fee for such quarter is payable upon termination, based on the
performance of the client's portfolio over the 12 months ending on the termination date.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Benchmark is calculated using the average of the U.S. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3-month Treasury bill rate on the first and last day of each quarter within the 12-month period in question. In calculating
the performance fee, the basis for determining the amount of appreciation is the starting value of the assets in the
client's portfolio at the beginning of the 12-month period. Every time a performance fee is paid out, the basis for
assessing the performance is adjusted to reflect the net asset value after such fee payment. According to section
4.4 of the Agreement, any underperformance in a given quarter must be made up before any new performance fees are payable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4.4 of the Agreements currently in effect with non-Plan clients states that the valuation of the performance
of the account will be provided by the Manager; however, the applicant represents that this section will be amended
to provide that the valuation of the performance of the account will be jointly determined by the Manager and the Plan's
custodian, which is the bank or other entity holding the assets of the Plan or other Plan fiduciary responsible for
causing the Plan to enter into the Agreement. The applicant further represents that, if the Manager and the Plan's
custodian are unable to agree as to the value of the Plan's account, they will jointly select a qualified appraiser
to make this determination. If they are unable to agree on an appraiser, the Manager and the Plan's custodian will each
select a qualified appraiser and the value will be determined by mutual agreement of such appraisers or, if they cannot
agree, by a third qualified appraiser designated by the two appraisers. All such appraisers will be independent of
the Manager.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the alternative arrangement, the client pays only a fixed fee equal to 0.40% per annum of the net asset value of
the portfolio, payable quarterly in arrears based on the net asset value of the portfolio as of the end of the quarter,
adjusted for additional withdrawals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The applicant represents that the fees are disclosed in information materials furnished to the client, including
the presentation flip book and the distributors' product overview letter. The applicant represents that the Manager's
fees under the Agreement are competitive with the fees charged by competitors offering no guarantee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. As stated, the Manager and the Bank would like to offer the same Guarantee to the Manager's Plan clients which are
not investing in pooled funds. The Plan fiduciaries would not be required to select the Guarantee, or if selected such
fiduciaries would still retain the right to cancel the investment management agreement or the Guarantee feature
at any time upon reasonable prior notice. A Plan will be permitted to cancel the investment management agreement with
the Manager on 30 days' prior notice. In addition, a Plan will be permitted to cancel the Guarantee immediately upon
notice of cancellation being given; that is, no period of advance notice will be required for cancellation of the Guarantee.
No separate fee or remuneration would be paid by the Plan or any other person to the Manager, the Bank, or any of their
affiliates for the Guarantee. The same negotiated investment management fees would be charged by the Manager whether
or not the Plan fiduciaries accept the Bank's Guarantee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of determining when the Guarantee would be enforced, and in what amount, records will be kept by both the
Manager and the Plan's custodian. The applicant represents that the Plan's custodian has no relationship to the Bank,
the Manager, and its affiliates. The records of these two parties will be reconciled monthly. The applicant represents
that in determining the value of the Plan's account, the value of a security will initially be determined by the Plan's
custodian. The value will then be checked by the Manager using the following sources depending on the sector and the
markets in which the security is trading: the closing price shown on the Reuters and/or Bloomberg screens; or if the
security is not so displayed, mid-market prices obtained from at least two brokers with these prices then being averaged.
If the value as so determined by the Manager is not significantly different from the value determined by the Plan's
custodian, the latter value will be used. If there is a significant difference, the Manager will consult with the Plan's
custodian in order to reach a mutually agreeable valuation. Thus, the final value of the Plan's account is determined
jointly by the Manager and the Plan's custodian. However, it is represented that, if the Manager and the Plan's custodian
are unable to agree as to the value of the Plan's account, they will jointly select a qualified appraiser to make this
determination. If they are unable to agree on an appraiser, the Manager and the Plan's custodian will each select a
qualified appraiser and the value will be determined by mutual agreement of such appraisers or, if they cannot agree,
by a third qualified appraiser designated by the two appraisers. All such appraisers will be independent of the Manager.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Section 7 of the Agreement currently in effect with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-Plan clients permits the Manager to lend the securities held in the portfolio and to receive income from this process
for its own account. However, this section also provides that any such lending by the Manager shall be entirely at the
Manager's own risk and that the Manager shall indemnify the client for any loss sustained by the portfolio as a result
of such activities. The applicant represents that this section of the Agreement will be amended to provide (a) that
income from any such lending from a Plan's account will be credited to the Plan's account and not to the Manager's account,
and (b) that no lending of this type will occur under circumstances where the borrower is a party in interest or disqualified
person with respect to the Plan unless the conditions of Prohibited Transaction Exemptions 81&hyph;6 (52 FR 18754,
May 19, 1987) and 82&hyph;63 (47 FR 14084, April 6, 1982, as corrected by 47 FR 16437, April 16, 1982) are satisfied.

8. The Applicants assert that by entering into an arrangement with the Manager and the Bank containing the proposed
Guarantee, a Plan would receive protection against the risk of any loss in the value of its investment, provided by
the proposed Guarantee, while also enjoying the benefit of potential income and gains realized by the Manager's individually
tailored, active management of the Plan assets covered by the investment management agreement. They represent that
these advantages are substantially similar to the benefits that may be achieved by so-called ``managed guaranteed
investment contracts'' and similar investment products currently offered by certain insurance companies and banks.
The Applicants state that since the terms and conditions of the investment management services provided by the Manager
to its clients are subject to regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Advisers Act, and since
the Bank must account for the Guarantee on its books and records in the same manner as any other Guarantee issued in the
course of its banking business subject to the regulation of the French banking authorities (as well as the regulation
of banking authorities in other countries, including the United States, in which the Bank maintains banking operations
through its subsidiaries, branches, and offices), substantial regulatory oversight exists to ensure protection
of the rights of Plans and their participants and beneficiaries with respect to the Guarantee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letter dated March 23, 1992, Jean-Pierre Mattout, Head of the Bank's Legal Department, stated his opinion that
the Guarantee constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of the Bank. The applicant points out that as the
Bank has a branch doing business in the United States, the Bank is subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of the United
States and a Plan could bring an action against the Bank in the courts of the United States to enforce the Guarantee.
By letter dated September 15, 1993, the attorney representing the applicant with respect to the exemption application,
explains that the Guarantee, a contract right created pursuant to the Agreement, would be a client Plan asset. He states
that the Bank is subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States and that a plan could bring an action against
the Bank in the district courts of the United States to enforce the Guarantee. He expresses the opinion that for these
reasons, the indicia of ownership of this contract right (the Guarantee) would be maintained within the jurisdiction
of the district courts of the United States, consistent with the requirements of 29 CFR 2550.404b&hyph;1.

29 CFR 2550.404b&hyph;1 provides, in pertinent part, that no fiduciary may maintain the indicia of ownership of any
assets of a plan outside the jurisdiction of the district courts of the United States, unless specified conditions
are satisfied. The Department is expressing no opinion herein as to whether or not the Agreement complies with the
requirements of this section of the regulations.

9. Although the Applicants anticipate that the proposed Guarantee would be provided principally to plans sponsored
by major corporations, generally with assets of at least US $200 million for each such plan, the Bank and the Manager
wish to be able to offer the proposed Guarantee to any plan investing its assets with the Manager (but not investing
in pooled funds) pursuant to an investment management agreement providing for such Guarantee, but only if the plan
fiduciaries responsible for making the decisions (1) to select and retain the Manager as investment Manager, and
(2) to select the Guarantee, are independent of the Bank, the Manager, and their affiliates. The Applicants represent
that they do not presently know the identity of any plan that may select the Manager as investment manager and thereby
may receive the Guarantee from the Bank under the applicable investment management agreement. The Applicants will
bear all costs in connection with the filing of this exemption application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. In summary, the Applicants represent that the proposed transaction satisfies the exemption criteria set forth
in section 408(a) of the Act because: (a) the proposed transaction will enable a Plan to receive protection against
the risk of any loss in the value of its investment in the Portfolio while also enjoying the benefit of potential income
and gains realized by the Manager's individually tailored, active management of the Plan assets covered by the Agreement;
(b) fiduciaries of the Plan who are independent of the Manager, the Bank, and their affiliates are responsible for
the selection and retention of the Manager as investment manager for the Plan, and for the decision to acquire the Guarantee
from the Bank; (c) no separate fee or remuneration is payable by the Plan or any other person to the Manager, the Bank,
or any of their affiliates for the Guarantee; (d) the Plan is entitled to cancel the investment management agreement
with the Manager, and/or the Guarantee provided by the Bank, at any time upon reasonable notice; and (e) the determination
of the value of a Plan's assets under the Manager's investment management at any relevant time shall be made pursuant
to objective standards jointly by the Manager and the Plan's custodian; however, if the Manager and the Plan's custodian
are unable to agree as to the value of the Plan's account, they will jointly select a qualified appraiser to make this
determination; if they are unable to agree on an appraiser, the Manager and the Plan's custodian will each select a
qualified appraiser and the value will be determined by mutual agreement of such appraisers or, if they cannot agree,
by a third qualified appraiser designated by the two appraisers, and all such appraisers will be independent of the
Manager.

NOTICE TO INTERESTED PERSONS:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the identities of Plans that might select the Manager as investment manager, and thereby receive the proposed
Guarantee pursuant to the Agreement, are presently unknown, the only practicable means of notifying potential interested
persons is the publication of this notice of proposed exemption in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->

the Manager represents that notice of the proposed exemption will be furnished by first class mail to all known prospective
plan clients.

Proposed Exemption
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is considering granting an exemption under the authority of section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code and in accordance with the procedures set forth in 29 CFR Part 2570, Subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August
10, 1990). If the exemption is granted, the restrictions of sections 406(a), 406(b)(1) and (b)(2) of the Act and the
sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975 of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1)(A) through
(E) of the Code shall not apply to the purchase (the Purchase) by Margaret Chapman, Loyal Chapman, and Lou Chapman Koester's
individually-directed accounts (the Accounts) in the Plan from Indianapolis Life Insurance Company and Columbus
Mutual Life Insurance Company of certain undivided interests (the Interests) in certain promissory notes (the Notes)
of which the obligor is L.H. Chapman Investment Company, a party in interest with respect to the Plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed exemption is conditioned on the following requirements: (1) the terms of the Purchase are at least as
favorable to the Accounts as those obtainable in an arm's-length transaction with an unrelated party; (2) the Purchase
price is equal to the Accounts' pro rata share of the aggregate outstanding principal balances of the Notes on the day
of the Purchase; (3) the Purchase occurs only if such outstanding principal balances are not greater than the fair
market values of the Interests on the day of the Purchase as determined by a qualified, independent appraiser; (4)
the Purchase does not involve more than twenty-five percent of the assets in each of the Accounts; and (5) the Accounts
are not required to pay any fees, commissions or expenses in connection with the Purchase.

The trustee of the Plan is Loyal Chapman, who is also the president of L.H. Chapman Investment Company (the Employer)
and its sole shareholder. The sponsor of the Plan is the Employer which is an Ohio corporation engaged in the jewelry
business. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. The Interests are undivided interests in two promissory notes (the Notes) which consist of a $400,000 promissory
note made payable to Indianapolis Life Insurance Company (the Indianapolis Note) and an $850,000 promissory note
made payable to Columbus Mutual Life Insurance Company (the Columbus Note). The Notes ultimately resulted from the
Employer's acquisition in 1974 of 5.7 acres of real property in Washington Court House, Ohio and the subsequent construction
of a shopping center on the property (the Shopping Center).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. The Notes, dated January 10, 1974, are twenty-five year promissory notes with interest accruing at a rate of 8-7/8
percent per annum. The Notes are secured by a first deed of trust on the Shopping Center which was valued at $2,200,000
as of March 1, 1994. The terms of the Notes provide that the Employer has the right to prepay the entire indebtedness
in full with a prepayment premium required only if the prepayment of the Notes is made in years eleven through twenty
of the twenty-five year term. The Employer represents that, as of February 1, 1994, the Notes were twenty-one years
old and, therefore, can be purchased by the Employer, without paying a premium, for their outstanding principal balances.
As of March 29, 1994, the outstanding principal balance of the Indianapolis Note was $152,238 and the outstanding
principal balance of the Columbus Note was $323,515. Prior to the Purchase, the Employer proposes to make a $63,966
payment towards the Indianapolis Note, thereby reducing its outstanding principal balance to $88,272 and the total
outstanding principal balances of the Notes to $411,787. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Mrs. and Mr. Chapman and Mrs. Koester (the Applicants) propose to have the Employer, acting as agent for the Accounts,
purchase the Interests for the Accounts for their outstanding principal balances on the date of the Purchase provided
that the outstanding principal balances of the Notes are not greater than the aggregate fair market values of the Interests.
The Accounts will purchase the Interests based upon the proportion of their respective accounts relative to the total
assets in the Plan. Accordingly, the Accounts will purchase the Notes in the following proportions:

4. The Employer obtained an appraisal of the Interests dated March 29, 1994 from John R. Garvin, MAI-GRE of Continental
Appraisal Company of Columbus, Ohio. Mr. Garvin represents that both he and Continental Appraisal are independent
of and unrelated to the Applicants and the Employer, although he has provided some consulting services for Mr. Chapman.
Mr. Garvin states that, on average in the past five years, he has derived less than one percent of his annual income from
the Employer and Mr. Chapman. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Mr. Garvin placed the fair market value of the Notes at $419,948. Such amount takes into consideration the $63,966
payment that will be made on the Indianapolis Note by the Employer. In assigning fair market values to the Interests
based upon the value of the Notes, Mr. Garvin discounted the two minority interests (Mr. Chapman and Mrs. Koester's
interests) by five percent to reflect their lack of liquidity. Mr. Garvin represents that because the majority interest
(Mrs. Chapman's interest) could liquidate the investment at any time without the consent of the minority interests,
there is no basis for any such discount with respect to the majority interest. The fair market values of the Interests,
as of March 29, 1994, are as follows:

Accordingly, because the outstanding balance of the Notes are less than the fair market values of the Interests, the
Accounts will purchase the Interests for their pro rata share of the outstanding balance.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
5. The Applicants represent that the Purchase is in the best interests of the participants because it offers the Accounts
the opportunity to purchase the Interests at less than their fair market values. Also, the Purchase will allow the
Accounts to enhance their current rate of return without additional risk. The Applicants represent that the Purchase
will not involve more than twenty-five percent of the assets in each of the Accounts. The Accounts are not required
to pay any fees, commissions or expenses in connection with the Purchase. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 6. In summary, it is represented that the proposed transaction will satisfy the statutory criteria for an exemption
under section 408(a) of the Act because: (a) the terms of the Purchase will be at least as favorable to the Accounts as
those obtainable in an arm's-length transaction with an unrelated party; (b) the Purchase price will be equal to the
outstanding principal balances of the Notes on the day of the Purchase; (c) the Purchase will occur only if such outstanding
principal balances are not greater than the aggregate fair market values of the Interests on the day of the Purchase

that there is no need to distribute the notice of proposed exemption to interested persons. Comments and requests

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The Asset Manager is not an affiliate of AT&amp;T and the terms of any Performance Fee are approved in writing by
AT&amp;T. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The terms of any Performance Fee shall be at least as favorable to the AT&amp;T Investment Fund as those obtainable

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (c) No AT&amp;T Trust shall allocate, in the aggregate, more than twenty percent of its total assets to Arrangements
which are the subject of this exemption, determined at the time any such Arrangement is established and at the time
of any subsequent allocation of additional assets (including the reinvestment of assets) to such an Arrangement.
The foregoing limitation shall not apply to an AT&amp;T Plan Assets Entity. However, that percentage of the Assets
of an AT&amp;T Plan Assets Entity which is deemed to be ``plan assets'' of an AT&amp;T Trust invested therein shall
be treated as assets of such AT&amp;T Trust for the purpose of applying the foregoing limitation to the AT&amp;T Trust.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (d) AT&amp;T shall receive the following written information with respect to assets subject to this exemption (Assets):
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (1) annual audited financial statements prepared by independent certified public accountants approved by AT&amp;T;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (2) quarterly and annual reports prepared by the Asset Manager relating to the overall financial position of the Assets

 (f) The Performance Fee shall be payable after Net Proceeds with respect to the Assets exceed the Threshold Amount.
The Threshold Amount and the amount of the Performance Fee, expressed as a percentage (or percentages) of the Net Proceeds
in excess of the Threshold Amount (or Threshold Amounts), shall be established by the Agreement. The Threshold Amount
for any Performance Fee shall include at least a minimum rate of return to the AT&amp;T Investment Fund, as described
in Part III, Section (q).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (g) The provisions of this paragraph (g) shall apply only where an Asset Manager has discretion to sell Assets without
prior approval of AT&amp;T. For any sale of an Asset which gives rise to the payment of a Performance Fee to an Asset Manager
prior to the Termination Date, the sales price of the Asset shall be at least equal to a Target Amount in order for the
Asset Manager to sell the Asset and receive its Performance Fee without further approval. If the proposed sales price
of the Asset is less than the applicable Target Amount, the proposed sale shall be disclosed to and subject to the approval
of AT&amp;T, in which event the Asset Manager shall be entitled to sell the Asset and receive its Performance Fee. If
the proposed sales price is less than the applicable Target Amount and AT&amp;T's approval is not obtained, the Asset
Manager shall retain the authority to sell the Asset, provided that the Performance Fee that would have been payable
to the Asset Manager by reason of the sale of the Asset shall be paid only at the termination of the Arrangement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (h) In the event of termination of the Arrangement upon its Termination Date, the Asset Manager shall be entitled to
receive a Performance Fee payable on the Termination Date. The amount of the Performance Fee upon termination shall
be determined by assuming a sale for cash of the remaining Assets at their fair market value (determined on the basis
of Independent Valuations) and no reinvestment of such cash in Assets subject to the Arrangement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (i) In the event of the removal or resignation of an Asset Manager prior to the Termination Date, the Asset Manager shall
be entitled to receive a Performance Fee payable on the Termination Date pursuant to this paragraph (i). The Performance
Fee shall be calculated on a preliminary basis at the time of such removal or resignation by assuming a sale for cash
of the remaining Assets at their fair market value (determined on the basis of Independent Valuations) and no reinvestment
of such cash in Assets subject to the Arrangements. As of the Termination Date, the amount so determined on a preliminary
basis shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of (1) the actual sales prices received by
the AT&amp;T Investment Fund on disposition of all Assets sold after the date of the Asset Manager's removal or resignation
and prior to the Termination Date, and (2) in the case of Assets which have not been sold prior to the Termination Date,
the value of the Assets as of the Termination Date (determined on the basis of Independent Valuations), and the denominator
of which is the aggregate value of the Assets which was used in connection with the preliminary determination of the
Performance Fee at the time of removal or resignation, provided that this fraction shall never exceed 1.0. The resulting
amount shall be the Performance Fee payable to the Asset Manager upon the Termination Date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (j) AT&amp;T shall maintain or cause to be maintained with respect to the Assets, for a period of six years, the records
necessary to enable the persons described in paragraph (k) of this Part II to determine whether the conditions of this
exemption have been met, except that (1) a prohibited transaction will not be considered to have occurred if, due to
circumstances beyond the control of AT&amp;T, the records are lost or destroyed prior to the end of the six-year period,
and (2) no party in interest, other than AT&amp;T, shall be subject to the civil penalty that may be assessed under section
502(i) of the Act or to the taxes imposed by section 4975 (a) and (b) of the Code if the records are not maintained or are
not available for examination as required by Part III, Section (k) below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (k) Notwithstanding any provisions of Section 504(a)(2) and 504(b) of the Act, the records referred to in Section
(j) of this Part II shall be unconditionally available at their customary location for examination during normal
business hours by:

Summary of Facts and Representations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. AT&amp;T is a New York corporation which provides a wide variety of national and international telecommunications
services. ATTIMCO is a wholly-owned subsidiary of AT&amp;T which performs investment management functions. ATTIMCO
is a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. AT&amp;T is the sponsor
of the AT&amp;T Master Pension Trust (AT&amp;T MPT), a qualified trust holding assets of certain employee benefit
plans maintained by AT&amp;T. The bulk of the real estate assets of the AT&amp;T MPT is held through the Telephone Real
Estate Equity Trust (TREET), a group trust established in connection with AT&amp;T's divestiture in 1984 of the regional
telephone holding companies, including BellSouth Corporation (BellSouth). The beneficial interests in TREET
currently are held by the AT&amp;T MPT and the BellSouth Master Pension Trust, a qualified trust holding the assets
of employee benefit plans maintained by BellSouth. As of January 1, 1994, the Assets of the AT&amp;T MPT (including
its interest in TREET) exceeded $38 billion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. AT&amp;T is the named fiduciary of both the AT&amp;T MPT and TREET with the power to manage and control the assets
of such trusts and to appoint investment managers of such assets. In order to facilitate investment of these and other
such funds in potentially beneficial transactions and to encourage asset managers to maximize the value of assets
under management, AT&amp;T seeks the flexibility to enter into arrangements described below (the Arrangements)
involving the payment of performance fees to independent asset managers, pursuant to formal agreements with current
and future asset managers (the Agreements). AT&amp;T is requesting an exemption to permit its payment of performance
fees to asset managers for services rendered to the funds pursuant to Arrangements established by the Agreements,
subject to the conditions in the proposed exemption, as described herein.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed exemption will be available for Arrangements involving any AT&amp;T Investment Fund (collectively,
the Funds), a term which is defined as (1) the AT&amp;T MPT or any other trust of which one hundred percent of the assets
are assets of employee benefit plans maintained by AT&amp;T, and (2) any group trust, partnership or other entity
(including without limitation the Telephone Real Estate Equity Trust), the assets of which are deemed to be ``plan
assets'' by reason of the application of 29 C.F.R. 2510.3&hyph;101, but only if (1) fifty percent or more of the interests
in such entity are held by one or more AT&amp;T Trusts, and (2) AT&amp;T is the named fiduciary or manager of the assets
of such entity. Under the Arrangements proposed, an asset manager would provide, or continue to provide, real estate
management or advisory services to one or more Funds. Depending on the terms of the particular Agreement, an asset
manager may have complete discretion with respect to assets of the Fund allocated to its account, including discretion
to identify appropriate investments, make investment decisions, and manage and dispose of investments, or may be
limited to making investment recommendations subject to the ultimate approval of AT&amp;T. Alternatively, the
asset manager may be given limited discretion with respect to some, but not all, aspects of the management of the assets
allocated to its account. For example, the asset manager may have discretion with respect to all aspects of managing
such assets except for specific major decisions such as acquisition and disposition.

4. The applicants represent that under the Agreements, assets of the Funds will be managed with the investment objective
of obtaining current income and/or capital appreciation, primarily through investment directly or indirectly,
in real estate and interests in real estate, including without limitation fee simple interests, interests in partnerships
and joint ventures having an interest in real property, mortgages, options to purchase real estate, leaseholds,
leasebacks, and investments in real estate funds, real estate investment trusts or other entities with assets which
are invested, directly or indirectly, primarily in real estate. Assets potentially to be subject to the Arrangements
include the following: (a) investments selected or recommended by an asset manager after an Agreement is executed,
in accordance with investment guidelines established by the Agreement; (b) pre-identified investments which are
particular properties which have been identified by the asset manager for investment (or recommended for investment)
prior to the execution of the Agreement; (c) pre-existing assets which are already held by a Fund prior to the execution
of the Agreement; and (d) combinations of the foregoing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. As proposed by the applicant, the performance fee payable to an asset manager under an Agreement (the Performance
Fee) is a fee payable after net proceeds (Net Proceeds) from the assets under management pursuant to the Agreement
exceed a certain amount (the Threshold Amount).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Net Proceeds, with respect to an Arrangement, are the aggregate amount of cash and other assets (valued at fair market
value on the basis of independent valuations
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) which cease to be assets subject to the Arrangement. Each Agreement establishing an Arrangement will specifically
identify the assets to be subject to the Arrangement, and the basis upon which income and earnings on such assets will
cease, or continue, to be subject to the Arrangement. For example, the applicant represents that an Agreement might
provide that the assets initially allocated to the Arrangement plus all earnings and proceeds thereon will be reinvested
and remain subject to the Arrangement until the Termination Date, whereupon all such assets will cease to be subject
to the Arrangement. In such case, there will be no Net Proceeds during the term of the Arrangement, and therefore no
Performance Fee would be payable until the Termination Date. Alternatively, the applicant represents that an Agreement
might provide that all net income and other proceeds generated by the assets initially allocated to the Arrangement
will cease to be subject to the Arrangement and will thereby constitute Net Proceeds. In such case, Net Proceeds will
be generated as and when the initial assets generate net income or other proceeds, and a Performance Fee would be payable
once the amount of these Net Proceeds exceed the Threshold Amount. The Threshold Amount is defined as an amount equal
to one hundred percent of the Fund's capital investment plus a pre-specified annual compounded cumulative rate or
rates of return each of which is at least a minimum rate of return as determined by a formula based on the consumer price
index, as required in Part III, Sections (q) (1) and (2) of the proposed exemption. The proposed exemption provides
that the Performance Fee is payable (a) after Net Proceeds exceed the Threshold Amount, and/or (b) on the Agreement's
termination date (the Termination Date, defined as the date on which the Arrangement will terminate by reason of the
passage of time, as the same may be amended from time to time with the approval of AT&amp;T), either upon termination
of the Arrangement or in the event of the prior removal or resignation of an asset manager. The Performance Fee will
be equal to a pre-specified percentage, or several pre-specified percentages, of all Net Proceeds in excess of the
Threshold Amount, or Threshold Amounts, subject to such limitations as AT&amp;T may impose. In this regard, AT&amp;T
represents that there is a possibility that several Threshold Amounts may be established with different percentages
being utilized to determine the Performance Fee, depending upon which Threshold Amount has been exceeded. AT&amp;T
states that this structure will allow AT&amp;T to negotiate an arrangement on behalf of a Fund pursuant to which the
amount of the Performance Fee will increase as the level of investment performance increases. AT&amp;T states that,
as an example, AT&amp;T could negotiate a Performance Fee whereby an asset manager would receive ten percent of all
Net Proceeds in excess of an initial Threshold Amount (e.g., all invested capital plus an eight percent annual return),
and twenty percent of all Net Proceeds once a second Threshold Amount (e.g., all invested capital plus a twelve percent
annual return) has been achieved. Both the annual rate(s) of return used in determining the Threshold Amount(s) and
the percentage(s) used to determine the amount of the Performance Fee will be negotiated between AT&amp;T and the
asset manager prior to the application of any Arrangement to assets under management of the asset manager.

Under the proposed exemption, the term ``independent valuations'' means valuations based on independent and objective
third party sources acceptable to AT&amp;T (including without limitation NASDAQ, newspapers, or other general
publications, or brokers which are independent of the Asset Manager and its affiliates). AT&amp;T represents that
the assets of AT&amp;T Investment Funds to be subject to the Arrangements will consist primarily of real estate or
interests in real estate which will be valued, as a general matter, by independent appraisers. However, a portion
of an AT&amp;T Investment Fund's assets subject to an Arrangement may consist of real estate-related securities,
such as shares in real estate investment trusts, that may be valued using independent sources other than appraisers,
such as NASDAQ and the other sources described in the definition of ``independent valuations''.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With respect to the determination of the Threshold Amount, each of the pre-specified rates of return will be at least
equal to a minimum rate of return as specified in Part III, Section (q) of the proposed exemption. In determining the
Threshold Amount, different assets or different groups of assets may be subject to different annual rates of return,
with the rate of return applicable to any particular asset being established by the Agreement.

 Net Proceeds in excess of the Funds invested capital plus the minimum return must actually be achieved (or deemed achieved
upon the Termination Date or the removal of the asset manager) in order for the Threshold Amount to be reached. The Performance
Fee payable to an asset manager may be reduced by all or a portion of any fees previously paid to the asset manager with
respect to the assets under any prior fee arrangement if and to the extent such a reduction is called for by the Agreement
and shall be subject to such other limitations as AT&amp;T may impose.

AT&amp;T represents that under the Agreements, asset managers will not have discretion to shift assets within the
Arrangement from one class to another, and that AT&amp;T will be responsible for determining whether assets may be
shifted from one class to another during the term of the Arrangement.

6. As a specific provision of any Agreement which gives an asset manager complete discretion over the acquisition
and disposition of assets, AT&amp;T will require that for any sale of an asset which causes the payment of a Performance
Fee and which occurs prior to the Termination Date, the sales price for the asset must be at least equal to a certain amount
(the Target Amount) in order for the asset manager to sell the asset and receive the Performance Fee without further
approvals. The Target Amount for each asset will be assigned either at the time the asset becomes subject to the Arrangement,
as agreed between AT&amp;T and the asset manager, or pursuant to an objective formula approved by AT&amp;T and the
asset manager at the time the Arrangement is established. If the proposed sales price of the asset is less than the applicable
Target Amount, the proposed sale must be disclosed to AT&amp;T for approval in order for the asset manager to receive
its Performance Fee as a result of the sale. If the proposed sales price is less than the applicable Target Amount and
AT&amp;T's approval is not obtained, the asset manager will continue to have authority to sell the asset but the Performance
Fee which would have been payable to the asset manager by reason of the asset sale will be paid only at the Termination
Date. Under each Arrangement subject to the proposed exemption, all realized income on, and proceeds from the sale
of, the assets, net of expenses and reasonable reserves, will either (a) be reinvested in assets subject to the Arrangement,
if the Agreement so provides or if AT&amp;T so determines pursuant to the Agreement, or (b) cease to be subject to the
Arrangement and thereby become Net Proceeds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AT&amp;T represents that the Target Amount concept provides protection for the AT&amp;T Investment Fund to assure
that an asset manager will not sell any assets at unduly low prices to trigger immediate payment of the related performance
fee. AT&amp;T states that this concept is intended to provide a floor on the price at which an asset can be sold and the
performance fee paid immediately without having to obtain AT&amp;T's approval. For newly-acquired assets, the
minimum floor is deemed to be the cost of the asset; for previously acquired assets, the minimum floor amount is the
value of the asset at the time the asset becomes subject to the Arrangement, an approach which AT&amp;T represents
to be the most logical to establish the minimum Target Amount for previously acquired assets. AT&amp;T notes that
it has the flexibility to negotiate a higher Target Amount in any case where it believes the minimum Target Amount permitted
by the proposed exemption would be inadequate.

7. AT&amp;T offers four hypothetical examples to illustrate the operation of the proposed exemption with respect
to the Target Amount concept. In each example, it is assumed that the asset manager has discretion to sell the relevant
asset without the prior approval of AT&amp;T
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 and that its performance fee is equal to ten percent of all Net Proceeds in excess of the Threshold Amount. In each example,
the Threshold Amount at the time the relevant asset is sold is $110:

AT&amp;T represents that under the typical Arrangements contemplated, it intends to retain this discretion, in

Example 1:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 AT&amp;T and an asset manager enter into an Arrangement whereby the asset manager agrees to manage a portion of the
real estate investment of an AT&amp;T Investment Fund, including Parcel X, a real estate investment to be acquired
by the AT&amp;T Investment Funds at the time the Arrangement is entered into. The cost of Parcel X is $100 cash. At the
time the Arrangement is entered into, the asset manager and AT&amp;T agree that the Target Amount shall be $100. Two
years later, the asset manager sells Parcel X for $150 without the prior approval of AT&amp;T. Having exceeded the
Threshold Amount for the Arrangement, the asset manager is entitled to a performance fee of $4.00 (i.e., [$150 ^ $110]
&times; .10). Since the asset manager exceeded the Target Amount for Parcel X, this performance fee is payable at the
time of the sale of Parcel X.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 2:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Assume the same facts as in Example 1 except that Parcel X was acquired by the AT&amp;T Investment Fund three years prior
to the date the Arrangement was entered, that the initial cost of Parcel X was $50, and that its value at the time it becomes
subject to the Arrangement is $100. AT&amp;T and the asset manager agree that the Target Amount is $100, the value of
Parcel X at the time it becomes subject to the Arrangement. Upon the sale of Parcel X for $150, the asset manager is entitled
to a Performance Fee of $4.00, calculated and payable in the same manner as described in Example 1.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Example 3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: Assume the same facts as Example 2 except that the original acquisition price of Parcel X three years prior to the Arrangement
was $120. AT&amp;T and the asset manager agree that the Target Amount is $100, the value of Parcel X at the time it becomes
subject to the Arrangement. Upon the sale of Parcel X, the asset manager is entitled to a performance fee equal to $4.00,
calculated and payable in the same manner as described in Example 1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Example 4:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Assume the same facts as Example 3 except that the asset manager and AT&amp;T agree that the Target Amount for Parcel
X is $130 and that the asset manager sells Parcel X for $125 without the prior approval of AT&amp;T. Upon the sale of Parcel
X, the asset manager becomes entitled to a performance fee of $1.50 (i.e., [$125 ^ $110] &times; .10). However, because
AT&amp;T did not approve the sale at a price below the Target Amount, payment of the performance fee is deferred until
the Termination Date of the Arrangement. Had AT&amp;T approved the sale at the price below the Target Amount, the performance
fee of $1.50 would have been payable upon the sale.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. An Arrangement will terminate upon the Termination Date set forth in the Agreement, which may be changed with the
approval of AT&amp;T. Upon termination of an Arrangement, the assets under management will be either sold or retained
by the Fund, and the asset manager will be entitled to a Performance Fee or an additional Performance Fee if the Threshold
Amount has been reached at or before such time. In the case of any assets which are not sold upon termination of the Arrangement,
the Performance Fee will be calculated using the fair market value of such assets as determined on the basis of independent
valuations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Each Arrangement will provide that the asset manager may be removed by AT&amp;T at any time, without cause, upon
AT&amp;T's delivery of a notice of removal to the asset manager. An asset manager may resign at any time, without cause,
upon written notice to AT&amp;T. Upon removal or resignation of an asset manager, the asset manager will be entitled
to receive a Performance Fee if, at the time of the asset manager's removal or resignation, Net Proceeds with respect
to the assets under management would exceed an amount equal to the Threshold Amount. However, each Agreement will
provide that such a Performance Fee will not be payable until the Termination Date and shall be subject to a reduction
as determined under Part II, Section (i) of the proposed exemption. Accordingly, even if the aggregate value of the
assets under management declines after an asset manager's removal or resignation, the asset manager will still receive
a Performance Fee for the period of time that it provided services under an Arrangement if Net Proceeds, based on an
assumed sale of the assets at their fair market value, exceed an amount equal to the Threshold Amount at the time of the
asset manager's removal or resignation, subject to the calculation required under Part II, Section (i) of the proposed
exemption. The applicant represents that this provision ensures that an appropriate reduction in the Performance
Fee will be made if the aggregate value of the assets declines after the asset manager resigns or is removed.

10. No AT&amp;T Trust will be permitted to allocate, in the aggregate, more than twenty percent of its total assets
to Arrangements which are the subject of the proposed exemption, determined at the time any such Arrangement is established
and at the time of any subsequent allocation of additional assets, including the reinvestment of assets, to such Arrangement.
The foregoing limitation does not apply to an AT&amp;T Plan Assets Entity, which is defined as any group trust, partnership
or other entity, the assets of which are deemed to be ``plan assets'' by reason of the application of 29 C.F.R. 2510.3&hyph;101,
but only if (a) fifty percent or more of the interests in such entity are held by one or more AT&amp;T Trusts and (b) AT&amp;T
is the named fiduciary or manager of the assets of such entity. An AT&amp;T Plan Assets Entity may allocate up to one
hundred percent of its asset to Arrangements subject to the proposed exemption. However, solely for determining
if an AT&amp;T Trust satisfies the twenty percent limitation, the assets of any AT&amp;T Plan Assets Entity in which
such AT&amp;T Trust has an interest will be deemed to be the asset of such AT&amp;T Trust only to the extent of such AT&amp;&amp;
Trust's interest in the AT&amp;T Plan Assets Entity. As an example, the applicant explains a hypothetical situation
in which an AT&amp;T Trust has total assets of $100 million: This AT&amp;T Trust may allocate up to $20 million to Arrangements.
In the hypothetical example, $15 million of the AT&amp;T Trust's assets are invested in an AT&amp;T Plan Assets Entity
which has total assets of $30 million, fifty percent of which are allocated to Arrangements. For the purpose of determining
if the AT&amp;T Trust satisfies the twenty percent allocation limit, $15 million of the assets of the AT&amp;T Plan
Assets Entity, representing the AT&amp;T Trust's investment therein, are deemed to be assets of the AT&amp;T Trust.
Because fifty percent of the AT&amp;T Plan Assets Entity's overall assets are allocated to Arrangements, fifty percent
(or $7.5 million) of this $15 million is deemed to be allocated to Arrangements. Thus, by virtue of its investment in
the AT&amp;T Plan Assets Entity, the AT&amp;T Trust is treated as having allocated $7.5 million to Arrangements.
Accordingly, in this hypothetical example, the AT&amp;T Trust may allocate up to $12.5 million of its remaining assets
to Arrangements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Throughout the term of an Arrangement, AT&amp;T will receive quarterly and annual reports prepared by the asset
manager relating to the overall financial position of the assets under management, including a statement regarding
the amount of all fees paid to the asset manager during the period covered by the report, and annual reports indicating
the current fair market value of all assets as determined on the basis of the most recently available independent valuations,
as defined in Part III, Section (k) of the proposed exemption. AT&amp;T will also receive annual audited financial
statements prepared by independent certified public accountants approved by AT&amp;T, generally within ninety
days of the end of the twelve month period covered by the statement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. The proposed exemption requires AT&amp;T to provide for the maintenance, for six years, of records necessary
to enable determinations of whether the conditions of the proposed exemption are satisfied. Such records must be
unconditionally available at their customary location for examination during normal business by any duly authorized
representative of the Department or the Internal Revenue Service, any contributing employer (or its representative)
with respect to an employee benefit plan with assets held in a Fund which has entered into an Arrangement, and any participant
or beneficiary (or his/her representative) of such a plan.

13. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transactions satisfy the criteria of section 408(a) of
the Act for the following reasons: (a) Each Arrangement is authorized in writing by AT&amp;T as named fiduciary or
manager of the relevant Fund; (b) No AT&amp;T Trust may invest, in the aggregate, more than twenty percent of its total
assets in Arrangements which are the subject of the proposed exemption; (c) AT&amp;T will receive written reports
with respect to the condition of assets and payment of fees under the Arrangements, and will maintain accessible records
to enable determinations of whether the terms of the proposed exemption are satisfied; (d) The fees paid to an asset
manager under any Arrangement will constitute no more than reasonable compensation; (e) The timing and formula for
determining fees under the Arrangements will be established and approved by AT&amp;T prior to a Fund's entering into
an Arrangement, and will be based on pre-specified percentages of Net Proceeds after the Fund has recovered its invested
capital plus a minimum pre-specified rate of return; (f) The terms of any Performance Fee will be at least as favorable
to the Fund as those obtainable in arm's-length transactions with unrelated parties; and (g) AT&amp;T may remove
an asset manager under an Arrangement at any time.

Proposed Exemption
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is considering granting an exemption under the authority of section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code and in accordance with the procedures set forth in 29 CFR Part 2570, Subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August
10, 1990). If the exemption is granted, the restrictions of sections 406(a), 406(b)(1) and (b)(2) of the Act and the
sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975 of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1)(A) through
(E) of the Code, shall not apply to (1) the proposed extension of credit to the Plan by Boatmen's Trust Company (BTC),
a party in interest with respect to the Plan, in the form of a payment (the Advance) with respect to group annuity contract
CG01285B3A (the GIC) issued by Executive Life Insurance Company (ELIC); and (2) the Plan's potential repayment of
the Advance (the Repayments), provided: (a) all terms of such transactions are no less favorable to the Plan than those
which the Plan could obtain in arm's-length transactions with an unrelated party; (b) no interest and/or expenses
are paid by the Plan; (c) the Advance is made with respect to amounts invested by the Plan in the GIC; (d) the Repayments
are restricted to the amounts, if any, paid to the Plan after August 2, 1994, by ELIC or other responsible third parties
with respect to the GIC (the GIC Proceeds); (e) the Repayments do not exceed the total amount of the Advance; and (f)
the Repayments are waived to the extent the Advance exceeds the GIC Proceeds.

Summary of Facts and Representations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Plan is a profit sharing plan which had 6,938 participants as of March 31, 1994. The approximate aggregate fair
market value of the Plan's assets as of that date was $313 million. BTC is the trustee of the Plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. On February 12, 1988, $763,683.21 of the Plan's assets were invested in the GIC, yielding 8.5% compound interest
with a March 1, 1993 maturity date. As of March 31, 1991, the book value of the GIC totalled $987,902.02.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. On April 11, 1991, a California court appointed the Insurance Commissioner of the State of California as conservator
of ELIC. Pursuant to this action, payouts on ELIC's GICs were suspended.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Subsequently, the California Insurance Commissioner approved a Rehabilitation Plan for ELIC (the Rehab Plan),
which involved, among other things, Aurora National Life Assurance Company (Aurora) assuming most of the insurance
policy and GIC obligations of ELIC, in some cases at discounted values.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Rehab Plan also involved liquidation of certain assets of ELIC, including real estate and so-called ``junk bonds'',
to fund various aspects of the Rehab Plan. For holders of ELIC GICs, the terms of the Rehab Plan included an election
either to:

In this proposed exemption, the Department expresses no opinion as to whether the acquisition and holding of the GIC
violated any provisions of Part 4 of Title I of the Act.

The Department notes that the exemption proposed herein is not intended to affect any cause of action by any participant
of the Plan or the Department with respect to the GIC.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Opt into the Rehab Plan, and receive a replacement GIC from Aurora at a discounted value; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Opt out of the Rehab Plan, in return for a discounted account value (DAV) payable partly in cash now and partly in
the form of future contingent cash payments from certain ELIC liquidating trusts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. In its capacity as trustee of the Plan, BTC ultimately selected the opt out option for the Plan. Under the terms of
the Rehab Plan and the opt out election, a substantial portion of the DAV ($569,100.82) has already been received from
ELIC in cash. The balance of the DAV ($260,801.20) represents the California Insurance Commissioner's estimate
of the future contingent payments to be received by the Plan from the ELIC liquidating trust. It is expected that the
remaining asset liquidations will take several years. The precise timing and amount of future payments is subject
to uncertainty.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. BTC is willing to make the proposed Advance in order to protect plan participants from any loss with respect to their
initial principal investment in the GIC. The proposed amount of the Advance, $194,582.39, represents the difference
between the Plan's initial investment in the GIC ($763,683.21) and the cash payments which have been received to date
from ELIC pursuant to the Rehab Plan ($569,100.82). Without the Advance, the applicant represents that it is possible
that the Plan might be unable to meet in timely fashion its obligations to pay benefits and make distributions and to
accommodate participant-directed investment reallocations. BTC proposes the Advance as an alternative to being
forced to ``freeze'' that portion of the Plan invested in the GIC. Moreover, BTC represents that the Advance will protect
the Plan participants and their beneficiaries from the risk of loss and possible reduction of benefits attendant
to the investment in the GIC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The applicant represents that the Advance will be made in a single payment of $194,582.39. As a result of the transaction,
participants will receive at least the original principal amount invested in the GIC. The proposed Advance will be
made to the Plan on an interest-free, unsecured basis. The Plan will incur no expenses in connection with the proposed
Advance. The proposed Advance may be repaid only out of the GIC Proceeds. If the amounts so received are less than the
amount of the Advance, BTC will bear the loss, having no recourse against any other of the Plan's assets. In the event
that the GIC Proceeds exceed the amount necessary to repay the Advance, the excess will be distributed to the Plan for
the benefit of participants and their beneficiaries. BTC represents that it will maintain records of the proposed
Advance for a period of seven years, and such records will be open for inspection at all times by the Department or any
Plan participant.

7. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transactions will satisfy the criteria contained in section
408(a) of the Act because: (a) all terms of the transactions will be no less favorable to the Plans than those which the
Plans could obtain in an arm's-length transaction with an unrelated party; (b) no interest and/or expenses will be
paid by the plans; (c) the Advance will be made with respect to amounts invested by the Plan in the GIC; (d) the Repayments
are restricted to the GIC Proceeds; (e) the Repayments will not exceed the total amount of the Advance; and (f) the Repayments
are waived to the extent the Advance exceeds the GIC Proceeds.

General Information
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The attention of interested persons is directed to the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest of disqualified person from certain other provisions
of the Act and/or the Code, including any prohibited transaction provisions to which the exemption does not apply
and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act, which among other things require a
fiduciary to discharge his duties respecting the plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries
of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(b) of the act; nor does it affect the requirement
of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan must operate for the exclusive benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining
the plan and their beneficiaries;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Before an exemption may be granted under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2) of the Code, the Department
must find that the exemption is administratively feasible, in the interests of the plan and of its participants and
beneficiaries and protective of the rights of participants and beneficiaries of the plan; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The proposed exemptions, if granted, will be supplemental to, and not in derogation of, any other provisions of
the Act and/or the Code, including statutory or administrative exemptions and transitional rules. Furthermore,
the fact that a transaction is subject to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the
transaction is in fact a prohibited transaction; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The proposed exemptions, if granted, will be subject to the express condition that the material facts and representations
contained in each application are true and complete and accurately describe all material terms of the transaction
which is the subject of the exemption. In the case of continuing exemption transactions, if any of the material facts
or representations described in the application change after the exemption is granted, the exemption will cease
to apply as of the date of such change. In the event of any such change, application for a new exemption may be made to the
Department.

<DOCTITLE>Advanced Medical Systems, Inc. (Byproduct License No. 34&hyph;19089&hyph;01); Receipt of Petition for Director's
Decision Under 10 CFR 2.206</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice is hereby given that the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission Staff has received a Petition dated August 19,
1994, filed by William B. Schatz, on behalf of the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District (``Petitioner'' or ``NEORSD'').
The Petition requests, pursuant to 10 CFR 2.206, that the NRC take action with regard to Advanced Medical Systems,
Inc. (AMS), to amend AMS's License No. 34&hyph;19089&hyph;01 to require AMS to install, maintain, and operate a radiation
alarm system on all drains at 1020 London Road, Cleveland, Ohio (AMS Facility) that lead to either sanitary or storm
sewers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioner asserts as the bases for this request that it views the quantity of cobalt-60 waste in the basement of the
AMS facility as a major threat; that the NRC admits that the existing contamination at the AMS Facility continues to
pose a risk; that the contamination that exists at the AMS Facility is estimated to be 393 curies of loose, ``talcum-like''
cobalt scattered upon the floor of the waste hold-up room in the basement; that cobalt-60 contamination was found
in the sewer line connecting the AMS Facility to the public sewer and was found in the public sewer directly under the
AMS discharge; that the NEORSD has already incurred costs of nearly $2 million addressing loose cobalt-60 contamination
at its Easterly and Southerly Wastewater treatment plants; that the NRC has been unable or unwilling to explain the
source of the cobalt-60 on the NEORSD property and unable to identify any likely sources for the cobalt-60 other than
the AMS Facility; that the quantity of cobalt-60 at the Southerly Plant exceeds that which the AMS records show was
released by AMS into the sewer system; and that License Amendment No. 10 to the original license for this site, issued
to Picker in 1962, contained a requirement for an alarm system to detect unmonitored discharges. The Petitioner states
that such an alarm system was not a condition of the subsequent AMS license despite a recommendation from Oak Ridge
Associated Universities that such an alarm system be installed along with control valves to shut off flow to the sewer
if the alarm sounds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Petition has been referred to the Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards pursuant to 10 CFR 2.206. As
provided by Section 2.206, appropriate action will be taken with regard to the specific issue raised by the Petition
in a reasonable time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A copy of the Petition is available for inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room at 2110 L Street, N.W.,
Washington, D.C. 20555, and at the Local Public Document Room, Perry Public Library, 3753 Main Street, Perry, Ohio

This proceeding concerns two license amendments for the River Bend Station, a nuclear facility located in Feliciana
Parish, Louisiana. The amendments: (1) Authorize Gulf States Utilities Company to become a wholly owned subsidiary
of Entergy Corporation; and (2) designate Entergy Operations, Inc. as a new licensee to operate, manage, and maintain
River Bend.

In response to a Notice of Opportunity for Hearing, 58 FR 36,423, 36,435&hyph;36 (1993), Cajun Electric Cooperative,
Inc. (Cajun) petitioned to intervene in this proceeding. On December 16, 1993, the NRC Staff issued the license amendments
requested, and on January 27, 1994 an NRC Licensing Board admitted Cajun as an intervener (LBP&hyph;94&hyph;3, 39
NRC 3). The decision to admit Cajun was subsequently affirmed by the Commission on August 24, 1994 (CLI&hyph;94&hyph;10,

).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Please take notice that a hearing will be conducted in this proceeding. Matters currently at issue are Cajun's contention
that the proposed license amendments may result in a reduction in the margin of safety at River Bend caused by underfunding
of the facility.

<DOCTITLE>Northeast Nuclear Energy Company; Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed
no Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. NPF&hyph;49, issued to Northeast Nuclear Energy Company (NNECO/the licensee), for operation of the
Millstone Nuclear Power Station, Unit No. 3, located in New London County, Connecticut.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment would revise the Technical Specifications (TS) to modify surveillance requirements by increasing
the acceptance criterion for the closure of the main steam isolation valves (MSIVs) from 5 seconds to 10 seconds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change would permit Millstone Unit 3 to resume plant operation. To resume plant operations Millstone
Unit 3 must meet the operability requirements of the Technical Specifications for the MSIVs. On September 8, 1994,
during monthly testing of the ``C'' MSIV, it was determined that the MSIV was inoperable because its closure time was
determined to be greater than 5 seconds. Subsequent efforts to meet the required closure time have been unsuccessful.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.91(a)(6) for amendments to be granted under exigent circumstances, the NRC staff must determine
that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations
in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve
a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the
possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant
reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue
of no significant hazards consideration (SHC), which is presented below:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
*&blank;*&blank;* The proposed change does not involve an SHC because the change would not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NNECO's proposal to modify Surveillance Requirement 4.7.1.5.1 of the Millstone Unit No. 3 Technical Specifications
does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The increase in the MSIV stroke time from 5 seconds to 10 seconds has no adverse impact on the FSAR [Final Safety Analysis
Report] analyses for the feedwater line break and the main steam line break. The applicable acceptance criteria (e.g.,
DNBR [departure from nucleate boiling ratio] and pressure) for both 3-loop and 4-loop operation continue to be met
with an increase in the MSIV closure time from 5 to 10 seconds. No other accident analyses discussed in Chapter 15 of
the FSAR are affected by the proposed increase in the MSIV closure time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, evaluations have determined that the proposal does not affect the environmental qualification program
for either the main steam valve building or the containment, does not impact the design basis accident radiological
consequence calculations, does not negatively impact fluid transient evaluations, has a negligible impact on the
long term cooling capacity of the steam generators, and does not change pipe rupture mechanistic effects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not introduce any new failure modes. It simply modifies an acceptance criterion for a surveillance
requirement. As such, increasing the MSIV stroke time from 5 seconds to 10 seconds affects only the FSAR analyses for
the feedwater line break and the main stream line break. No other accident analyses discussed in Chapter 15 of the FSAR
are affected by the proposed increase in the MSIV closure time. The applicable acceptance criteria (e.g., DNBR and
pressure) for both 3-loop and 4-loop operation continue to be met with an increase in the MSIV closure time from 5 to
10 seconds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, evaluations have determined that the proposal does not affect the environmental qualification program
for either the main steam valve building or the containment, does not impact the design basis accident radiological
consequence calculations, does not negatively impact fluid transient evaluations, has a negligible impact on the
long term cooling capacity of the steam generators, and does not change pipe rupture mechanistic effects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, the proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously
analyzed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The increase in the MSIV stroke time from 5 seconds to 10 seconds has no adverse impact on the FSAR analyses for the feedwater
line break and the main steam line break. The applicable acceptance criteria (e.g., DNBR and pressure) for both 3-loop
and 4-loop operation continue to be met with an increase in the MSIV closure time from 5 to 10 seconds. No other accident
analyses discussed in Chapter 15 of the FSAR are affected by the proposed increase in the MSIV closure time. Additionally,
the proposed change does not impact the consequences of an accident previously analyzed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, there is no significant reduction in the margin of safety.

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 15 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 15-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period, such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
15-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission
take this action, it will publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a notice of issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur very infrequently.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By October 19, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the Learning Resource Center, Three Rivers Community-Technical
College, Thames Valley Campus, 574 New London Turnpike, Norwich Connecticut 06360. If a request for a hearing or petition
for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated
by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or
petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an
appropriate order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspects(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not later then 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in providing
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave

<DOCTITLE>Sequoyah Nuclear Plant Units 1 and 2; Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed
no Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of amendments to Facility Operating
License Nos. DPR&hyph;77 and DPR&hyph;79 issued to the Tennessee Valley Authority (the licensee) for operation
of the Sequoyah Nuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2, located in Soddy Daisy, Tennessee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendments, submitted by the licensee's letter dated September 8, 1994, would incorporate a clarification
to separate the portion of the steam generator tubing from the end of the tube up to the start of the tube-to-tubesheet
weld from the remainder of the tube for the purposes of sample selection and repair when defects are found in this section
of a steam generator tube.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the
proposed amendments would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee
has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
TVA has evaluated the proposed technical specification (TS) change and has determined that it does not represent
a significant hazards consideration based on criteria established in 10 CFR 50.92(c). Operation of Sequoyah Nuclear
Plant (SQN) in accordance with the proposed amendment will not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This change will clarify the requirements for indications found in the region of the steam generator (S/G) tube, which
protrudes below the tubesheet. This region of the tube does not affect the structural integrity of the reactor coolant
system (RCS) pressure boundary, since it is not part of the pressure boundary. This revision will exempt this portion
of the tube from being considered under the result and action required sections of Table 4.4&hyph;2 in SQN's TS. Therefore,
indications in this region will not require repairs and will not be used for the purpose of expanding the sample of tubes
to be inspected under the requirements of the TS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The condition described in this evaluation results in tube integrity considerations commensurate with Regulatory
Guide 1.121 criteria both analytically and empirically. If the indications are hypothetically considered as cracks,
the Row 1 tube end indications neither adversely affect S/G tube integrity or any other component, nor does the presence
of the indications alter the function of the S/G or any other component. Continuing the hypothetical scenario, even
if the crack propagated beyond the weld, the only consequence of an accident that could be caused by plant operation
or by the occurrence of a faulted condition event with the tube end indications, would be negligible leakage from the
primary to secondary system. Such leakage is expected to be insignificant at both normal and faulted conditions.
Therefore, plant operation with the tube end indications present in the Row 1 tubes does not increase the probability
of an analyzed accident such as a S/G tube rupture event,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any hypothetical accident as a result of plant operation with the Row 1 tube end indications would be bounded by the
consequences of a postulated S/G tube rupture. Therefore, this change does not create the possibility of a new or different
kind of accident from any previously analyzed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The locations of the axial indications observed are below the tube-to-tubesheet weld. Consequently, it is concluded
that the axial indications do not affect the structural and leakage integrity of the primary pressure boundary. Should
the indications be single or multiple axial cracks on the tube ends, the effect of crack propagation was evaluated.
Tube burst is precluded for cracks within the tubesheet by the constraint provided by the tubesheet. Therefore, crack
lengths do not need to be limited by burst considerations and operating leakage limits are not required to detect crack
lengths associated with the tube burst. However, primary to secondary leakage must be shown to remain within acceptable
limits during all plant conditions. Leak-rate testing shows that such leakage would be negligible during all plant
conditions. Since the pressure boundary integrity, acceptable leak rate, and function of the S/G are not affected
by the presence of the tube end indications, the margin of safety is not reduced.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would during the notice
period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the
Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day notice period, provided that its final
determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. The final determination will
consider all public and State comments required. Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By October 19, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the Chattanooga-Hamilton County Library, 1101 Broad Street,
Chattanooga, Tennessee 37402. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date,
the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order. As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition
for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularly the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding, and how
that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition should specifically explain the reasons
why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's
right under the Act to be made party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial,
or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of any order which may be entered in the proceeding
on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the
proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or
who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the
first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfy the specificity
requirements described above. Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding,
a petitioner shall file a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which
are sought to be litigated in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or
fact to be raised or controverted. In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the
contention and a concise statement of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which
the petitioner intends to rely in proving the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references
to those specific sources and documents of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely
to establish those facts or expert opinion. Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine
dispute exists with the applicant on a material issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within
the scope of the amendment under consideration. The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner
to relief. A petitioner who fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least
one contention will not be permitted to participate as a party.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held.

In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange has determined to increase the fees associated with applications for membership to more accurately
reflect the costs associated with the processing of applications and to place them more in line with the fees existing
on other markets. The increases apply to the initial application fee as well as the fee to exercise a Chicago Board Options
Exchange (``CBOE'') membership. The exercise process is part of the agreement for access between the two markets.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 Additionally, intra-firm transfers of individuals assigned to a membership are being raised to reflect the cost
of processing the transfers.

Pursuant to an agreement signed in November 1986, a CBOE member may be eligible to become a proprietary member of the
CSE without having to purchase and own a certificate of proprietary membership (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 a seat on the Exchange), provided that the CBOE member meets all of the other requirements of eligibility set forth
in the CSE's By-Laws. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->

2. Statutory Basis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the objectives of Section
6(b)(5) in particular in that it is not designed to permit unfair discrimination between customers, issuers, brokers
or dealers, and in general is designed to protect investors and the public interest.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The CSE does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any inappropriate burden on competition.

The NASD proposes to amend the Interpretation to require members or persons associated with members, to annotate
the affirmative determination made prior to effecting a short sale. The affirmative determination requirement
already appears in the Interpretation and requires, among other things, that members or associated persons assure
that the securities involved in a sale will be available by settlement date. For long sales, the affirmative determination
is required to be noted on the order ticket at the time the order is placed. The Interpretation as it currently reads,
however, does not require that such determination be evidenced in any specific manner with respect to short sales.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Interpretation as amended, members or associated persons will be required to annotate, on the trade ticket
or on some other record maintained for that purpose by the member, the following information in order to comply with
the affirmative determination requirement for short sales:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Where a customer assures delivery, the member or associated person must annotate that conversation noting the
present location of the securities; whether the securities are in good deliverable form; and whether the securities
will be delivered to the firm within time for settlement; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Where the member or associated person locates the stock, an annotation must be made that identifies not only the
number of shares needed to cover the short sale but also the individual and firm contacted that offered assurance that
the shares would be delivered or were available for borrowing by settlement date.

Pursuant to Rule 440C, The New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'') also requires NYSE members to make affirmative determinations
prior to effecting short sales and to annotate such determinations. NYSE Information Memo 91&hyph;41 (October 18,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its proposed amendment to the Interpretation, the NASD has not specified the manner in which a member or person associated
with a member must annotate compliance with the affirmative determination requirement applicable to short sales.
It is clear, however, that the affirmative determination requirement contained in the amendment to the Interpretation
applies to each and every transaction; a ``blanket'' or standing assurance that securities are available for borrowing
is not acceptable to satisfy the requirement as is evidenced by the duty to annotate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice of the proposed rule change, as amended, together with its terms of substance was provided by issuance of a Commission

As the NASD indicated in its filing, requiring annotations will enhance member compliance with the affirmative determination
requirement already imposed by the Interpretation and will enable the NASD to examine member compliance with the
rule more effectively. The NASD also noted that the amendment will make clear the NASD's longstanding policy that
firms may not rely on daily facsimile sheets of ``borrowable stocks'' to satisfy their obligations under the Interpretation.
The addition of the annotation requirement will preclude this practice as members or their associated persons will
have to annotate the name of the person contacted, the name of the firm contacted and the number of shares for each short
sale.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has determined to approve the NASD's proposal. The Commission finds that the rule change is consistent
with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to the NASD, including the requirements
of Section 15A(b)(6) of the Act.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 Section 15A(b)(6) requires that the rules of a national securities association be designed to prevent fraudulent
and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and
coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to,
and facilitating transactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open
market and a national market system, and in general to protect investors and the public interest. The proposal will
enable the NASD to more effectively enforce an already existing provision of the Prompt Receipt and Delivery Interpretation
requiring members of their associated persons to affirmatively determine that shares relating to a short sale are
available for delivery to a purchaser.

Requiring annotation of affirmative determinations will also enhance the NASD's ability to examine for member compliance
with various other NASD short sale rules including those found in Article III, Section 21 of the Rules of Fair Practice
(record keeping)
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 and in the Uniform Practice Code, Section 71 (mandatory close-outs).
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 Further, the annotation requirement will assist the NASD in examining for member compliance with the short sale rule
or ``bid test,'' recently granted temporary 18 month approval by the SEC.

Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder,
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') a proposed rule change to list and
trade Market Index Target-Term Securities (``MITTS''),
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 the return on which is based upon a portfolio of securities (``REIT Portfolio'') of U.S. real estate investment trusts
(``REITs''). Notice of the proposal appeared in the

In Amendment No. 1, the Exchange proposes to: (1) Provide that dividends paid on a component security will be included
in calculating both the daily values of the REIT Portfolio and the Total Return Portfolio Value (as defined herein),
regardless of any subsequent corporate event (such as insolvency) that would effect the value of the common stock
of that component REIT; and (2) amend the formula for determining the weightings of the portfolio components in the
Original Portfolio Value (as defined herein) to provide that no component may represent more than 10 percent of the
Original Portfolio Value. See Letter from James Buck, Senior Vice President and Secretary, NYSE, to Sharon Lawson,
Assistant Director, Office of Market Supervision, Division of Market Regulation, Commission, dated August 25,
1994 (``Amendment No. 1'').

II. Description of the Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Section 703.19 of the Exchange's Listed Company Manual (``Manual''), the NYSE may approve for listing securities
which can not be readily categorized under the listing criteria for common and preferred stocks, bonds, debentures,
and warrants.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 The NYSE is now proposing under Section 703.19 of the Manual to list for trading MITTS based on the REIT Portfolio (``REIT
Portfolio MITTS'').

The Commission has previously approved the listing and trading on the Exchange of a MITTS based upon a global portfolio
of securities representing telecommunications companies and one based on a portfolio of securities representing
European companies. See Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 32840 (September 2, 1993), 58 FR 47485 (September 9,
1993), and 33368 (December 22, 1993), 58 FR 68975 (December 29, 1993)) (collectively, ``MITTS Approval Orders'').

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As with other MITTS products, the REIT Portfolio MITTS will conform to the listing guidelines under Section 703.19
of the Manual, which provides that: (1) Issues must have a minimum public distribution of one million securities;
(2) a minimum of 400 shareholders; (3) a minimum duration of one year; (4) a market value of at least $4 million; and (5)
otherwise comply with the NYSE's initial listing criteria.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 In addition, the Exchange will monitor the REIT Portfolio MITTS to verify compliance with the Exchange's continued
listing criteria.
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 MITTS are non-callable senior hybrid debt securities of Merrill Lynch that provide for a single payment at maturity,
and will bear no periodic payments of interest. At maturity, holders of REIT Portfolio MITTS will be entitled to receive
an amount in cash based upon the ``Total Return Portfolio Value;'' provided, however, that the amount payable at maturity
will not be less than $9 for each $10 principal amount of the REIT Portfolio MITTS. The ``Total Return Portfolio Value''
will be an amount based upon the change in the ``Original Portfolio Value'' and the value of the REIT Portfolio at maturity,
plus the aggregate dollar amount of dividends paid on the components of the REIT Portfolio during the term of the REIT
Portfolio MITTS. The ``Original Portfolio Value'' will equal $10, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the value of the REIT Portfolio on the date the REIT Portfolio MITTS are priced by the issuer for initial offering to
the public. The value of the REIT Portfolio at maturity will be based on the average of the closing prices of the components
of the REIT Portfolio for a specified number of days immediately prior to the maturity date of the REIT Portfolio MITTS.
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 REIT Portfolio MITTS are cash-settled in that they do not give the holder any right to receive a portfolio security
or any other ownership right or interest in the portfolio securities, although the return on the investment is based,
in part, on the aggregate portfolio value of the REIT Portfolio securities.

The hybrid listing standards in Section 703.19 of the Manual are intended to accommodate listed companies in good
standing, their subsidiaries and affiliates, and non-listed equities which meet the Exchange's original listing
standards. Domestic issuers must also meet the earnings and net tangible assets criteria set forth in Sections 102.01
and 102.02 of the Manual. Specifically, the minimum original listing criteria requires that issuers have: (1) 2,000
holders holding 100 shares or more or have 2,200 holders with an average monthly trading volume of 100,000 shares;
(2) a public float of 1.1 million shares; (3) an aggregate public market value of $18 million or total net tangible assets
of $18 million; and (4) earnings before taxes of $2.5 million in the latest fiscal year and earnings before taxes of
$2 million in each of the preceding two fiscal years, or earnings before taxes of $6.5 million in the aggregate for the
last three fiscal years with a $4.5 million minimum in the most recent fiscal year (all three years are required to be
profitable).

The Continued listing criteria for capital or common stock requires that: (1) the number of holders of 100 shares or
more is equal to or greater than 1,200; (2) the number of publicly-held shares is equal to or greater than 600,000; (3)
the aggregate market value of publicly-held shares is equal to or greater than $5 million; (4) the aggregate market
value of shares outstanding (excluding treasury stock) is equal to or greater than $8 million and average net income
after taxes for the past three years is equal to or greater than $600,000; and (5) net tangible assets available to common
stock are equal to or greater than $8 million and average net income after taxes for the past three years is equal to or
greater than $600,000. In addition, the continued listing standards for bonds require that outstanding publicly-held
bonds have an aggregate market value or principal amount equal to or greater than $1 million. See Section 802 of the
Manual.

In particular, the Total Return Portfolio Value will be based on the average closing prices of the REIT Portfolio component
securities for the first 45 NYSE trading days of the ``Calculation Period.'' The Calculation Period is defined as
the period from and including the 90th scheduled NYSE trading day prior to the maturity date to and including the fourth
scheduled NYSE trading date prior to the maturity date.

According to the NYSE, REIT Portfolio MITTS will allow investors to combine the protection of a portion of the principal
amount of the MITTS with potential additional payments based upon the performance of a portfolio of securities representing
20 highly capitalized REITs. In particular, the proposed REIT Portfolio MITTS will provide 90% principal protection
of the original issue price at maturity with the opportunity to participate in the dividend stream related to the REIT
Portfolio components plus any upside appreciation of the underlying REIT Portfolio. REIT Portfolio MITTS will mature
in August 2000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As of June 6, 1994, the REIT Portfolio consisted of the common stock of 20 REITs that have significantly different levels
of market capitalization, ranging from a high of approximately $2.3 billion (Simon Property Group, Inc.) to a low
of approximately $216 million (Excel Realty Trust, Inc.). Also as of June 6, 1994, the exchange market prices of the
components of the REIT Portfolio ranged from a high of $40.25 to a low of $11.25. The average daily trading volume for
the components of the REIT Portfolio for the period from January 16, 1994, through July 14, 1994, ranged from a high
of approximately 145,318 shares to a low of approximately 22,030 shares.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The common stocks of 19 of the 20 component REITs are listed on the Exchange and the common stock of the other component
REIT is traded on the American Stock Exchange (``Amex''). The initial weightings of the components of the REIT Portfolio
will be based upon each stock's relative liquidity (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, relative trading volume in dollars) in the Untied States; provided, however, that no component may represent more
than 10% of the Original Portfolio Value.

<FOOTNAME>

11
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
See Amendment No. 1, supra note 5. For purposes of this calculation, the weight of any component that would otherwise
exceed 10% of the Original Portfolio Value will be reduced to 10%. The remainder of the Original Portfolio Value will
then be allocated among the remaining components of the REIT Portfolio based on relative liquidity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To determine relative liquidity, Merrill Lynch will compare the average daily consolidated dollar volume of a stock
over the 90-day period immediately preceding the date on which the REIT Portfolio MITTS are priced for issuance to
the average daily consolidated dollar volume for all of the stocks in the REIT Portfolio for that 90-day period. As
of June 6, 1994, the highest weighting for any stock in the REIT Portfolio was 10.00%
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 and the weighting for the five components with the highest relative liquidity was 42.50%. Also as of that date, the
lowest weighting for any stock in the REIT Portfolio was 1.58% and the weighting for the five components with the lowest
relative liquidity was 10.24%. For the six-month period from January 16, 1994, through July 14, 1994, the average
dollar daily trading volume of the components ranged from a high of $2,468,375 (Simon Property Group, Inc.) to a low
of $345,618 (Western Investment Real Estate Trust).

Except for certain multiplier adjustments discussed below, once the initial weightings have been determined, the
multipliers will remain constant throughout the term of the REIT Portfolio MITTS. The value of the REIT Portfolio
MITTS at any point in time will equal the aggregate for the components of the price of each component times the multiplier
for that component plus the cumulative dividends paid on each component since the issue date for the REIT Portfolio
MITTS. The multipliers assigned to the component REITs will be adjusted for certain events such as stock splits, reverse
stock splits, or stock dividends, and the value of the common stock of the component REITs will also be adjusted for
certain events including a liquidation, bankruptcy, insolvency, merger, or consolidation involving the issuer
of the underlying shares. For example, if the issuer of the shares underlying a component REIT has been subject to a
merger or a consolidation and is not the surviving entity, then the value for such common stock will be determined at
the time such issuer is merged or consolidated and will equal the last available exchange market price for such common
stock plus the cumulative dividends paid on that stock from the date of issuance of the REIT Portfolio MITTS through
that date.
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 That value will then be constant for the remaining term of the REIT Portfolio MITTS. In addition, no adjustments of
any multiplier of a portfolio security will be made unless such adjustment would require a change of at least 1% in the
multiplier then in effect.

If the issuer of a portfolio security is in the process of liquidation or subject to a bankruptcy proceeding, insolvency,
or other similar adjudication, such security will continue to be included in the REIT Portfolio so long as an exchange
market price for such security is available. If an exchange market price is no longer available for a portfolio security,
including, but not limited to, liquidation, bankruptcy, insolvency, or any other similar proceeding, then the value
of that portfolio security used in calculating both the daily value of the REIT Portfolio and the Total Return Portfolio
Value, will be equal to the cumulative dividends paid on that stock from the date of issuance of the REIT Portfolio MITTS
through that date.
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>

Like the other MITTS products that are listed on the NYSE, REIT Portfolio MITTS may not be redeemed prior to maturity
and are not callable by the issuer. Holders of REIT Portfolio MITTS will be able to cash-out of their investment by selling
the security on the NYSE. The Exchange anticipates that the trading value of the security in this secondary trading
market will depend in large part on the value of the securities comprising the REIT Portfolio and also on such other
factors as the level of interest rates, the volatility of the value of the REIT Portfolio, the time remaining to maturity,
dividend rates, and the creditworthiness of the issuer, Merrill Lynch.

Because REIT Portfolio MITTS are linked to a portfolio of equity securities, the NYSE's existing equity floor trading
rules will apply to the trading of REIT Portfolio MITTS. First, pursuant to NYSE Rule 405, the Exchange will impose
a duty of due diligence on its members and member firms to learn the essential facts relating to every customer prior
to trading REIT Portfolio MITTS.
<FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>
 Second, consistent with NYSE Rule 405, the Exchange will further require that a member or member firm specifically
approve a customer's account for trading REIT Portfolio MITTS prior to, or promptly after, the completion of the transaction.
Third, REIT Portfolio MITTS will be subject to the equity margin rules of the Exchange. Fourth, in accordance with
the NYSE's Hybrid Approval Orders, the Exchange will, prior to trading REIT Portfolio MITTS, distribute a circular
to the membership providing guidance with regard to member firm compliance responsibilities (including suitability
recommendations) when handling transactions in REIT Portfolio MITTS and highlighting the special risks and characteristics
of the REIT Portfolio MITTS.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section
6(b)(5). Specifically, the Commission believes that providing for exchange-trading of REIT Portfolio MITTS will
offer a new and innovative means of participating in the market for REITs. In particular, the Commission believes
that REIT Portfolio MITTS will permit investors to gain equity exposure to REITs, while at the same time, limiting
the downside risk of the original investment. For the reasons discussed in the MITTS Approval Orders, the Commission
finds that the listing and trading of REIT Portfolio MITTS is in the public interest.

As with the other MITTS products approved by the Commission, REIT Portfolio MITTS are not leveraged instruments;
however, their price will still be derived and based upon the underlying linked securities. Accordingly, the level
of risk involved in the purchase or sale of REIT Portfolio MITTS is similar to the risk involved in the purchase or sale
of traditional common stock. Nonetheless, as with the other MITTS products, the Commission has several specific
concerns regarding the trading of this type of product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission notes that the Exchange's rules and procedures that address the special concerns attendant to the
trading of hybrid securities will be applicable to REIT Portfolio MITTS. In particular, by imposing the hybrid listing
standards, suitability, disclosure, and compliance requirements noted above, the Commission believes the Exchange
has addressed adequately the potential problems that could arise from the hybrid nature of REIT Portfolio MITTS.
Moreover, the Exchange will distribute a circular to its membership calling attention to the specific risks associated
with REIT Portfolio MITTS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission realized that REIT Portfolio MITTS are dependent upon the individual credit of the issuer, Merrill
Lynch. To some extent this credit risk is minimized by the Exchange's continued listing standards which require issuers
to maintain an aggregate market value of $5 million for its publicly-held shares.
<FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>
 In addition, the Exchange's hybrid listing standards further require that REIT Portfolio MITTS have at least $4 million
in market value. In any event, financial information regarding Merrill Lynch, in addition to the information regarding
Merrill Lynch, in addition to the information on the issuers of the underlying securities comprising the REIT Portfolio,
will be publicly available.

The Commission also has a systemic concern, however, that a broker-dealer, such as Merrill Lynch, or a subsidiary
providing a hedge for the issuer will incur position exposure. As discussed in the MITTS Approval Orders, the Commission
believes this concern is minimal given the size of REIT Portfolio MITTS issuance in relation to the net worth of Merrill
Lynch.

The Commission believes that the listing and trading of REIT Portfolio MITTS should not unduly impact the market for
the individual securities contained in the REIT Portfolio. First, as discussed above, the components of the REIT
Portfolio are highly capitalized, liquid stocks. Second, as discussed above, because of the restriction that no
component may account for more than 10% of the initial weight of the REIT Portfolio, no single component or group of
components dominates the REIT Portfolio. Third, the issuers of the securities contained in the REIT Portfolio are
subject to reporting requirements under the Act, and all of the portfolio securities are listed and traded on U.S.
securities exchanges. Finally, the Intermarket Surveillance Group Agreement, dated July 14, 1983, as amended on
January 29, 1990, will be applicable to the trading of REIT Portfolio MITTS and of the underlying component securities.
<FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>
 This, in addition to the NYSE's surveillance procedures, will serve to deter as well as detect any potential manipulation.

Amex; the Boston Stock Exchange, Inc.; the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc.; the Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc.;
the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.; the NYSE; the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc.; and the Philadelphia

options, and the underlying stock and the need for greater sharing of surveillance information for these potential
intermarket trading abuses, the major stock index futures exchanges (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day
after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in order to allow the Exchange to list without delay REIT Portfolio MITTS as described herein. Specifically, in Amendment
No. 1 to the proposal, the Exchange proposes to provide that all dividends paid on any component REIT after the date
of issuance of the REIT Portfolio MITTS and prior to a corporate event which would effect the value of that component
security shall be used in calculating both the daily values of the REIT Portfolio and the Total Return Portfolio Value.
The Commission believes this is appropriate because it is consistent with the risks involved in the direct ownership
of the individual component securities, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the owner of a security generally will not be required to return dividends paid by the issuer prior to the insolvency
of the issuer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange also proposes a modified weighting system in Amendment No. 1 whereby no component of the REIT Portfolio
may account for more than 10% of the Original Portfolio Value. The effect of the weighting method in this case is merely
to reduce the weight of one component from 10.22% to 10.00% and to raise the initial weights of the remaining components
only marginally.
<FOOTCITE>25</FOOTCITE>
 Additionally, for the full six-year term of the MITTS, the weights of the component REITS may move freely above the
10% level based on subsequent price changes among the components. As a result, the Commission believes that this weighting
method has an immaterial effect on the valuation of the REIT Portfolio during the term of the MITTS and on the amount
that holders of the REIT Portfolio MITTS will ultimately receive upon maturity of the MITTS.

Applicant's Representations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Company was a savings and loan holding company whose primary asset and source of income was the United Savings
Association of Texas (``USAT''). As a result of the recession in Texas beginning in 1986, USAT's financial condition
deteriorated, and on December 30, 1988 it was placed into receivership. The assets of USAT were sold to an unaffiliated
third party and the Company received no consideration for the loss of its primary subsidiary, thereby generating
a substantial tax loss. In light of this tax loss, the Company determined not to liquidate, but instead to acquire an
operating business.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Company's efforts to acquire an operating business have been substantially hindered due to claims asserted
against it by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (the ``FSLIC'') and its successor, the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (the ``FDIC''), which term as used herein includes the FSLIC. The FDIC asserted an approximately
$534 million claim against the Company in January 1989 for failure to maintain the net worth of USAT (the ``Net Worth
Claim'') and an approximately $14 million claim concerning certain tax refunds alleged to have been received by the
Company (together with the Net Worth Claim, the ``FDIC Claims''). In addition, the FDIC has asserted the existence
of possible other claims (the ``Indemnified Claims'') against the Company and certain former officers and directors
of the Company and USAT. The Company may have indemnification obligations to these former officers and directors.
The FDIC has not alleged a dollar amount for any Indemnified Claims. Although the Company disputes the FDIC Claims
and the Indemnified Claims, their existence constitutes a large contingent liability against the Company's assets,
thus making it difficult for the Company to acquire an operating business.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. During 1989 and 1990, the Company was in continuous negotiations with the FDIC in an attempt to reach a resolution
of the FDIC Claims and in early 1990 the Company reached a tentative agreement. However, in December 1990 the FDIC rejected
the Company's settlement offer and informed the Company that no counter proposal would be offered. In mid-1991, the
Company again contacted the FDIC to determine whether a settlement could be reached on the FDIC Claims. Beginning
in July 1991, the Company and the FDIC's representatives again began negotiations and in August 1991, the Company
offered a proposed settlement. Although the FDIC has not responded to the Company's settlement proposal, in December
1991 the FDIC requested, and the Company provided, an agreement to toll the statute of limitations for the period expiring
July 31, 1992. This would give the FDIC adequate time to review any possible claims against the Company that might reflect
on a global settlement. This tolling agreement was subsequently extended eleven times, initially through September
30, 1992, then eventually through December 30, 1994. During this tolling period, the Company has engaged in continuous
discussions with the FDIC staff and as part of that process has furnished the FDIC with documents and financial records
for their review.

4. On June 30, 1994, the Company held assets of approximately $11.94 million, comprised of approximately $.27 million
in cash and cash equivalents, $9.92 million in short-term investments, $1.23 million in loans and notes receivable,
and $.52 million in other assets. The Company's common stock currently is traded sporadically in the over-the-counter
market. The Company does not employ any full-time employees. The Company's administrative operations are handled
by contract bookkeepers, accountants, and attorneys.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Rule 3a&hyph;2 under the Act provides a one-year safe harbor to issuers that meet the definition of an investment
company but intend to maintain that status only transiently. The Company relied on the safe harbor provided by this
rule from December 30, 1988 until December 30, 1989. The expiration of the safe harbor period necessitated the filing
of an application for exemption. In 1990, the Company was granted conditional relief from all provisions of the Act
until December 30, 1990 (the ``1990 Order''). The SEC extended this exemptive relief by four subsequent orders, most
recently until December 30, 1994.

6. As described in detail in the applications for the Prior Orders, during a portion of the period in which the requested
exemption will be effective, it is possible that the Company will be subject to the jurisdiction of the federal bankruptcy
courts. In this regard, the Company has formulated a plan of reorganization (the ``Reorganization Plan'') to be implemented
under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code once the FDIC approves a settlement of the FDIC Claims. The Reorganization
Plan would settle the outstanding claims against the Company and provide a structure for the possible acquisition
of a new operating business or businesses. Because the bankruptcy court is charged with protecting the interests
of the Company's creditors and equity interest holders, the Company believes that it is not necessary for it to comply
with section 17(a) or section 17(d) with respect to transactions approved by the bankruptcy court.

Applicant's Legal Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Section 3(a)(3) of the Act defines an investment company as an issuer engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting,
owning, holding, or trading in securities, and owning investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value
of such issuers' total assets (exclusive of government securities and cash items). The Company acknowledges that,
based on its current mix of assets, it may be deemed to be an investment company under section 3(a)(3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Company requests, pursuant to sections 6(c) and 6(e) of the Act, that the SEC issue an order exempting the Company
from all provisions of the Act, subject to certain exceptions, until December 30, 1995. The requested order would
extend the exemption granted by the Prior Orders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. In determining whether to grant exemptive relief for a transient investment company, the SEC considers such factors
as: (a) Whether the failure of the company to become primarily engaged in a non-investment business or excepted business
or liquidate within one year was due to factors beyond its control; (b) whether the company's officers and employees
during that period tried, in good faith, to effect the company's investment of its assets in a non-investment business
or excepted business or to cause the liquidation of the company; and (c) whether the company invested in securities
solely to preserve the value of its assets. The Company asserts that it meets these criteria.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
4. The Company asserts that its failure to become primarily engaged in a non-investment business by December 30, 1994
is a result of factors beyond its control. The existence of the FDIC Claims has precluded the Company from investing
its assets in a non-investment company business. Although the Company's executive officers reviewed numerous possible
asset or business acquisitions, the magnitude of the FDIC Claims and the potential threat that the FDIC would seek
to enjoin any utilization of the Company's assets has prevented the Company from investing its assets in a non-investment
company business.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Pending the settlement of the FDIC Claims, the Company has limited its investments to high quality marketable securities,
cash or cash equivalents. Thus, the Company asserts that it primarily invests in securities solely to preserve the
value of its assets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Although the Company has made substantial efforts to formulate alternative methods by which it can acquire an operating
business and utilize its tax loss, the pending settlement negotiations of the FDIC Claims make it necessary for the
Company to seek relief extending the relief granted by the Prior Orders. This would allow the Company to seek an FDIC
settlement and, if successful, to formulate and implement new plans for becoming an operating business and utilizing
the Tax Loss.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The Company believes that the issuance of an order exempting it from all provisions of the Act, subject to certain
exceptions, until December 30, 1995 would be in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors
and the purposes of the Act.

Applicant's Conditions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Company agrees that the requested exemption will be subject to the following conditions, each of which will apply

company:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. During the period of time the Company is exempted from registration under the Act, it will not purchase or otherwise
acquire any securities other than securities with a remaining maturity of 397 days or less and that are rated in one
of the two highest rating categories by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization, as that term is
defined in rule 2a-7(a)(10) under the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Company will continue to comply with section 9, 17(e) and 36 of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Company will continue to comply with sections 17(a) and17(d), subject to the following exceptions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

17(a) or section 17(d) with respect to any transaction, including without limitation the Reorganization Plan, that
is approved by the bankruptcy court; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) the Company would not be required to comply with section 17(a) or section 17(d) with respect to any transaction
or series of transactions that result in its ceasing to fall within the definition of an ``investment company'' provided
that (i) no cash payments are made to an ``affiliated person'' (as defined in the Act) of the Company as part of such transaction
or series of transactions, and (ii) no debt securities are issued to an affiliated person of the Company as part of such
transaction or series of transactions unless such debt securities are expressly subordinated upon liquidation
to claim of the holders of the Company's 9% Debentures.

 notice of June 30, 1994 announced that the October 6 DTAG meeting would be an open meeting. After setting the agenda,
State Department officials and the DTAG officers found it necessary to close the afternoon portions of the meeting.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The open session, which will be made up of all sessions preceding the lunch break, will include speakers from the Bureau
of Political-Military Affairs and reports on DTAG Working Group progress, accomplishments, and future projects.
Members of the public may attend the open session as seating capacity allows, and will be permitted to participate
in the discussion in accordance with the Chairman's instructions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As access to the Department of State is controlled, persons wishing to attend the meeting must notify the DTAG Executive
Secretariat by Friday, September 30, 1994. Each person should provide his or her name, company or organizational
affiliation, date of birth, and social security number to the DTAG Secretariat at telephone number (202) 647&hyph;4231
of fax number (202) 647&hyph;4232 (Attention: Eva Chesteen). Attendees must carry a valid photo ID with them. They
should enter the building through the C-Street diplomatic entrance (21st and C Streets, NW.), where Department personnel
will direct them to the Loy Henderson auditorium.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following the open portion of the meeting, briefings which the Department of State will arrange for DTAG members will
involve discussions of classified information pursuant to Executive Order 12356. The disclosure of classified
and/or proprietary information essential to formulating U.S. defense trade policies would substantially undermine
U.S. defense trade relations with foreign competitors. Therefore, these segments of the meeting will be closed to
the public, pursuant to section 10(d) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), 5 U.S.C. 552b(c)(1) and 5 U.S.C.
552b(c)(9)(B).

The IMO Subcommittees work to develop international agreements, guidelines, and standards for the marine industry.
In most cases, these international agreements, guidelines, and standards form the basis for national standards/regulations
and class society rules. The U.S. Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) Working Group supports the U.S. Representative to the
IMO Subcommittee in developing the U.S. position on those issues raised at the IMO Subcommittee meetings. Because
of the impact on domestic regulations through development of these international guidelines, standards, and regulations,
the U.S. SOLAS Working Group serves as an excellent forum for the U.S. maritime industry to express their ideas. All
shipping companies, shipyards, design firms, naval architects, marine engineers, and consultants are encouraged
to send representatives to participate in the development of U.S. positions on those issues affecting your maritime
industry and remain abreast of all activities ongoing within the IMO.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In 1986, this agency granted BMW of North America, Inc.'s (BMW) petition for exemption from the parts marking requirements
of the vehicle theft prevention standard for the BMW 7 Car line. This notice grants BMW's petition for a modification
of the previously approved antitheft device. The agency grants this petition because it has determined, based on
substantial evidence, that the modified antitheft device described in BMW's petition to be placed on the car line
as standard equipment, is likely to be as effective in reducing and deterring motor vehicle theft as compliance with
parts marking requirements.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In October 1986, NHTSA published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 a notice granting the petition from BMW of North America, Inc. (BMW) for an exemption from the parts marking requirements
of the vehicle theft prevention standard for the model year (MY) 1988 BMW 7 Car line. (See 51 FR 36333, October 9, 1986).
The agency determined that the antitheft device which BMW intended to install on the 7 Car line as standard equipment
is likely to be as effective in reducing and deterring motor vehicle theft as would compliance with the parts marking
requirements of the theft prevention standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 17, 1994, BMW submitted a letter to the agency stating that the MY 1995 7 Car line would include modifications
to the antitheft system that is installed as standard equipment. In a letter dated August 12, 1994, the agency informed
BMW that the modification to the antitheft system on the 7 Car line appeared to be subject to NHTSA approval pursuant
to 49 CFR section 543.9, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Terminating or modifying an exemption. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency had determined that the changes to the previously approved antitheft system were not 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
based on BMW's discussions of proposed changes to radio and glove box monitoring, and the addition of a glass breakage
sensor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 26, 1994, BMW submitted its petition for modification. The petition incorporated by reference certain
information, dated May 29, 1986, that BMW already provided to NHTSA in its petition for exemption for the MY 1988 7 Car
line. Together, the above information submitted by BMW constitutes a complete petition, as required by 49 CFR section
543.9(d), in that it meets the general requirements contained in section 543.5 and the specific content requirements
of section 543.6.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its petition for MY 1988, BMW included a detailed description of the identity, design and location of the components
of the antitheft device, including diagrams of components and their location in the vehicle. BMW stated that the system
consists of three lines of defense designed to prevent entry, disable the car, and scare away potential thieves. BMW
described the antitheft device that was installed as standard equipment as passively activated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BMW stated that, for MY 1995, the antitheft system will be modified in three ways:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A remote control device will be added. BMW describes the remote control device as ``an integral component within
the vehicle key,'' used to lock/unlock the door(s) and actuate the alarm system. BMW stated that the remote control
device is identical to that provided for the antitheft device on the BMW 8 Car line. In a letter to BMW dated October 4,
1993, NHTSA determined that the addition of the remote on the 8 Car line is a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
change to the antitheft device.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Monitoring circuits for the radio and glove box are removed. In their place, the antitheft device will monitor
glass breakage. As under the original exemption, the antitheft device monitors door opening. BMW asserts that the
combination of the door and glass monitoring make the occupant compartment impenetrable. If the glass is broken in
order to unlock and open a door, the device sounds. Likewise, if a door is opened by a means other than breaking the glass,
e.g., through the use of a slim jim, the device sounds when a door is opened.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The alarm siren's decibel level is raised from 104 decibels to 112 decibels.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BMW stated that, for MY 1995, the antitheft device features a comprehensive security alarm system and an ignition/fuel
system disabling device that is activated by locking the door (either driver or passenger) with the metal key. The
key can be turned in the front door locks in three positions: off; 45 degrees; and 90 degrees. If the driver holds the
key a little past the 90 degree position, any open windows and the sunroof close. When the key is turned 45 degrees and
removed, the doors, trunk, and fuel filler door are locked and the alarm system is armed. Additionally, when the key
is removed from the driver's or passenger's door lock after having been turned 45 degrees, the ignition and fuel injection
systems are deactivated, immobilizing the car.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When the key is turned 90 degrees and removed, the car's alarm is armed and the doors are ``double locked.'' The alarm
monitors the doors, hood, trunk, side window glazing and ignition switch. If the key is not first turned in the driver's
or passenger's door lock, the alarm will sound if someone tampers with the doors, hood, or trunk, or turns the ignition
switch. When this happens, the horn will sound, and the hazard warning lamps and high beam headlights will flash.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After 30 seconds, the alarm will automatically shut off and then rearm itself within 5 seconds. The alarm system has
its own separate fuse, so removal of any of the fuses in the fuse box of the engine compartment will not disarm the system.
The hood has an inside lock release located underneath the dashboard, and is also tied into the alarm system. BMW stated
that the electronic control unit for the system is hidden within the vehicle. Cutting, disconnecting, or manipulating
system wiring will trigger the alarm. Therefore, if a thief did manage to penetrate to the battery circuit and interrupt
it, the alarm systems' memory will trigger the alarm when the circuit is again completed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The steering/ignition lock is hardened against the grip of a screw, and the housing is reinforced to prevent removal
of the lock. When the key is removed, the steering lock has a mechanism that causes the lock to instantly engage, preventing
steering wheel movement without any additional action. BMW states that the steering lock cannot be broken by forcing
the steering wheel because a clutch in the steering drive is designed to slip long before torque sufficient to break
the lock can be administered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BMW states that the inside locking mechanism operates by means of a vertical plunger on each door, and that the plunger
on the driver's door overrides the other plunger. In the event of an accident, an inertia switch will unlock all doors.
The same key operates door locks and the ignition/steering lock, and can be inserted in a keyhole in either direction.
To prevent locking the keys in the car upon exiting, the driver's door can only be locked with a key after it is closed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BMW describes the key for the 7 Car line as being unique in that it has the equivalent of four rows of teeth. BMW asserts
that the unique design makes the locks almost impossible to pick and the keys impossible to duplicate on the open market.
Special key blanks, key cutting machines, and codes will be closely controlled and new keys will only be issued to authorized
persons. Additionally, the first gate in the door lock keyway is hardened to resist the grip of a screw to prevent use
of a slampuller.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BMW states that an LED warning lamp on the center console which is visible from outside of the vehicle informs the driver
of the arming status of the alarm/no-start systems. Upon return to the operator's vehicle, the warning lamp informs
the operator if a theft attempt has been made, or if a door, hood or trunk is not completely closed. It also indicates
if there are any problems with the system. Additionally, BMW states that the vehicle's diagnostic umbilical contains
extra circuits which, when plugged into the vehicle diagnostic machine at the dealership, identifies problems with
the antitheft system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a complementary feature to the passive system, the operator may manually arm another alarm system and deactivate
the vehicle's ignition/fuel systems so that a thief would not be able to start the engine and steal the vehicle. This
active system is armed by the driver keying in a 4-digit code into the computer built into the dashboard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BMW addressed the reliability and durability of its antitheft device by providing a list of American and international
standards for which the antitheft system has been tested and found in compliance. This list includes various environmental
tests and a Swedish regulation that requires door and ignition locks to be able to resist commonly available tools
for a minimum period of 5 minutes in attempted forced entries. BMW uses the proposed system's conformance to these
standards as support for the likely effectiveness of the system in reducing and deterring theft.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BMW noted that NHTSA's February 1986 Report to Congress indicates that the first year's theft rate for new introductions
are generally lower because the demand for replacement parts is relatively small. BMW believes that this finding
applies to its 7 Car line and that theft rates will generally be lower because of the limited total sales of these vehicles.
Additionally, BMW believes that most of this car line will be stolen for the value of the whole car, not its parts. BMW
stated that since parts marking seeks to deter thefts of automobiles for their parts, while antitheft devices deter
all thefts, BMW believes that its antitheft system ``should be considerably more effective'' in reducing and deterring
theft than parts marking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BMW compares its MY 1995 antitheft system to similar systems which have previously been granted exemptions by the
agency. It compared its proposed system to systems installed in the Saab 9000, Mazda 929, Infiniti M30, and Lexus LS.
BMW believes that its analysis reveals that its system is equivalent to, or has more extensive features than, all of
the compared systems previously granted an exemption by the agency. The agency believes that the BMW antitheft device
is comparable to the systems on the cited car lines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1983/84 median theft rate was 3.2712 thefts per thousand vehicles produced. (See 50 FR 46666, November 12, 1985).
Based on data from the FBI's National Crime Information Center, NHTSA's official source of theft data, BMW showed
that for MYs 1989 through 1992, the theft rates of the Saab 9000, Mazda 929, Infiniti M30, and Lexus LS fell mostly below
3.2712. For 1989, the Saab 9000 had a theft rate of 2.3691 (per thousand vehicles manufactured), and the Mazda 929 had
a theft rate of 3.3610. No theft data were available for the Infiniti M30 or Lexus LS for 1989. For 1990/91, the Saab 9000
had a theft rate of 0.5125, the Mazda 929 had a theft rate of 2.7178, the Infiniti M30 had a theft rate of 2.7496, and the
Lexus LS had a theft rate of 1.8977. For 1992, preliminary data show that the Saab 9000 had a theft rate of 0.4695, the
Mazda 929 had a theft rate of 2.6477, the Infiniti M30 had a theft rate of 2.7117, and the Lexus LS had a theft rate of 2.4390.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these reasons, BMW believes that the antitheft system proposed for installation on its 7 Car line is likely to be
as effective in reducing thefts as compliance with the parts marking requirements of part 541.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA believes that there is substantial evidence indicating that the modified antitheft system installed as standard
equipment on the MY 1995 BMW 7 Car line will likely be as effective in reducing and deterring motor vehicle theft as compliance
with the requirements of the theft prevention standard (49 CFR part 541). This determination is based on the information
that BMW submitted with its petition and on other available information. The agency believes that the modified device
will continue to provide the types of performance listed in section 543.6(a)(3): promoting activation; attracting
attention to unauthorized entries; preventing defeat or circumventing of the device by unauthorized persons; preventing
operation of the vehicle by unauthorized entrants; and ensuring the reliability and durability of the device.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 49 CFR section 543.6(a)(4), the agency also finds that BMW has provided adequate reasons for its belief
that the modified antitheft device will reduce and deter theft. This conclusion is based on the information BMW provided
on its device. This information included a description of reliability and functional tests conducted by BMW for the
antitheft device and its components. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
49 CFR section 543.9(h)(2)(ii) permits the agency to establish an effective date for the modification of the antitheft
device earlier than ``the model year following the model year in which NHTSA issued the modification decision'' upon
a showing of good cause by the manufacturer that an earlier effective date for modifying its exemption is consistent
with the public interest and purposes of 49 U.S.C. section 33106. In its petition, BMW stated that making the modification
of its antitheft system effective beginning with MY 1995 is in the public interest since it would permit expeditious
manufacture and sale of vehicles with the modified antitheft system as standard equipment. BMW stated the 1989 theft
data published by NHTSA in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (56 FR 7444, February 22, 1991) show that the BMW 7 Car line had a theft rate of 3.9505 per thousand vehicles stolen, somewhat
above the 1983/84 median theft rate of 3.2712. BMW stated its belief that the antitheft device proposed for the MY 1995
7 Car line, with improvements that enhance the effectiveness of the antitheft system, will lower the 7 Car line's theft
rate. NHTSA has reviewed this showing of ``good cause'' and finds that making the modification of BMW's petition effective
beginning with the 1995 model year is consistent with the public interest and 49 U.S.C. section 33106. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the foregoing reasons, the agency hereby exempts the BMW 7 Car line that is the subject of this notice, in whole,
from the requirements of 49 CFR part 541. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If, in the future, BMW decides not to use the exemption for the car line that is the subject of this notice, it should formally
notify the agency. If such a decision is made, the car line must be fully marked according to the requirements under
49 CFR section 541.5 and section 541.6 (marking of major component parts and replacement parts). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency notes that the limited and apparently conflicting data on the effectiveness of the pre-standard parts
marking programs continue to make it difficult to compare the effectiveness of an antitheft device with the effectiveness
of compliance with the theft prevention standard. The statute clearly invites such a comparison, which the agency
has made on the basis of the limited data available. With implementation of the requirements of the ``Anti Car Theft
Act of 1992,'' NHTSA anticipates more probative data upon which comparisons may be made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA notes that if BMW wishes in the future to modify the device on which this exemption is based, the company may have
to submit a petition to modify the exemption. Part 543.7(d) states that a Part 543 exemption applies only to vehicles
that belong to a line exempted under this part and equipped with the antitheft device on which the line's exemption
is based. Further, section 543.9(c)(2) provides for the submission of petitions ``(t)o modify an exemption to permit
the use of an antitheft device similar to but differing from the one specified in that exemption.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency wishes to minimize the administrative burden which section 543.9(c)(2) could place on exempted vehicle
manufacturers and itself. The agency did not intend in drafting Part 543 to require the submission of a modification
petition for every change to the components or design of an antitheft device. The significance of many such changes
could be 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Therefore, NHTSA suggests that if the manufacturer contemplates making any changes the effects of which might be
characterized as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 it should consult the agency before preparing and submitting a petition to modify.

1. The United States has a long-standing commitment to the achievement of ``universal service''_widespread availability
of ``basic'' telephone service at affordable rates. First articulated in the early twentieth century,2 universal
service has since been adopted by Federal and State regulators as one of the core objectives of U.S. telecommunications
policy. For example, it was incorporated in general terms in Section 1 of the Communications Act of 1934.3 More importantly,
many of the major regulatory reforms that have been considered over the past several decades_most notably decisions
concerning whether and under what conditions to allow competition in telecommunications service and equipment
markets_have been evaluated, at least in part, in terms of their possible impact on universal service.

2The concept was first articulated by Theodore Vail, President of AT&amp;T, in 1907, although his concept of universal
service was quite distinct from modern notions of what that term means.

3Section 1 authorizes the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) to regulate interstate and foreign communications
``so as to make available, so far as possible, to all the people of the United States a rapid, efficient, Nation-wide,
and world-wide wire and radio communication service with adequate facilities at reasonable charges.'' 47 U.S.C.
151 (1988). Telecommunications reform legislation pending in both Houses of Congress would make preservation and
advancement of universal service an explicit goal of U.S. policy.

2. Historically, universal service has meant widespread access to voice-grade 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
telephone service, commonly referred to as ``plain old telephone service'' (POTS). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fundamental objective has been to give all Americans an opportunity to pick 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
up the telephone and, at a reasonable cost, have a voice conversation with anyone 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
else in the country or, increasingly, the world. In recent years, however, many 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have questioned whether traditional notions of universal service are adequate to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meet the needs of the American people, now and in the 21st century.

3. This reassessment is prompted by two principal developments. First is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emergence of information as a vital economic resource and source of individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
empowerment. In 1991, U.S. companies for the first time spent more money on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
computer and communications equipment than on industrial, mining, farm and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturing machinery_dramatic evidence of the nation's transition from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Industrial Age to the Information Age.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 Increasingly, the ability of U.S. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
businesses to remain competitive in a global marketplace and to create challenging, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
high-paying jobs hinges on their proficiency in creating, manipulating, managing, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and using information. Similarly, an individual's ability to acquire, develop, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sustain marketable job skills_and, indeed, to be an informed, productive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participant in American society_will depend on how well he or she can access, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyze, and assimilate information.

4. Second, technological changes_particularly the convergence of computers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and communications and the deployment of high capacity, digital transmission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities_promise to make telecommunications networks the highways of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information Age, the principal means by which individuals and businesses access 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and distribute essential information resources. In this environment, it may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anachronistic to continue speaking of universal service in terms of voice telephone 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service. Accordingly, consensus is growing that there is a need to redefine that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concept to meet the demands of a new age. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Reform of universal service policies would be necessary even if there were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no redefinition issue. As described more fully below, many experts agree that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current pricing policies for voice telephone service are characterized by extensive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsidies between and among services, although the extent of those subsidies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remains a matter of considerable dispute.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 In other words, certain services (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 long distance, business service) have been overpriced to maintain low cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residential voice service. Whether or not that pricing structure was ever desirable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a matter of policy,
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 it could be sustained only in a market environment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characterized by monopoly provision of telephone service.

6. That environment is rapidly becoming a thing of the past. Competition is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
norm in many telecommunications services and equipment markets; it is growing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rapidly in the rest. Competition drives prices toward the costs of providing those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services and, in so doing, undermines traditional pricing structures that incorporate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inter-service subsidies. As a result, even though competition is not inimical to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
universal service goals,
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 its emergence and expansion is forcing a re-examination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of traditional universal service funding policies as surely as technological change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the emergence of the Information Age are prompting changes in the way 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
universal service is defined. The challenge for government and service providers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alike is to find a new funding scheme that is compatible with and sustainable in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
competitive market environment.

7. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issuing this Notice to gather public comment on these important issues. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Clinton Administration (the Administration) has stated a commitment to extending 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the concept of universal service to ensure that information resources are available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to all at affordable rates.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 This policy is a matter of fundamental fairness; if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information means empowerment, the United States ``cannot accept a division of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
our people among telecommunications `haves' and `have-nots.'''

8. This Notice represents another stage in NTIA's continuing investigation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
universal service issues.
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 Since December 1993, NTIA has conducted field 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearings in five locations across the country to gather information on those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issues.
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 This Notice has been shaped by what the agency has learned over the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
course of those hearings. The Notice also seeks to supplement the record 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developed at those hearings on the many questions subsumed within the concept 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of universal service. At the end of this process, NTIA will work to develop a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concept of universal service that fits the challenges and opportunities of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information Age. As importantly, NTIA intends to identify mechanisms that can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fund an expanded version of universal service in a competitive market 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment.

The Administration's activities relating to universal service are one facet of a comprehensive National Information
Infrastructure (NII) initiative. The Administration has established an interagency Information Infrastructure
Task Force (IITF), chaired by the Secretary of Commerce, to address the many issues relating to deployment of the NII.
The IITF operates through a number of subcommittees and working groups, and with the assistance of a public/private
sector Advisory Council. For further information on the IITF and related organizations, see The NII Field Hearings
on Universal Service and Open Access: America Speaks Out

testimony from public interest groups, state and local governments, labor, industry, and academia. Summaries of
each of the hearings are on the on-line NTIA Bulletin Board. See not 1 for access information. In this Notice, we also
request comment on how best to continue and expand these public outreach activities.

9. Finally, we also seek comment on another issue related to the policies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
underlying universal service_``open access.'' If, as noted above, information is of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increasing importance to businesses and individuals alike, and if competition among 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service providers is likely to be the norm in the future, ensuring universal service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for consumers is only part of the equation. Steps must also be taken to afford 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information providers access to consumers and vice versa. Accordingly, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administration is also committed to ensuring that telecommunications facilities and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
networks are sufficiently ``open'' so that all information providers can transmit their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wares to consumers across those facilities reliably, efficiently, and seamlessly, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without compromising the integrity or security of the information delivered.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NTIA therefore requests comment on a variety of questions relating to the meaning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and implementation of open access.

policies and solicits comment on the degree to which the nation has achieved the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
goal of providing basic voice telephone service to all Americans. Section III.B 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considers the issue of redefining the traditional concept of universal service and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining what services or functions should be included in an expanded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of universal service. Section IV focuses on mechanisms for funding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
universal service in an increasingly competitive market environment. Section V 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
focuses on the role of the Federal and State governments in determining universal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service policies. Finally, Section VI requests comment on the definition and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation of open access.

II. Competition and Universal Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
11. The Federal government and many States have made a fundamental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commitment to introducing and expanding competition in telecommunications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
markets. The benefits of that commitment are increasingly apparent and show no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
signs of diminishing. There is also some concern, however, about the effects of competition on universal service.
While those concerns merit attention, there is much evidence to suggest that competition and universal service are
not incompatible goals. Market rivalry both drives prices towards underlying costs and reduces underlying costs
by forcing competing firms to operate more efficiently. Competition thus tends to reduce prices for goods and services,
making them more affordable for more consumers and ultimately reducing the need for subsidies. At the same time, competition
also increases the range of services and products available to consumers and, potentially, their geographic reach
as well, further promoting universal service goals.

12. The potential effects of competition on rates and consumer choice can be gleaned from the recent history of the
long distance and CPE markets in the United States. Prior to the break-up of the Bell System in 1984, most of the United
States was served by a single long distance network operated by AT&amp;T. Today, after a decade of government efforts
to facilitate entry in the long distance market, there are more than 500 long distance carriers in the United States,
offering a wide, ever-changing array of services and pricing options.
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 Due in part to this active rivalry among firms, long distance rates have declined more than sixty percent since 1984
by some estimations, making long distance calling more affordable for more Americans.

 Letter from Gerald J. Kovach, MCI, to Clarence L. Irving, Jr., NTIA, Attachment 1 at 1 (June 9, 1994) (long distance
rates, adjusted for inflation, have declined 66% since 1985). As a result of the sharp decline in long distance rates,
long distance calling has surged in recent years, especially relative to local calling. Toll calls (measured in minutes
of use) comprised 26.6% percent of all calls in 1992, as compared to 19.9% in 1984.

13. Similarly, when the Bell System controlled the CPE market, customers could lease (but not buy) any telephone they
wanted, so long as it was a black 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instrument that delivered unadorned voice service. Today, customers can choose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their phones from a wide variety of colors, sizes, shapes, and designs. Modern 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
telephones also include a variety of features (e.g., speed dialing, re-dial, memory programming) that greatly increase
usefulness of that equipment for many customers. In addition, its cost has declined considerably in the last decade
(as much as 50 percent in ``real'' terms).

14. The impact of competition on universal service can be examined more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directly by reviewing the development of local telephone service after expiration of the original Bell telephone
patents in 1893/94 unleashed a twenty-five year period of competition in the provision of local telephone service.
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>
 In 1895, after nineteen years of the Bell System patent monopoly, there were only 251,994 telephones in the United
States, or one telephone for every 276 of the nation's 69.5 million people. By 1920, at the close of the competitive
era, there were some 13.4 million telephones in the United States, or one telephone for every eight of the nation's
105.7 million people.
<FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>
 Moreover, fifty-five percent of all telephone subscribers were residential customers, as compared to only ten percent
in 1895.

15. We seek comment on the relationship between competition and universal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service. Will competition help make new advanced telecommunications services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more readily available across the nation and thereby reduce the need for universal service regulation? Some argue
that the universal service rationale is based on the premise that the market alone cannot uniformly guarantee provision
of telecommunications and services. They believe that depending on the market to provide advanced services may seriously
impede access by important segments of society to those services, particularly if the offerings are not commercially
viable in certain areas.
<FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>
 Consumer and civil rights groups, in particular, raise the specter of ``electronic redlining,'' in which low income
and minority neighborhoods are ``systematically underrepresented'' in the deployment of advanced services, as
has been alleged with respect to various local telephone companies' video dialtone networks.

Raymond Lawton, Associate Director of The National Regulatory Research Institute, pointed out in his testimony
at the Indianapolis field hearings that in an unregulated market, services are provided to rural/residential/low
income service recipients last because service to them is often more expensive and they are most often unable to pay.

17. Various proposals address the concern that a marketplace-driven definition of universal service may not bring
comparable services to all segments of the population or to all areas of the country at the same rate. One proposal,
for example, is for government to require firms to provide services to community centers, such as schools and libraries,
at the same time that such services are first provided to businesses and residences. The proponents of this approach
claim that focusing on providing service to such centralized points within a community, as a transitional mechanism,
could make desirable services more widely available without incurring the risks and costs of mandating universal
provision of uneconomical or unwanted services.
<FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>
 We request comment on this approach. In particular, do such public institutions have the facilities, funds, and hours
of operation to afford individuals, especially the young, a full and fair opportunity to explore the highways of the
Information Age? If not, what mechanisms could be explored for providing such resources?

18. We also seek comment on the possible effects of competition on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achievement of universal service goals in rural areas. Some argue that competition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in such areas is not only unsustainable, but potentially destructive to universal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service goals.
<FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>
 On the other hand, competition may spur the introduction or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expansion of service in rural areas, as suggested by the forty-fold increase in

 Basic telephone service has also become increasingly affordable for the average American, particularly since the
AT&amp;T divestiture in 1984. Between 1983 and 1993, prices for telephone service, on average, rose less (2.0%) than
the consumer price index for all items (3.8%) or for all services (4.7%). Moreover, since 1984, telephone service
has comprised no more than 2.0&hyph;2.1% of annual household expenditures.

universal service has not been fully achieved in the United States.
<FOOTCITE>34</FOOTCITE>
 Low 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penetration rates among certain groups appear to result from a variety of factors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, witnesses at NTIA's Albuquerque, New Mexico, field hearing cited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the state's low per-capita income as an important cause of the low penetration in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the area.
<FOOTCITE>35</FOOTCITE>
 More than sixty-five percent of the households of the Navajo Nation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in New Mexico do not subscribe to telephone service because telephone service is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either not affordable or not available.
<FOOTCITE>36</FOOTCITE>
 Language barriers and the need for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increased public education, at least among certain groups, may also result in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduced telephone service penetration.

For example, research indicates that people with limited knowledge of the English language frequently are not able
to take full advantage of the programs and services available to them. A 1992 survey of Chinese, Korean and Latino consumers
in San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, and Brownsville, Texas, about their knowledge of telecommunications
revealed that 43% did not know how to begin the process of having a phone installed and 17% did not know who to call if the
phone was not working.

22. We seek further comment on these matters. Are there other underserved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
groups besides those we have mentioned? Are the measures used and types of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data currently being collected by the Census Department and other government 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies adequate for determining whether universal service goals are being met in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all sectors of society? If so, parties are requested to provide that information for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the record. If not, what recommendations are there for providing more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comprehensive and targeted data on these issues? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 23. We also solicit comment (particularly studies, surveys, etc.) on why some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Americans do not have telephone service. Is income the determining or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
predominant factor? Does subscribership depend to any significant degree on geography (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
do penetration levels differ between rural and urban areas after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controlling for factors like income)? To what extent are cultural factors important? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If such factors are important, what steps can be taken to overcome them? Do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different considerations affect a household's ability to retain phone service over 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time, as compared to its decision to subscribe initially? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 24. Finally, we request comment on whether implementation of universal service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be measured in terms of availability of POTS rather than penetration. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
example, some households may not have telephone service simply because they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
choose not to subscribe. What measure(s), applied on a regular basis for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring purposes, would best enable policymakers to distinguish such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
households from those that desire basic service but cannot obtain it?

B. Formulating an Expanded Definition of Universal Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
25. As the nation decides whether and how to redefine universal service, it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
important to remember that, to a large extent, the current debate represents but a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new phase in a continuing process. Although universal service has traditionally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been defined as voice-grade POTS, the minimally-acceptable characteristics of that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service have changed over the past sixty years. Thus, direct dialing became 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
popular as it obviated the need to make more expensive operator-assisted calls in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
many instances and regulators mandated lower rates for directly-dialed calls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Party-line service has been replaced in recent decades by single-line service. Some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
states have directed local exchange carriers to incorporate touch-tone capability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into their basic service offerings because of its importance in accessing many 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information services. In short, the current interest in redefining universal service is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with past practice. The principal differences are the ever-expanding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
range of services that could be incorporated into a revised concept of universal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service and the quicker pace at which policymakers must make their decisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
26. As noted above, there appears to be strong public support for expanding the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing definition of universal service. There is, however, little consensus about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
what services, features, and capabilities should be included within a new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition. Witnesses at the NTIA field hearings suggested that universal service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
encompass a host of different services, including: access to a basic set of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information and telecommunications services; multiple languages, including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Spanish and Native American languages that require special, non-ASCII
<FOOTCITE>38</FOOTCITE>
 characters; set-aside resources, facilities, and capacity for public, education, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
government training and use; new technologies such as video link and cellular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
telephone service; and services defined as characteristics or features, rather than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technologies.
<FOOTCITE>39</FOOTCITE>
 A random survey of 1,000 likely voters conducted by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

27. If universal service is to be redefined as a group of services or capabilities, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some mechanism or set of principles must be found to help select from the wealth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of possible alternatives. We therefore request comment on whether there is an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organizing principle or set of principles that can be used to determine whether a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular service or feature should be included within a modern concept of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
universal service. This is essential because redefinition is not without potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pitfalls. Adding each new component to the package deemed universally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary increases both the societal costs of making that package universally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available as well as the chances of prematurely mandating services or features that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are ultimately proven to be commercially undesirable.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Defining universal service to include certain services may also raise constitutional and regulatory issues. For
example, government designation of certain information services as part of a universal service package could be
challenged as violative of the First Amendment on the ground that it compels providers to ``speak'' or because it discriminates
against other information services. Moreover, inclusion of information services within a redefined universal
service could lead to regulation of currently unregulated services. We seek comment on these issues as well.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
28. One approach could be to allow the marketplace to identify, at least in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first instance, services and features that warrant inclusion in an expanded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of universal service.
<FOOTCITE>42</FOOTCITE>
 Under this approach, private firms would offer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services to consumers in competition with other companies. If some service were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subscribed to by a predesignated minimum percentage of U.S. households, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
government regulators would either have the authority to consider whether to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
make that service universally available or be required to do so.
<FOOTCITE>43</FOOTCITE>
 We seek 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment on whether government should select services to be included in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expanded definition of universal service and, if so, on what basis such services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be chosen? What role should the market play in determining that mix? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Should there be some threshold of market penetration before a capability or service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is added to the definition of universal service? If so, what should the threshold be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and why? Are there disadvantages in relying on market forces even in the first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instance?

29. An alternative to identifying particular services to be incorporated into an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expanded concept of universal service would be to define universal service in terms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a network connection that would enable customers to access any service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available via such network. If universal service were to be defined in such a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fashion, the cost of making it available throughout the country would likely be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduced. Moreover, government officials would not be required to make difficult 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determinations about the relative value of different services or equipment; instead, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it should allow the market to determine customer valuation of each service or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment item. On the other hand, government officials may have to make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equally difficult decisions as to the type of network connection that should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30. We request comment on the notion of defining universal service in terms of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a network connection. Would such an approach effectively spur deployment of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advanced telecommunications infrastructure? Would it give all sectors of society a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chance to participate in the information revolution? If this approach were adopted, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
what sort of connection should be specified (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in terms of capacity,

If universal service is defined in terms of a network connection, should that connection provide access to the Internet?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
32. Another important area of inquiry is the extent to which universal service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policy should address customer premises equipment (CPE). Without adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment on the customer's premises, network connection and the many services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it affords is meaningless. CPE capable of providing access to advanced services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be expensive at market prices, however, and thus could serve as a barrier to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the availability of advanced services. For the same reason, however, subsidizing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CPE as part of universal service could be expensive, possibly prohibitively so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Including CPE in the definition of universal service could also reverse the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
government's existing regulatory approach toward CPE, which is now deregulated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and subject only to market forces.
<FOOTCITE>46</FOOTCITE>
 Local exchange carriers may provide CPE in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conjunction with local telephone service, subject to certain safeguards. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, at present, computer manufacturers, set-top box manufacturers, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
television manufacturers are competing to develop the product or products that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could be used for receiving advanced services. It is thus not clear which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment the government should specify, if any, and on what basis it should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
choose. Moreover, government selection of a certain type of CPE for inclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the universal service definition carries with it the risk of government picking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
winners and losers, a questionable strategy.

33. We seek comment on whether CPE should be included in the new definition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of universal service, and, if so, whether a category of providers should be obligated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to supply it. Should the Government identify specific equipment or merely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capabilities if it is included in the definition? What other alternative approaches 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could be adopted, e.g., such as a voucher system, which would assure that all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumers could purchase the type of CPE they desire from the provider of their

choice without government specification?

IV. Funding Universal Service in a Competitive Environment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
34. Today, most experts agree that current pricing policies support universal service by generating subsidies that
reduce the costs of providing POTS in particular areas and make service more affordable for certain groups of customers.
By and large, such subsidies have been internally generated_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, created by setting the pricing of certain services above the costs of providing them_rather than funded by external
sources, such as taxes.
<FOOTCITE>47</FOOTCITE>
 The growth of competition, which to some extent reduces the need for subsidies and is by no means incompatible with
universal service, does put pressure on existing funding mechanisms. Above-cost pricing creates market opportunities
for new entrants. New entry, in turn, drives prices towards costs, in the process, eliminating excess revenues that
were available, prior to competitive entry, to subsidize universal services like POTS. The challenge for policymakers
is to develop funding mechanisms that help achieve universal service goals, but are sustainable in a competitive
environment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Thus, for example, rates for the local telephone facilities used to originate and terminate long distance services_so-called
access facilities_have been set above cost to subsidize local telephone rates. Long distance service providers
pass those access costs through to subscribers. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
See, e.g., Infrastructure Report, supra 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->

support for local service to residential users.

above-cost rates for some customers and below cost rates for others.

Although internally generated subsidies are widely used to fund universal service, they are not the only mechanisms.
For example, subsidies to fund 911 emergency services and services for the hearing impaired increasingly are generated
directly through a separate charge on each subscriber's bills.

35. While there is widespread agreement that competition is putting pressure on existing mechanisms for funding
universal service, there is no consensus on the amount of subsidies at risk.
<FOOTCITE>48</FOOTCITE>
 Thus, a study sponsored by the United States Telephone Association concluded that interexchange access and toll
services provided by local exchange telephone companies (LECs) are priced to produce approximately $20 billion
of contribution in excess of their long-run incremental costs.
<FOOTCITE>49</FOOTCITE>
 Those additional revenues are presumably needed to fund universal service. Teleport Communications Group (Teleport),
a major provider of competitive local telecommunications services, disputes this claim, contending that only $400
million of the LECs' $86 billion in annual revenues goes toward subsidizing rates for basic telephone service.
<FOOTCITE>50</FOOTCITE>
 A study done for MCI estimated that the subsidy is about $3.7 billion when basic service costs are examined and extraneous
LEC revenue requirements are subtracted.
<FOOTCITE>51</FOOTCITE>
 Finally, the Consumer Federation of America alleges that, far from requiring support from other services, local
telephone service produces net income for the LECs in the amount of five to ten dollars per month.

36. We ask for comments on the amount of the subsidy today and the basis for the estimates. What methodologies were used
to derive the estimates cited, and what are the strengths and weaknesses of each approach? What data sources are available
on which to base the estimates? What are the implications of universal service subsidies in terms of market inefficiencies
and the positive ``externalities'' generated by the addition of subscribers to the network? With respect to a system
of subsidies, is there a threshold point at which the net positive benefits to society are maximized? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
37. There is a similar lack of agreement concerning possible new mechanisms for funding universal service, although
certain themes have begun to emerge. The debate overwhelmingly centers on the sources and distribution of the funding,
since most parties appear to agree that some form of universal service support should be continued.

38. Many proposals focusing on potential funding sources look to service providers as a source of subsidies. For example,
NARUC's Universal Service Project Group contends that as markets continue to evolve toward competition, all service
providers that deliver services over the public switched network should be required to contribute proportionally
to the universal service support mechanisms, including enhanced service providers.
<FOOTCITE>54</FOOTCITE>
 Metropolitan Fiber Systems (MFS), another provider of competitive local telecommunications services, would require
contributions from all providers of telecommunications services.
<FOOTCITE>55</FOOTCITE>
 Teleport, on the other hand, suggests that all common carriers providing facilities-based, two-way telecommunications
contribute to funding universal service.
<FOOTCITE>56</FOOTCITE>
 Professor Eli Noam has developed a plan under which all entities providing ``transmission path services'' to third
parties for compensation would pay a proportionate share, based on revenues, toward universal service funding.

regulated by the FCC under Title II, including local exchange carriers, interexchange carriers, cellular carriers,
competitive access providers, and satellite carriers. He would exclude enhanced service providers, information
providers, resellers, private networks, equipment manufacturers, and cable and broadcast operators. A system
of credits and debits would be used to determine amounts owed and transfers would only be made in the event of a difference
owing between providers. He would begin this program at the same time that local competition would be fully permitted,
with full interconnection and collocation rights. He indicates that his proposal could be implemented under existing
mechanisms.

39. We request comment on these and other mechanisms for generating funds to support universal service. What are the
advantages and disadvantages of deriving universal service support funding from service providers? What criteria
should be used to determine which service providers should be required to contribute to universal service funding?
Should contributions be required only from facilities-based service providers and, if so, why? If contributions
are to be required from non-facilities based service providers (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, resellers, enhanced service providers), do steps have to be taken to prevent double payment? How can the contribution
scheme be structured so as to minimize adverse effects on competition?
<FOOTCITE>58</FOOTCITE>
 Finally, should we keep any of the existing funding mechanisms?

40. Some have suggested public funding as an alternative to obtaining universal service funding from service providers.
For example, Professor Noam lists a variety of tax measures that could be used to fund universal service (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, general tax revenues, a telecommunications sales tax, a tax on telecommunications equipment, or a property tax
on carriers), while pointing to problems with each.
<FOOTCITE>59</FOOTCITE>
 Some witnesses at the NTIA field hearings asserted that subsidies should be generated from tax-based funding under
ideal circumstances, with a sectoral levy on telecommunications as a second best option.
<FOOTCITE>60</FOOTCITE>
 Finally, at NTIA's Indianapolis hearing, an executive of Procter and Gamble suggested that commercial advertising
on the NII could be an alternative mechanism for funding universal service objectives.

41. We request comment on the advantages and disadvantages of using public funding to advance universal service goals.
While that approach would be competitively neutral, public funding would represent a sharp departure from current
funding policies and would likely encounter stiff opposition, given the Federal deficit and other budget priorities.
We also seek comment on the efficacy of advertising as a vehicle for funding universal service in the 21st century.

B. Distribution of Subsidies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
42. The other facet of universal service funding concerns the distribution of subsidies. Currently, universal service
support is provided in both targeted and untargeted fashions. As noted above, government regulators historically
have mandated above-cost prices for certain services to reduce rates for residential POTS. This approach, however,
effectively subsidizes all residential customers, including those who would be willing and able to pay cost-based
rates for telephone service. Similarly, regulators have also directed subsidies towards high cost areas to ensure
affordable POTS in those areas.
<FOOTCITE>62</FOOTCITE>
 Once again, this approach benefits all households in high cost areas, whether or not they are low income or would terminate
telephone service if faced with cost-based rates.

One such subsidy mechanism is the Universal Service Fund (USF) which provides monies to local telephone companies
whose ``local loop'' costs (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 the cost of the facility connecting the subscriber's home to the nearest company switching office) are more than 15
percent above the national average. The USF grew from $445 million in 1986 to more than $700 million in 1993, sparking
an investigation by a Federal-State Joint Board and the FCC into the causes of its rapid growth.

telephone loan program which, since 1947, has provided low-cost loans directly to rural telephone companies and
cooperatives.

43. Recently, government regulators have developed more carefully targeted funding programs. For example, the
FCC's Link-Up America program allows States to reduce telephone installation charges for qualified households
by as much as $30, as well as to use installment payments for installation charges without any interest charges to the
customer. To date, forty-eight states and the District of Columbia have implemented Link-Up America programs. Funding
of the program this year will be approximately $15.9 million. Under the FCC's Lifeline program, started in 1985, the
FCC matches State rate discounts to eligible subscribers (up to the maximum Federally-mandated subscriber line
charge of $3.50 per month). Thirty-five states and the District of Columbia have implemented some form of Lifeline
assistance, at a projected cost of some $119 million in 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
44. Most experts contend that universal support should be provided only to those subscribers who could not otherwise
afford telephone service. Some argue for targeting subsidies to low income users, high cost areas, and special needs
groups.
<FOOTCITE>63</FOOTCITE>
 NARUC's Universal Service Project recommends continuing some support mechanisms in place today, including targeted
support in low cost areas and direct assistance to end users through Lifeline and Link-up programs.
<FOOTCITE>64</FOOTCITE>
 Others also support some form of lifeline option to assist low income customers while avoiding subsidizing every
household.

45. We seek comment on how best to target universal support funding. What criteria should be established to identify
those eligible for subsidies? Should eligibility for support be linked to the eligibility standards associated
with other social ``safety net'' programs. Should support be structured so that some defined package of telecommunications
services consumes no more than a specified percentage of a household's annual income, or represents no more than a
designated fraction of a household's yearly expenditures?
<FOOTCITE>66</FOOTCITE>
 Should subsidies be applied to a limited set of services and, if so, how should that set of services be determined?

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
46. We also request comment on the current practice of providing support to firms providing service in high cost (predominantly
rural) areas. Some have argued that rural telephone companies have higher average costs only if one considers the
fixed costs of their telephone networks. When operating expenses (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 labor costs, taxes, interest expenses) are factored in, total costs for some rural companies are lower than the costs
incurred by companies operating in non-rural areas.
<FOOTCITE>67</FOOTCITE>
 Commenters should address these analyses and their implications for universal service policies in rural areas.

47. In a related vein, MFS suggests that subsidies for high cost areas be based on objective criteria such as population
density, geography, and other subscriber statistics rather than actual telephone company costs to reduce any incentive
of LECs to inflate costs so they can keep receiving subsidies.
<FOOTCITE>68</FOOTCITE>
 Is that a viable funding strategy? Would it be more efficient to direct support to rural households, thereby subsidizing
only those subscribers who could otherwise not afford telephone service?

48. Finally, we solicit comment on the appropriate recipients of universal service support. As noted above, subsidies
are directed towards the providers of telephone service, in return for their commitment to provide below cost service
to certain subscribers or in certain areas. Some observers have suggested providing subsidies directly to subscribers,
either as a complement to or in place of transfers to carriers. There is growing interest, for example, in a voucher
system to allow subsidies to be distributed directly to eligible subscribers who would choose their own providers.
<FOOTCITE>69</FOOTCITE>
 Similarly, there is a proposal to give eligible customers credits on their monthly bills to reflect reductions in
the price of basic service.

49. Directing support to end users, rather than to carriers, could give customers more control in choosing their providers,
while continuing to ensure that all have access to affordable service. It might also stimulate competitive entry
in some areas. Others have argued, however, that providing support to subscribers would encourage inefficient entry
by new firms, jeopardize incumbent providers' ability to serve remaining customers, and actually increase universal
service support requirements.

50. Should universal service support payments be made to service providers, to subscribers, or in some other fashion?
Would directing subsidies to carriers encourage inefficient entry in some areas? If so, under what conditions? Could
a subscriber-based subsidy program be structured to avoid such problems? How much would such a program cost to establish
and operate? If support payments are made to service providers, should they be limited to certain categories of providers,
such as ``carriers of last resort'' (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 firms that agree to provide universal services throughout an entire geographic area)? If so, would it be feasible
or efficient to designate (and provide subsidy payments to) multiple carriers of last resort in a particular area?
What rules should dictate when carriers of last resort can enter or exit geographic areas? What is the most effective
way to establish service in currently unserved areas? For example, would it be possible to award a franchise to service
an unserved area via competitive bidding? What minimum franchise requirements would be necessary to make such an
auction fair and attractive to potential bidders?

C. Transition Measures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
51. Establishing a new funding scheme will likely necessitate transitional measures. For example, if any rate rebalancing
occurs, it will be necessary to address potential ``rate shock'' to local ratepayers. One commenter contends that
any transition should be aimed at achieving two goals: (1) developing a level playing field for competitors and (2)
continuing to protect consumers. Ameritech proposes to use what it calls the ``Customers First Plan,'' based on what
Ameritech labels ``bulk billing.'' In effect, Ameritech would collect the necessary subsidy amount by billing long
distance carriers according to their share of the total toll revenues reported to the FCC for all of Ameritech's interstate
access customers. Ameritech urges this approach as a transition to long-term reform of universal service funding
mechanisms.
<FOOTCITE>72</FOOTCITE>
 We request comment on this approach, as well as on other transitional proposals. How should these mechanisms be structured
so as not to distort competitive markets?

V. Role of the Federal and State Governments in Developing Universal Service Policies
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
52. Traditionally, FCC and state regulators have worked in tandem to promote universal service goals, but responsibility
for defining the precise components of universal service has resided primarily with the States. The telecommunications
reform legislation pending in Congress would specify differing degrees of Federal-State cooperation. The Senate
bill, S. 1822, would charge the FCC with defining universal service, ``based on recommendations from the public,
Congress, and the Federal-State Joint Board,'' although it would authorize the States to prescribe requirements
over and above the federally-established minimum as long as such regulations are not inconsistent with those prescribed
by the FCC.
<FOOTCITE>73</FOOTCITE>
 The House bill, H.R. 3626, would delegate the task to the FCC and the States, based on recommendations from the Joint
Board.

53. Similarly, most funding proposals recognize the joint role of the FCC and the states, given the bifurcated regulatory
jurisdiction over telecommunications. For example, both bills now pending in Congress, H.R. 3626 and S. 1822, require
the involvement of the FCC and the States in determining new universal service funding mechanisms, although the final
distribution authority between the two levels of government will turn on the specific legislative language enacted.
Many parties stress the need for administration of a funding mechanism by a neutral third party from the private sector.

54. There are numerous arguments for allowing more or less federal or state authority over universal service policies.
Defining universal service on a nationwide basis, for example, could facilitate network planning and service deployment,
thereby reducing the total costs to society of implementing universal service. On the other hand, giving individual
states flexibility to adopt differing definitions and funding mechanisms, as is the case today, would allow them
to craft policies more in line with local conditions. Allowing for state experimentation might also reduce the risks
of mandating provision of services either unnecessarily or prematurely, and or leave room for creative funding mechanisms
that might reduce the total subsidy requirement. We request comment on the appropriate role of the Federal and State
government in defining and funding universal service. What role should be played by the private sector?

VI. Open access for Telecommunications and Information Systems
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
55. The development and convergence of new telecommunications and information technologies are also leading to
changes in the way people think about access to the ``network.'' The concept of ``open access'' has come to represent
technical, regulatory, and empowerment components. This section examines these evolving concepts of open access
and the policies that can help make them a reality.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
56. Historically, access has focused on issues such as physical access to a seamless and transparent web of monopoly
local exchanges, equal access to long distance carriers,
<FOOTCITE>76</FOOTCITE>
 and availability to and ease of use by consumers, among others. As a result, any telephone customer can initiate as
well as receive phone calls, regardless of the local exchange and long-distance carrier serving the caller and the
call recipient. This ``open system'' that we all take for granted has been achieved through a framework of policies
designed to promote interconnection and interoperability, such as expanded interconnection and a uniform system
of ``addresses'' (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

In contrast, cable television franchises are not interconnected with other networks. Each customer is served by
a local provider who provides access solely to the services that cable operator wishes to provide and the set-top box
is principally a receive-only device. In the cable context, access generally refers to customer access to cable service
(measured in homes passed) and to carriage requirements imposed on cable providers such as Public, Education and
Government channels, leased access, and must carry channels.

57. The Administrations's open access goals are broader and more multi-faceted than the traditional approach. In
the evolving competitive marketplace, open access will require that multiple telecommunications and information
providers as well as users can interconnect transparently and be interoperable. This will in turn promote even more
competition among information providers and service options for consumers. Thus, as the NII evolves, the Administration
seeks to ensure that consumers and service providers will be able to transfer information across disparate networks
easily and accurately, with seamless, interactive, user-driven operations. Also, to be truly useful, an advanced
information infrastructure must allow service providers to offer a full range of educational material, health information,
and home and business services, and it must make those services truly accessible without unreasonable technical
or regulatory barriers, particularly to disabled individuals.

58. We solicit comments on how open access should be defined at this time. How should an open access policy be shaped
to accommodate the changing needs of our information society? What impact will open access have on competition and
ultimately on the extent of the need for universal service regulation? How can policymakers ensure that the NII fulfills
its promise for education, economic growth and job creation? How will the new entrants in the market affect open access?
What steps can be taken to facilitate or ensure access by Americans with disabilities?

59. The Administration also envisions open access to a two-way system of broadband communications as a means of individual
empowerment. The idea is that improved access to information will build and promote the values of democracy.
<FOOTCITE>79</FOOTCITE>
 Open access in this new environment creates opportunities for potential service providers as well as users to be providers
of information, thereby promoting an enhanced concept of community involvement and competition in the free flow
of ideas. Thus, open access to the NII could spur development of community-driven grass-roots networks or ``electronic
commons.'' In addition, the NII will enhance the ability of the Federal government and state and local governments
to deliver information and services to citizens more effectively, and for citizens to communicate their views on
legislation and policy initiatives back to government officials just as easily.

60. How can the ``electronic communities'' envisioned by the Administration be fostered? How can access to the NII
be assured for individuals, small and large businesses, non-profit institutions (in particular, schools, libraries
and health care facilities) and state and local governments? How can access be assured in rural areas? Should there
be different access opportunities and prices for profit and non-profit entities? Large and small entities? How can
society ensure that our citizens are sufficiently ``computer literate'' to utilize the NII?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
61. The critical question facing policymakers is how to ensure open access to the NII.
<FOOTCITE>80</FOOTCITE>
 NTIA's field hearings revealed a general consensus among witnesses that significant issues such as interconnection,
<FOOTCITE>81</FOOTCITE>
 interoperability and standard open interfaces,
<FOOTCITE>82</FOOTCITE>
 and reasonable prices and tariffs
<FOOTCITE>83</FOOTCITE>
 need to be addressed before open access can be assured.

The telecommunications reform bills being considered by the 103rd Congress contain numerous provisions to promote
open access. These include, for example, requirements for interconnection capability among telecommunications
carriers; non-discriminatory access to network facilities, services, functions and information on an unbundled
basis under certain conditions; the development of interconnection standards; joint planning among telecommunications
and information service providers for interoperability of private and public networks; the elimination of restrictions
on resale or sharing of network facilities and services; and the provision of advanced services, possibly with preferential
rates, to various governmental and non-profit institutions. The nature and extent of these provisions will depend
on final passage of telecommunications reform legislation in Congress and implementation actions by the FCC.

A number of commenters also noted that resolving security, privacy, and intellectual property issues over the NII
is also critical. The Administration is currently addressing these issues through several IITF committees and working
groups. These include the NII Security Issues Forum, the Network Reliability and Vulnerability Working Group, and
the Privacy Working Group.

62. The NII will integrate and build upon many different hardware and software components, some of which already exist
and many of which are still in development. These components must be interoperable, i.e., able to work together. Interoperable
components would allow distinct networks to communicate with each other and allows users to access various products
and services through standard software and hardware.
<FOOTCITE>85</FOOTCITE>
 An NII comprised of interoperable networks will create an infrastructure that is accessible to all providers and
users.

 What critical points in today's infrastructure must be interoperable if the NII vision is to be successfully implemented?

Many believe that the Internet is an excellent model for such interoperability, since it allows users all over the
world to access information and talk to each other easily over the network. We request comments on whether the Internet
is, indeed, a good model for interoperability for the NII.

63. Interoperability can be accomplished in a number of different ways. Equipment can have open protocols and interfaces
that permit a physical connection (as is the case of a plug and socket) or logical connection (message format and exchange
procedure).
<FOOTCITE>87</FOOTCITE>
 Equipment built with open architecture will also permit interoperability. Additionally, standards for voice,
video, data and multi-media services are also crucial to interoperability.

Comments of Alan R. Blatecky, Vice President, Information Technologies, MCNC, North Carolina Hearing (Apr. 27,
1994). ``It is essential to have regulatory guidelines which ensure interoperability across networks through the
rapid adoption and encouragement of open standards. If standards are not adopted, the marketplace becomes a battleground
for proprietary solutions which penalize users until one of the standards finally become[s] a de facto standard.''

64. While there have been times when the U.S. government has promoted particular standards, industry adoption of
voluntary standards, working with government officials, is now the norm. Various commenters have argued that either
approach can be too slow given the fast pace of change in the industry. In addition, some argue that the industry standard-setting
process is costly and requires large amounts of employee time, which creates hardships for smaller companies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
65. How should standards develop for the NII? Do standards affect the ability to innovate? How can standards be developed
that are flexible and adaptable enough to meet user needs at affordable costs? If voluntary, industry-set standards
are the favored approach, what procedures should be followed in establishing standards, and what fora should be used?
What role, if any, should the government play?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
66. Competition is one of several means of ensuring that innovation and the provision of information and transport
services will flourish on the NII. At the same time, there is a recognized need for government intervention in the case
of market failures, for example, to protect new entrants from the market power of incumbent operators when necessary.
Will greater competition in information and transport markets alone be sufficient to achieve open access goals?
If not, what other actions are necessary? What regulations or policies need to be in place to guarantee reasonable
and nondiscriminatory interconnection and reasonable cost-based pricing and tariffs for the NII? What technical
or regulatory barriers must be overcome?

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The National Institutes of Health (NIH) announces the availability of educational loan repayment under the National
Institutes of Health Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) Research Loan Repayment Program. The Program,
which is authorized by section 487A of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act (42 U.S.C. 288&hyph;1), as added by the Health
Omnibus Programs Extension Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100&hyph;607) and amended by the National Institutes of Health Revitalization
Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;43), provides for the partial repayment of the accumulated educational loan debt of
health professionals who agree to conduct, as employees of the NIH, research with respect to AIDS. The Program provides
for the repayment of up to $20,000 of the principal and interest of the educational loans of such health professionals
for each year of obligated service. The purpose of the program is the recruitment and retention of highly qualified
health professionals conducting AIDS research as NIH employees. The NIH, through this notice, invites health professionals
interested in engaging in AIDS research as NIH employees to apply for participation in the NIH AIDS Research Loan Repayment
Program.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of 1993 (Public Law 103&hyph;43) was enacted on June 10, 1993,
amending section 487A of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act (42 U.S.C. 288&hyph;1). Section 487A directs the Secretary
to continue a program of entering into agreements with appropriately qualified health professionals under which
such health professionals agree to conduct, as employees of the NIH, research with respect to acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome (AIDS) in consideration of the Federal Government agreeing to repay, for each year of service, not more than
$20,000 of the principal and interest of the educational loans of such health professionals. This program is known
as the NIH AIDS Research Loan Repayment Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Program, the NIH will repay qualified educational loan debt incurred by health professionals to pay for
their undergraduate, graduate, and/or medical educational expenses. Upon application, individuals must have
total qualified debt which will exceed 20% of their anticipated annual NIH salary (``debt threshold'') on the date
of program eligibility. Half of this debt threshold amount will not be repaid by the Program and will remain the obligation
of the participant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The remaining repayable debt of qualified health professionals will be satisfied at the rate of one-third per year,
subject to a statutory limit of $20,000 per year, for each year of obligated service EXCEPT for individuals with repayable
debt equal to or less than $10,000. These individuals will receive repayment of their repayable debt at the rate of
one-half per year. Obligated service requires individuals selected to participate in the Program to agree to serve
at least 2 years as an NIH employee engaged in qualified AIDS research. Participants may apply for renewal contracts
in one-year increments to satisfy their remaining repayable debt.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In return for the repayment of their educational loans, participants must agree to (1) Engage 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
primarily 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in qualified AIDS research as employees of the NIH for a minimum period of 2 years; (2) make payments to lenders on their
own behalf for periods of Leave Without Pay (LWOP); (3) pay monetary damages as required for breach of contract; and
(4) satisfy other terms and conditions of the Program's contract and application procedures. Applicants must submit
a signed contract, prepared by the NIH, agreeing to obligated service at the time they apply for consideration under
the Program. Substantial monetary penalties will be imposed for breach of contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since program participation is contingent upon employment with the NIH, an individual who wishes to apply must obtain
a written commitment from an Institute, Center, or Division (ICD) Personnel Office of the NIH to be employed in a qualified
AIDS research position. Current deadlines, sources for assistance, and additional details regarding application
procedures are published in an annual 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Applicant Information Bulletin 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
which is available from the Director, AIDS Research Loan Repayment Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The Loan Repayment Committee (LRC), whose members are appointed by the Director, NIH, review, rank, and approve or
disapprove the scientific portions of Loan Repayment Program applications. The LRC is composed of NIH scientific
staff and chaired by the Associate Director for AIDS Research, NIH. Review and selection of applications for approval
is based upon the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (1) The appropriateness of the research assignment to qualified AIDS research; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (2) The scientific merit of the research assignment; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (3) The credentials of both applicant and supervisor and other criteria the Secretary deems appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Initial contracts will be executed to cover a two-year service period. At the conclusion of this initial contract,
participants may be recommended for a one-year renewal contract, subject to review of their AIDS research accomplishments.
These continuation contracts may be approved on a year-to-year basis. Funding of all contracts is contingent upon
appropriation and/or allocation of funds from the U.S. Congress and/or the NIH. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NIH will repay lenders for the principal, interest, and related expenses (such as the required insurance premiums
on the unpaid balances of some loans) of qualified Government (Federal, State, local) and commercial educational
loans obtained by participants for the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Undergraduate, graduate, and health professional school tuition expenses; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Other reasonable educational expenses required by the school(s) attended, including fees, books, supplies,
educational equipment and materials, and laboratory expenses; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Reasonable living expenses, including the cost of room and board, transportation and commuting costs, and other
reasonable living expenses as determined by the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Repayments will be authorized quarterly for direct payment to lenders, following receipt of (1) The supervisor's
verification of completion of the prior period of obligated service and (2) lender verification of the crediting
of prior loan repayments, including the resulting account balances and current account status. The NIH will repay
loans in the following order unless significant savings would result from repaying loans in a different priority
order: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Health Education Assistance Loans (HEAL); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Other loans guaranteed by the Federal Government; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Other qualifying loans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following loans are NOT repayable under the Program: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Loans not obtained from a Government entity or commercial lending institution, such as loans from friends and
relatives, or other private individuals; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Loans for which contemporaneous documentation is not available; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Loans, or those portions of loans, obtained for educational or living expenses which exceed a ``reasonable''
level as determined by a review of the standard school budget for the year in which the loan was made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, for other programs which provide loans, scholarships, loan repayments, or similar awards in exchange
for a future service obligation, the NIH will 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
NOT 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
repay any sums that may result from failure to serve as required or conversion of the obligation to a loan under these
programs. This includes, but is not limited to the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Physicians Shortage Area Scholarship Program; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) National Research Service Award Program; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Public Health Service and National Health Service Corps Scholarship Programs; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Armed Forces (Army, Navy, or Air Force) Health Professions Scholarship Programs; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Indian Health Service Scholarship Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, payments will 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
be made under the Program for loans which participants have already repaid, delinquent loans, loans in default, loans
not current in their payment schedule, or loans for which promissory notes have been signed after the program eligibility
date. During lapses in loan repayments, due either to administrative complications or a break in service, Program
participants are wholly responsible for making payments or other arrangements which maintain loans in a current
payment status such that increases in either principal or interest do not occur. Penalties assessed participants
as a result of NIH administrative complications may be considered for reimbursement.

On May 20, 1994, the OMB approved the collections of information contained in the Third Report and Order which established
service-specific rules for competitive bidding on licenses to be awarded for Personal Communications Services
in the 900 MHz band (``narrowband PCS'') and the general procedural and processing rules for the narrowband PCS service.
The Commission received seven petitions for reconsideration of the Third Report and Order and three oppositions
and comments and on reply. Upon reconsideration, the Commission has clarified, modified and supplemented the original
rules governing the auction of narrowband PCS licenses. For example, the Commission has modified its original definition
of small business to include larger concerns, and has codified principles for attributing the interests of various
affiliates of the applicant to that applicant. The Commission has also modified the various preferential measures
that are available to certain entities designated by Congress, such as increasing the available bidding credits
to 40% from 25% in some cases. In order to better ensure that applicants claiming these preferences are entitled to
them and to aid the Commission's enforcement efforts, winning bidders are now required to supply additional information
on the ownership of the applicant. The FCC Form 175, now permits applicants to amend their FCC Form 175 applications
to reflect ownership changes that do not result in a change in control of the applicant. The Commission believes that
the new and modified rules and requirements will facilitate the auction process and will increase the opportunities
for designated entities to participate in the provision of narrowband PCS. The rules and requirements have been carefully
crafted as to not unduly burden any applicant with unnecessary paperwork requirements. We estimate that each applicant
will take an additional five (5) hours to comply with the new and modified paperwork requirements. If the normal 60-day
OMB review and clearance process for information collections were followed, it would effectively impede the Commission's
ability in achieving Congressional objectives of encouraging rapid deployment of service, efficient use of the
spectrum, enhancing access to telecommunications services, and ensuring that spectrum based services are available
to a wide range of consumers. It would also thwart the Commission's ability to recover for the public a portion of the
value of the public spectrum. The result would be an unnecessary delay in the anticipated benefits to the public. The
revised rule sections are in the following Appendix are provided in this notice as required by the Paperwork Reduction
Act of 1980.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

do not result in a change in control of the applicant and do not involve another applicant (or parties in interest to
an applicant) who has applied for any of the same licenses as the applicant. Amendments which change control of the
applicant will be considered major amendments. An FCC Form 175 which is amended by a major amendment will be considered
to be newly filed and cannot be resubmitted after applicable filing deadlines. See also Section 1.2105.

cause the applicant to lose its status as a designated entity under Section 24.309, or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The individual or mutual withdrawal, amendment or dismissal of any pending application, amendment, petitioner
or other pleading.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) If the amendment would cause the applicant to lose its status as a designated entity under Section 24.309, the applicant
must notify the Commission of this change in status and must comply with the obligations imposed by Sections 24.308,
including increasing its down payment to the level required as a non-designated entity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Contain specific allegations of fact which, except for facts of which official notice may be taken, shall be supported
by affidavit of a person or persons with personal knowledge thereof, and which shall be sufficient to demonstrate
that the petitioner (or respondent) is a party in interest and that a grant of, or other Commission action regarding,
the application would be prima facie inconsistent with the public interest;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Be filed within thirty (30) days after the date of public notice announcing the acceptance for filing of any such
application or major amendment thereto (unless the Commission otherwise extends the filing deadline); and

revocation, if they are FCC licensees, and may be prohibited from participating in future auctions.
