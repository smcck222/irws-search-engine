SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are proposing to amend the regulations regarding the importation of horses from Mexico to remove the requirement
that such horses be quarantined for not less than 7 days in vector-proof quarantine facilities before being imported
into the United States. We believe this action is warranted because Mexico has reported no cases of Venezuelan equine
encephalomyelitis (VEE) in over a year, and it appears that horses imported from Mexico without a 7-day quarantine
would not pose a risk of transmitting VEE to horses in the United States.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations in 9 CFR part 92, referred to below as the regulations, govern the importation into the United States
of specified animals and animal products, including horses from Mexico, to prevent the introduction into the United
States of various animal diseases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 27, 1993, we published an interim rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 45236&hyph;45238, Docket No. 93&hyph;096&hyph;1) in which we required that horses imported into the United
States from Mexico be quarantined for not less than 7 days in a vector-free facility. Prior to our interim rule, horses
intended for importation from Mexico were not required to be held in quarantine for any specified number of days, but
were required, instead, to be quarantined only long enough to complete the testing required by the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A 7-day quarantine became necessary when the government of Mexico reported that Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis
(VEE) had been detected in horses in that country. VEE is an equine viral disease, transmitted primarily by mosquitoes
and other hematophagous (blood-feeding) insects, particularly flying insects, that results in a high mortality
rate in animals infected with the disease. Although tests exist for the presence of VEE in horses, the tests currently
available may yield positive results for horses that have been vaccinated for VEE but that are not otherwise affected
with the disease. The most efficient method for initial identification of horses that may be infected with VEE is observation
of the horses for clinical signs of the disease. A horse will usually exhibit signs of VEE within 2&hyph;5 days after
contracting the disease. Seven days is considered the length of time necessary to ensure that any clinical signs of
VEE manifest themselves. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this document, we are proposing to remove the requirement that horses from Mexico be quarantined for not less than
7 days. We believe the removal of this requirement is warranted because Mexico appears to be free of VEE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The last case of VEE in Mexico was reported in July 1993. Following the initial outbreak of VEE in the Mexican State of
Chiapas in June 1993, the Government of Mexico instituted emergency measures to locate, contain, and eradicate the
disease. These emergency measures included the following: Activation of the country's animal health emergency
group; organization of groups such as regional livestock associations and State authorities; establishment of
quarantines in areas in which the disease was known to exist; vaccination of horses in affected areas; traceback of
horses that might have been moved from affected areas before quarantine measures were established; and increased
surveillance in States surrounding the affected areas. Based on these considerations, the government of Mexico
has requested that the U.S. Department of Agriculture consider Mexico to be free of VEE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the documentation submitted by the government of Mexico, it appears that no horses in that country are affected
with VEE. (This documentation is available, upon written request, from the person listed under 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) Therefore, we are proposing to amend 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;92.324 of the regulations to remove the requirement that horses intended for importation from Mexico be quarantined
for not less than 7 days before being imported into the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are also proposing to remove the requirement in &sect;92.324 that horses from Mexico intended for importation
into the United States through land border ports be quarantined in Mexico at a facility approved by the Administrator
of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and constructed so as to prevent the entry of mosquitoes
and other hematophagous insects. This requirement was necessary when VEE was known to exist in horses in Mexico, but
we believe it is unnecessary now that Mexico appears to be free of VEE.

Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The rule has been determined to be not significant
for purposes of Executive Order 12866, and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, we have prepared an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
regarding the impact of this proposed rule on small entities. We do not currently have all the data necessary for a comprehensive
analysis of the effects of this rule on small entities. Therefore, we are inviting comments concerning potential
impacts. In particular, we are interested in determining the number and kind of small entities that may incur benefits
or costs from implementation of this proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with 21 U.S.C. 111, the Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to promulgate regulations to prevent
the introduction or dissemination of any contagious, infectious, or communicable disease of animals from a foreign
country into the United States. In accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
21 U.S.C. 102, the Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to quarantine livestock imported into the United States.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule would remove the requirement that horses imported from Mexico be quarantined for 7 days at vector-proof
quarantine facilities. We believe this action is warranted because it appears that Mexico is free of Venezuelan equine
encephalomyelitis (VEE), and that horses imported from Mexico without a 7-day quarantine would not pose a risk of
transmitting VEE to horses in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compared with the 5-month period from October 1992 through February 1993 (pre-interim rule), there was a significant
decline in the number of horses imported from Mexico during the period from October 1993 through February 1994 (following
publication of the interim rule). During the 1992/1993 5-month period, there were 3,772 horses imported from Mexico,
compared with only 125 during the 1993/1994 5-month period. It is reasonable to assume that the additional costs associated
with the quarantine were at least partially responsible for the reduction in the number of horses imported during
the 1993/1994 period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is a $50 hourly fee for inspection services conducted in Mexico by APHIS veterinary medical officers (in addition
to an APHIS per horse charge of $28.50). Assuming that APHIS services would be rendered for 2 hours during each day of
quarantine, and assuming an average quarantine period of 3 days prior to the VEE interim rule and 7 days following the
interim rule, the reduction in user fee costs from the lifting of the restrictions due to VEE would be about $400 per
shipment ($700 minus $300). For an average shipment of 40 horses, the savings in fees would be about $10 per head.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Other quarantine costs, such as for feed and handling, could also be expected to decrease by more than one-half if the
7-day quarantine is no longer required. Whereas quarantine costs prior to the interim rule averaged about $3 per head
per day, we estimate that during the period following the interim rule, these charges increased to between $5 and $10
per day, due to additional precautionary measures. Again assuming a 3-day pre-interim rule quarantine, the savings
in charges by removing the 7-day quarantine requirement would be between $26 and $61 per head ($35 minus $9, and $70
minus $9). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the combined savings of reduced user fees and other quarantine charges, the removal of the VEE quarantine requirements
would reduce importers' costs by an estimated $36 to $71 per head. Based on the average 1992 price of $310 per head for
horses imported from Mexico, these reduced costs would represent a savings of between 11 and 23 percent of the value
of each horse.

The Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) is proposing to adopt a rule setting forth procedures applicable to administrative
claims based upon acts or omissions of the RTC as receiver. The rule is intended to inform potential claimants of the
circumstances under which the RTC will consider claims based upon acts or omissions of the receiver to be timely filed
and to clarify when suit may be filed on these claims. The rule will thus inform and remind potential claimants of the
deadlines applicable to claims and suits based upon acts or omissions of receivers. Comments received from the public
will be considered in determining the form of a final rule.

The legislative history of 12 U.S.C. 1821(d) reveals that the dual purpose behind requiring exhaustion of claims
before suit can be filed is: (1) To minimize costs to the receivership estate and to the legitimate claimants who share
in the distributions from the estate, and (2) to minimize the burden on federal courts by avoiding needless litigation.

the receivership claims process must be exhausted with respect to claims based upon acts or omissions of the RTC as

the receiver is given an initial opportunity to allow meritorious claims outside of litigation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, both the literal terms of 12 U.S.C. 1821(d)(13)(D) and the purposes of the statute make it clear that no suit can
be maintained against the RTC as receiver based upon any act or omission of the RTC as receiver unless and until the claims
process has been pursued.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As of March 31, 1994, the RTC held over 533,000 assets, such as real estate, mortgages and deeds of trust, and commercial
and consumer loans. The RTC, as receiver, has entered into and will continue to enter into numerous contracts for the
sale of these assets. In addition, the RTC, as receiver, enters into many other contracts relating to its operations.
Further, many additional claims arise relating to the conduct of receivership affairs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the number of contracts that the RTC enters into as receiver and because the RTC, as receiver, acts in a wide
variety of ways, disputes necessarily arise between the RTC and other persons. In order to fulfill the purposes of
the claims process set forth in 12 U.S.C. 1821(d), the RTC is promulgating this proposed rule setting forth procedures
applicable to claims based upon acts or omissions of the RTC as receiver. (The proposed rule does not address claims
against the RTC in its corporate capacity.) When final, this rule will replace the Interim Statement of Policy Regarding
Procedures to be Used with Regard to Claims Based upon Acts or Omissions of the Receiver, 59 FR 10663 (March 7, 1994),
which will be superseded in its entirety.

agreement or unexpired lease of the institution, any claim based upon a repudiation by the receiver of any agreement
or lease, and any claim alleging a violation of law by the receiver; provided, that Post-Receivership Claims shall
include only claims that were not in existence as of the date of the receiver's appointment and that rely for their existence
upon an act or omission of the RTC as receiver. A Post-Receivership Claim shall not include any claim in existence as
of the date of the appointment of the receiver, regardless of whether the claim was then contingent, unliquidated,
not matured or not known or discovered.

(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In general. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Any Post-Receivership Claim must be filed with the receiver within the time limits set forth in this section or the
claim shall be disallowed, the disallowance shall be final, and the claimant shall have no further rights or remedies
with respect to the claim.

Pre-existing contracts. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a Post-Receivership Claim is based on a contract that is in writing, that was entered into with the RTC as receiver
or as conservator prior to [THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE FINAL RULE], and that contains any term or provision requiring
that the claim be filed with or presented to the institution or to the RTC as conservator or receiver within a certain
period of time or by a certain date, then the claim must be filed by the earliest of the following dates:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The date or time set forth in the contract;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The 90th day after the RTC first publishes notice of its intention to terminate the receivership; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The date established by any applicable statute of limitations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If the receiver mails a notice to a claimant requiring that a Post-Receivership Claim with proof be filed by a certain
date, then the claim must be filed by the date set forth in the notice or by the date established by any applicable statute
of limitations, whichever occurs first (unless the claim is based upon a contract meeting the description set forth
in paragraph (b) of this section, in which case the time limits set forth in paragraph (b) apply). The date set forth
in the notice shall be not less than 90 days after the notice is mailed (and may be later than the date established pursuant
to 12 U.S.C. 1821(d)(3)(B)(i)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
All other cases. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In all cases other than those described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, a Post-Receivership Claim must be
filed by the 90th day after the RTC first publishes notice of its intention to terminate the receivership or by the date
established by any applicable statute of limitations, whichever occurs first.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
No extension to file claims subject to bar of 12 U.S.C. 1821(d)(3)(B)(i) or 1821(d)(5)(C). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section shall apply only to Post-Receivership Claims and shall not apply to and shall not be construed as extending
the period to file claims described in 12 U.S.C. 1821(d)(3)(B)(i) or 1821(d)(5)(C) for any other claim.

Applicability of 12 U.S.C. 1821(d). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The applicable portions of 12 U.S.C. 1821(d) shall govern any Post-Receivership Claim that is filed with the receiver.
No suit upon any Post-Receivership Claim may be filed or maintained until the claims process has been exhausted. Any
suit filed must be filed in the courts and in accordance with the time limits specified in 12 U.S.C. 1821(d)(6) (or 1821(d)(8),
when appropriate). 12 U.S.C. 1821(d)(6) requires, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, that suit be filed in the district or territorial court of the United States for the district within which the depository
institution's principal place of business is located or the United States District Court for the District of Columbia
before the end of the 60-day period beginning on the earlier of the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The end of the 180-day period (or any mutually agreed upon extension thereof) provided in 12 U.S.C. 1821(d)(5)(A)(i)
for the receiver to consider the claim; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The date of any notice of disallowance of such claim pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1821(d)(5)(A)(i).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Contractual provisions requiring forbearance from suit. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a claim is based upon a written contract that was entered into the RTC as receiver prior to [THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE
FINAL RULE] and that contains any term or provision requiring the claimant to forebear from filing suit for any period
of time less than 180 days after first presenting or filing a claim with the RTC or receiver, then the claimant may, but
need not, treat the failure of the RTC or receiver to allow or disallow the claim prior to the end of the contractual forbearance
period as a disallowance pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1821(d)(5)(A)(i) entitling the claimant to file suit within 60 days
after the end of the contractual forbearance period. If the claimant does not elect to treat the failure of the RTC or
receiver to allow or disallow the claim prior to the end of the contractual forbearance period as a disallowance, then,
in order to preserve its claim, the claimant must file suit in the appropriate federal court during the 60-day period
beginning on the earlier of:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The end of the 180-day period (or any mutually agreed upon extension thereof) beginning on the date the claim is
filed; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The date of any actual notice of disallowance of such claim.

under its rules regarding the filing of ownership reports by officers, directors, and principal security holders,
and the exemption of certain transactions by those persons from the short-swing profit recovery provisions of Section
16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act''). The comment period for the Proposing Release also is
extended until November 1, 1994.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current Rule 16a&hyph;1(c)(3) definitional exclusion covers any compensatory instrument issued in an employment
context that can be redeemed or exercised solely for cash, provided that the instrument either: (1) Is awarded under
an employee benefit plan that satisfies certain conditions prescribed by Rule 16b&hyph;3;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 or (2) can be redeemed or exercised only upon a fixed date or dates at least six months from the date of the award, or incident
to death, retirement, disability or termination of employment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Both prongs of this exclusion are based on the principle that removal of the insider-recipient's discretion with
respect to the timing of grant and/or realization of a cash-only instrument would minimize the opportunity for speculative
abuse that Section 16 was designed to prevent.

As proposed to be amended in the Proposing Release, the Rule 16a&hyph;1(c)(3) exclusion would extend to all compensatory
cash-only instruments issued pursuant to an employer-employee relationship, even if the insider-recipient could

There [is] any basis for according disparate treatment, for reporting and/or short-swing profit purposes, to equity-based

As reflected in the above-quoted request for comment, the Commission is interested in comments on whether the current
definitional exclusion for compensatory cash-only instruments codified in Rule 16a&hyph;1(c)(3) is appropriate.
The Commission is interested in determining whether, for example, stock appreciation rights (``SARs'') that have
a multi-year term and may be exercised at the volition of the insider-recipient may provide opportunities for speculative
profit that are identical, regardless of whether the SARs are payable exclusively in cash, stock, or some combination
of the two and, from the perspective of shareholders and analysts, have the same Section 16(a)

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Accordingly, in addition to considering the proposals and alternatives addressed in the Proposing Release, the
Commission invites commenters to express their views on whether the current exclusions for cash-only instruments
set forth in Rules 16a&hyph;1(c)(3)(i) and (ii), respectively, are overly broad in light of the purposes of Section
16, and thus should be limited to a smaller class of such instruments. In responding to this question, commenters should
discuss whether any continued exclusion for cash-only compensatory instruments should be limited to those for which
the timing of settlement is not subject to the insider's volition. For example, should Rule 16a&hyph;1(c)(3)(i)
be rescinded, so the exemption would be available only if the instrument met the fixed-date conditions of Rule 16a&hyph;1(c)(3)(ii)?
If an exemption for cash-only instruments is appropriate, should it be made available only under the short-swing
profit recovery provision of Section 16(b),
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
8
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 rather than also providing an exemption from the reporting requirements of Section 16(a)? If a separate Section 16(a)
exclusion is retained for certain compensatory cash-only instruments, comment is sought on whether it should be
recast as an exemptive rule, rather than the current rule, which excludes these instruments from the definition of
``derivative securities'' and therefore from the class of ``equity securities'' covered by Section 16.

Were the Commission to eliminate the definitional exclusion for volitional compensatory cash-only instruments,
transactions involving these instruments would be reportable under Section 16(a) but still could qualify for Section
16(b) exemptive treatment. Specifically, Rule 16b&hyph;3 coverage would be available for these instruments if
all applicable conditions were satisfied, including non-transferability (if retained as a condition
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
9
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), six-month holding period, shareholder approval, disinterested administration (or formula), and window-period
settlement. Comment is requested as to whether fewer or additional conditions should be imposed as a prerequisite
to Rule 16b&hyph;3 qualification of cash-only instruments. Or should a separate exemption from Section 16(b) be
created for the grant and/or settlement of these instruments? If so, what exemptive conditions would be necessary
and appropriate in furtherance of the purpose of Section 16(b)?

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under the authority of 2 U.S.C. 136, the Librarian of Congress is authorized to make rules and regulations for the government
of the Library. 18 U.S.C. 1017 contains criminal provisions on the misuse of official U.S. Government seals. Part
701 is revised to clarify the boundaries of when and how much credit or recognition the Library of Congress should appropriately
receive when its name, seal, or logo are used in conjunction with a commercial product. It outlines also the current
circumstances under which the use of both the name and seals of the Library may be granted and the procedures for doing
so. This part combines and revises the provisions set forth in parts 701.35 and 701.36 of 36 CFR Chapter VII. Part 701.36
of 36 CFR Chapter VII, Use of the Seal of the Library of Congress and the Library of Congress Trust Fund Board, will be
removed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) The name ``Library of Congress,'' or any abbreviation thereof, shall be used officially to represent the Library
of Congress and its programs, projects, functions, activities, or elements thereof. The Library's name shall be
used only when it is in the interest of the Library. Any other use of the Library's name by any person or organization,
except as provided by this part, is prohibited. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Library of Congress seal symbolizes the Library's authority and standing as an official agency of the U.S.
Government. As such, it shall be displayed only on official documents or publications of the Library. The seal of the
Library of Congress Trust Fund Board shall be affixed to documents of that body as prescribed by the Librarian of Congress.
Procedures governing the use of any other Library of Congress logo are set out in paragraphs (c)(3) through (c)(10).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Internal publications.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Each internal Library publication shall include a copy of an official Library logo in a position, format, and location
suitable to the particular media involved. The logo may be alone or in addition to an approved unit or activity logo,
but shall be no less prominent than any other logo used, except in the cases of the Copyright Office, the Congressional

by the Library employee with whom they are dealing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Ordinarily, the Library logo accompanied by a concise acknowledgement should appear in an appropriate and suitable
location on all collaborative and all commercial publications. The Library requires that a credit line accompany
reproductions of images from its collections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The size, location, and other attributes of the logo and credit line should be positioned in such a way that they
do not imply Library endorsement of the publication unless such endorsement is expressly intended by the Library,
as would be the case in copublication or coproduction activities. Use of the Library name or logo in any context suggesting
an explicit or implicit endorsement may be approved in only those instances where the Library has sufficient expertise
to pass judgment on the subject matter, where that expertise has been engaged or applied, and where the terms of the
collaborative undertaking are such that the Library has sufficient control over the publication to make changes
necessary to reflect Library expertise.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposes to take action on the state implementation plan (SIP) submitted
by the State of Idaho Division of Environmental Quality (State or IDEQ) for the purpose of bringing about the attainment
of the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than
or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM&hyph;10) in the Ada County/Boise area. The SIP was submitted by the State to
satisfy certain Federal requirements for an approvable moderate nonattainment area PM&hyph;10 SIP for Ada County/Boise,
Idaho. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In summary, EPA proposes to grant full approval of the emissions inventory and PM&hyph;10 precursor exclusion elements
of the SIP because they are separable and independent elements. EPA proposes limited approval under sections 110(k)(3)
and 301(a) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) of the control measures that have been submitted by the State to date. This limited
approval of the control measures is for the limited purpose of making them federally enforceable and thereby advancing
the Clean Air Act NAAQS-related air quality goals. At the same time, EPA is proposing to disapprove the control measures
as not satisfying the specific requirement under sections 172(c)(1) and 189(a)(1)(C) of the CAA to submit a SIP revision
that includes provisions to assure that reasonably available control measures (RACM) are implemented no later than
December 10, 1993 and to disapprove the attainment demonstration and quantitative milestones and reasonable further
progress (RFP) elements of the Ada County/Boise PM&hyph;10 SIP because the State has not adopted and submitted to
EPA the mandatory wood smoke control ordinances for Eagle, Garden City, Meridian and unincorporated Ada County.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Ada County/Boise, Idaho area was designated nonattainment for PM&hyph;10 and classified as moderate under sections
107(d)(4)(B) and 188(a) of the Clean Air Act, upon enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 (see 56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991) and 40 CFR 81.313). The air quality planning requirements for moderate PM&hyph;10
nonattainment areas are set out in subparts 1 and 4 of title I of the Act.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 EPA has issued a ``General Preamble'' describing EPA's preliminary views on how EPA intends to review SIP's and SIP
revisions submitted under title I of the Act, including those State submittals containing moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment
area SIP requirements (see generally 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) and 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992)). Because EPA is describing
its interpretations here only in broad terms, the reader should refer to the General Preamble for a more detailed discussion
of the interpretations of title I advanced in this proposal and the supporting rationale. In today's rulemaking action
on the State of Idaho's moderate PM&hyph;10 SIP for the Ada County/Boise nonattainment area, EPA is proposing to apply
its interpretations taking into consideration the specific factual issues presented. Additional information
supporting EPA's action on this particular area is available for inspection at the address indicated above. EPA will
consider any timely submitted comments before taking final action on today's proposal.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Those States containing initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas (those areas designated nonattainment
under section 107(d)(4)(B) of the Act) were required to submit, among other things, the following provisions by November
15, 1991: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Provisions to assure that RACM (including such reductions in emissions from existing sources in the area as may
be obtained through the adoption, at a minimum, of reasonably available control technology (RACT)) shall be implemented
no later than December 10, 1993; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Either a demonstration (including air quality modeling) that the plan will provide for attainment as expeditiously
as practicable but no later than December 31, 1994, or a demonstration that attainment by that date is impracticable;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Quantitative milestones which are to be achieved every three years and which demonstrate reasonable further progress
(RFP) toward attainment by December 31, 1994; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Provisions to assure that the control requirements applicable to major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 also
apply to major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 precursors except where the Administrator determines that such
sources do not contribute significantly to PM&hyph;10 levels which exceed the NAAQS in the area. See sections 172(c),
188, and 189 of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States with initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas were required to submit a permit program for the construction
and operation of new and modified major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 by June 30, 1992 (see section 189(a) of the
Act). This permit program element, also known as the New Source Review (NSR) program, was submitted by the State of
Idaho on May 17, 1994. EPA notified Idaho in a June 10, 1994 letter to the Administrator of the IDEQ that the NSR program
submittal was complete. EPA is currently reviewing Idaho's NSR program submittal to determine if the program meets
the requirements of the CAA. EPA intends to take action on Idaho's NSR program in a separate document when EPA has completed
its review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, States containing initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas were required to submit contingency
measures by November 15, 1993 which become effective without further action by the State or EPA upon a determination
by EPA that the area has failed to achieve RFP or to attain the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS by the applicable statutory deadline
(see section 172(c)(9) of the Act and 57 FR 13510&hyph;13512 and 13543&hyph;13544). Contingency measures for the
Ada County/Boise PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area have not yet been submitted by IDEQ. A findings letter, dated January
13, 1994, was mailed to the Governor of Idaho which informed him that the State had failed to make the required PM&hyph;10
contingency measures submittal for Ada County/Boise. The State has until July 13, 1995 to correct this deficiency
for Ada County/Boise, or it will face Federal highway or offset sanctions (see section 179 of the CAA and 58 FR 51270
(October 1, 1993)). EPA intends to take action on the contingency measures for the Ada County/Boise PM&hyph;10 nonattainment
area when this requirement is submitted or intends to impose sanctions in the event this deficiency is not corrected.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. This Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 110(k) of the Act sets out provisions governing EPA's review of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565&hyph;13566).
In this action, as described below, EPA is proposing to grant full approval of the emission inventory element and exclusion
from the PM&hyph;10 precursor control requirements. These elements of the State's moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment
SIP submittal for Ada County/Boise are separable and independent of the provisions that the State has not adequately
addressed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also as described below, EPA is proposing to grant a limited approval of the control measures that have been submitted
by the State as of this date. EPA may grant a limited approval of these control measures under section 110(k)(3) of the
Act, in light of EPA's authority under section 301(a) of the Act to adopt regulations necessary to further air quality
by strengthening the SIP. The proposed approval of these control measures is limited, however, in that EPA is not proposing
that these control measures satisfy the specific requirements of sections 172(c)(1) and 189(a)(1)(C) to implement
RACM, including RACT, in moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas. EPA believes, however, that the control measures
adopted and submitted as of this date will achieve PM&hyph;10 emissions reductions in the Ada County/Boise nonattainment
area. Thus, EPA is proposing to approve these control measures for the limited purpose of strengthening the SIP and
making them federally enforceable (see e.g. sections 113 and 302(q) of the Act). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, because the State has not yet adopted into the SIP and submitted to EPA certain control measures on which it
relies in the SIP to demonstrate timely attainment and continued maintenance of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS in the Ada County
Boise nonattainment area, EPA is proposing to disapprove the RACM (including RACT) element. In addition, because
the attainment demonstration and quantitative milestones and reasonable further progress (RFP) elements of the
Ada County/Boise PM&hyph;10 SIP depend in part on the control measures which the State has not yet adopted and submitted
to EPA, EPA is also proposing to disapprove these elements. If this proposed disapproval becomes final, it will begin
the period for the imposition of discretionary sanctions under section 110(m) of the Act and the 18-month sanctions
clock for the imposition of mandatory sanctions under section 179 of the Act. If finalized, this disapproval will
also authorize EPA to issue a Federal implementation plan as provided in section 110(c)(1) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If, however, prior to EPA's final action on this proposal the State submits the additional control measures on which
it relies and, based on EPA's review, these additional control measures adequately address the outstanding deficiencies,
EPA will consider withdrawing this limited approval/disapproval and will instead propose full approval of the PM&hyph;10
plan for Ada County/Boise relative to those moderate area PM&hyph;10 SIP requirements which were due November 15,
1991. EPA invites public comment on its proposed action.

1. Procedural Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act requires states to observe certain procedural requirements in developing implementation plans and plan
revisions for submission to EPA. Section 110(a)(2) of the Act provides that each implementation plan submitted by
a state must be adopted after reasonable notice and public hearing.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 Section 110(l) of the Act similarly provides that each revision to an implementation plan submitted by a state under
the Act must be adopted by such state after reasonable notice and public hearing.

EPA also must determine whether a submittal is complete and therefore warrants further EPA review and action (see
section 110(k)(1) of the Act and 57 FR 13565). EPA's completeness criteria for SIP submittals are set out at 40 CFR part
51, appendix V. EPA attempts to make completeness determinations within 60 days of receiving a submission. However,
a submittal is deemed complete by operation of law if a completeness determination is not made by EPA six months after
receipt of the submission.

The IDEQ initially held a public hearing on the Ada County/Boise PM&hyph;10 air quality improvement plan on October
11, 1990, and received no public comments regarding the plan. However, following one 24-hour PM&hyph;10 exceedance
on January 7, 1991 and two near exceedances on January 4 and 6, 1991, EPA requested on March 22, 1991 that IDEQ modify
the PM&hyph;10 plan to better ensure healthful air in the future. IDEQ revised the PM&hyph;10 plan and the State of
Idaho subsequently held a public hearing on the modified Ada County/Boise PM&hyph;10 plan on November 4, 1991. Again,
IDEQ received no public comments. The modified PM&hyph;10 plan was then adopted by the State of Idaho on November 14,
1991, and the plan was submitted to EPA on November 15, 1991 as a proposed revision to the SIP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SIP revision was reviewed by EPA to determine completeness shortly after its submittal in accordance with the
completeness criteria set out at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V. A letter dated April 27, 1992 was forwarded to the Administrator
of the Idaho Division of Environmental Quality indicating the completeness of the submittal and the next steps to
be taken in the review process.

2. Accurate Emissions Inventory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 172(c)(3) of the Act requires that nonattainment plan provisions include a comprehensive, accurate, current
inventory of actual emissions from all sources of relevant pollutants in the nonattainment area. The emissions inventory
should also include a comprehensive, accurate, and current inventory of allowable emissions in the area (see e.g.
section 110(a)(2)(K) of the Act). Because the submission of such inventories is necessary to an area's attainment
demonstration (or demonstration that the area cannot practicably attain), the emissions inventories must be received
with the demonstration submission (see 57 FR 13539). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The base year emission inventory (1987) developed for Ada County/Boise identified the major sources of PM&hyph;10
concentrations during 24-hour worst case winter periods as residential wood combustion (71%), fugitive road dust
(15%), industrial (7%) and other sources, including but not limited to, transportation, construction and open burning
(7%). Annual emissions for 1987 were fugitive road dust (51%), residential wood combustion (23%), building construction
(12%), transportation (6%), industrial (6%) and other sources (2%). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing to approve the emissions inventory because it generally appears to be accurate and comprehensive,
and provides a sufficient basis for determining the adequacy of the attainment demonstration for this area consistent
with the requirements of sections 172(c)(3) and 110(a)(2)(K) of the Clean Air Act.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Full approval of this element is appropriate because it is separable and independent of the deficiency which prevents
full approval of the SIP, namely, the adoption and submission of all control measures on which the State relies in the
SIP. The emissions inventory is a separable component of the Ada County/Boise PM&hyph;10 SIP because it represents
an assessment of PM&hyph;10 emissions in the area prior to the adoption of control measures and will not change as the
result of any additional control measures adopted. For further details, see the Technical Support Document (TSD)
corresponding with this action, which is available at the EPA address indicated above.

3. Control Measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted above, the initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas must submit provisions to assure that RACM (including
RACT) are implemented no later than December 10, 1993 (see sections 172(c)(1) and 189(a)(1)(C) of the Act). The General
Preamble contains a detailed discussion of EPA's interpretation of the RACM (including RACT) requirement (see 57
FR 13539&hyph;13545 and 13560&hyph;13561). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In broad terms, the State should identify available control measures evaluating them for their reasonableness in
light of the feasibility of the controls and the attainment needs of the area. A State may reject available control
measures if the measures are technologically infeasible or the cost of the control is unreasonable. In addition,
RACM does not require controls on emissions from sources that are insignificant (i.e. de minimis) and RACM does not
require the implementation of all available control measures where an area demonstrates timely attainment of the
NAAQS and the implementation of additional controls would not expedite attainment (see 57 FR 13540&hyph;13544).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Idaho's SIP submittals for Ada County/Boise do not provide for implementation of control measures which assure timely
attainment of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS, nor, in the alternative, do they show that the adoption of available control measures
would be economically or technologically unreasonable. Therefore, the submittals do not meet the specific statutory
requirements to provide for the implementation of RACM (including RACT) in moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas.

a. Residential Wood Burning Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State relies on control strategies designed to reduce wood smoke for timely attainment of the 24-hour and annual
PM&hyph;10 standards. The residential wood burning program has three main objectives: 1. Reduce wood burning during
critical periods; 2. Improve the performance and efficiency of wood heating equipment; and 3. Provide reasonable
alternatives to wood heat. The State's available control measures to be implemented in the Ada County/Boise nonattainment
area that address the main objectives include the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Episodic Wood Burning Curtailment Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The SIP submittal discusses an episodic two-stage voluntary and mandatory wood burning curtailments in the Ada County/Boise
nonattainment area. The first stage is a voluntary burn ban when 24-hour PM&hyph;10 levels in the nonattainment area
are predicted to equal or exceed 100 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/m3. The 24-hour PM&hyph;10 prediction is made after an IDEQ meteorologist calculates lower atmospheric stability
and evaluates PM&hyph;10 equivalent sampler, nephelometer, upper air temperature sounding, snow cover, surface
temperature, delta temperature, wind speed, cloud cover, National Weather Service and occasionally commercial
weather service data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second stage is a mandatory curtailment program. In 1986, Boise adopted an ordinance imposing a mandatory burn
ban when 24-hour PM&hyph;10 levels actually attain or exceed 110 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/m3, and stable meteorological conditions are expected to persist for the next 24 hours (see Boise City Code, Tit.
4, Ch. 6). This ordinance was amended in January 1993 to reduce the trigger point for mandatory burn bans from 110 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/m3 to 100 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/m3 (see Boise City Code, Sec. 4&hyph;6&hyph;4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SIP states that Garden City also has a mandatory curtailment program, but no documentation of the Garden City program
was included in the initial SIP submittal. The SIP further states that the State would attempt to persuade other Ada
County jurisdictions to implement mandatory curtailment programs similar to the Boise program. To date, EPA has
informally received copies of mandatory wood smoke curtailment ordinances (some are signed and others are unsigned)
for unincorporated Ada County and the cities of Eagle, Garden City and Meridian. These ordinances, however, have
not been adopted into the SIP and have not been formally submitted to EPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its SIP submittal, the State notes that a county-wide

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 mandatory wood smoke curtailment program is necessary to bring the Ada County/Boise nonattainment area into timely
attainment of the NAAQS because approximately 30% of the wood burning in the area occurs outside of areas covered by
mandatory wood burning restrictions. For this reason, the SIP submittal for Ada County/Boise cannot be considered
to satisfy the RACM requirement because the State has not adopted as part of the SIP and submitted to EPA those available
control measures necessary for expeditious attainment of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS (or shown that all economically and
technologically feasible control measures have been implemented and timely attainment is impracticable). Specifically,
the State has not adopted and submitted mandatory burn ban ordinances for Garden City, Eagle, Meridian and unincorporated
Ada County. EPA urges the State to promptly adopt and submit to the EPA the necessary mandatory residential wood smoke
burning ban ordinances on which the State relies in its SIP submittal.

In a letter to the EPA, dated August 14, 1992, the State argued for the exclusion of the locality south of Amity Road and
west of Cloverdale Road (the Kuna area) from proposed mandatory burn bans because the area is located in a separate
stream drainage from the Boise River Valley, and thus does not significantly contribute smoke to the valley where
the PM&hyph;10 exceedances have been recorded. The State also noted that the emission inventory, modeling and visibility
observations indicate that the Kuna area air quality is markedly cleaner than the ambient air in the Boise River Valley,
which includes downtown Boise. EPA acknowledged in an August 27, 1992 letter to IDEQ, that the State had adequately
demonstrated that mandatory burn bans in the Kuna area were unnecessary to demonstrate attainment and EPA formally
proposes to make this determination in today's action.

Although the SIP submittal cannot be considered to satisfy the RACM requirement at this time, EPA is proposing limited
approval of the Boise wood smoke control ordinance, Boise City Code Tit. 4, Ch. 6, pursuant to sections 110(k)(3) and
301(a) of the Act in order to strengthen the SIP and make the ordinance federally enforceable. EPA believes that this
control measure will result in reductions in PM&hyph;10 emissions in the nonattainment area and thus advance the
Act's air quality-related protection goals.

(2) Wood Smoke Public Education/Awareness Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The wood smoke public education/awareness program for the Ada County/Boise nonattainment area plays a critical
role in achieving the aforementioned three main objectives of IDEQ's residential wood burning program. The wood
smoke public education/awareness program was first officially initiated in 1986, following the passage of Boise's
local wood burning ordinance. Brochures, television and radio public service announcements, newspaper advertisements,
outreach meetings at public schools, media interviews and press conferences are the main components of the integrated
awareness package. Various points have been focused on during the program's existence, including the nature of the
wood smoke problem, health impacts, meteorological factors (including tips asking citizens to refrain from burning
on clear, calm and/or cool days) and how to burn cleaner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IDEQ and the City of Boise are responsible for a majority of the continuing wood smoke public education/awareness
program. According to IDEQ, local surveys and building department statistics show reductions in the numbers of wood
stoves installed, reduction in the average volume of wood burned per household and widespread public cooperation
during poor air quality periods as the result of the wood smoke public education efforts. These surveys and statistics
are the basis for the 10% annual credit IDEQ is claiming for the wood smoke public education/awareness program during
1990 through the year 2000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that IDEQ has adequately demonstrated, through surveys and building department statistics, that the
well-established, extensive, wood smoke public education/awareness program for the Ada County/Boise PM&hyph;10
nonattainment area has achieved at least a 10 percent wood smoke emission reduction. Therefore, EPA proposes limited
approval of the wood smoke public education/awareness program described in the Ada County/Boise SIP as a SIP strengthening
measure and proposes to accept the 10 percent credit requested by the IDEQ.

(3) Wood Stove Certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The City of Boise's 1986 wood burning ordinance initiated a requirement mandating all wood burning appliances sold
and installed within the city to be certified as meeting certain emission standards (see Boise City Code, Sec. 4&hyph;6&hyph;9).
The ordinance is enforced by city and county building department inspectors. The initial certification program
was based on the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality standards. The current program is based on the national
wood burning device New Source Performance Standards developed by the EPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The implementation and enforcement of the certification program resulted in the City of Boise accelerating the introduction
of certified stoves and the phase-out of old, high emission uncertified stoves. However, IDEQ does not take any credit
for the emission reductions that have resulted from the wood stove certification program.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
According to the SIP submittal, Meridian, Eagle, Garden City, unincorporated Ada County, Nampa and Emmett also require
that only certified wood stoves be sold and installed within their respective jurisdictions. However, no documentation
(i.e. ordinances) supporting this statement was included in the SIP submittal.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based upon the enforceability of the City of Boise wood stove certification program and its advancement of the PM&hyph;10
air quality goals, EPA is proposing limited approval of this program as a SIP strengthening measure.

(4) Wood Stove Change-Out Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An initial feature of the City of Boise's 1986 wood burning ordinance was the development of a financial incentive
program to replace uncertified wood stoves with certified stoves (see Boise City Code, Sec. 4&hyph;6&hyph;18).
Low or no interest loans were offered to individuals participating in the program. In order to receive a loan, the participant
was required to give the uncertified wood stove to the city building department for destruction. The loan program
began in September 1986 and ended in September 1988. Approximately $800,000 in loans were made, resulting in the replacement
of 494 uncertified wood stoves with cleaner heating devices. IDEQ does not take credit for reductions in the emissions,
even though 84 uncertified wood stoves were removed from the airshed after the area source emission inventory base
year (1987).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Idaho Department of Water Resources (IDWR) also operated a wood stove change-out loan program, which ran from
May 1987 to May 1993. 186 uncertified wood stoves were changed-out with cleaner heating devices during that period,
with a majority of the replacements occurring during 1988&hyph;1993. Again, IDEQ did not take credit for these PM&hyph;10
emission reductions. Both the Boise and IDWR wood stove change-out loan programs strengthen the SIP and further assure
that these wood smoke sources will not contribute to a future PM&hyph;10 exceedance. Accordingly, EPA proposes limited
approval of the wood stove change-out loan program because it strengthens the SIP and enhances PM&hyph;10 air quality
protection for the Ada County/Boise PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area.

b. Other Sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted, RACM does not require controls on emissions from sources that are insignificant (i.e. de minimis) and does
not require the implementation of all available control measures where an area demonstrates timely attainment and
the implementation of additional controls would not expedite attainment (see 57 FR 13540&hyph;13544).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IDEQ has determined, through its analysis of the nonattainment area, that road dust contributed 15 percent of the
PM&hyph;10 concentration on the worst case day in base year 1987. IDEQ did not propose controls for road dust. Rather,
the State relies on wood smoke controls to demonstrate timely attainment of the 24-hour PM&hyph;10 standard, concluding
that the implementation of additional control measures for road dust would not expedite attainment. However, the
State's control strategy assumes the timely adoption and submittal of effective and enforceable mandatory wood
smoke curtailment ordinances for the remainder of the nonattainment area. While such mandatory wood smoke curtailment
ordinances, in conjunction with the other wood smoke controls described above, may demonstrate attainment of the
standard, all of these control measures have not in fact been submitted. Thus, RACM is not met because it has not been
demonstrated that the implementation of available control measures could not expedite attainment or that the implementation
of such measures is technologically or economically unreasonable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is EPA's view that RACM does not require the implementation of controls for prescribed silvicultural and agricultural
burning for the Ada County/Boise nonattainment area because the area is not significantly impacted by those activities.
Similarly, EPA believes that RACT does not require the implementation of control technology for stationary sources
of PM&hyph;10 in the nonattainment area, because the area is primarily characterized by commercial, residential
and light industrial uses. There are currently no major stationary sources operating in the Ada County/Boise PM&hyph;10
nonattainment area and large stationary sources do not contribute significantly to the PM&hyph;10 air quality problem
in Boise.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, EPA is proposing to approve, under the authority of sections 110(k)(3) and 301(a) of the Act and for the
limited purpose of strengthening the SIP and making such control measures federally enforceable, the control measures
that have been submitted to date as part of the PM&hyph;10 SIP for the Ada County/Boise nonattainment area. These measures
include the voluntary episodic wood burning curtailment program for the entire nonattainment area, the mandatory
episodic wood burning curtailment program for the City of Boise, the wood smoke public education/awareness program,
the wood stove certification program and the wood stove change-out program. A final limited approval of these existing
control measures would not mean that EPA has approved these control measures as satisfying the specific Act requirement
for the State to implement RACM (including RACT) in moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas (see sections 172(c)(1)
and 189(a)(1)(C)). Rather, limited approval of these measures by EPA means only that these control requirements
become part of the applicable implementation plan and are federally enforceable by EPA (see, e.g., sections 302(q)
and 113 of the Act). EPA is concurrently proposing to disapprove the RACM (including RACT) element because the State
has not adopted and submitted to EPA all of the mandatory wood smoke control ordinances on which it relies in its SIP
submittal. A final disapproval of the Ada County/Boise PM&hyph;10 SIP RACM (including RACT) element would start
the 18 month clock for the imposition of mandatory sanctions under section 179 of the Act and the two-year clock for
the promulgation of a Federal Implementation Plan under section 110(c)(1) of the Act.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas must submit a demonstration (including air quality modeling) showing
that the plan will provide for attainment as expeditiously as practicable but no later than December 31, 1994 (see
section 189(a)(1)(B) of the Act). The General Preamble sets out EPA's guidance on the use of modeling for moderate
area attainment demonstrations (57 FR 13539). Alternatively, the State must show attainment by December 31, 1994
is impracticable. The 24-hour PM&hyph;10 NAAQS is 150 micrograms/cubic meter (

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated in the General Preamble, 57 FR 13539, EPA has developed a supplemental attainment demonstration policy
for initial PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas. This policy provides additional flexibility in meeting the PM&hyph;10
attainment demonstration requirements. An earlier April 2, 1991 memorandum titled, ``PM&hyph;10 Moderate Area
SIP Guidance: Final Staff Work Product'' contained ``Attachment 5'' describing the same policy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IDEQ conducted an attainment demonstration based upon WYNDvalley, a non-guideline dispersion model that EPA recommended
be used in the Ada County/Boise nonattainment area. WYNDvalley is applicable in light and variable wind scenarios
in regions influenced by complex terrain. Cold temperatures and light winds with limited vertical mixing create
stagnant weather conditions in the Boise River Valley. All of the PM&hyph;10 exceedances observed in the Ada County/Boise
nonattainment area have occurred during stagnant wintertime conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The attainment demonstration indicates that the Ada County/Boise nonattainment area will be in attainment of the
24-hour PM&hyph;10 NAAQS during the entire period of 1993 to 2000, with the maximum predicted 24-hour concentration
of 147

 occurring in 1995. The demonstration also addresses the quantitative milestone requirement (discussed below)
by showing that the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS will be maintained after December 31, 1994 by predicting a 24-hour worst case
day design concentration of 144

 for the year 2000. According to EPA's review, which corrected for the use of non-reference PM&hyph;10 data in 1986
and 1987 (i.e. Hi-Vol SA321A gravimetric PM&hyph;10 sampler), the Ada County/Boise area has never violated the annual
arithmetic mean PM&hyph;10 standard. The highest valid three-year annual average in the nonattainment area is 43

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The control strategy used to achieve these design concentrations and demonstrate attainment of both the 24-hour
and annual PM&hyph;10 standards, however, relies on mandatory wood smoke control programs in Eagle, Garden City,
Meridian and unincorporated Ada County. As discussed above in the section titled ``Control Measures,'' the State
has not adopted these ordinances as part of the SIP and submitted them to EPA. Accordingly, EPA proposes to disapprove
the attainment demonstration. More detailed description of the attainment demonstration is contained in the TSD
accompanying this document.

5. Quantitative Milestones and Reasonable Further Progress (RFP)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area plan revisions demonstrating attainment must contain quantitative milestones
which are to be achieved every three years until the area is redesignated attainment and which demonstrate RFP, as
defined in section 171(1) of the Act, toward attainment by December 31, 1994 (see section 189(c) of the CAA).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although section 189(c) plainly provides that quantitative milestones are to be achieved until an area is redesignated
attainment, it is silent in indicating the starting point for counting the first three-year period or how many milestones
must be initially addressed. In the General Preamble, EPA addressed the statutory gap in the starting point for counting
the three-year milestones, indicating that it would begin from the due date for the applicable implementation plan
revision containing the control measures for the area (i.e., November 15, 1991 for initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment
areas (see 57 FR 13539)). As to the number of milestones, EPA believes that at least two milestones must be initially
addressed. Thus, submittals to address the SIP revisions due on November 15, 1991 for the initial moderate PM&hyph;10
nonattainment areas must demonstrate that two milestones will be achieved (1st milestone: November 15, 1991 through
November 15, 1994; 2nd milestone: November 15, 1994 through November 15, 1997). For areas that demonstrate timely
attainment of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS, the second milestone should, at a minimum, provide for continued maintenance
of the standards.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 189(c) provides that quantitative milestones are to be achieved ``until the area is redesignated attainment.''
However, this endpoint for quantitative milestones is speculative because redesignation for an area as attainment
is contingent upon several factors and future events. Therefore, EPA believes it is reasonable for States to initially
address at least the first two milestones. Addressing two milestones will ensure that the State continues to maintain
the NAAQS beyond the attainment date for at least some period during which an area could be redesignated attainment.
However, in all instances, additional milestones must be addressed if an area is not redesignated attainment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the initial PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas that demonstrate attainment, the emissions reduction progress
made between the SIP submittal (due date of November 15, 1991) and the attainment date of December 31, 1994 (46 days
beyond the November 15, 1994 milestone date) will satisfy the first quantitative milestone. The de minimis timing
differential makes it administratively impracticable to require separate milestone and attainment demonstrations
(see 57 FR 13539). In implementing the quantitative milestone and RFP provisions for this initial moderate area,
EPA has reviewed the attainment demonstration for the area to determine the nature of any milestones necessary to
ensure timely attainment and whether annual incremental reductions should be required in order to ensure attainment
of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS by December 31, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SIP purports to demonstrate attainment by 1994 and maintenance through 2000, which would satisfy three milestones.
However, as discussed above, the maintenance demonstration and, therefore, the quantitative milestones directly
depend on mandatory wood smoke control programs in Eagle, Garden City, Meridian and unincorporated Ada County. As
discussed above in the section titled ``Control Measures,'' the State has not adopted these ordinances as part of
the SIP and submitted them to EPA. Accordingly, EPA proposes to disapprove the quantitative milestone requirement
(see General Preamble, 57 FR 13565 and July 9, 1992 EPA memorandum regarding ``Processing of State Implementation
Plan (SIP) Submittals'').

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The control requirements which are applicable to major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 also apply to major stationary
sources of PM&hyph;10 precursors unless EPA determines such sources do not contribute significantly to PM&hyph;10
levels in excess of the NAAQS in that area (see section 189(e) of the Act). The General Preamble contains guidance addressing
how EPA intends to implement section 189(e) (see 57 FR 13539&hyph;13540 and 13541&hyph;13542).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the emission inventory for the Ada County/Boise PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area did not reveal any major stationary
sources, including any major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 precursors, EPA is proposing to grant the exclusion
from control requirements authorized under section 189(e) for major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 precursors.

All measures and other elements in the SIP must be enforceable by IDEQ and EPA (see sections 172(c)(6) and 110(a)(2)(A)
of the Act and 57 FR 13556). EPA criteria addressing the enforceability of SIP's and SIP revisions were set forth in
a September 23, 1987 memorandum (with attachments) from J. Craig Potter, Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation,

of the control measures and other elements in the SIP (see section 110(a)(2)(C)).

The specific control measures that were submitted as part of the SIP are addressed above under the section headed ``Control
Measures.'' As also discussed in that section, although the State relies on mandatory wood smoke control ordinances
throughout the entire nonattainment area (except for the Kuna area) to demonstrate attainment and maintenance of
the standard, the State has adopted and submitted to EPA a mandatory wood smoke curtailment ordinance only for the
City of Boise. The necessary ordinances for Eagle, Garden City, Meridian and unincorporated Ada County, as well as
evidence that the wood smoke control programs for these areas are adequately funded, implemented, enforced and maintained,
have not been submitted at this time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has reviewed for enforceability the wood smoke ordinance for the City of Boise, which includes the mandatory curtailment
program and the wood stove certification program for Boise, and has determined that it meets all of the criteria included
in the September 23, 1987, Potter Memorandum. Exemptions from the mandatory burn bans are allowed only for the following
reasons and must be approved by the City Building Department: a. wood burning is the resident's sole source of heat;
b. curtailment would cause unreasonable economic hardship for low income households; or c. the wood burning device
being utilized is certified by the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality or EPA as ``clean burning''. This is
consistent with the recommendations for woodburning curtailment programs provided in EPA's Guidance Document
for Residential Wood Combustion Emission Control Measures. The wood stove certification program does not contain
any exemptions. Compliance with wood burning curtailments and the certification program is mainly achieved by responding
to citizen complaints, but the City of Boise has limited personnel that independently monitor for noncompliance.
Enforcement of burn bans and the certification program follows three progressive steps: 1. written warning; 2. fine;
and 3. further legal action against the violator, if needed. IDEQ's submittals and the TSD contain further information
on the enforceability of the Boise wood smoke curtailment ordinance and the personnel and funding intended to support
effective implementation of this ordinance. In these respects, this control measure appears to be enforceable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 110(a)(2)(E) of the Act requires that, where the State has relied on a local or regional government, agency
or instrumentality for the implementation of any plan provision, the plan must provide necessary assurances that
the State has responsibility for ensuring adequate implementation of such plan provision. The State's initial SIP
submittal did not address the requirement of section 110(a)(2)(E). However, in a recent submission from the State
addressing State responsibility for local control measures, such as the Boise wood smoke control ordinance, the
State indicated that it relies on its existing ability to issue an operating permit to any stationary source when the
Department determines that emission reductions from that source are necessary to attain or maintain a NAAQS (see
Idaho Administrative Procedures Act (IDAPA) 16.01.01012.03.c (June 1993); IDAPA 16.01.01401.03 (May 1994)).
The submission includes a copy of an opinion from the Attorney General's office stating that such permits could be
issued to the owners of wood stoves and could include provisions directly implementing local mandatory wood smoke
curtailment ordinances in the event a local entity fails to implement or enforce its respective local ordinance.
This mechanism appears to satisfy the requirements of section 110(a)(2)(E) of the Act for State responsibility for
local wood smoke control ordinances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is reserving judgment on the enforceability of the outstanding control measures (i.e. mandatory wood smoke curtailment
programs for Eagle, Garden City, Meridian and unincorporated Ada County) and the adequacy of the related enforcement
programs until EPA receives and reviews these measures.

8. Contingency Measures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As provided in section 172(c)(9) of the Act, all moderate nonattainment area SIP's that demonstrate attainment must
include contingency measures (see generally 57 FR 13510&hyph;13512 and 13543&hyph;13544). These measures must
have been submitted by November 15, 1993 for the initial moderate nonattainment areas. Contingency measures should
consist of other available measures that are not part of the area's core control strategy . These measures must take
effect without further action by the State or EPA, upon a determination by EPA that the area has failed to make reasonable
further progress or attain the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS by the applicable statutory deadline.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Contingency measures for the Ada County/Boise PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area have not yet been submitted by IDEQ.
A findings letter, dated January 13, 1994, was mailed to the Governor of Idaho informing him that the State had failed
to make the required PM&hyph;10 contingency measures submittal for the Ada County/Boise SIP. The State has until
July 13, 1995 to correct this deficiency for Ada County/Boise, or it will face Federal highway and/or offset sanctions
(see section 179 of the CAA).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA intends to take action on the contingency measures for the Ada County/Boise PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area when
this requirement is submitted or intends to impose sanctions in the event this deficiency is not corrected.

9. Transportation Conformity Protective Finding
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 176(c)(4) of the CAA and the regulations implementing that provision require that transportation plans,
programs, and projects which are funded or approved under title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Act must conform with
State or Federal air quality implementation plans (see 58 FR 62188 (November 24, 1993)). According to 58 FR 62228,
&sect;51.448, areas which submitted a control strategy implementation plan before November 24, 1993 must be demonstrated
to conform according to transitional period criteria and procedures by November 25, 1994. Otherwise, their conformity
status will lapse, and no new project-level conformity determinations may be made. Under 40 CFR 51.448(a)(2),
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 if EPA disapproves a control strategy implementation plan revision submitted by the State and notifies the State,
the Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO), and the Department of Transportation (DOT), the conformity status
of the transportation plan and transportation improvement program (TIP) lapses 120 days after EPA's disapproval.
After that time, no new project-level conformity determinations may be made and no new transportation plan, TIP,
or project may be found to conform until another control strategy implementation plan revision is submitted and conformity
is demonstrated according to transitional period criteria and procedures. Note that these conformity consequences
of a disapproval of a control strategy are in addition to the discretionary sanctions, which may be imposed under section
110(m) of the Act at any time following a disapproval, and the mandatory sanctions, which must be imposed under section
179 of the Act beginning 18 months following a disapproval.

Although &sect;&sect;51.448(d) (2) and (3) by their terms apply to ``areas which submitted a control strategy implementation
plan before November 24, 1993,'' the effective date of the conformity rule, EPA intended that these provisions apply
only to plans on which final action had been taken prior to the effective date of the rule. EPA intended the provisions
of &sect;51.448(a) (2) and (3) to apply to all plans, regardless of the date of submission, on which final action was
not taken until after November 24, 1993. In other words, EPA intended that the conformity status of the transportation
plan and TIP lapse 120 days or, in the case of a protective finding, one year after the later of the effective date of the
conformity rule (November 24, 1994) or the disapproval of the control strategy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 51.448(a)(3), however, allows EPA to extend the 120-day lapse period to one year from the date of disapproval
if EPA determines that the control strategy contained in the revision would have been considered approvable with
respect to requirements for emission reductions if all committed measures had been submitted in enforceable form
as required by section 110(a)(2)(A) of the Act. If EPA makes such a ``protective finding,'' the transportation conformity
plan and TIP will be valid for 12 months following the date of disapproval and the conformity status of the transportation
plan and TIP will lapse 12 months following the date of disapproval unless within that time another control strategy
implementation plan revision is submitted to EPA and found to be complete.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If, as proposed in this action, EPA disapproves the control strategy in the moderate area SIP for the Ada County/Boise
nonattainment area, under &sect;51.448(a)(2) the conformity status of the transportation plan and TIP would lapse
120 days after the effective date of the disapproval. EPA has evidence, however, that the wood smoke control ordinances
for the cities of Eagle, Garden City and Meridian, and unincorporated Ada County are enforceable as a matter of local
law, and believes that these control measures would have been considered approvable with respect to requirements
for emission reductions if each of these control measures had been submitted to EPA in enforceable form as required
by section 110(a)(2)(A). Therefore, EPA proposes that the 120-day lapse period be extended to one year under 40 CFR
51.448(a)(3). Accordingly, if EPA takes final action on this proposal, and the RACM (including RACT) requirement,
attainment demonstration and quantitative milestones and RFP elements of the Ada County/Boise moderate PM&hyph;10
nonattainment SIP are disapproved, then the State of Idaho's transportation plan and TIP may be found to conform for
12 months past the effective date of the PM&hyph;10 SIP disapproval. The conformity status of the transportation
plan and TIP would then lapse 12 months following the effective date of final action on this proposal unless within
that time another control strategy implementation plan revision is submitted to EPA and found to be complete.

III. Implications of This Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing to approve the emission inventory and, as described in the TSD, several submittals to address requirements
of section 110(a)(2) of the Act, including the: a. Monitoring network (CAA section 110(a)(2)(B)); b. consultation
and public notification/process (CAA section 110(a)(2)(J); c. provisions for revising the plan (CAA section 110(a)(2)(H));
and d. prohibiting sources from significantly impacting other states (CAA section 110(a)(2)(D)). EPA is also proposing
to grant the exclusion from precursor control requirements authorized under section 189(e) of the Act. EPA is proposing
limited approval of the control measures that have been submitted by the State as of this date under the authority of
sections 110(k)(3) and 301(a) of the Act for the limited purpose of strengthening the SIP and making them federally
enforceable. EPA believes making these control measures federally enforceable will achieve PM&hyph;10 emissions
reductions in the Ada County/Boise nonattainment area and, therefore, advances the NAAQS-related goals of the CAA.
EPA is proposing disapproval of these control measures as meeting the RACM (including RACT) requirement, because
the State has not adopted as part of the SIP and submitted to EPA those available control measures necessary for expeditious
attainment of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS (or shown that all economically and technologically feasible control measures
have been implemented and timely attainment is impracticable), specifically, mandatory burn ban ordinances for
Garden City, Eagle, Meridian and unincorporated Ada County. In addition, because the attainment demonstration
and quantitative milestones and reasonable further progress (RFP) elements of the Ada County/Boise PM&hyph;10
SIP depend in part on the control measures which the State has not yet adopted and submitted to EPA, EPA is also proposing
to disapprove these elements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A final disapproval of these Ada County/Boise PM&hyph;10 SIP elements will authorize the imposition of discretionary
sanctions under section 110(m) of the Act, and will institute the 18-month clock for the imposition of mandatory sanctions
under section 179 of the Act and the two-year clock for the promulgation of a Federal Implementation Plan under section
110(c)(1) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If, however, the State submits the additional control measures on which it relies in its SIP submittal and, based on
EPA's review, these additional control measures adequately address the outstanding deficiencies, EPA will consider
withdrawing this limited approval/disapproval and instead proposing full approval of the PM&hyph;10 plan for Ada
County/Boise relative to those moderate area PM&hyph;10 SIP requirements which were due November 15, 1991.

V. Administrative Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2224), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The OMB has exempted this regulatory action from E.O. 12866 review.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIP approvals under sections 110 and 301 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply
approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose
any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its
actions concerning SIPs on such grounds (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Union Electric Co. v. U.S.E.P.A.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)). EPA's disapproval of the State request under section
110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA does not affect any existing requirements applicable to small entities. Any
pre-existing Federal requirements remain in place after this disapproval. Federal disapproval of the State submittal
does not affect its state-enforceability. Moreover, EPA's disapproval of the submittal does not impose any new Federal
requirements. Therefore, EPA certifies that this disapproval action does not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities because it does not impose any new Federal requirements.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This document announces that NHTSA is considering the proposal of a minimum driving range for dual fueled electric
passenger automobiles, otherwise known as hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). The purpose of establishing the range
is to encourage the production of HEVs. An HEV which meets the range would qualify to have its fuel economy calculated
according to a special procedure that would facilitate the efforts of its manufacturer to comply with the corporate
average fuel economy standards. Comments are requested to assist the agency in developing the proposed range.

<SUPPLEM>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Alternative Motor Fuels Act of 1988 (AMFA), as amended by the Energy Policy Act of 1992, has two essential purposes:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) To encourage the development and widespread use of methanol, ethanol, natural gas, other gaseous fuels, and electricity
as transportation fuels by consumers; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) To promote the production of alternatively fueled motor vehicles.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To achieve those purposes, the AMFA provides that alternatively fueled motor vehicles that meet an appropriate minimum
driving range qualify for special treatment in the calculation of their fuel economy for purpose of their manufacturers'
compliance with the corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The inclusion of electricity in the list of alternative fuels covered by the AMFA necessitates that a minimum driving
range be established for dual fueled electric passenger automobiles for fuel economy credit purposes. The AMFA specifies
a minimum driving range of 200 miles for dual fueled passenger cars (other than dual fueled electric) when operating
on the alternative fuel, but allows the Secretary of Transportation to establish the minimum driving range for dual
fueled electric passenger cars.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this notice is to seek public comments about HEVs that would aid the agency in developing a proposed driving
range. The AMFA and Energy Policy Act provisions, which are codified at 49 U.S.C. sections 32901(c) and 32905, require
the Secretary of Transportation to establish a minimum driving range for dual fueled electric vehicles. This minimum
range requirement applies to passenger automobiles only. It does not apply to dual fueled light trucks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In seeking to carry out its goals, the Act attempts to balance two competing objectives:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Encouraging the production of alternatively fueled vehicles by offering CAFE standard compliance incentives;
and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Encouraging the purchase of alternatively fueled vehicles by consumers by providing the incentives to only those
vehicles whose range of operation is large enough to meet consumer needs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The setting of a minimum driving range for dual fueled electric automobiles must balance the needs of the consumer
with the technical and economic considerations that are faced by the manufacturers. A low minimum driving range eligibility
criterion might encourage the production of dual fueled cars, but lead to dual fueled electric vehicles being designed
with such a low alternative fuel driving range that consumers do not buy them or, even if they buy them, infrequently
operate them on the alternative fuel. Conversely, an excessively stringent minimum driving range eligibility criterion
might discourage the production of dual fueled electric cars and unnecessarily compromise other vehicle attributes
and aspects of performance. Manufacturers would be discouraged by an overly-stringent minimum range because a vehicle
which does not meet the minimum driving range for its type is unlikely to be built since the manufacturer would not receive
any of the benefits or incentives provided by the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
From the viewpoint of the consumer, the necessary driving range may be dictated by the convenience of a range that permits
a typical workweek travel distance, or a daily travel distance for a fleet car. Also, if the majority of consumers would
use a dual fueled electric vehicle in an urban area with more recharging stations or in a fleet application with a central
recharging station, a large driving range may be less critical.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whether the range is large or small, the agency will need a method of measuring the range of HEVs. NHTSA is considering
basing the dual fueled electric vehicle driving range on procedures established by a Society of Automobile Engineers
(SAE) committee. The SAE is currently developing procedures for chassis dynamometer measurements of range, electrical
energy consumption, fuel economy, and exhaust emissions of HEVs. In a brief overview, the SAE HEV Test Procedure Task
Force committee's actions will include:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To aid the agency in relating the data on driving range for dual fueled electric vehicles to the unique characteristics
of dual fueled passenger automobiles, NHTSA is posing a number of questions in the following areas on the use of dual
fueled electric passenger automobiles, as well as any other relevant areas such as:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Consumer acceptability,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Economic practicability,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Technology,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Environmental impact,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Safety,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Driveability, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Performance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Information on other factors is also welcome. The data provided in response to these questions will be considered
by NHTSA in developing a proposed minimum driving range for dual fueled electric passenger automobiles. The data
will also aid the agency in making preliminary judgments about such fundamental matters as the extent to which manufacturers
would seek to achieve the selected range in designing dual fueled electric passenger automobiles, the production
volumes or schedules for those vehicles, the cost and other implications of different ranges, and the likely consumer
acceptability of different driving ranges. For easy reference, the questions are numbered consecutively throughout
the document.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In providing a comment on a particular matter or in responding to a particular question, interested persons are requested
to provide any relevant factual information to support their conclusions or opinions, including but not limited
to test data, statistical and cost data, and the source of such information. The agency is particularly interested
in quantitative evaluations of anticipated environmental impacts and energy conservation impacts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA requests information and comments on the following questions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. How should minimum driving ranges for dual fuel electric passenger automobiles be determined? Is there any trend
toward increased or decreased driving ranges?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Can the vehicle operate solely on electricity or must the auxiliary power source be activated in order to follow
the EPA driving cycle? How would you compute driving range on electricity if the auxiliary power source is activated
during the driving cycle? What if the other power source is also alternative fueled?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Can the SAE procedure be adapted for use with the EPA urban and highway cycles for determining driving range? Why
or why not? Is there some other test procedure that will be suitable for dual fueled electric vehicle?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Would dual fueled electric vehicles be generally utilized by consumers residing in urban areas and by fleets where
it would be practical to provide for recharging at centralized facilities as opposed to consumers in rural areas?
Also, where would it be practical to recharge the battery?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. What driving range does the consumer expect from the passenger cars that he/she operates on electricity? Does the
range vary with the size or typical use of the car; e.g., a subcompact car as compared to a large station wagon, or a car
typically used for city commuting compared to one used primarily for urban and intercity driving? Does the expected
driving range vary with the economic or social profile of the car operator; e.g., are younger drivers satisfied with
smaller ranges or do high-income drivers demand greater driving ranges? Would the consumer be willing to accept a
lower driving range in a vehicle with the added flexibility of dual fuel capability or with more recharging points
and shorter waiting times? What is the minimum driving range acceptable to consumers?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Do vehicle manufacturers consider availability of fuel distribution or recharging points in establishing driving
ranges?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Describe any trade-off for the design of the vehicle with cost that would dictate an upper limit of driving range
for economic practicability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Discuss reduction in vehicle driving range due to climate control energy demand. Discuss any new technology utilized
in vehicle design and in advanced heating and cooling approaches to mitigate range reduction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Describe how the weight/size of the battery pack will affect the driving range on dual fueled electric passenger
cars. What determines this result?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Does the specific driving range of dual fueled electric cars create any environmental impacts that could be mitigated
by choosing a different range or battery capacity? Please discuss the basis for your answer (e.g., (1) setting the
minimum driving range so high that manufacturers could meet it only with battery technologies that employ more harmful
chemicals, (2) setting the minimum driving range so high that manufacturers would be discouraged from trying to meet
it, or so low that consumers wouldn't buy it, thus delaying the development or use of these cleaner technologies, and
(3) setting the minimum driving range so low that the consumer would frequently be forced to use the more polluting
non-electric fuel.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. For longer driving range on electric power, please discuss any significant safety or fire problems for the occupants
of the dual fueled car or any object with which the car may collide. Is there an optimum battery capacity that would minimize
potential safety problems for the electrolyte spillage, shock or fire? Please explain your answer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. Would the driveability (i.e., handling and performance) of a dual fueled electric car be penalized by a requirement
for a driving range comparable to that for typical gasoline-fueled cars? Can an optimum driving range standard for
dual fueled electric vehicles be established from driveability considerations? Please explain your answer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. Is it likely that dual fueled electric passenger car applications may have decreased performance capabilities
when powered by electricity (e.g., predominately city driving, acceleration, top speed, and gradeability limit)
and consequently result in lower consumer expectations for driving range. Please discuss your answer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. How do style or appearance considerations affect the space for the batteries and, therefore, minimum driving
range? How will minimum driving range limit the storage space in the trunk of the vehicle?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. What other factors, if any, should the agency consider in establishing the driving ranges for dual fueled electric
passenger cars when operated on electricity?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. What do you recommend as the minimum driving range for dual fueled electric passenger cars when operating on electricity?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. What safety problems could arise if both battery acid and the second fuel spilled and mixed during an accident?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
18. What kinds of range extenders are manufacturers considering for use in dual fueled electric vehicles (e.g., flywheels,
hydraulic accumulators, small range heat engines, fuel cell systems, etc.)?

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pursuant to section 184 of the Clean Air Act, the Northeast Ozone Transport Commission recommended that EPA require
all state members of the OTC to adopt an Ozone Transport Commission Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In today's supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPRM), EPA is proposing to find that reduction of new motor
vehicle emissions through OTC LEV or LEV-equivalent program is necessary to mitigate the effects of pollution transport
and to bring nonattainment areas in the OTR into attainment and to avoid interference with maintenance. EPA believes
an alternative federal low emission vehicle program can be developed that would achieve reductions equivalent to
or greater than the OTC LEV program. EPA also believes there could be significant additional benefits from such a program
and proposes in today's notice a process by which development of such a program could continue. The Agency intends
to work with stakeholders in this effort. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the absence of such a program, however, EPA is proposing under sections 184(c) and 110(k)(5) of the Act that the
OTC LEV program is necessary throughout the OTR and is consistent with the Act. EPA is thus proposing a SIP call under
section 110(k)(5) to require each state in the OTR to revise its SIP to include the OTC LEV program within one year. Today's
notice also proposes regulations determining ``model year'' for purposes of section 177 and part A of title II of the
Act as that term is applied to on-highway motor vehicles.

This proposal supplements EPA's April 26 proposal, and EPA does not intend to thereby withdraw from consideration
any of the various elements previously proposed. Rather, EPA intends to focus for purposes of public comment on EPA's
proposed specific approach to, and basis for, approving the OTC LEV recommendation. In addition, EPA is proposing
today ``model year'' regulations that are relevant to, but beyond the specific scope of EPA's April 26 proposal.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
A. Overview of Title I Scheme 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The OTC's recommendation under section 184(c) of the Act that EPA mandate that states in the OTR adopt the LEV program
arises in the context of the program designed to address ozone (or ``smog'') pollution in subpart 2 of part D of title
I of the Act. This program is described in detail in EPA's General Preamble for the Implementation of Title I of the Clean
Air Act Amendments of 1990, 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992), and the Nitrogen Oxides Supplement to the General Preamble,
57 FR 55620 (Nov. 25, 1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of provisions in subpart 2 and elsewhere in the Act are particularly important to emphasize here. Part D establishes
a system for more polluted areas to have more time to attain the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and
subjects those more polluted areas to a graduated program of additional and more stringent specific control requirements
to be accomplished over the longer timeframe. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 181(a) provides for classification of ozone nonattainment areas based on the degree of the nonattainment
problem in the area (as measured by the area's ozone design value), and provides that attainment ``shall be as expeditiously
as practicable but not later than'' specified deadlines expressed as years after enactment. The areas and the corresponding
attainment deadlines are: Marginal (1993); moderate (1996); serious (1999); severe (2005 or 2007, depending on
the design value); and extreme (2010). The Act also provides for designation of areas as attainment or as ``unclassifiable.''
All classifications other than extreme are represented in the OTR. Section 184(b) also specifies additional requirements
applicable for attainment areas in ozone transport regions, including: (1) Enhanced vehicle inspection and maintenance
programs in cities meeting specified size thresholds; (2) state-wide implementation of reasonably available control
measures (RACT); (3) ``Stage II'' vehicle refueling vapor controls or ``comparable measures''; and (4) treatment
of major stationary sources of ozone precursors as if they were in moderate nonattainment areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 182 establishes the graduated control measures applicable for each nonattainment classification. These
measures are additive in that the higher classifications must generally adopt, in addition to measures specifically
applicable to that higher classification, all measures identified for lower classifications as well. A basic requirement
applicable to marginal and above classifications is that states are to submit inventories of actual emissions from
all sources in each nonattainment area. See sections 182(a)(1) and 172(c)(3). These emissions inventories may be
important in determining whether the LEV program is necessary in the OTR. The inventories are critical inputs for
models used to determine the magnitude of emissions reductions that may be needed for attainment and the effectiveness
of various measures to obtain such reductions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another potentially key requirement is that moderate and above areas must submit attainment demonstrations. Under
section 182(b)(1)(A), for moderate and above areas, states are to specify in their plans specific annual reductions
in emissions ``as necessary to attain the [NAAQS] for ozone by the attainment date applicable under this Act.'' Under
section 182(c)(2)(A), for serious and above areas, states are to submit a demonstration that the SIP, ``as revised,
will provide for attainment of the ozone [NAAQS] by the applicable attainment date.'' Further, this provision continues,
``[t]his attainment demonstration must be based on photochemical grid modeling or any other analytical method determined
by the Administrator, in the Administrator's discretion, to be at least as effective.'' The modeling information
is, of course, important to determining the reductions necessary in areas to achieve attainment throughout the OTR.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is also relevant that states are obligated to adopt various measures specified for progress toward attainment,
and to achieve certain percentage reductions in emissions by interim dates. In general, section 172(c)(2) requires
that SIPs ``require reasonable further progress'' (RFP), defined in section 171(1) to mean ``such annual incremental
reductions in emissions of the relevant air pollutant as are required by this part or may reasonably be required by
the Administrator for the purpose of ensuring attainment of the [NAAQS] by the applicable date.'' Section 182(b)
specifically provides that, by November 15, 1993, states were to submit SIP revisions for moderate and above areas
providing for, with a limited feasibility exception, a 15% reduction by 1996 in emissions of volatile organic compounds
(VOCs) from a 1990 baseline. Further, section 182(c)(2)(B) provides that, by November 15, 1994, states are to submit
SIP revisions for serious and above areas that will result, subject to a limited feasibility exception, in additional
reductions in VOC emissions from the 1990 baseline of 3% each year averaged over consecutive 3-year periods beginning
in 1996 and until the attainment date. Section 182(c)(2)(C) provides for substitution of reductions in emissions
of nitrogen oxides (NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) for VOC, in accordance with EPA guidance. These RFP requirements establish minimum reductions that certain nonattainment
areas in the OTR will be required to achieve apart from whether EPA approves or disapproves the OTC recommendation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, section 110 of the Act establishes general requirements for SIPs. Section 110(a)(2) specifies minimum
elements of a state's SIP, and subparagraph (D) specifies that a state's SIP shall: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Contain adequate provisions_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Prohibiting, consistent with the provisions of this title, any source or other type of emissions activity within
the State from emitting any air pollutant in amounts which will_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(I) Contribute significantly to nonattainment in, or interfere with maintenance by, any other State with respect
to any such national primary or secondary ambient air quality standard.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This provision, as discussed in detail below, is the key mechanism under the transport provisions of sections 176A
and 184, and is central to the OTC recommendation and to EPA's action on it.

B. Ozone Transport Region Provisions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OTR was established by operation of law under section 184 of the Act and is comprised of the States of Connecticut,
Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont,
the District of Columbia, and the portion of Virginia that is within the Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area
that includes the District of Columbia. Congress established the OTR in the 1990 Amendments to the Act based on the
recognition that the transport of ozone and ozone precursors throughout the region may render the northeast states'
attainment strategies interdependent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 184, the Administrator established a Northeast Ozone Transport Commission for the OTR consisting
of the Governors of each state or their designees, the Administrator or her designee, the Regional Administrators
for the EPA regional offices affected (or the Administrator's designees), and an air pollution control official
representing each state in the region, appointed by the Governor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 184(c) specifies a procedure for the OTC to develop recommendations for additional control measures to be
applied within all or a part of the OTR if the OTC determines that such measures are necessary to bring any area in the
OTR into attainment for ozone by the applicable dates in the Act. Section 184(c)(1) provides that:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Upon petition of any States within a transport region for ozone, and based on a majority vote of the Governors on the
Commission (or their designees), the Commission may, after notice and opportunity for public comment, develop recommendations
for additional control measures to be applied within all or a part of such transport region if the commission determines
such measures are necessary to bring any area in such region into attainment by the dates provided by [subpart 2 of part
D of title I of the Clean Air Act].
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 184(c) also lays out procedures the Administrator is to follow in responding to recommendations from the
OTC. Upon receipt of the recommendations, the Administrator is to publish a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice stating that the recommendations are available and providing an opportunity for a public hearing within 90
days. The Administrator is also to ``commence a review of the recommendations to determine whether the control measures
in the recommendations are necessary to bring any area in such region into attainment by the dates provided by [subpart
2] and are otherwise consistent with [the] Act.'' Finally, in undertaking her review, the Administrator is to consult
with members of the OTC and is to take into account the data, views, and comments received pursuant to the public hearing.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Last, sections 184(c)(4) and (5) govern EPA's response to the OTC recommendations. The Administrator is to determine
whether to approve, disapprove, or partially approve and partially disapprove the recommendations within nine
months of receipt. For any disapproval, the Administrator is to specify: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Why any disapproved additional control measures are not necessary to bring any area in such region into attainment
by the dates provided by [subpart 2] or are otherwise not consistent with the Act; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Recommendations concerning equal or more effective actions that could be taken by the commission to conform
the disapproved portion of the recommendations to the requirements of [section 184]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 184(c)(5) provides that, upon approval or partial approval of any recommendations, the Administrator is
to issue to each state in the OTR to which an approved requirement applies a finding under section 110(k)(5) that the
SIP for that state is inadequate to meet the requirements of section 110(a)(2)(D), quoted above. Under section 184(c)(5),
the Administrator's finding of inadequacy under section 110(a)(2)(D) is to require that each affected state revise
its SIP to include the approved additional control measures within one year after the finding is issued. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, section 184(d) provides that, for purposes of section 184, the Administrator is to ``promulgate criteria
for purposes of determining the contribution of sources in one area to concentrations of ozone'' in another nonattainment
area. These criteria are to ``require that the best available air quality monitoring and modeling techniques be used
for purposes of making such determinations.'' EPA issued such criteria in 1991.

C. Background Regarding OTC LEV Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administrator convened the OTC on May 7, 1991. Thereafter, the OTC moved to work toward a regional ozone strategy
with emphasis on consensus agreements to adopt regional measures to address the ozone problem in the Northeast. To
address the contribution of motor vehicles to the northeast ozone problem, the OTC focused early on emissions standards
for new motor vehicles and on adoption of federal reformulated gasoline throughout the OTR as potential additional
control measures. The Act, however, imposes certain limitations on the states' ability to adopt new motor vehicle
emissions standards.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 209 of the Act generally preempts states from establishing new motor vehicle emissions standards, leaving
such regulation to EPA under section 202 of the Act. Section 209 does, however, provide an exception for California
to adopt new motor vehicle emissions standards where the Administrator grants a preemption waiver based on a finding
that California's standards will be, ``in the aggregate, at least as protective of public health and welfare as applicable
Federal standards.'' Further, under section 177 of the Act, any state which has SIP provisions approved under part
D of title I may adopt and enforce new motor vehicle emission standards for any model year if: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Such standards are identical to the California standards for which a waiver has been granted for such model year,
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) California and such state adopt such standards at least two years before commencement of such model year (as determined
by regulations of the Administrator).*&blank;*&blank;*. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has granted a waiver for California's ``Low Emission Vehicle'' program. See 58 FR 4166 (Jan. 13, 1993)(announcing
availability of Waiver of Federal Preemption; California Low-Emission Vehicle Standards (Jan. 8, 1993)). This
program generally calls for five categories of vehicles meeting progressively more stringent emissions standards:
California Tier I vehicles; Transitional Low Emission Vehicles (TLEV); Low Emission Vehicles (LEV); Ultra-Low
Emission Vehicles (ULEV); and Zero Emission Vehicles (ZEV). California has also established an overall non-methane
organic gas (NMOG) standard that each manufacturer must meet for its fleet of new vehicles in a particular model year
by selling any combination of vehicles certified by California as meeting standards for one of the five categories.
In addition, under California's program, at least 2% of each manufacturers' new vehicle fleet sold in California
must be ZEV's by 1998 and 10% by 2003.

At its second meeting on July 16, 1991, the OTC adopted a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in which the state and District
of Columbia representatives agreed that, in view of the significant contribution of motor vehicles to the northeast
ozone problem, they all support California's Motor Vehicle Control Program, and call on their jurisdictions to cooperatively
evaluate the feasibility, air quality benefits, and associated costs of this Program in the OTR. At its third meeting
on October 29, 1991, the OTC states agreed to a further MOU providing that each OTC state would take steps to implement
California's Low Emission Vehicle program as soon as possible. New York and Massachusetts are the only states that
have adopted the California LEV program in legislation and regulations without contingencies, and both states are
set to implement their programs. The automobile manufacturers have challenged the legality of both programs, and
both lawsuits are ongoing. Other states have adopted or are adopting the program contingent on regional program adoption,
and the remaining states are at various stages of the legislative or regulatory process to adopt the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In August 1993, Maine, Maryland, and Massachusetts petitioned the OTC to adopt a recommendation calling for the application
of the California LEV program throughout the OTR. During the fall of 1993, the OTC held a number of public forums in various
locations in the northeast, and held a public hearing in Hartford, Connecticut on December 16&hyph;17, 1993. Finally,
at its winter meeting on February 1, 1994, in Washington, D.C., the OTC voted by a 9 to 4 majority to recommend that EPA
mandate the California LEV program throughout the OTR. (The OTC refers to the program they recommend as ``OTC LEV.'')
New Hampshire, Virginia, Delaware, and New Jersey voted against the recommendation. The OTC's recommendation contains
the following elements: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The OTC LEV program would be applicable to all 1999 and subsequent model year passenger cars and light-duty trucks
in the OTR;

(2) Subject to certain very limited exceptions, all vehicles sold, imported, delivered, purchased, leased, rented,

Regarding California's ZEV sales mandate, the OTC recommends that, to the extent it must apply to satisfy section
177, it shall apply. But if it is not required under section 177, the OTC recommends that the ``individual states within
the OTC may at their option include such a requirement and/or economic incentives designed to increase the sales of
ZEVs in the programs they adopt.''

D. EPA Actions in Response to the OTC LEV Recommendation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 18, 1994, EPA published a notice announcing receipt of the OTC's recommendation, as required by in section
184(c)(1). See 59 FR 12914. This notice explained EPA's process for responding to the recommendation, identified
the major elements of the recommendation, and briefly explained EPA's intended approach at that time for analyzing
the issues. On April 8, 1994, EPA announced that the public hearing as required by section 184(c)(1) would be held in
Hartford, Connecticut on May 2&hyph;3, 1994. See 59 FR 16811. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 26, 1994, EPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) on the OTC recommendation. 59 FR at 21720. This
notice described the framework for EPA's action on the recommendation and provided substantial detail regarding
the issues EPA was considering in deciding whether to approve, disapprove, or partially approve and partially disapprove
the recommendation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NPRM described in detail the background and context of the OTC's recommendation, as well as the legislative history
of section 184. The text of the OTC's recommendation was reprinted as an appendix to the NPRM. It also addressed the
applicability of rulemaking procedures for EPA's action on the recommendation. Thereafter, the notice addressed
the standards applicable to EPA's review of the recommendation, including both the ``necessary'' and ``consistent
with the Act'' criteria. Regarding necessity, the NPRM addressed the legal interpretation of this standard, the
magnitude of emissions reductions needed for attainment in the OTR, the focus on contribution of emissions from across
the OTR, and the timing of the necessary reductions, including the relevance of maintenance after attainment. The
NPRM also explained the OTC's recommended LEV program in detail, EPA modeling of the emissions benefits from this
program, and the auto manufacturers' FLEV alternative. The NPRM then explained EPA's approach to considering other
alternatives to the OTC LEV program. Regarding consistency of the OTC LEV recommendation with the Act, EPA addressed
issues common to pending litigation in New York and Massachusetts as well as other issues regarding consistency of
the OTC LEV recommendation with section 177 of the Act. Overall, EPA proposed, in the alternative, to approve, disapprove,
or partially approve and partially disapprove the OTC's recommendation. The NPRM provided that the public comment
period would remain open until June 3, 1994, thirty days following the public hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To provide a further opportunity for interactive discussion of the issues among the various interested parties,
members of the public, and EPA, the Agency held an additional series of three public ``roundtable'' meetings in Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania, Durham, New Hampshire, and New York City. The agenda for these meetings was structured to generally
follow the framework for analysis described in the NPRM. EPA published a notice on June 2, 1994, providing the time,
place, and agenda for each meeting. See 59 FR 28520. The primary topics discussed at the first meeting in Philadelphia
were the proper interpretation of the ``necessity'' standard, and the OTC LEV program itself. The topics addressed
at the second meeting in Durham included the magnitude of reductions needed in the OTR, alternatives to the OTC LEV
program, and a proposal from the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) for emissions trading. At the third meeting in New
York City, the discussion continued regarding alternative approaches to achieving the necessary emissions reductions,
including the automakers' FLEV proposal, and a proposal from Texaco, Merck, and Public Service Electric &amp; Gas
Co. to establish a cap on NO

 emissions together with trading. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the New York City roundtable meeting, EPA re-opened the public comment period on the NPRM until July 30, 1994, to
allow interested parties to submit additional information in response to issues raised in the roundtable meetings.
See 59 FR 35292. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 4, 1994, EPA formally created a subcommittee of the Clean Air Act Advisory Committee in accordance with the
Federal Advisory Committee Act, 5 U.S.C. App. The subcommittee will focus on issues related to the OTC petition and
provide a public forum to pursue discussion of alternative car standards that could apply in 49 states. The first substantive
meeting of the subcommittee will take place in Washington, D.C. on Tuesday, September 13 and Wednesday, September
14, 1994 at the Ramada Plaza Hotel. EPA published a notice of these meetings on August 30, 1994. See 59 FR 44729.

II. Explanation of Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing today to approve the OTC's LEV recommendation based on the determination under sections 184(c) and
110(k) of the Act that the recommended LEV or a LEV-equivalent program
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 is necessary throughout the OTR and that the recommended LEV program is otherwise consistent with the Act. EPA is proposing
to find under its SIP call authority in section 110(k)(5)
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 that the SIP for each state in the OTR is substantially inadequate to meet the requirements relating to pollution transport
in section 110(a)(2)(D).
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 EPA is thus proposing to require each state in the OTR to revise its SIP to include the LEV program within one year after
the section 110(k)(5) finding is finally issued. EPA is proposing that the SIP call allow individual OTR states to
give manufacturers the choice of complying with either the OTC LEV requirements or_if such a program is developed_a
voluntary new-vehicle program to which automakers could voluntarily opt-in that achieves equivalent or greater
emissions reductions that are fully enforceable and qualifies for SIP credits.

Section 110(k)(5) authorizes the Administrator, whenever she finds that a SIP for an area is substantially inadequate
to mitigate adequately the interstate pollutant transport described in section 176A or 184, or to otherwise comply
with any requirement of the Act, to require the State to revise the SIP as ``necessary'' to correct the deficiency.

EPA does not ordinarily undertake rulemaking to issue a SIP call. EPA usually issues SIP calls by letter containing
a finding of substantial inadequacy. The basis for the SIP call and finding would then be the subject of notice-and-comment
rulemaking before the imposition of any sanctions warranted in response to state failure to respond to the SIP call.
Here, EPA is choosing instead to undertake notice-and-comment rulemaking regarding the basis of the SIP call before
issuing it.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is also proposing that states in the OTR be allowed, but not required, to adopt the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) sales
requirement. The OTC recommended that EPA require states to adopt the ZEV sales requirement only if it is a necessary
component of a LEV program under section 177. EPA is proposing today that a ZEV sales requirement is not a required component
of a LEV program adopted under section 177 and that states would therefore not be obligated to adopt it. However, states
have the discretion to include a ZEV sales requirement. States may also include economic incentives designed to increase
the sales of ZEVs as long as such incentives are consistent with sections 177 and 209 of the Act. EPA is also taking comment
on whether to adopt a ``ZEV equivalency approach'' to require states either to impose ZEV mandates or to impose other
requirements on new motor vehicles that achieve the evaporative NMOG and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 benefits associated with ZEVs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, EPA is proposing regulations to determine the term ``model year'' for purposes of section 177 and part A of
title II of the Act, as that term applies to motor vehicles. The proposed regulations provide that model year will apply
on a model-by-model basis. This regulatory action codifies long-standing EPA guidance on this definition and should
clarify the applicability of the two-year lead-time requirement in section 177.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Today's proposed action is authorized by several Clean Air Act provisions. As discussed in the NPRM, EPA has authority
to approve the OTC's LEV recommendation under section 184(c). EPA also has independent authority to require that
states submit LEV SIP revisions under sections 110(a)(2)(D) and 110(k)(5). EPA disagrees with the comments of the
automakers that argue that EPA lacks authority to approve the OTC LEV recommendation because the section 184 process
is unconstitutional and because an EPA SIP call requiring state regulation of emissions from new motor vehicles violates
sections 177, 202, and 209 of the Clean Air Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. EPA's Authority To Act Under Section 184
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 184 provides a clear statutory basis for EPA's action here. EPA described that provision in detail in the background
section above, and in its April 26 proposal. See 59 FR at 21722&hyph;24. In summary, the OTC is a body created by operation
of law under sections 176A and 184 of the Act, and is comprised of the Governor (or Governor's designee) and an air pollution
control official appointed by the Governor for each state in the OTR, as well as the EPA Administrator (or her designee)
and the affected EPA Regional Administrators (or the Administrator's designees). Decisions of the OTC are by majority
vote of all members other than the EPA representatives. Under section 184(c), the OTC may, after notice-and-comment,
develop recommendations for additional control measures to be applied within the OTR as necessary to bring any area
in the region into attainment by the dates provided in subpart 2 of part D. The OTC is then to transmit such recommendations
to EPA to require such measures throughout the OTR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 184 grants EPA authority to approve the recommendations and issue SIP calls requiring that the affected states
adopt the recommended measures if EPA determines that the measures are ``necessary to bring any area in [the OTR] into
attainment by the dates provided by this subpart and are otherwise consistent with the Act.'' Upon approval, section
184(c)(5) authorizes the Administrator to issue a finding under section 110(k)(5) that the SIP for any state to which
a requirement of the approved recommendation applies is inadequate to meet the requirements of section 110(a)(2)(D)
of the Act. The effect of the finding is to require that any such state revise its SIP to include the approved recommended
measures within one year after the finding is issued.

B. State Obligations and EPA's Authority To Act Under Section 110
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA also is proposing to interpret section 110 of the Act to provide that the Agency has independent authority for today's
proposed action under that section, apart from any authority provided by section 184. Under section 110(a)(2)(D),
each state is obligated to submit SIP provisions prohibiting sources in the state from contributing significantly
to nonattainment or interfering with maintenance in any other state. If EPA finds that a SIP is substantially inadequate
to adequately mitigate interstate pollution transport, section 110(k)(5) authorizes EPA to issue a SIP call to correct
the inadequacy. Under EPA's proposed interpretation, sections 110(a) and (k) allow EPA to find at any time that a SIP
is inadequate due to pollution transport. Thus, EPA is proposing to find that, because of the transport of pollution,
OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) is necessary for areas in the OTR to achieve or maintain the ozone NAAQS, and therefore,
that EPA has authority under sections 110(a)(2)(D) and (k)(5) to make a finding of substantial inadequacy and to issue
a SIP call requiring adoption of OTC LEV. Rather than make a general finding of SIP substantial inadequacy, EPA is proposing
to find the SIPs substantially inadequate only to the extent they do not contain the OTC LEV program. EPA is therefore
proposing to require these states to adopt the OTC LEV program to correct the deficiency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments broadened each state's long-standing obligation to address in its SIP the contribution
of emissions in its state to air pollution in other states.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 The changes expand the provision beyond stationary sources that prevent downwind attainment or maintenance to other
sources and emissions activities that contribute significantly
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 to downwind nonattainment or interfere with downwind maintenance. The expanded provision encompasses, among other
things, mobile source controls in light of the impact of mobile sources on downwind attainment and maintenance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Prior to 1990, section 110(a)(2)(E) required that the SIPs: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Contain adequate provisions *&blank;*&blank;* prohibiting any stationary source within the State from emitting
any air pollutant in amounts which will *&blank;*&blank;* prevent attainment or maintenance by any other state of
any such national primary or secondary ambient air quality standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the 1990 Amendments, this provision was re-codified at section 110(a)(2)(D) and broadened to require that a SIP
submitted under the Act shall: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Contain adequate provisions *&blank;*&blank;* prohibiting, consistent with the provisions of this title, any
source or other type of emissions activity within the state from emitting any air pollutant in amounts which will *&blank;*&blank;*
contribute significantly to nonattainment in, or interfere with maintenance by, any other state with respect to
any such [NAAQS].

Whenever the Administrator finds that the applicable implementation plan for any area is substantially inadequate
to attain or maintain the relevant [NAAQS], to mitigate adequately the interstate pollutant transport described

Importantly, the Act does not address how states' attainment demonstrations are to account for transport of ozone
pollution and its precursors.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 As was the case prior to the 1990 Amendments, neither section 110 nor any other provision of the Act specifies when states
must submit SIP revisions to address the transport issue. Even with the advent of the very specific SIP submission
schedules in the subpart II ozone program under the 1990 Amendments, no deadline is specified for compliance with
the section 110(a)(2)(D) prohibition. EPA believes it may reasonably take action to make a finding of substantial
inadequacy as soon as EPA has a factual basis to believe that states need to act in order to prevent the pollution transport
problem from continuing past the downwind areas' attainment deadlines. Absent a LEV-equivalent program, EPA believes
it is necessary that the states take action now to adopt the OTC LEV program, and waiting to make this finding may compromise
their ability to achieve the reductions by the time they are needed for timely attainment and maintenance thereafter.
This action is fully justified by the terms of section 110(k)(5). This provision states that ``[w]henever'' EPA makes
the requisite finding of inadequacy, the state is obliged to submit a SIP revision. By its terms, section 110(k)(5)
makes clear that the timing of a SIP call depends only on EPA's determination of inadequacy, and the section does not
contain any provision that would tie SIP calls to any particular point on the SIP development timeline specified in
sections 181 and 182.

EPA's proposed interpretation of sections 110(a)(2)(D) and (k) is best understood in the context of the general statutory
scheme for attainment and maintenance of the ozone NAAQS. EPA's April 26 proposal contains a substantial explanation
of the statutory program to address ozone pollution in subpart II of part D of title I added in the 1990 Amendments to
the Act. See 59 FR at 21721&hyph;22 (citing General Preamble for the Implementation of Title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments
of 1990, 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992)). As explained there, section 181 provides for the classification of areas according
to their degree of ozone pollution. The greater the degree of pollution, the longer the area has to attain and the more
stringent control measures it must adopt. The classifications and deadlines by which the areas are to attain the ozone
NAAQS are: marginal (1993); moderate (1996); serious (1999); severe (2005 or 2007, depending on the ozone design
value); and extreme (2010).

Section 182 establishes the specific requirements and graduated control measures applicable for each type of area.
One basic requirement is that states were to submit emissions inventories by November 1992. A key upcoming requirement
is that, by November 15, 1994, states are to have submitted, for all moderate and above areas, demonstrations that
the states' SIPs will provide for attainment of the ozone NAAQS by the relevant attainment dates. As described in detail
in the April 26 notice and the General Preamble, section 182 specifies a host of control requirements that states must
adopt for various areas to ensure progress toward attainment.

Requiring submission of specific SIP revisions pursuant to section 110(k)(5) is consistent with past EPA actions.
Prior to 1990 and the enactment of section 184, EPA required states to submit specific reasonably available control
technology (RACT) control measures applicable to stationary sources as part of a SIP call under section 110(k)(5).
There, EPA's rationale was that:

Because of the relative imprecision of ozone databases and modeling techniques *&blank;*&blank;* EPA historically
has required most areas to include in their control strategies certain stationary source control measures that EPA
believes are reasonably available, and necessary to ensure that the SIP ``provides for'' attainment of the ozone
standard as expeditiously as practicable.

See 52 FR at 45062 (Nov. 24, 1987) (footnote added). EPA took this action right away in response to a new list of areas
violating the ozone standard. See 52 FR at 45055; 53 FR 34500 (Sept. 7, 1988); 55 FR 30973 (July 30, 1990). EPA did not
wait for these areas to develop attainment plans before issuing a SIP call requiring them to adopt specific controls
necessary for attainment. Likewise, here EPA is proposing to require submission of the OTC LEV program as necessary
for compliance with section 110(a)(2)(D).

EPA believes it has authority under section 110(k)(5) to find that the states' SIPs are substantially inadequate
for lack of the many additional measures needed to fully achieve the emissions reductions necessary to adequately
mitigate transport, but does not believe it should make such a broad finding of substantial inadequacy at this time.
This is because the states are on track to incorporate many additional control measures into their SIPs for purposes
of their attainment demonstration obligations. In preparing these demonstrations, the OTR states are actively
working to adopt regional strategies to address transport. In the ordinary course, EPA believes it should allow states
the first opportunity to address transport in their forthcoming SIP revisions. There is still this opportunity for
states to adopt such other control measures to achieve the necessary reductions in time for downwind states to meet
their attainment deadlines and to maintain the NAAQS thereafter.
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 If those efforts do not result in timely adoption of a regional strategy that will provide the emission reductions
needed for attainment and maintenance, EPA may consider making a more comprehensive finding of SIP inadequacy insofar
as other measures in addition to LEV are lacking.

Section 181(a)(1) specified that ozone nonattainment areas are to attain the NAAQS ``as expeditiously as practicable
but not later than'' the dates specified in that section. Based on currently available information, EPA does not believe
that the serious and severe nonattainment areas in the OTR will be able to practicably attain the NAAQS earlier than
the dates specified in section 181(a)(1). This is because these areas will need to rely for attainment on control measures
that depend on equipment turnover that will take time to occur. For this reason, EPA's analysis in this SNPRM is based
on the Agency's belief that the serious and severe attainment dates are the dates specified in section 181(a)(1).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA does not, however, believe it should wait to find the SIPs inadequate insofar as they lack the LEV program. This
is because the LEV program depends on vehicle fleet turnover that will take an unusually long time to generate the needed
emissions reductions. If EPA waits for the states' attainment demonstrations, the opportunity to ensure that necessary
emissions reductions from the LEV program are achieved beginning in 1999 and growing thereafter may be irrevocably
lost. Any delay in beginning the fleet turnover to LEV vehicles in model year 1999 will diminish the emissions benefits
in the years following. It is therefore necessary for the states to act now to adopt OTC LEV, and appropriate for EPA
to make a finding of substantial SIP inadequacy now with respect to that program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In sum, EPA is proposing to find now that the OTR states' SIPs are substantially inadequate insofar as they do not contain
the OTC LEV program. This is because EPA believes that the states need to adopt this program now to mitigate pollution
transport adequately by the attainment deadlines for areas in downwind states. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing to set a one-year deadline under section 110(k)(5) for OTC LEV SIP submissions. Even though section
110(k)(5) authorizes EPA to allow up to 18 months, EPA believes a one-year deadline is appropriate here. EPA expects
the one-year deadline to fall at the end of calendar year 1995. To ensure implementation of the OTC LEV program in model
year 1999, and given the two-year lead-time requirement of section 177, states must adopt the program before January
2, 1996. If states were given more than about one year to adopt the LEV program, they could not be assured of implementing
it for all 1999 model year vehicles. Since EPA is proposing to conclude that 1999 model year implementation is necessary
to achieve the necessary emissions reductions, it is important that the SIP submission deadline fall in time to meet
the two-year lead-time requirement.

 The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) has submitted a response to these constitutional arguments.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 EPA does not believe the arguments that section 184 is unconstitutional have merit. And in any case, given EPA's independent
authority under section 110(k)(5), any constitutional question regarding the validity of section 184 would not
affect the validity of the action proposed today.

The automakers argue that Congress, through section 184, is commandeering the legislative processes of the OTR states
by directly compelling them to take certain actions. The automakers argue that this violates principles of federalism
and the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution. The Supreme Court has interpreted the Tenth Amendment to mean that Congress
cannot coerce states in their sovereign political capacity to regulate private conduct.
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 Section 184 is fully within the scheme of ``cooperative federalism'' that the courts have confirmed is consistent
with constitutional requirements.
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 As with many other federal programs, section 184 is simply an unremarkable case under the Clean Air Act's SIP program
where Congress has provided incentives to the states as a method of influencing their policy choices. Congress may
attach conditions on the receipt of federal funds (as long as the conditions bear some relation to the purpose of the
federal spending), to influence states' legislative choices. And where Congress has the authority to regulate private
activity under the Commerce Clause, the Court has recognized Congress's power to offer states the choice of regulating
an activity according to federal standards or having state law pre-empted by federal regulation.
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
 Here, Congress provided incentives to the states by placing conditions on highway funding; by allowing states to
apply a less stringent ``offset ratio'' for new stationary pollution sources; and by allowing states to themselves
impose regulations rather than having the federal government implement the program the state chose not to implement.
See sections 179 (highway and offset sanctions) and 110(c)(1) (federal implementation plans).

The automakers also argue that section 184 constitutes an unconstitutional delegation of federal authority to the
OTC and violates the Appointments Clause. They argue that through section 184 Congress delegated legislative authority
outside the federal government, or authorized state officials composing the OTC to exercise significant federal
executive authority that the Constitution commands only federal officials appointed consistent with the Appointments
Clause may exercise. EPA does not, however, believe that state officials exercise ``significant authority'' pursuant
to federal law in this context. EPA welcomes comment on the automakers' constitutional arguments and the response
from NRDC that are in the docket.

D. Consistency of EPA Action With Limitations on Authority Under Sections 177, 202 and 209 of the Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA's proposed action is fully consistent with both the letter and spirit of sections 177, 202 and 209 of the Act. These
three provisions make it clear that Congress wanted auto manufacturers to have to meet only two types of standards_federal
standards and California standards. Section 177 specifically contemplates that California's standards may apply
outside California. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approving the OTC's recommendation is doing no more than requiring states, based on need, to exercise authority given
to them by Congress. EPA is authorized to take this action under sections 184 and 110. EPA disagrees with those commenters
that claim sections 177 and 202 preclude EPA from approving the OTC's recommendation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requiring adoption of the LEV standards in the OTR does not change any current federal standard, so it is not prohibited
by section 202. Section 202(b)(1)(C) explicitly precludes EPA only from exercising its authority under section
202 to modify certain specified standards prior to model year 2004_it is not a general prohibition of all EPA action
relating to the control of emissions from motor vehicles. Thus, EPA may not modify certain mandatory federal standards
applicable nation-wide to motor vehicles until model year 2004. However, today's proposal requires only that states
adopt certain programs applicable to motor vehicles in such states, as states are permitted to do under section 177.
EPA is not proposing to rely on section 202 to require the LEV standards, so the prohibition in 202(b)(1)(C) is irrelevant.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The automakers have argued that granting the OTC petition violates section 177 because EPA is making a choice (whether
states should adopt California standards) that section 177 reserves to the states. This misconstrues the nature
of section 177 and fails to read section 177 together with section 110(k)(5) or section 184. Section 177 provides an
exception to the general prohibition in section 209 against states (other than California) adopting motor vehicle
emission standards. Section 177 thus provides states the discretion to adopt controls that section 209 would otherwise
preclude. Sections 110(k)(5) and 184 allow EPA to require states to take actions that would otherwise be left to their
discretion. The language of section 177, that the states' authority applies ``[n]otwithstanding section 209,''
makes clear that Congress intended to provide an exception to section 209, not bar EPA requirements under sections
110 or 184.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA's April 26 proposal contains an extensive discussion of the Agency's approach to interpreting the ``necessary''
standard under section 184(c), and includes several options. See 59 FR at 21725&hyph;27. Today, EPA is proposing
its interpretation of this standard. Section 110(k)(5) also includes a ``necessary'' standard providing that,
upon an EPA finding of SIP inadequacy, the Agency is to require that the state submit SIP revisions that are ``necessary''
to correct the inadequacy. EPA is proposing that, in this particular case, the ``necessary'' standard under section
110(k)(5) be interpreted the same as the ``necessary'' standard under section 184(c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If EPA approves or partially approves the recommendation, section 184(c)(5) provides that EPA is to issue a finding
that the SIPs for the states to which an approved requirement applies are inadequate to meet the requirements of section
110(a)(2)(D). Section 110(a)(2)(D) provides that SIPs are to contain adequate provisions prohibiting emissions
within the state that will ``contribute significantly to nonattainment in, or interfere with maintenance by, any
other state.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing that contributing emissions are significant under section 110(a)(2)(D) at least where controlling
such emissions is necessary to bring any downwind area into attainment. EPA also is proposing that emissions interfere
with downwind maintenance under 110(a)(2)(D) at least where controlling such emissions is necessary for downwind
areas to maintain the NAAQS.
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>
 EPA is further proposing to interpret section 184 to mean that the Agency may approve the OTC's recommendation if the
measures are necessary for any area in the OTR to attain or maintain the NAAQS.

EPA is not addressing in this rulemaking whether, under section 110(a)(2)(D), a state's emissions may ``contribute
significantly'' to nonattainment or ``interfere with maintenance'' in another state when controlling the upwind
state's emissions is not strictly necessary but nevertheless would be helpful to downwind states' efforts to attain
and maintain the NAAQS.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 110(k)(5) provides that EPA may issue a SIP call whenever it finds a SIP for an area to be substantially inadequate
to attain or maintain the NAAQS, to mitigate adequately interstate transport under sections 176A or 184, or to otherwise
comply with any requirement of the Act. EPA is proposing to interpret section 110(k)(5) to mean that it may issue a SIP
call based on a finding that a SIP does not comply with the requirement of the section 110(a)(2)(D) to address adequately
the effect of pollution transport on downwind attainment and maintenance. EPA may require that the states revise
their SIPs to include any particular measure that is necessary to comply with section 110(a)(2)(D).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that the ``necessary'' standard requires the Agency to evaluate the emissions reductions needed, and
then whether reasonable and practicable alternative measures could be adopted instead of the OTC LEV program to achieve
the needed reductions. The role of ``alternatives'' in EPA's analysis has often been confused in the course of EPA's
hearings and round-table proceedings. EPA believes two distinct kinds of alternatives are relevant to necessity.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, an alternative program to achieve the same emissions reductions from the same emissions sources may render
the OTC LEV program unnecessary. An example is useful to illustrate this point. If EPA or the states were (hypothetically)
to mandate that all new motor vehicles be ZEVs, then an OTC LEV program would not be necessary_it would not make sense
(and would be unnecessary) to mandate OTC LEV tailpipe standards for a new vehicle fleet consisting entirely of cars
without tailpipes. This would be true regardless of what emissions reductions are needed overall and what other measures
are available to achieve the needed reductions. It is in this sense that EPA believes that OTC LEV would be unnecessary
if there were another program available to achieve emissions reductions from new motor vehicles comparable to, or
greater than, those from OTC LEV. Under this aspect of the analysis, the ability of the alternative to achieve reductions
sufficient to comply with section 110(a)(2)(D) is not relevant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is aware of alternative programs that currently are under discussion by various interested parties. EPA believes
that some alternative programs could be preferable to simply approving the petition. Such alternatives focus on
a 49-state approach, whereby auto manufacturers would commit to produce cars with a cleaner internal combustion
engine (compared to current federal standards) nationwide. Incentives for advanced technology and zero emission
vehicles are also part of the discussion. As these alternatives are developed and modeling of associated benefits
is undertaken, EPA will add the analyses to the docket and publish a notice of data availability in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that a 49-state low emission vehicle approach could be better than the OTC LEV program in a number of respects.
First, EPA believes that a 49-state program could have significant environmental benefits as compared to the OTC
LEV program. A 49-state approach could benefit the OTR by reducing incoming pollution from other states_both transported
air pollution and pollution from the migration of non-OTR vehicles into the state (as a result both of tourism and relocation).
A 49-state approach would also help non-OTR states by providing NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and VOC reductions and other air quality benefits. EPA also believes that an alternative could provide equal or greater
impetus to development of advanced technology. Second, the auto industry would benefit from uniform markets. See
discussion in Section IV.A.2.(d) for a discussion of the benefits of uniform markets. The auto industry plays a vital
role in our economy. Reducing the economic impacts of EPA's actions, without reducing environmental benefits are
matters of concern to the Agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Once these 49-state alternatives are further developed, EPA intends to complete a qualitative and quantitative
comparison of their environmental benefits relative to the OTC LEV program. The Agency will then publish, as soon
as possible, a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The options for developing an alternative program are somewhat limited. As explained above, section 202 bars EPA
modification of the Tier I standards prior to model year 2004, and the states cannot, under section 177 and 209, adopt
standards other than the California standards. Thus, the only alternative method for requiring vehicle manufacturers
to achieve reductions in tailpipe emissions from new light-duty cars and trucks is a program in which manufacturers
voluntarily agree to be bound by more stringent standards. This concept and the legal basis for it are discussed in
greater detail in section V of this notice, below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is this first kind of alternative that underlies the basis for EPA providing in its SIP call for the possibility that
an alternative program may be developed that would achieve emissions reductions from new motor vehicles that are
comparable to or greater than those from OTC LEV. If such a program were developed, it would not be necessary to apply
the OTC LEV program to vehicles subject to the alternative standards. This concept and the legal basis for it are discussed
in greater detail in section V of this notice, below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the availability of alternative measures that are sufficient to achieve the necessary reductions without
further reductions from new motor vehicles or trucks could likewise render the OTC LEV program unnecessary. The question
here is not whether EPA will mandate such other measures in response to the OTC's recommendation. The OTC did not recommend
such other measures and; for the reasons described in section III.B., EPA is not ready to consider mandating them under
sections 110(k)(5) and 110(a)(2)(D) at this time. Rather, the question is whether such other measures are available
so that it is unnecessary for EPA to require the OTC LEV program. As EPA explained in its April 26 proposal:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
To the extent more reductions will be needed even with the LEV program [to mitigate significant contribution to nonattainment
in the OTR], other measures that address that shortfall would not, for that reason alone, qualify as ``alternatives''
to LEV. Rather, other measures might qualify as ``alternatives'' only if such other measures, singly or in combination,
generate enough reductions to fill the entire shortfall needed without LEV.

EPA has established a precedent for interpreting the ``necessary'' standard that is consistent with this approach.
EPA's interpretation is guided by its approach to interpreting that term (ultimately codified by Congress), under
section 211(c)(4)(C) of the Act, as explained in the April 26 proposal. See 59 FR at 21734. That interpretation is important
to evaluating the availability of alternatives sufficient to achieve the necessary emissions reductions. Under
section 211(c)(4)(C), controls are necessary if they would still be needed after adoption of all other reasonable
and practicable measures. That is, EPA would consider alternatives available if they are comparatively reasonable
and practicable. And the reasonable and practicable alternatives must be sufficient to achieve the necessary reductions
in order to conclude that the proffered control is unnecessary.

EPA also suggested in its April 26 proposal a different possible approach to the ``necessary'' standard. Under that
approach, EPA might consider as necessary any additional control measures that contribute to attainment, as long
as measures specifically required by the Act or that are otherwise in place are insufficient to achieve attainment.
That is, as long as the States in the OTR still need more reductions to address the transport problem, then EPA would
consider the OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) program necessary. Assessment of alternative control measures would not
be relevant. See 59 FR at 21725. While EPA is not proposing here to adopt that approach, EPA notes that the facts showing
that the OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) program is necessary under the approach discussed in the text would, a fortiori,
be sufficient to show that the OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) program is necessary under this different approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Of course, whether potential alternative measures are ``reasonable and practicable'' as well as sufficient to achieve
the necessary reductions may not be self-evident. In its April 26 proposal, EPA described approaches to factual uncertainty
and other policy considerations that could influence these determinations. See 59 FR at 21726&hyph;27. As with its
decisions under section 211(c)(4)(C), here EPA does not consider drastic measures such as gas rationing, or plant
shutdowns to constitute reasonable alternatives to the OTC LEV program. Congress could not have intended that EPA
should consider such drastic alternatives, since such alternatives would clearly be adequate to achieve any necessary
reductions, and hence no proffered measure would ever be necessary. This would essentially read section 184 out of
the Act. Further, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes cost-effectiveness of potential alternatives is a criterion in evaluating reasonableness and comparing
other measures to the measure proffered as necessary. But the comparison of the reasonableness and practicability
of various measures, including what is ``too drastic,'' is a complicated policy determination requiring consideration
of cost and public acceptance, and need not be supported by a highly specific technical record. See 59 FR at 21726. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While EPA believes that it is important to assess the sufficiency of reasonable and practicable alternatives, states
have the continuing opportunity to come forward to adopt sufficient alternatives and prove that the OTC LEV program
indeed turns out to be unnecessary. EPA does not believe states would seriously entertain unreasonable or impracticable
measures to adopt in place of OTC LEV in order to achieve the necessary emissions reductions. Nonetheless, EPA recognizes
that states which do in fact adopt such other measures sufficient to comply with section 110(a)(2)(D) might thereby
render the OTC LEV program unnecessary. EPA therefore is proposing that it would retain authority under the SIP call
to change its necessary determination and withdraw its SIP call for those states that adopt controls sufficient to
comply with section 110(a)(2)(D), including those controls EPA might now believe to be unreasonable or impracticable.
As states in the northeast have not yet adopted sufficient measures proving that the LEV program (or LEV-equivalent)
is unnecessary, EPA believes that it should evaluate whether sufficient reasonable and practicable alternatives
exist based on the best current information and policy judgment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also discussed in its April 26 proposal various approaches to factual uncertainty regarding issues such as cost
and the amount of reductions needed for compliance with section 110(a)(2)(D). There, EPA raised the question of whether
the statutory structure, together with the legislative history, support giving substantial weight or ``deference''
to the OTC's recommendation that the OTC LEV program is necessary for attainment in the OTR. EPA suggested that it could
reasonably interpret the provisions to mean that EPA is to start with a presumption of approving the OTC's recommendations
and approve the recommendation unless EPA found that the recommended measures were unnecessary. EPA pointed to floor
statements in the conference debate in the Senate regarding section 184 that EPA bears a ``heavy burden'' to ``demonstrat[e]
that the additional control measure(s) is not necessary.'' See 59 FR at 21726 (quoting Baucus-Chafee Statement of
Managers and Senator Lieberman). EPA's public hearings and round-table discussions reflected some confusion about
the meaning of ``deference'' to the OTC. EPA questions whether there is any basis under any provision of the Clean Air
Act to relieve the Agency of an obligation to consider independently all of the factual information available in determining
whether the OTC LEV program is necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this case, EPA believes the facts affirmatively show that this measure is indeed necessary. In addition, EPA believes
that its general policy of prudence in making decisions regarding highly complex scientific issues affecting public
health should apply to its analysis here. EPA believes this policy is reasonable and permissible in addressing what
is ``necessary'' to achieve and maintain the health-based ambient air quality standard for ozone.

Courts have recognized that scientific evidence is cumulative, and that EPA has discretion to take an environmentally
protective approach to protecting public health and welfare. In Ethyl Corp. v. EPA, 541 F.2d 1 (D.C. Cir.), cert. denied,
426 U.S. 941 (1976), the court of appeals considered EPA's action to regulate the lead content of gasoline on grounds
that emissions ``will endanger'' the public health or welfare under prior section 211(c)(1)(A). There, the court
recognized that EPA's decision may be based on ``the inconclusive but suggestive results of numerous studies.''
Ethyl, 541 F.2d at 38. Further, the court found that the Administrator appropriately acted ``conservatively'' based
on ``suggestive'' evidence to make a ``prudent'' determination. Ethyl, 541 F.2d at 39. EPA believes such prudence
is likewise appropriate here, where the public health and welfare is at stake.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA believes its general policy in favor of protecting public health and welfare is particularly appropriate to evaluate
whether a particular measure is needed to solve an inter-state problem. EPA believes that pollution transport and
the states' obligations under section 110(a)(2)(D) to control emissions that would contribute to nonattainment
or interfere with maintenance downwind are critical to the integrity of the states' attainment plans under title
I. Especially in a region such as the Northeast, where extensive transport makes states inter-dependent on their
collective pollution control programs, EPA believes that its general policy should apply to make sure that states
adopt controls necessary for other states' attainment. These states depend for their own citizens' health on the
actions of upwind states that may lack an incentive to bear the costs of protecting downwind citizens' health. In such
circumstances, EPA's general policy of prudence is particularly appropriate in evaluating what is necessary in
the upwind states to protect health downwind. Moreover, these states' independent efforts (and their residents'
support for them) to address emissions within their own borders may depend significantly on the confidence these
states have that the other states in the region are acting as ``good neighbors.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
High officials closely involved in the SIP planning process in these states have now come to EPA, after extensive public
processes of their own, believing a particular measure is necessary for them and their neighbors to do their part to
address a substantially collective public health problem. These officials, as the chief state officers responsible
for ensuring state compliance with the Clean Air Act, are the closest to the air quality planning information in the
states. Whether EPA responds under section 184 or by exercising its authority under section 110(k)(5), EPA believes
that it makes policy sense to apply its general approach of prudence in favor of environmental protection to scientific
uncertainties. EPA believes sound policy dictates that it has a responsibility to do so. The legislative history
reviewed in EPA's April 26 proposal reflects that at least some in Congress intended that EPA follow this approach.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To the extent EPA's analysis reveals that other measures are reasonable and practicable but are not sufficient to
achieve the necessary reductions, EPA would have authority directly under section 110(k)(5) to require the states
to adopt those measures, too. But, for the reasons described above in section III.B., EPA does not believe it need exercise
its authority in this manner at this time. Of course, states will need to adopt many of these measures as part of their
attainment demonstrations due November 15, 1994, and this may go a long way toward these states' contribution to downwind
nonattainment or their interference with downwind maintenance. But EPA believes that it should require this measure
now, in light of the states' recommendation, the time needed to yield emissions benefits (due to the lead-time requirement
and time for fleet turnover), and the need for a coordinated decision to adopt the program for the entire region collectively.
Since it is both necessary to address the transport problem and very difficult for the states to adopt the OTC LEV program
without assurance that their neighbors that need to will also do so, the Agency believes that there is adequate reason
to act now to require this measure under sections 184 and 110(k)(5). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA recognizes that, under this approach, certain states would have to adopt the OTC LEV program even though they did
not vote to make this recommendation to EPA. In its April 26 proposal, EPA questioned whether the ability of certain
states to override the wishes of others by vote could militate against an environmentally conservative approach
to uncertainty. EPA does not view the objection of certain states as justifying a different approach. Rather, EPA
currently believes that the weight of a recommendation from high officials in a majority of the states justifies an
environmentally conservative decision regarding whether the measure in question is necessary. While the minority
states might understandably wish to reserve their options for compliance, their adopted attainment demonstrations
are due in a matter of two months, and the work that those states have accomplished toward assembling their attainment
plans has not convinced EPA that the OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) program will be unnecessary to address the transport
problem. As noted above, EPA believes that even if these officials presented this recommendation without invoking
the formal section 184 process, EPA would appropriately take an environmentally protective approach to deciding
whether to issue a SIP call for the measure directly under section 110(k)(5). Moreover, as discussed above, EPA is
proposing to explore the possibility that alternatives will become available and adopted so that states would no
longer need the OTC LEV program, or that the states may demonstrate that they have adopted sufficient measures without
LEV (potentially including those that EPA might otherwise dismiss as unreasonable or impracticable) to comply with
section 110(a)(2)(D).

i. General Conclusions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first step in EPA's analysis of whether the OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) program is needed is to consider what emissions
reductions are necessary to bring all areas into attainment. Based on EPA's region-wide modeling analyses, it is
clear that very large reductions in emissions of both NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and VOC are needed for the serious and severe areas of the OTR to come into attainment. Based on the best analysis available
to EPA to date, NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emission reductions on the order of 50% to 75% are needed throughout the OTR to reach attainment with the ozone NAAQS.
VOC emissions reductions on the order of 50% to 75% are needed for attainment particularly in the East Coast urban corridor.
These estimates are based on modeling analyses that used a 1985 emissions baseline. Updated inventory information
indicates the 1985 inventory underestimated base case NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and VOC emissions. Therefore, EPA believes that at least a 50% to 75% reduction in emissions is necessary from the 1990
baseline.
<FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>
 Given EPA's belief that in addressing areas of factual uncertainty here it should err on the side of environmental
protection, EPA requests comments on whether reductions from reasonable and practicable measures should be in the
middle of these ranges before EPA would determine that the OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) program is unnecessary.

The Clean Air Act requires states to develop 1990 base year emissions inventories of actual emissions on which to base
planning requirements, including attainment demonstrations. Therefore, the remainder of the document will generally
refer to emissions reductions required or obtained from a 1990 emissions inventory. EPA is relying on the above-noted
relationship between the 1985 and 1990 inventory to draw conclusions about necessary emissions reductions from
the 1990 baseline inventory.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has reached these conclusions based on modeling analyses of the impact of emissions reduction strategies for
this region. For purposes of its modeling studies, EPA considered the impact of various strategies in the year 2005.
Focusing first on the impact in 2005 is reasonable because by then all control measures explicitly mandated in subpart
2 of part D of the Act will be in place. EPA can thereby analyze more precisely what reductions beyond those already explicitly
required will be needed. Since two of the three core severe nonattainment areas in the urban corridor along the East
Coast from Washington D.C. to Boston have an attainment deadline of 2005, it is by this date that the Clean Air Act mandates
severe area controls to be in place. These areas are the Baltimore and Philadelphia areas. The New York-New Jersey-Connecticut
severe area has the slightly later attainment deadline of 2007 due to its higher ozone design value. EPA also focused
on this year in its studies in part because the OTC's modeling committee asked that EPA do so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is important to note, however, that for purposes of this step in the analysis, the year that is the subject of the study
does not affect the magnitude of necessary emissions reductions. This is because the precise question in this step
is what reductions are needed from a 1990 baseline emissions inventory in order for each of the nonattainment areas
in the OTR to come into attainment. For purposes of this analysis, EPA assumes that all growth in emissions since 1990
must be neutralized in addition to achieving the requisite emissions reductions from the 1990 baseline. That is,
EPA's conclusion is that emission reductions on the order of 50% to 75% in VOC (primarily in the urban areas and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (regionally) are needed in the OTR to reach attainment, and that growth in emissions since 1990 must be neutralized
in addition to the 50% to 75% reductions. Of course, in later years the amount of growth that must be neutralized on top
of the 50% to 75% reductions will increase. But the conclusion that 50% to 75% reductions from the 1990 baseline are
needed remains constant over time.

ii. Analytical Modeling Tools. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two basic atmospheric modeling tools are used to analyze the need for and effectiveness of various emissions reduction
strategies to attain the ozone NAAQS. These are both photochemical grid models into which information regarding
the atmosphere and emissions is input for subunits in a grid that encompasses a particular area, or ``domain.'' The
model is designed to measure the impact of changes in emissions input for each subunit on the grid. An important aspect
of the models is the set of assumptions regarding the air that enters the modeling domain at its boundaries, commonly
referred to as ``boundary conditions.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The two basic models used to analyze ozone pollution in the northeast United States are the Urban Airshed Model (UAM)
and the Regional Oxidant Model (ROM). The key differences between these models are the size of the modeling domain
and the resolution of information about subunits in the photochemical grid. The resolution depends on the size of
the overall domain. As their names indicate, the UAM is an urban scale model that yields more precise information about
particular urban areas, and the ROM is a broader regional model that is more useful for assessing regional impacts.
The UAM generally involves a modeling domain on the order of 200 km on a side, with a horizontal resolution of five km
or better and five or more vertical layers.
<FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>
 EPA is using a ROM to analyze the domain encompassing the United States east of 99W longitude, covering approximately
the eastern half of the country. Horizontal resolution is approximately 18 km, with three vertical layers considered.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Grid models, such as the UAM and the ROM, entail superimposing a 3-dimensional box over the area to be modeled. This
box is subdivided into grid cells. The model predicts average concentration within each cell for each hour of a simulation.
The spatial resolution possible with a model is defined by the size of these individual grid cells. The models do not
allow one to draw conclusions about concentrations averaged over areas which are smaller than the size of the individual
grid cells.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The UAM is particularly useful to demonstrate with fine resolution whether urban areas will achieve attainment using
a particular emissions reduction strategy, based on assumptions about the boundary conditions of the UAM domain.
The ROM is useful for assessing the relationship between UAM domains and what is happening in the broader region to
determine appropriate boundary conditions for UAM modeling. The function of ROM applications for developing attainment
strategies is to provide boundary conditions for the UAM analyses. Essentially, boundary conditions are estimates
of the amount of ozone and ozone precursors entering each of the UAM domains from upwind. Boundary conditions reflect
the cumulative effect of pollutant transport as well as control measures and growth applied in upwind areas. Upwind
areas for purposes of the ROM analysis include upwind UAM domains, portions of the OTR outside the UAM domains, and
the eastern U.S. outside the OTR. The boundary conditions resulting from these ROM simulations serve as an important
input to the states' UAM analyses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Modeling using the UAM and ROM tools is an iterative process. First, UAM yield information about the strategies and
impacts of strategies in smaller areas. The information from these models can then be fed into the ROM to yield information
about the collective impact of the UAM assumptions throughout the region. The strategies in each area impact other
areas downwind as the air moves from one area to another. The ROM then yields information about the appropriate boundary
conditions to be input into the next round of each area's UAM. Each iteration in this process yields more refined information
about the effect of strategies in the UAM domains and the appropriate boundary conditions for each UAM domain. In sum,
the UAM is useful to assess the precise strategies in isolated nonattainment areas; the ROM is useful to assess the
relationship between areas in light of their interdependence because of a common transported air mass throughout
the region and to provide boundary conditions for further UAM modeling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Clean Air Act requires that the states submit modeled demonstrations of attainment to EPA on or before November
15, 1994. As described, states will be using the UAM with input from the ROM applications to make these modeled demonstrations,
though none have yet been completed and submitted to EPA for review. In the OTR, the states will model four urban areas
using the UAM: (1) New England; (2) New York City/Connecticut/northern New Jersey; (3) Philadelphia/New Jersey/Maryland;
and (4) Baltimore/Maryland/Washington D.C. These urban areas are so close together and so inter-dependent that
each of these four UAM modeling domains overlaps portions of at least one of the other four. EPA does not expect the states
to complete UAM modeling analysis for the four urban areas that demonstrates that a particular control strategy will
achieve attainment (relying on ROM applications through the iterative process discussed above), until well after
November 1994. EPA's analysis of the need for the LEV program relies principally on several past and ongoing ROM studies.
While EPA could use the complete UAM studies to refine the analysis, EPA believes ROM is the more important modeling
tool for assessing transport. EPA further believes that certain conclusions can now be drawn about the outcome of
the UAM analyses with respect to transport. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has used the ROM over the past several years to study national policies and strategies for reducing ozone.
Because of the large domain subject to a ROM analysis, this tool is well-suited for assessing effects of regional strategies
on regional transport of ozone and its precursors. ROM provides vital information for the states to consider in choosing
sets of individual measures within each nonattainment area for purposes of their attainment demonstrations. EPA
has applied ROM in various studies since 1988 to assess regional effects of control strategies. For purposes of assessing
the amount of reductions needed to attain the ozone NAAQS throughout the OTR, EPA reviewed the results of these ROM
studies. These studies analyzed impacts of various control strategies using data from the actual ozone exceedance
episode in July 1988. During these particular episodes, the ROM model predicted that two sub-regions in the OTR would
have hourly ozone concentrations over 180 ppb (50% over the ozone NAAQS), even after application of the control measures
specifically mandated in the Act.

 reductions in the rural and suburban areas can be important even where such areas are not themselves violating the
NAAQS, because the ozone and ozone precursors from these areas are transported into the nonattainment areas, exacerbating
conditions in the nonattainment areas. EPA concluded that VOC reductions on the order of 70%&hyph;90% from 1985

 levels would be needed to reduce ozone levels to comply with the level specified in the NAAQS in several of the large
cities along the East Coast urban corridor. Based on this and the other studies discussed below, EPA believes that

While these studies used a regional 1985 emission inventory as the baseline, it is the 1990 emissions baseline that
is of particular concern in determining whether LEV is necessary for attainment. Under the Act, states are required
to submit comprehensive 1990 inventories of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and VOC emissions upon which to base their air quality planning, including their attainment demonstrations. EPA
believes that, based on current, recently updated information, both the matrix and ROMNET studies relied on assumptions
about the emissions inventory that underestimated base case VOC and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

 emissions.
<FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>
 This is because inventories used in both the matrix and ROMNET studies were based on older estimates compiled for the
National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program (NAPAP).
<FOOTCITE>25</FOOTCITE>
 For example, EPA believes that inventory assumptions in the matrix study underestimated 1990 baseline emissions
in the OTR for NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 by 16% and VOC by about 38%. Correcting the inventory assumptions in the matrix study should therefore result in modeling
results that reductions in NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and VOC emissions needed for attainment throughout the OTR are even greater than described above. EPA does not have
a precise comparison between the current inventory information and the assumptions relied on in the ROMNET study,
but a comparable difference is likely based on the difference between the current recently updated inventory and
the older NAPAP-based inventory used in ROMNET. Based on these ROM modeling studies and analysis of 1985 and 1990 emission
inventory assumptions, EPA concludes that, at a minimum, 50% to 75% reductions in NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 throughout the OTR and VOC in and near the urban areas emissions will be necessary for regional attainment from the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second step in EPA's analysis is to assess the degree to which transport contributes to the ozone problem in the
OTR. As explained in the April 26 notice, EPA believes that the ``need'' for additional measures in the OTR in order
to comply with section 110(a)(2)(D) focuses primarily on the states' need to adopt the program in question for the
benefit of areas downwind. See 59 FR at 21728. Of course, the states retain full authority to adopt the LEV program under
section 177 for their own benefit without EPA approval. As explained below, analysis of what reductions are needed
for any specific area to avoid causing ozone exceedances downwind is an enormously complicated task that depends
on regional, urban, and wind trajectory modeling information and monitoring data. Further, the analysis of the controls
necessary in an upwind area depends on the controls assumed in the web of downwind areas and other upwind areas. In dealing
with these complications and uncertainties, EPA emphasizes that the lead-time together with the lengthy time needed
for fleet turnover in order to obtain the benefits from the OTC LEV program support reaching a decision now based on
the best data currently available. Based on this data, EPA's conclusion is that very large reductions in NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions on the order of 50% to 75% throughout the OTR are necessary for the serious and severe nonattainment areas
in the OTR to attain the ozone standard by their respective attainment dates. EPA also believes that a similar magnitude
of reductions in VOC emissions is necessary primarily in and near the urban areas of the OTR.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because ROM is useful to assess regional strategies in light of the transport of ozone and ozone precursors across
a region, and is therefore critical to establishing boundary conditions for UAM models, it is also useful to assess
the degree of transport across a region. The ROM studies discussed above therefore are a critical component of the
best current information regarding the extent to which upwind areas contribute to exceedances of the ozone standard
in downwind areas throughout the OTR. Use of these studies, together with regional trajectory analyses, to assess
contribution between areas, is consistent with EPA's published guidance for conducting contribution analyses.
<FOOTCITE>26</FOOTCITE>
 The OTC, too, relied on these approaches consistent with EPA's published guidance to establish the importance of
addressing pollution that is transported throughout the OTR and to thereby support its recommendation that the LEV
program is necessary region-wide.

EPA believes that the ROM studies, together with regional trajectory analyses, show that the large percentage reductions
in NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and VOC discussed above (on the order of 50% to 75% reductions, with somewhat less emphasis on VOC reductions outside
the urban areas) are needed throughout the OTR for purposes of the downwind nonattainment areas to attain the NAAQS.
EPA recognizes that these conclusions are based on ROM and trajectory analyses for the OTR as a whole, and that factual
uncertainty remains regarding the precise degree of contribution for individual small subunits of the modeled domain
to ozone violations in other areas, and the amount of emissions reductions needed to prevent such contribution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assess such contribution for each subunit in the grid would require a myriad of sensitivity tests that are extremely
complicated. This is because contribution from one area to another can be enormously difficult to isolate. The significance
of any particular area's contribution depends on the controls that have been implemented in other areas that share
the same airshed. The interrelationship between the ROM and UAM models illustrates this point. The strategies needed
in the urban areas depend on what is being done in other areas that affects UAM boundary conditions, and the strategies
applied in all of the areas determines the boundary conditions. In short, upwind areas may need to do somewhat less
to avoid causing downwind exceedances if the downwind areas themselves do more, but the upwind areas may need to do
more if the downwind areas do less. And this relationship must account for such variables in the many areas that share
air throughout the northeast.

While recognizing these complications and the associated factual uncertainties, modeling and wind trajectory
analyses show that emissions transport from OTR areas in an arc extending from the south and southwest to the northwest
substantially affect nonattainment areas along the East Coast urban corridor. The OTC's technical support document
for its recommendation
<FOOTCITE>27</FOOTCITE>
 contains several analyses that support this conclusion. These analyses relate wind trajectory data to monitored
ozone data during three multi-day ozone exceedance episodes in 1992 and 1993, as well as the July 1988 episode that
was the subject of the ROMNET study discussed above. These analyses also relate monitoring data at mountaintop sites
during these episodes that indicate a broad region-wide buildup of ozone as the episodes progress. For the 1992 and
1993 episodes, the wind trajectory data together with the timing of high ozone readings at relatively rural sites
in the northern part of the OTR support the conclusion that transport from the East Coast urban corridor toward the
northeast portions of the OTR leads to high regional ozone over a prolonged period.

The analysis of the July 1988 episode relies heavily on EPA's ROMNET study. The ROMNET results indicate that emissions
within the East Coast urban corridor have a dominant impact on predicted ozone levels within the corridor when emissions
levels are very high. The conclusion that corridor-wide emissions play a dominant role in affecting predicted high
ozone concentrations is consistent with findings in a subsequent study EPA has performed for the OTC.
<FOOTCITE>28</FOOTCITE>
 The ROMNET study separately modeled the impact of similar large percentage reductions (60%) in NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions first in OTR nonattainment areas, second in OTR attainment areas and third in the four states bordering
the OTR. The modeling showed that ozone levels in the urban corridor were more sensitive to reductions in the nonattainment
areas (which are mostly in the urban corridor). This was because the actual quantity of emissions and hence the amount
eliminated through a 60% reduction was greater in the urban corridor, and because these reductions were closer to
the problem. However, as shown in the ROMNET study, emissions from outside the urban corridor have an increasingly
important impact as the emissions within the corridor are reduced. Since modeling indicates that very large reductions
inside the urban corridor are needed to approach the NAAQS, EPA expects that large reductions outside the urban corridor
will also become increasingly important and in fact necessary for the nonattainment areas in the urban corridor to
reach the NAAQS.

In addition to the study of these three episodes on which the OTC relied, EPA has reviewed additional surface and aloft
wind trajectory information. This information was generated from ROM wind fields for each of the days analyzed in
the four UAM modeling studies for purposes of attainment demonstrations currently underway for the four UAM modeling
domains in the OTR. In all, EPA analyzed twenty-five days during 1987, 1988 and 1991. EPA has found that on more than
80% of these days surface winds
<FOOTCITE>29</FOOTCITE>
 are from the south to southwesterly direction. This surface wind orientation is consistent with a large cumulative
impact of emissions along the northeast urban corridor. EPA also found that, on about 70% of the days, winds aloft
<FOOTCITE>30</FOOTCITE>
 originate from directions ranging from west-southwest through northwest. This wind aloft orientation is consistent
with a longer range impact on the northeast urban corridor from sources located anywhere from the west-southwest
through the northwest of each of the OTR nonattainment areas in the urban corridor. This would include sources in the
western and northwestern portions of the OTR and beyond.

Even though the UAM analyses for purposes of the attainment demonstrations are not yet complete, EPA believes certain
conclusions can now be drawn about the outcome with respect to transport. The episodes selected for these UAM analyses
were chosen on the basis of high observed ozone concentrations. In other words, the prevailing meteorological conditions
on these days were right for ozone formation. These episodes correspond with wind trajectory information that indicates
a large impact from emissions transported across the region. These wind trajectories will therefore also be used
in the ROM analyses to generate the boundary conditions for feedback into the UAM analyses. These UAM analyses are
the basis for the attainment demonstrations for the OTR, and they are therefore likely to indicate that regional controls
are critical to demonstrating attainment for the four UAM domains. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

An additional source of specific information about transport along the urban corridor is the calculation of boundary
conditions for Washington/Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York and New England for July 7, 1988.
<FOOTCITE>31</FOOTCITE>
 This is the only day subject to modeling in all four UAM domains in the OTR. Estimates of the surface winds for this day
are consistently from the south-southwest for all four domains. Both predicted and observed values for the boundary
conditions for the UAM domains are above or approaching the level of the NAAQS (120 ppm). And the modeled values show
a clear tendency to increase moving northeast along the corridor, thus supporting the conclusion that the emissions
accumulate as they are transported up the corridor.

wind trajectories were from the west or northwest. For most of these days, predicted and observed boundary conditions
are on the order of 50&hyph;90 ppb with one exception on June 22, 1988 for New York. The data for the day with higher boundary
conditions are presented in the following table. The mean values in the table represent the concentrations averaged

Predicted ozone values at the western boundary of the domain for this day are also on the order of 100 ppb. On this day,
the ROM trajectories indicate light surface winds prevailed. The data in the table support the conclusion that these
high boundary conditions result at least in part from long range transport from the western and northwestern OTR.
This, together with all the other information available, further supports the conclusion that controls in the western
and northwestern portions of the OTR are necessary for attainment throughout the region. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, EPA has compiled back-trajectories calculated from ROM for each of the four UAM domains for all days selected
for modeling. The results generally support the conclusion that surface winds from the south through west-southwest
and winds aloft from the northwest to south-southwest transport pollutants across the OTR. This, together with all
of the other available information, supports EPA's conclusion that large emission reductions in NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in both the northeast urban corridor and upwind areas located to the far south-through-northwest of the nonattainment
areas in the urban corridor are necessary, and that large emissions reductions in VOC at least in and near the urban
corridor are necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In sum, EPA analyzed ozone monitoring data, wind trajectory data, and information derived from several analytical
techniques and modeling studies. All of these analyses in combination lead EPA to conclude that large scale regional
transport is a critical component of the ozone nonattainment problem in the OTR. It is clear that to reach attainment
in the northeast urban corridor, the nonattainment areas themselves will have to implement very extensive emission
control programs for NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and VOC to counteract their contribution to ozone violations in their immediate areas and further downwind toward
the northeast. Also, EPA believes, based on best current information, that large reductions in NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions are necessary throughout areas located from the south through the west and northwest, and that large VOC
reductions are necessary for at least the urban portions of the OTR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Analysis of Inventory and Options for Control Measures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Having assessed the magnitude of reductions needed throughout the OTR, the next step in EPA's analysis is to assess
the options available for achieving the necessary 50% to 75% reductions in NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 across the OTR and in VOC for the urban parts of the OTR. In doing so, EPA first assessed the best available information
about the inventory of emissions across the OTR. Then EPA proceeded to consider various potential control measures
to reduce these emissions by the necessary amount. As discussed above in section IV.A.1. and in the April 26 notice,
EPA considered options that are at least potentially reasonable and practicable in light of the OTC LEV program. Based
on this analysis, EPA believes that no combination of potentially reasonable and practicable controls on large and
small stationary point sources, area sources, highway vehicles, offroad mobile sources, and fuels will be sufficient
to achieve the necessary reductions without more stringent standards for new motor vehicles. And the only option
legally available to the states for achieving the necessary further reductions from new motor vehicles is the OTC
LEV program.

 and VOC emissions are based on modeling which used the 1985 NAPAP emissions inventory. However, as stated above, EPA
believes that the amount of reductions necessary from the 1990 baseline are comparable to, or perhaps greater than
the reductions from the 1985 inventory. This means that controls must counteract growth in emissions to produce a
reduction from the emissions levels in 1990 of at least 50&hyph;75%. Inventories reflecting growth and controls
need to be compared to the approximate reduction targets to fully evaluate the need for a LEV program. The table below

 and VOC emissions, therefore, constitute a major portion of the emissions in the OTR, and it is reasonable to conclude
that a workable compliance plan for the OTR must include substantial controls on motor vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, because the LEV program would achieve emissions reductions primarily from gasoline-powered vehicles,
it may be useful to separate the projected mobile source emissions into gasoline and diesel components. EPA estimates

ii. Analysis of Options for Control Measures Without More Stringent New Motor Vehicle Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section reviews options for control measures that could potentially render the OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent)
unnecessary in the OTR. As will be discussed, EPA has determined that such measures do not provide sufficient emissions
reductions without LEV and that therefore LEV is necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In evaluating control options, EPA considered measures that it believes are not clearly unreasonable or impracticable
(and are thus potentially reasonable and practicable). This does not mean that EPA believes that such measures are
in fact reasonable and practicable. Rather, EPA believes that for purposes of assessing whether states might adopt
other reasonable and practicable measures to achieve the needed reductions without OTC LEV, it should consider all
measures that are not clearly unreasonable or impracticable.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA did not consider measures such as mandatory plant shutdowns, gas rationing, and bans on ownership of high-emitting
vehicles because the Agency believes these are clearly unreasonable or impracticable to impose in comparison to
the OTC LEV program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA does not intend its consideration of particular measures here to suggest that the Agency believes such measures
constitute reasonably available control technology (RACT) or reasonably available control measures (RACM) as
those terms of art are used in the Clean Air Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As EPA explained in its April 26 notice and in section III.A.1. above, the Agency believes that cost-effectiveness
of control options is one criterion in evaluating whether they are clearly unreasonable and impracticable. EPA believes
that it should consider additional factors, such as extreme economic and societal costs, disruptions, distributional
impacts, and public acceptance, that would warrant the conclusion that Congress would not have had the Agency consider
particular measures to be viable options for finding other measures unnecessary. See 59 FR at 21726. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In assessing options for control measures, EPA relied, in part, on the same ROM modeling studies EPA used to assess
the overall magnitude of reductions needed in the OTR. These studies are useful to check whether the impact of specific
control strategies corresponds with predictions about the overall magnitude of reductions. See sections IV.A.2.(a)
and (b), above. The first ROM study analyzed the impact of the control measures explicitly mandated in the Act for OTR
areas. The second study is the 1991 ROMNET ``matrix'' study of the impact of a series of uniform reductions in emissions
of NO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, VOC or both. As discussed above, EPA reached conclusions about necessary emissions reduction targets from these
studies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the analysis, EPA first quantified the impact of the measures required by the Act. Next, EPA evaluated an array of
additional control options that are not clearly unreasonable or impracticable that could be implemented in addition
to the mandatory measures. EPA then surveyed other potentially reasonable and practicable control measures to determine
whether those options are sufficient to make up the shortfall which exists after application of the mandatory measures
without the OTC LEV program. These other control options include the maximum region-wide limit on NO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

Plans for three areas in California, and measures listed in compilations of NO

of Local Air Pollution Control Officials (STAPPA/ALAPCO). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA considered both NO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions on the order of 50%&hyph;75% are needed region-wide, while a similar magnitude of VOC reductions are necessary
primarily in or near the East Coast urban corridor. EPA believes that there are insufficient potentially reasonable
and practicable measures to achieve the necessary NO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reductions region-wide without the LEV program. This is a sufficient basis for approval of the OTC's recommendation
and for issuing a finding that the SIPs are substantially inadequate to meet section 110(a)(2)(A) without the LEV
program for the entire region. EPA also believes that there are insufficient potentially reasonable and practicable
measures to achieve the necessary VOC reductions in and near the urban areas, which constitutes an additional basis
for approving the OTC's recommendation and for making a finding of substantial inadequacy with regard to interstate
transport for those areas.

EPA used an 80% Rule Effectiveness value in calculating the overall effectiveness of control measures. Rule effectiveness
was applied to all controls that were not an irreversible process change (for which 100% effectiveness was assumed).
Thus, for the controls that consider Rule Effectiveness the emission reduction due to a particular control device
was calculated as the product of the control efficiency and the Rule Effectiveness value. For example, a device that
controls at a level of 75% would produce an emissions reduction of only 60% (i.e. 0.75 &times; 0.80). Rule effectiveness
is explained in detail in this section, below.

One commenter asked that EPA, in assessing the need for the OTC LEV program, consider the potential for emissions reductions
from landfills. EPA has proposed a new source performance standard (NSPS) for landfills and proposed guidelines
for existing landfill sources. See 56 FR 24468 (May 30, 1991). EPA expects to take final action on the NSPS and the guidance
by December 1994. EPA has taken the resulting emissions reductions into account among the Clean Air Act mandatory
measures.

 and 37% for VOC from the 1990 baseline. As discussed above in sections IV.A.2.(a) and (b), EPA believes this level of
reductions will not be sufficient to attain the ozone NAAQS throughout the OTR. Confirming this conclusion, ROM studies
of four episodes applying these measures in 2005 for all days being modeled in the four UAM domains in the OTR yield predictions
of ozone levels above the 120 ppb NAAQS in five OTR subregions. These subregions include the UAM domains for Baltimore/Washington,
Philadelphia, New York City and New England, and west/central Pennsylvania. Further, the model predicts ozone levels
would exceed 160 ppb in at least one subregion for each of the episodes.

EPA notes that these percentage reductions are from a 2005 projected baseline. EPA's conclusion that a 50%&hyph;75%
reduction in emissions is from a 1990 inventory baseline. It is important to bear in mind throughout this analysis
that the 1990 baseline inventory is substantially larger than the projected 2005 baseline, which presumes application
of mandatory Clean Air Act controls. Therefore, percentage reductions that particular measures achieve from the
2005 are larger than the percentage reductions those same measures would achieve if calculated from the 1990 baseline.

&bull;Transportation Control Measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA also considered transportation control measures (TCMs) as potentially reasonable and practicable measures
available for the OTR. There are a wide range of TCMs that have been proposed, but EPA believes that many of them, such
as gasoline rationing, are unreasonable and impracticable here. Two options that EPA considers potentially reasonable
and practicable are the extension of the Employee Commute Option (ECO) program region-wide and implementation of
a comprehensive system of congestion pricing, employee parking pricing, and emissions-based registration fees.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 182(d)(1)(B) of the Act mandates that the severe areas in the OTR adopt employee trip reduction programs (also
known as ECO programs). Under these programs, each employer with more than one hundred employees must offer incentives
and encouragement for employees to travel to work by means other than single-occupant vehicles. The eventual goal
of the program is to achieve a 25% increase in vehicle occupancy for morning commuting trips. This is equivalent to
one out of five employees using a mode of commuting, other than driving. EPA's best case estimate of the benefits of
extending the ECO program region-wide is a three percent reduction in vehicle miles travelled (VMT) in the OTR. This
reduction in VMT would correspond to approximately a two percent reduction in NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and VOC emissions from light-duty vehicles in the OTR, and to a 0.6% reduction in overall NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions and a 0.4% reduction in overall VOC emissions from the 2005 baseline. The incremental amount of reductions
is limited because the program would only affect the limited number of large employers outside the severe areas and
because commuting trips are only a fraction of overall trips and VMT. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A second TCM option is a comprehensive system of fees and incentives designed to affect driving habits and vehicle
usage. These controls, including congestion pricing, employee parking pricing, and emissions-based registration
fees, are described in the Cameron Report.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
42
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 These measures could possibly achieve a 12% reduction in car and light-truck VMT in the OTR. This would correspond

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The use of California reformulated gasoline in the OTR is another option that has been mentioned. This program would
generate limited additional emissions reductions in the OTR. California reformulated gasoline achieves greater
emissions reductions than Federal reformulated gasoline, due to the different specifications for the California
fuel, such as a lower Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP). EPA estimates that the implementation of California reformulated
gasoline in the OTR could provide an approximate six to seven percent reduction in NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

EPA also considered additional emission reduction measures that the Agency has included in a proposed Federal Implementation
Plan (FIP) for the Ventura, Sacramento, and South Coast areas of California. See 59 FR 23263 (May 5, 1994). As the following
discussion indicates, the measures proposed for consideration in these FIPs which are not unreasonable or impracticable
and which could be implemented by the states in the OTR, have largely been considered as part of other strategies discussed
above. Those that remain would not generate a substantial reduction in emissions from the overall inventory.

Context Surrounding FIP Measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The court-ordered obligation that EPA produce FIPs for three regions of California has placed EPA in an unusual position.
The Clean Air Act places primary responsibility for clean air planning at the regional, state and local levels. This
is appropriate because state and local officials have the specific knowledge, flexibility, and sensitivity to tailor
clean air plans to the particular needs of their communities. Throughout the FIP development process, EPA has acknowledged
that the measures at its disposal include blunt instruments that have the potential for significant social and economic
impact. Also, the time constraints imposed by the court order and the functional limits on EPA's ability to fashion
measures which meet the specific needs of localities have forced the Agency to propose a number of measures that would
not be appropriate for implementation in the OTR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The pollution problems experienced in California are of a magnitude far greater than those experienced anywhere
else in the nation. Moreover, the OTC, with its recommendation here, seeks to benefit from the leadership California
has demonstrated in setting strict pollution standards for new vehicles. The measures proposed in the FIP generally
supplement measures California has already adopted. The LEV program is a critical aspect of California's attainment
strategy and the FIP. When considering whether FIP measures may constitute part of a set of measures sufficient to
achieve the necessary reductions in the OTR without the LEV (or LEV-equivalent) program, it is essential to stress
that EPA proposed these measures for California in addition to the LEV program that California had already adopted
in 1990. If the LEV program had not already been adopted, EPA would have had to propose a measure very much like it for
the FIP, due to the substantial and relatively cost-effective benefits that the program will provide in California.

Description of FIP Measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the purposes of this discussion, EPA has grouped proposed FIP measures into four broad categories: (1) FIP measures
that are not practicable in the OTR because they depend on federal authority to be implemented or are predicated on
special regulatory authority Congress has conferred only upon California; (2) FIP measures that are clearly unreasonable
and impracticable in the OTR because they are predicated upon industrial or geographic circumstances that are particular
to California; (3) FIP measures that are unreasonable and impracticable in the OTR relative to LEV implementation
because they are too costly or speculative; and (4) FIP measures which are not clearly unreasonable or impracticable
for implementation in the OTR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Measures excluded because they depend on unique authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Federal Authority_EPA proposed two different types of FIP measures relying on EPA's unique federal authority.
Most were measures that would apply nationally, such as recreational marine vessel controls, and thus would apply
in the OTR, as well. Additionally, EPA proposed some parts of the FIP solely under authority accorded to the Agency
under the FIP provisions in section 110(c). These parts of the FIP regulated source categories including new locomotives
and farm and construction equipment under 175 hp. See section 209(e)(1). These proposed FIPs would rely on section
110(c) to impose requirements for these sources that are more stringent than EPA has proposed for the nation as a whole.
All states, including California, are preempted from regulating this category of sources. Therefore, no state in
the OTR has the option of adopting these controls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. State Authority_California has authority under section 209 of the Act to address pollution from on-highway and
nonroad engines (except certain categories of nonroad engines noted above), which other states do not have. In the
FIP proposal, EPA stepped into the shoes of California and proposed several measures under California's section
209 authority for California only. Generally, these measures are tight new emission standards for new on-highway
and nonroad equipment. EPA also proposed certain measures to improve durability of on-highway and nonroad equipment
to better control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions in-use. EPA again proposed these programs under California's special authority that other states do not
have. Because states are preempted from adopting such regulations in the absence of California regulations actually
adopted under California's Clean Air Act authority, states in the OTR do not now have the option of adopting any of these
controls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) FIP measures that are impracticable in the OTR because they are predicated upon industrial or geographic circumstances
that are particular to California.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA proposed several programs for the FIP that deal with circumstances unique to California's industrial and geographic
circumstances and are therefore inappropriate for the OTR. For example, due to the fire hazards inherent in an arid
region, California fire departments burn vegetation periodically to lower the risk of a wild fire. EPA proposed that
these burns only occur on certain days so that the pollution from the fire does not add to ozone exceedances. Since such
burns do not occur in the OTR, such requirements would not make sense there. The rules regarding outer continental
shelf oil exploration are another example of rules which may make sense in California but not in the OTR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) FIP measures that are unreasonable or impracticable in the OTR because they are too costly or disruptive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FIP contains ``cap'' rules for stationary sources which impose an annual rate of reduction on affected sources
for as many controllable VOC and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 categories as possible. The emission reduction targets are derived from the overall shortfall in the FIP area rather
than any consideration of available emission control technologies. EPA's proposal anticipates that the state and
local agencies can over time develop carefully tailored economic incentive programs or traditional rules based
upon the most recent technologies and regulatory approaches. But the cap rules themselves are not examples of specific
regulatory approaches to be adopted at the state or local level. These are therefore blunt instruments without specific
and identifiable emissions control mechanisms in mind. As such, they may be costly to achieve and EPA cannot now conclude
that they are based on technologies that are potentially practicable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Beginning in 2004, the FIP also proposes to discourage the use of older high polluting recreational boat engines through
the imposition of a user fee and permit system. EPA believes that measures which restrict individual behavior or prevent
citizens from benefitting from investments made in property are particularly difficult to implement. EPA does not
believe it is reasonable to adopt such measures before implementation of the LEV standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Proposed FIP measures which are not clearly unreasonable and impracticable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many of the proposed FIP measures are based on national, state and local initiatives that EPA does not believe it should
dismiss as clearly unreasonable or impracticable. Nationally, there are a variety of standards for stationary and
mobile sources. California initiatives include the LEV program itself, as well as other measures applicable to consumer
products. The FIP proposal also takes into account local efforts in the affected California areas to reduce NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 from stationary and mobile sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is in the process of developing many national rules that it took into account in the FIP proposal and that it therefore
expects to apply in the OTR. For example, apart from the FIP proposal, EPA is developing by November 1995, nation-wide
emission standards for new marine engines. EPA is also developing standards for locomotives and small nonroad engines
under 25 hp. California has also developed rules to reduce VOC emissions from paints and other consumer products and
EPA is developing similar controls on the VOC content of consumer and commercial solvents and architectural coatings.
EPA has already accounted for the benefits of all of these measures for the OTR above, in its modeling of the impact of
the mandatory Clean Air Act measures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Local areas in California, especially the South Coast Air Quality Management District (South Coast), have been especially
innovative in developing emissions reduction programs. There are two programs that EPA took into account in its FIP
proposal which merit special comment here. First, the South Coast developed an ECO program to reduce the number of
vehicle miles travelled to and from major employers. As discussed above, the Clean Air Act now requires many nonattainment
areas to implement ECO programs. EPA proposed in the FIP to expand coverage to Sacramento. As discussed above, the
ECO programs already required for certain areas in the OTR could be expanded region-wide, or applied to smaller employers
than currently mandated. However, as noted above, the incremental benefits from these programs appear to be relatively
small. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The South Coast has also developed a new program that EPA took into account in its FIP proposal, known as the Regional
Clean Air Incentives Market (RECLAIM), to establish a declining cap on NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions from stationary sources. Unlike the South Coast, however, large stationary NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 sources in the OTR are dominated by coal-fired utilities. In place of a declining NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 cap program, the OTR states are developing a plan to impose a stringent NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

 standard for utilities. This is part of the 0.15 lbs/MMBtu NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 standard , discussed above. This standard is substantially more stringent than many in the OTR believe to be reasonable,
but EPA has nonetheless modeled the impacts of such a strategy in its analysis here.

In evaluating the emissions reductions attributable to particular control measures, it is important to consider
the effectiveness of the rules. If all sources fully comply with the rules at all times, and if there were never problems
with control equipment, then the emission reductions associated with control measures could be calculated and summed
to reflect the anticipated reductions as a result of applying specific regulations. However, past history has shown
that rules are not consistently applied or enforced, control equipment malfunctions, and operating and maintenance
problems occur, all contributing to air emissions. These emissions are accounted for through the application of
rule effectiveness (RE) guidelines. This is a means of identifying and estimating the increased emissions failures
and uncertainties in emission control programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rule effectiveness is a measure of the extent to which a rule actually achieves its desired emission reductions. It
accounts for a variety of factors that influence the efficacy of emission control programs, including: the nature
of the regulation or control (e.g., complexity of record-keeping or test methods); nature of control techniques
(e.g., potential for fugitive emissions); performance of sources in complying with the regulation (e.g., schedule
of maintenance and inspection of control equipment); and performance of those enforcing the regulation (e.g., inspector
training). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA accounts for RE for mobile source controls that affect the mobile emissions factors internally in the MOBILE model.
For stationary sources, however, the emissions inventory must account for RE to yield more reliable estimates of
the actual emissions reductions that SIP rules will achieve. In general, EPA specifies an 80 percent default RE value
in the absence of a local category-specific RE value. In essence, this assumes that the ability to use control devices
or regulations to achieve emission reductions is only 80 percent effective. Without application of RE to the emissions
inventory, the emissions reductions estimated to occur as a result of control measures would be overly optimistic.
Although EPA's analysis of measures mandated in the Act accounts for RE, the emissions reductions assumed for the
other measures may not have accounted for REs and must therefore be considered overly optimistic.

 Conclusions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As described above, EPA believes reductions in the range of 50% to 75% from 1990 baseline NO

 and VOC emissions levels will be needed to enable all of the serious and severe nonattainment areas in the OTR to attain
the ozone standard. The NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reductions are needed throughout the OTR and the VOC reductions are needed at least in and near the urban portions of
the OTR. EPA recognizes that there are uncertainties in its modeling analysis used to reach this conclusion. For the
reasons described earlier in this notice, EPA believes it would be appropriate generally to resolve uncertainties
in its factual analysis in favor of the most environmentally conservative course. EPA requests comment on whether,
for purposes of its analysis of alternative control measures, EPA should conclude that the middle of this range, or
at least a 65% reduction from baseline NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions, will be necessary throughout the OTR. Here, as described below, EPA believes that focus on the low end of
the range would not change its conclusion. In addition to uncertainties in the atmospheric models, uncertainties
also exist in the base year emissions inventories, the projected emissions that account for growth in the future,
the amount of emission reductions estimated to result from implementation of the control measures (including consideration
of rule effectiveness), and the modeled ozone concentrations resulting from the emissions. Additionally, EPA believes
that it should err on the side of environmental protection in addressing these uncertainties.

In addition, the transportation control measures that EPA would not consider clearly impracticable or unreasonable
(including expanded geographic coverage of ECO programs and implementation of a comprehensive system of congestion
pricing, employee parking pricing, and emissions-based registration fees, and the versions of those measures included
in EPA's FIP proposal), would yield a combined reduction of 2.5% from 1990 baseline inventory-wide NO

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reduction EPA believes is needed throughout the OTR for attainment in the serious and severe nonattainment areas
of the region. As a result, those areas will not be able to attain the standard through application of all of the potentially
practicable measures, without NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reductions from more stringent emissions standards for new vehicles region-wide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After evaluating the control measures discussed above, EPA concludes that the emissions reductions resulting from
application of potentially reasonable and practicable control measures will not be sufficient to achieve attainment
throughout the OTR without more stringent new vehicle emission standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mobile source emissions comprise a significant part of the 2005 NO

 and VOC emissions inventories. Indeed, EPA believes that, apart from its analysis of each potentially reasonable
control option independently, the reasonableness and practicability of adopting all these controls measures without
adopting more stringent standards for new motor vehicles is questionable. And for NOx, while additional emissions
reductions from other source categories will be important to meet the attainment goal, EPA believes the measures
will be needed in addition to, rather than in place of, more stringent controls for new motor vehicles throughout the
OTR. Although EPA has not quantified all of the VOC reduction measures described above, EPA believes the conclusion
also applies for VOC, at least in and near the urban portions of the OTR.

iii. Determination Whether Reductions from OTC LEV (or LEV-Equivalent) Approach to New Motor Vehicles Are Necessary.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

EPA believes that the foregoing information supports the conclusion that sufficient options to make up the shortfall
in emissions reductions necessary for attainment in the OTR are not available from sources other than new motor vehicles,
and that additional reductions in NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and VOC emissions from new motor vehicles are therefore necessary. EPA believes that the OTC LEV program would achieve
reductions beyond the mandated Clean Air Act measures by 2005 of 4% for NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

These calculations are based on the incremental effect of the LEV program beginning in 1999 throughout the OTR over
the reductions that will take place in New York and Massachusetts as a result of their existing LEV programs beginning
in 1996. Due to the phase-in schedule for the LEV program and the time required for fleet turnover, the maximum benefit
for LEV would not be realized until 2028. Therefore, EPA expects that emissions reductions attributable to an OTC
LEV program would continue to grow after 2005. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the OTC LEV program, some increases in emissions would be associated with the permanent migration of non-LEVs
into the OTR, and with temporary visits by non-LEV vehicles from other states. The amount of excess emissions associated
with migrating and visiting vehicles is dependent on two factors: (1) the difference in emissions per car between
the cars entering the OTR and the ``native'' fleet within the OTR; and (2) the number and age-mix of the cars entering
the OTR from outside. Both questions are difficult to answer and will have different answers for permanent migration
and temporary visitation. The numbers in this Table 4 do not include these effects because EPA is still analyzing this
issue and has not yet quantified these effects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When this analysis is ready, EPA will put it in the docket and publish a notice of data availability in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As described above, EPA does not believe other practicable options are available to make up the shortfall to achieve
the reductions necessary in the OTR for attainment. Therefore, EPA believes that a program available to achieve more
reductions from new motor vehicles is necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Legal limitations make the LEV program the only option available to the states to achieve what are necessary additional
reductions from new motor vehicles. Section 209 of the Act prohibits states from adopting or attempting to enforce
any standard relating to the control of emissions from new motor vehicles or engines, except for California if a waiver
is granted. This is subject to a limited exception provided in section 177 for states that have SIP provisions approved
under part D of the Act to adopt and enforce emissions standards for new motor vehicles and engines if: (1) Such standards
are identical to the California standards for which a waiver has been granted; and (2) California and the state adopt
the standards at least two years before the beginning of the model year in which the standards are to apply. EPA has granted
a waiver for the California LEV standards, and the states can therefore adopt them.

 At the same time, section 202(b)(1)(C) explicitly prohibits EPA from changing the current ``Tier 1'' emissions standards
for new motor vehicles in sections 202(a)(3)(B)(ii), (g), (h), and (i) before model year 2004.

Therefore, no options other than the LEV program are currently available to achieve the necessary additional reductions
from new motor vehicles and engines. As explained in section V of this notice, EPA is proposing to allow for the possibility
that an alternative federal program achieving comparable emissions reductions to the OTC LEV program may be developed.
But the possibility that such an alternative program can be developed in the future does not contradict the conclusion
that the only option currently available to the states to achieve the required reductions in new motor vehicle emissions
(the LEV program) is necessary.

 In addition, when the California Air Resources Board (CARB or the Board) initially approved its LEV regulations in
1990, it directed CARB to report biennially to the Board on the status of implementation of the regulations. The staff
provided the Board with the first such report at a June 11, 1992 public meeting. At the time the Board found that the low-emission
vehicle standards continued to be technologically feasible within the required time frames, and accordingly no
changes to the standards or phase-in schedule were needed.

did recognize that a variety of amendments would be appropriate to augment the LEV regulations, make them clearer,
and facilitate their implementation. This recognition led to the adoption of several LEV ``follow-up'' amendments,
which were formally adopted by the Board. On September 22, 1993, CARB sent a letter requesting that EPA confirm the
Board's determination that these amendments fall within the scope of the January 8, 1993 waiver for the California

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To determine emission reduction equivalency, alternatives must be compared to the emission reduction potential
of the OTC LEV recommendation with respect to the primary ozone precursors. This means that the OTC will assess non-methane
organic gases (NMOG) exhaust emissions, NMOG evaporative emissions, and exhaust emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO

full benefits available from the ZEV component.

 emissions benefits of the ZEV sales requirement without selling ZEV's, they would have to provide a mix of vehicles
subject to requirements in addition to the NMOG fleet average achievement. Under the ZEV equivalency approach, states
could provide the auto manufacturers the option of either complying with the ZEV sales requirement or selling a mix
of other vehicles, which could include some ZEVs, that satisfies both the NMOG requirements and also achieves the
additional benefits equivalent to those that would result from meeting the full ZEV sales requirement. This approach
raises a number of questions on which EPA is soliciting comment: (1) What emission reductions are attributable to
the ZEV sales mandate that would not be realized if only the NMOG fleet average part of the program were adopted? (2)
How would auto manufacturers demonstrate that their mix of vehicles achieved the same total emissions reductions
as the NMOG average plus the ZEV sales mandate? (3) Would such a demonstration require EPA or the states to set a new emission
standard or a sales mandate for non-ZEV vehicles?

EPA requests comment on a number of other issues pertaining to such a ``ZEV equivalency'' requirement, and whether
the Agency should include such a requirement in the final rule. First, EPA requests comment on whether the OTC's recommendation
can be interpreted to include a requirement that the states' programs achieve the benefits of the ZEV sales requirement
in addition to the remainder of the recommended LEV program from the new vehicle sector. EPA also requests comment
on whether the August 4 letter from the Chair of the OTC supports this interpretation, and the extent to which EPA may
rely on such a letter to determine the intent of the OTC's February 10 recommendation.

Finally, EPA notes that commenters suggesting this approach have not provided a specific explanation of how the states

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that its analysis of the contribution from one area to another in the OTR should be understood in the specific
context of the OTC LEV program in question here. EPA believes that several aspects of this particular program further
support EPA's conclusion that it is necessary to adopt this program region-wide to counteract ozone transport. Many
parties have commented that the OTC LEV program should apply on a region-wide basis in order to attain the greatest
amount of emissions reductions and facilitate operation of the LEV program.

First, new car sales are very much an interstate business, particularly in the northeast where many smaller states
are located together. Consumers frequently travel throughout a particular state and to different states to buy cars.
To the extent consumers in the more polluted nonattainment areas can continue to buy cars elsewhere in the same state
or in other states, then it is especially important that the cars they buy elsewhere meet the strictest emissions standards
needed for emissions reductions in the more polluted areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interstate business aspect is especially true in border areas of larger states, and can pervade smaller states,
such as those in the OTR. For example, according to auto dealers in Greenwich, Connecticut, fifty percent of their
sales are to New York residents. Dealers in different states regularly trade vehicles among themselves. Dealers
also engage in ``drop shipments,'' where a dealer accepts an order from an out-of-state customer and the vehicle is
shipped directly to the customer without ever physically entering the dealer's inventory. To accommodate such practices,
EPA has adopted a ``cross-border sales'' policy that in effect permits the sale of cars certified to California standards
in states that are contiguous to those that have adopted California standards.
<FOOTCITE>56</FOOTCITE>
 Indeed, members of Congress from Maine have urged EPA to extend this cross-border sales policy to dealers in Maine
because they claim that 125 out of 170 Maine dealers rely on vehicle trades with Massachusetts dealers. While they
explained that those in southern Maine are most affected, even dealers as far north as Bangor trade with Massachusetts
dealers.

It is important that the states adopt OTC LEV as soon as possible because the air quality benefits from the program will
not be realized immediately. This delay in air quality benefits is due to the leadtime requirement in section 177 and
the time required for fleet turnover. For the California standards to apply in another state, section 177 of the Act
requires that California and the adopting state adopt the standards at least two years before commencement of the
model year in which the LEV standards are to apply. Due to the phase-in schedule for the LEV program and the time required
for fleet turnover, the maximum benefit for LEV would not be realized until 2028.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is also very important that the emissions sources in question here are mobile. Residents of particular states drive
their cars into other states, and may even relocate to such other states. This may be particularly true in the northeast,
where there is a high concentration of large metropolitan areas and a very dense transportation infrastructure that
allows people to drive into and between these big cities. For this reason, it makes particular sense to ensure to the
maximum extent possible that the fleet of cars throughout the region meet the strictest emissions standards needed
for emission reductions in the more polluted areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these business and environmental reasons, industry and government organizations, including auto dealers and
states, have urged that if the program is to be adopted, all states in the region should do so.
<FOOTCITE>58</FOOTCITE>
 Requiring that different cars meeting LEV standards be sold in different parts of the same state, in a potential patchwork
across the region, could create business difficulties and could also compromise the intended environmental benefits
of the program. Indeed, congressional debate over the adoption of section 177 reflected this concern.
<FOOTCITE>59</FOOTCITE>
 Presumably due to these concerns, a number of states in the OTR have actually adopted legislative authority or actual
regulations to implement the LEV program under section 177 that would go into effect on the condition that some number
of other neighboring states in the region likewise implement the program.

Finally, EPA believes that its action in approving state volatility controls as necessary under section 211(c)(4)(C)
constitutes a precedent for considering business practices to conclude that the program should apply state-wide,
even if it may not have been environmentally necessary in that case across the entire state. In that case, EPA approved
New York's adoption of volatility controls as necessary throughout New York, even in areas that were in attainment
for ozone, in part based on the fact that the pipeline distribution network for gasoline made the supply of different
gasoline to different parts of the state difficult for business and for program administration. Therefore, EPA concluded
that the need for the program in part of the state justified allowing New York to adopt it state-wide under section 211(c)(4)(C).

EPA is not now proposing that Virginia adopt the OTC LEV program state-wide, but requests comment on this issue. Congress
designated only the northern portion of Virginia that is part of the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area as part of
the OTR. Therefore, Congress clearly intended that Northern Virginia can be treated separately from the remainder
of Virginia for the purposes of ozone transport, and that pollution control in northern Virginia is particularly
important for attainment of the ozone NAAQS in the northeast. Also, there has been no motion under section 176A to extend
the OTR to the rest of Virginia on grounds that the rest of the state contributes significantly to nonattainment in
the region. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, certain commenters questioned a state's authority to adopt California standards in part of a state. Though
EPA disagrees with such comments, as discussed below, EPA requests comment on whether its final action should require
Virginia to adopt the OTC LEV program state-wide. While EPA believes that there is good reason generally for the program
to apply state-wide and region-wide in the OTR, EPA does not believe that state-wide application is legally required
under section 177. Section 177 was clearly designed to deal with nonattainment of standards. This is consistent with
the heading for section 177: ``New Motor Vehicle Standards in Nonattainment Areas.''

 Section 177 does not require statewide implementation of California standards; nor do any of the explicit requirements
of section 177 imply a requirement for statewide implementation. Section 177 merely requires that the state adopt
standards that are identical to the California standards. EPA believes it is most reasonable to interpret the geographical
area in which the standards apply to be a part of the California program that is not an aspect of the term ``standards''
in section 177(l). Of course, other states applying the California standards will necessarily apply them in a variety
of places different from California. And the underlying rationale for the identicality requirement that other states
not adopt standards creating a ``third vehicle'' is not implicated by limitation of the program to part of a state.

(e) Conclusions regarding need for OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) for purposes of attainment by the dates provided in
subpart 2 of part D of title I. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's approach has been to analyze the reductions needed in the OTR for purposes of attainment, and then the options
available to achieve those needed reductions. As discussed above, EPA believes that a 50% to 75% reduction in NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions throughout the OTR and VOC emissions in and near the urban areas will be necessary for attainment throughout
the OTR. This range is based on studies that used a 1985 emissions baseline. Updated inventory information indicates
that the 1985 inventory underestimated actual emissions. Therefore, EPA believes at least 50% to 75% emissions reductions,
and possibly more, are needed from the 1990 emissions baseline. EPA's modeling analysis has focused generally on
the inventory in the year 2005. As discussed in section IV.A.2.(a), the percentage reductions necessary from the
1990 baseline for purposes of attainment do not change over time and do not depend on EPA's choice of 2005 for purposes
of modeling. Still, control options for achieving those reductions by a particular time can vary, if it takes time
for certain measures to be developed or to be implemented and to achieve reductions. Also, the growth that states must
counteract in order to achieve the percentage reductions from the 1990 baseline will continue to rise over time. EPA's
conclusion that the OTC LEV program is necessary for attainment in the OTR applies for all of the serious and severe
areas with attainment deadlines of 1999, 2005 and 2007. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the analysis focusing on the 2005 inventory, EPA believes that the OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) program is
necessary for the severe nonattainment areas in the OTR to attain by the 2005 deadline. EPA believes there is no basis
to find that its conclusion that the OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) program is necessary would be different for emissions
that contribute to nonattainment in the New York-New Jersey-Connecticut severe area, which has a 2007 attainment
deadline. The control options EPA assessed will not achieve such greater reductions in the extra two years so as to
make up the shortfall in reductions needed for attainment without the LEV program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, it is important to note that each of the states in the New York-New Jersey-Connecticut nonattainment area needs
the OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) program in order for the other two to reach attainment by 2007. These three states are
part of a common airshed and represent a single area in which pollutants from VOC and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions mix to form a plume of high ozone concentrations. In addition, there is considerable interstate travel
by commuters between these states within this nonattainment area such that non-LEV vehicles from one state would
reduce the effectiveness of a LEV program in the adjacent states. For similar reasons, these states may also need the
LEV (or LEV-equivalent) program in order that the southern New Jersey-Philadelphia nonattainment area (that abuts
the New York-New Jersey-Connecticut area) may attain by 2005.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA further believes that the OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) program is needed in the OTR in order for serious areas with
a 1999 attainment deadline to attain on time. Such areas, including the northern serious areas downwind of the New
York-New Jersey-Connecticut area and western/northwestern New England, face a need for tremendous reductions
on a very fast track in order to attain by 1999. Since EPA believes that other reasonable and practicable options are
not available to achieve the entire shortfall in emissions reductions necessary for timely attainment, even the
limited reductions that the OTC LEV program would achieve in model year 1999 are actually necessary. And the program
is not impracticable or unreasonable for this purpose, since the costs in 1999 will be limited in proportion to the
limited vehicles that will meet the standards during that first model year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, EPA believes the manner in which areas actually demonstrate that they ultimately achieve attainment further
supports the conclusion that the OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) program is necessary for the serious areas to attain
by 1999. According to EPA guidance, attainment is reached when an area experiences no more than three exceedances
of the ozone NAAQS over a three-year period.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
62
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In other words, air quality that results in no more than one exceedance of the NAAQS per year averaged over three years
will be sufficient for attainment, and three years of such data are necessary to demonstrate that the state has achieved
such air quality.

This is assuming the area has complete ozone monitoring data. An adjustment is specified in the ozone NAAQS to account
for missing data. Where data are incomplete, the number of exceedances that would be expected had the data been complete
is calculated to determine the attainment status of the area; See 40 CFR 50.9 as interpreted by Appendix H; ``State

The Clean Air Act attainment requirements take into account that states may not be able to achieve air quality improvements
two years prior to the attainment year deadline in order to be able to show attainment over a three-year period ending
by that deadline year. Under section 181(a)(5) of the Act, a state may apply to EPA for a one-year extension of the attainment
deadline specified in section 181 if the state has complied with all SIP requirements and the area in question has experienced
no more than one exceedance of the ozone NAAQS during the deadline year, containing the attainment date. EPA may grant
up to two one-year extensions under this provision. Of course, in order to achieve the NAAQS and be eligible for redesignation
to attainment, the states must sustain the air quality improvements achieved in order to have not more than one exceedance
for each of the two extension years, and are likely to have to control growth in emissions in order to do so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Serious areas in the OTR may need to rely on extensions of the attainment deadline under section 181(a)(5) in order
to avoid a finding of failure to attain (and the consequent ``bump-up'' to a severe classification with a 2005 attainment
date).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
63
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA believes it is highly likely, in such a case, that OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) will be necessary to achieve reductions
in order to offset growth and sustain attainment-level air quality through the 2000 and 2001 extension years. OTC
LEV would generate increasing reductions in those years, due to fleet turnover.

In sum, since OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) is necessary to bring serious and severe areas stretching from Washington,
DC to Portsmouth, New Hampshire into attainment by the 1999, 2005, and 2007 deadlines applicable to those areas, and
because the reductions from OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) will be needed in areas located in a broad area extending from
the south through the northwest of each of those areas and nearby locations from which vehicles may travel and be traded,
EPA proposes to conclude that OTC LEV is necessary throughout the OTR to bring those areas into attainment by those
dates.

3. Need for OTC LEV (or LEV-Equivalent) Program for Purposes of Maintenance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Legal Relevance of Maintenance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA discussed the timing of reductions from the OTC LEV program and the relevance of maintenance to its inquiry at length
in the April 26 proposal. See 59 FR 21728&hyph;21730. The program would not achieve substantial reductions until
after its first implementation in model year 1999. There is much evidence that the nonattainment problem in the severe
areas is a regional problem in origin, and that the OTC LEV program is therefore needed throughout much of the region
to prevent contribution to nonattainment in the severe areas. In addition, however, EPA believes that the states
in the OTR need the program to avoid interference with downwind maintenance of the NAAQS even after it is achieved.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While EPA believes it should consider this maintenance need here, it must have legal authority to do so. In the April
26 notice, EPA raised this issue because the language in section 184(c) describing the basis for an OTC recommendation,
EPA's obligation in reviewing it, and EPA's obligation to explain why any control measure is not necessary all reference
necessity ``to bring an area in such region into attainment by the dates provided by this subpart'' and omit any reference
to maintenance. Nevertheless, EPA currently believes that it has legal authority to consider maintenance under
section 184, and in any case has independent authority for the action proposed here on maintenance grounds directly
under sections 110(k)(5) and 110(a)(2)(D). EPA believes that these sections of the Act, together with the overall
structure of title I, support this conclusion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To be sure, other provisions of the Act explicitly distinguish between ``attainment'' and ``maintenance.'' Beginning
with the overall goal of healthful ambient air quality, section 109(b) requires EPA to issue ambient air quality standards
``the attainment and maintenance of which'' are necessary to protect the public health or welfare. The current statutory
structure as revised in the 1990 Amendments, however, reflects a difference between the manner in which Congress
addressed states' attainment and maintenance obligations with respect to their own independent air quality and
the manner in which Congress addressed states' obligations to prevent contribution to downwind nonattainment and
interference with downwind maintenance. In sum, EPA believes that this new structure establishes particular time-frames
for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
states to address attainment separately from maintenance to protect their own air quality, but left much greater
discretion for EPA to insist that states address these concerns at all times when states' emissions cause harm in other
states. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to 1990, initial SIPs due nine months after EPA promulgation of a NAAQS were to include programs designed both
to attain and thereafter maintain the standards. See prior section 110(a)(2) (B) and (D) and section 172(a). In 1990,
for areas designated as nonattainment areas, Congress specified requirements for attainment and maintenance in
discrete provisions that provide for discrete SIP submissions to address these two separable concerns. Section
172 continues to require submission of a SIP providing for the attainment of the NAAQS in nonattainment areas. The
subpart 2 ozone program specifies deadlines for submission of a variety of SIP revisions, including attainment demonstrations
for moderate and above areas. Maintenance considerations for nonattainment areas were specifically relocated
to a new section 175A, which provides that states are to submit plans, including additional control measures, as necessary
to ensure maintenance for at least 10 years following redesignation to attainment. See section 175A(a). Significantly,
section 175A includes no requirement that a state adopt measures to address transport of pollutants that may interfere
with maintenance downwind.

One might assume that an area that is in attainment and maintains that status could not interfere with attainment or
maintenance downwind. Intuitively, one might not expect a ``clean air'' area to cause other areas to have ``dirty
air.'' But this is not the case. Areas that meet the standard may nonetheless have emissions that interfere with attainment
or maintenance downwind. Indeed, Congress's decision to require control measures such as RACT and nonattainment
new source review even in attainment areas throughout the OTR under section 184(b) indicates Congress understood
that ``clean air'' areas could contribute to ``dirty air'' downwind.

Consistent with this new structure, Congress changed the requirement formerly codified at section 110(a)(2)(D)
that required SIPs to include a permit program for stationary sources as necessary to assure that NAAQS ``are achieved
and maintained.'' The new section 110(a)(2)(C) simply requires regulation of stationary sources as necessary to
assure that NAAQS ``are achieved.'' Thus, it appears that Congress specifically deleted references to maintenance
in section 110(a)(2) where it believed that to be appropriate in light of the new structure and new section 175A.

Congress did leave a reference in section 110(a)(2)(C) to ``a permit program as required in parts C and D.'' The part
C permit program codified at section 165 of the Act is designed to prevent significant deterioration of air quality
in attainment areas, and hence would only be relevant to maintenance, not achieving attainment. One might argue from
this that Congress intended the reference to attainment in section 110(a)(2)(C) to include maintenance, as well.
But, the better view may be that Congress simply overlooked the need to delete the reference to part C in light of its
specific deletion of the reference to maintenance.

However, Congress made no such change to the pollution transport provisions of section 110(a)(2). The transport
provision was significantly broadened from the former section 110(a)(2)(E) to new section 110(a)(2)(D), as discussed
above. Nonetheless, in changing the language of the transport provision, Congress saw fit to retain the reference
to maintenance. Indeed, Congress had to specifically focus on this issue when it changed the standard from ``prevent[s]
attainment or maintenance'' in the former provision to ``contributes significantly'' to nonattainment and ``interfere[s]
with maintenance'' in the new provision. This indicates Congress specifically sought to retain maintenance as a
criterion for pollution transport under section 110(a)(2) at the same time it was deleting maintenance as a criterion
for the permit provisions in light of section 175A.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA believes this structure is consistent with the absence of any requirement that maintenance plans under section
175A address pollution transport. Thus, the only provision in the Act that requires states to prevent emissions within
their borders that interfere with maintenance in another state downwind is section 110(a)(2)(D). This may be particularly
important due to the staggered attainment deadlines under section 181 for ozone. As is the case in the northeast, severe
areas with longer attainment deadlines may be located upwind of less polluted nonattainment areas with shorter attainment
deadlines. Even if the downwind areas can attain on time, the upwind areas may continue to generate substantial emissions
interfering with downwind maintenance until or even beyond the upwind area's longer attainment deadline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed generally above, EPA believes it has authority to act under section 110(k)(5) at any time, even prior
to submission of attainment demonstrations under section 182, to require submission of measures EPA believes are
necessary for compliance with section 110(a)(2)(D). See 59 FR at 21730 (explaining EPA's independent basis to issue
SIP call under section 110(k)(5) to adopt measures necessary for compliance with maintenance aspect of section 110(a)(2)(D)).
It is especially important that EPA act now, because the LEV program depends on vehicle fleet turnover that will take
an unusually long time to generate the needed emissions reductions. If EPA waits for the states to develop their attainment
plans, and where applicable, their maintenance plans, the opportunity to ensure that necessary emissions reductions
from the LEV program are achieved beginning in 1999 and growing thereafter may be irrevocably lost. Any delay in beginning
the fleet turnover to LEV vehicles in model year 1999 will diminish the emissions benefits in the years following.
It is therefore necessary for the states to act now to adopt OTC LEV and appropriate for EPA to make a finding of substantial
inadequacy now with respect to that program for the purposes of maintenance. For the same reasons discussed generally
above, EPA believes an environmentally conservative approach to evaluating the need for the LEV program to avoid
interference with maintenance is warranted here. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that maintenance is a proper consideration under section 184(c), too. To be sure, that provision references
timely attainment and omits maintenance. However, section 184(c)(5) provides for an EPA finding of substantial
inadequacy under section 110(k)(5) that states' SIPs do not meet the requirements of section 110(a)(2)(D), which
specifically prohibits emissions in states from interfering with maintenance in downwind states. Moreover, EPA
believes there is an adequate basis to reasonably interpret section 184(c) to include maintenance. Specifically,
EPA believes that it should understand ``attainment'' to include ``maintenance'' where the issue is whether measures
are ``necessary'' to comply with pollution transport requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The very emphasis on the ``necessary'' standard under section 184 supports this conclusion. In contrast, EPA's recent
determination that ``attainment'' under section 182(f) does not include maintenance involved a different standard.
There, EPA's Conformity General Preamble explained that the NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 exemption test in section 182(f)(1)(A) where additional NO

X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

EPA stated that Congress could reasonably have believed it appropriate to require states to impose specified requirements
on NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 sources for areas in nonattainment, but that states might decide for themselves whether to impose such controls for
maintenance purposes, even if such controls would ``contribute'' to maintenance. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Id. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA noted, however, that this distinction might not apply where the test is whether control measures are ``necessary''
for attainment and maintenance is not referenced, as here. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Id. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where measures are ``necessary'' for maintenance, EPA does not believe it makes sense to let states decide for themselves
whether to adopt the measures. Inherent in the ``necessary'' determination under section 184 is the conclusion that
the states really have no choice: They need to adopt the measure in order to avoid interfering with downwind maintenance.
Unlike the section 182(f) ``contributes'' context, as long as EPA determines that it is necessary, there really is
no choice. It seems less reasonable to believe Congress intended that section 184 would not reach a measure in fact
necessary for maintenance, when the result of a failure to implement the measure would therefore be downwind areas'
relapse into nonattainment, perhaps shortly after the attainment dates in subpart 2. Where the necessary standard
applies in the interstate pollution context, EPA believes it is sensible to understand ``attainment'' to include
``maintenance.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, EPA believes its discussion of section 176A in its April 26 proposal identifies an additional statutory
basis to support this sensible conclusion. That is, the OTR in section 184 is established under section 184(a) ``within
the meaning of section 176A(a).'' Section 176A authorizes a transport commission under that provision to ``[r]ecommend
to the Administrator such measures as the Commission determines to be necessary to ensure that the plans for the relevant
states meet the requirements of section [110(a)(2)(D)].'' This presumably includes both the attainment and maintenance
aspects of section 110(a)(2)(D). In all other respects, EPA's obligations in response to a transport commission
under section 176A are less strict than under section 184. It would therefore be odd if section 176A required EPA to
consider maintenance in response to a commission's recommendations, but that EPA would not be required to do so under
section 184. This is particularly so since it seems foolhardy to consider measures necessary for attainment at the
exclusion of those necessary for maintenance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, it seems reasonable to interpret the OTC under section 184 as a creature of both sections 184 and 176A. Section
184 simply adds stringency to EPA's obligations in responding to recommendations from the OTC, since Congress specifically
identified the serious transport problem between the many northeast states as surely deserving the attention of
such a regional commission. Thus, it makes sense to believe that Congress intended the particular dates in section
184 to highlight the specific deadlines in the subpart 2 ozone program that the OTC is specifically charged with addressing.
But in so doing it does not seem as reasonable to believe that Congress intended to displace the more general authority
of a commission under section 176A to make recommendations concerning the maintenance aspects of section 110(a)(2)(D).
Thus, EPA believes it is most reasonable to understand the references in section 184(c) to attainment to include maintenance
through section 176A, as well. Even if operating under sections 176A, 110(k)(5), and 110(a)(2)(D) directly, EPA
believes it may issue a SIP call at this time under section 110(k)(5) requiring states to adopt the OTC LEV program as
necessary to avoid interfering with maintenance in other states.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(b) Technical Analysis of Need for OTC LEV (or LEV-Equivalent) Program for Maintenance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that the OTC LEV program is necessary for all of the nonattainment areas to maintain the ozone NAAQS, even
after they attain. This is because EPA's modeling analysis projects very high rates of growth in emissions in the OTR
that must continue to be neutralized even after controls sufficient for attainment by the attainment deadlines are
in place. Based on EPA's analysis discussed in sections II.A.(a), (b) and (c), the Agency does not believe that other
available control options are sufficient to attain without OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent). Since EPA is not aware of
sufficient additional control options to counteract growth following attainment, EPA believes, a fortiori, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
that OTC LEV will be necessary for these areas to demonstrate maintenance of the NAAQS over two consecutive ten-year
periods following redesignation (as required by section 175A of the Act). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not only does EPA believe that the OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) program is necessary for the nonattainment areas in
the OTR to maintain the ozone NAAQS, but EPA believes that this program will play an increasingly important role in
counteracting growth over the maintenance periods. Of course, implementation of the program in model year 1999 will
not begin to play a role until well into the maintenance periods for the marginal and moderate areas that attain the
standard by 1993 and 1996, respectively. Assuming areas could achieve redesignation in their attainment years,
for the serious and severe areas that have attainment deadlines under section 181 of 1999, 2005, or 2007, the OTC LEV
program will contribute to both attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS. Due to the phase-in schedule for the LEV program
and the time it takes for the fleet to completely turnover, the LEV program will continue to accrue additional benefits
through the year 2028. In 2015 (the last year for which EPA has done a projection analysis), emissions reductions due
to the OTC LEV program will be 1200 tons of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 highway vehicle emissions and a 38% reduction in VOC highway vehicle emissions compared to emissions in 2015 without
the OTC LEV program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following table presents VMT growth rate information averaged between 1990 and 2005 for mobile source emissions
within the OTR. The table focuses on growth estimates for mobile sources as the most relevant for assessing the impact
of LEV in the OTR, since LEV affects emissions from this source category. These growth rates are derived from the EPA's
MOBILE5 Fuel Consumption model, and are taken from a study prepared under EPA contract.

Emissions rates for mobile sources are calculated by multiplying emissions factors developed for the fleet by projected
activity levels, characterized as projected vehicle miles travelled (VMT). Growth in VMT tends to neutralize the
downward trend in emissions factors resulting from turnover in the fleet to vehicles meeting federal tier 1 standards,
and implementation of advanced inspection/maintenance programs. As the vehicle fleet turns over, fewer old cars
with less advanced technology will remain on the road, and the downward trend in emissions factors will slow over time.
Therefore, EPA expects that growth in VMT will overtake current programs to increase growth rates more and more over
time beyond the 1990&hyph;2005 time frame in the table. Of course, the OTC LEV program would be helpful in increasing
and extending the downward trend in emissions factors to offset growth in VMT and counteract overall emissions growth.

4. Relevance of EPA Transport Policy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As EPA discussed in its April 26 proposal, EPA is developing a policy to address the particular problem where overwhelming
transport from upwind areas with later attainment dates is such a dominant factor accounting for nonattainment in
a downwind area with an earlier attainment date that the downwind areas will not be able to attain by the deadline. See
59 FR at 21728&hyph;29. This problem was specifically raised in the OTR for areas in Massachusetts in letters from
the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection and the Conservation Law Foundation.
<FOOTCITE>67</FOOTCITE>
 Of course, one solution is for the responsible upwind areas to relieve their overwhelming contribution so that the
downwind areas may attain by the specified year. But, as EPA described in its April 26 proposal, in certain cases this
could be at odds with the overall title I scheme that establishes later deadlines for attainment in more polluted areas
and also establishes a graduated program of additional and more stringent requirements to be accomplished over the
longer time-frame. It might be appropriate for EPA to interpret the Act so that, if it is impracticable to accelerate
controls in the upwind areas and other facts are shown, then the downwind areas might have additional time to reach
attainment beyond the section 181(a)(1) dates.

Since EPA's April 26 proposal, EPA staff has continued to work with a group of officials from states across the country
that are likely to be affected, including officials from Massachusetts, Maine, and other states to develop a policy
to address this problem. This policy, described in a September 1, 1994 memorandum from Mary D. Nichols, Assistant
Administrator, to EPA regional offices, provides that states seeking to have the Clean Air Act interpreted so as to
allow them a later attainment deadline would have to make certain showings including a showing of overwhelming transport.

EPA does not expect that the states will be able to complete such analyses and have EPA make a determination by the time
EPA takes final action on the OTC recommendation. Nevertheless, EPA recognizes that pervasive transport in the OTR
underlies the creation of the OTC and the basis for EPA's proposed approval of the OTC LEV recommendation. EPA expects
that, on this basis, a few areas in the OTR are likely candidates to make valid demonstrations that the Act should be
interpreted to allow them more time to attain because overwhelming transport from upwind areas with later attainment
deadlines will unavoidably prevent earlier attainment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While this has not yet occurred, EPA can anticipate the implications here if it does. If downwind areas ultimately
are subject to later attainment deadlines than are currently believed to pertain, then emissions reductions during
the ``extension period'' would apply to reaching attainment rather than to maintenance of the NAAQS after attainment.
To the extent EPA currently believes that the OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) program is necessary for maintenance in
such areas after the section 181(a)(1) attainment year (and through any ``extension period''), then such reductions
likewise would be necessary for attainment if EPA grants that such areas have the ``extension period'' to attain.
EPA does now believe that areas in the OTR will need the OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) program to maintain the NAAQS in
the years after the section 181(a)(1) deadlines. EPA therefore expects that the OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) program
will ultimately be necessary in those years for such areas that may have longer under the forthcoming transport policy
to actually attain the NAAQS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, even if attainment dates are not extended pursuant to a transport policy, EPA believes that it may conclude
that certain serious areas in the OTR will not be able to reach attainment by 1999, nor to qualify for the one-year extensions
described earlier. Such areas would then be subject to ``bump up'' under section 181(b)(2) of the Act and would have
until 2005 (or, if sooner, as expeditiously as practicable) to attain. EPA believes that the OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent)
program will ultimately be necessary to achieve reductions in the period after 1999 for any such areas to attain.

Section 184 requires that in reviewing the recommendation of the OTC, EPA must evaluate whether the additional control
measures are ``otherwise consistent with this [Act].'' In general, states, with the exception of California, are
prohibited under section 209(a) of the Act from regulating emissions from new motor vehicles. However, section 177
of the Act provides an exception from this prohibition that allows a state which has plan provisions approved under
part D of title I of the Act to adopt California's standards relating to control of emissions from new motor vehicles
and to take other actions otherwise prohibited under section 209(a) if_

Section 177 of the Act provides the only exception in the Act from preemption of state standards for control of emissions
from new motor vehicles under section 209(a). The control measures recommended by the OTC must therefore be consistent
with section 177. EPA noted in the NPRM that four aspects of the OTC recommendation may implicate section 177 of the
Act. See 59 FR 21735. First, the OTC recommends that EPA require use of California LEVs but specifically states that
adoption of California reformulated gasoline is not a part of the recommendation. Second, the recommendation does
not require inclusion of the ZEV sales requirement in any state regulations except to the extent the sales requirement
is required under section 177. Third, EPA noted that the recommendation did not explicitly incorporate California's
regulations. Instead, the recommendation merely stated that the OTC recommended adoption of a low emission vehicle
program that includes certain elements detailed in the recommendation, pursuant to the requirements of section
177. EPA also noted that the OTC recommended incorporation of California's fleet NMOG standards and that some commenters
believed incorporation of the NMOG standards was inconsistent with section 177. Finally, EPA requested comments
regarding whether section 177 allows a state to adopt a California vehicle program in a portion of the state, rather
than the entire state. This final point is not addressed in this section of the preamble, but is addressed in section
IV.A.2.(c)iii., above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the publication of the first NPRM, EPA has received comments indicating that other aspects of the OTC's recommendation
may violate section 177. One commenter asserted that a state's incorporation of the California LEV program after
the program is initiated in California may create a ``third vehicle'' because of the operation of California's emissions
credit banking regulations. Also, a commenter questioned whether a state without a current nonattainment area or
an approved state implementation plan can impose the California LEV requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA today proposes to find that the OTC's recommendation for EPA to require implementation of the OTC LEV program throughout
the OTR is consistent with section 177. Moreover, EPA proposes to find that implementation of the ZEV sales requirement
is not necessary in order for the recommendation to be consistent with section 177. Therefore, EPA proposes not to
require that states in the OTR adopt the ZEV sales requirement. Individual states may, at their discretion, incorporate
the ZEV sales requirements into their programs.

EPA proposes to find that the OTC's failure to include California's clean fuel requirements in its recommendation
does not violate section 177. EPA believes that the failure to include the California fuels requirements does not
violate the requirement of section 177 that standards must be ``identical to the California standards for which a
waiver has been granted for such model year.'' EPA also believes that the lack of California fuel requirements does
not violate the ``third car prohibition'' of section 177.

California's clean fuel provisions were not part of California's waiver application under section 209. In fact,
state standards that are related to fuel as opposed to emissions of motor vehicles, are not even governed by section
209(a). State fuel provisions are addressed separately in section 211 of the Act, which provides a substantially
different regime for state fuel standards. Under section 211, states may regulate fuels if they can demonstrate to
EPA that such regulation is necessary to meet federal air quality standards, except that California may regulate
fuel without such a demonstration. Therefore, as California has not asked for a waiver for its fuel regulations, nor
is it required to do so under the Act, such standards are not ``standards *&blank;*&blank;* for which a waiver has been
granted'' and thus are not subject to the identicality provisions of section 177. Were the Agency to find that states
must also adopt California's fuel standards to meet the section 177 identicality requirements, then every state
wishing to adopt California's motor vehicle standards would be required to meet not only the requirements of section
177 but also the requirements of section 211, so that it could simultaneously adopt associated fuel controls. EPA
believes that this would be an incorrect interpretation of the Act, given the structure of the Act and its explicit
differentiation between vehicle and fuel requirements. For the reasons provided in this notice and outlined by EPA
in its amicus curiae briefs and by the courts in the New York and Massachusetts cases, EPA proposes to find that no conflict
with section 177 exists on this point. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Third Vehicle Prohibition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also proposes to find that the lack of a clean fuel requirement does not violate the ``third vehicle'' prohibition
of section 177. Manufacturers claim that the difference in sulfur levels between the fuels sold in California and
the northeast would cause deleterious effects on emission control systems on California LEV vehicles, which would
require certain design changes to manage these effects. This, they claim, would require them to manufacture vehicles
for the OTR that would differ from the vehicles they expect to sell for California, and would thus violate section 177's
``third vehicle'' prohibition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The manufacturers' arguments fail on several grounds. First, nothing in the OTC recommendation requires any manufacturer
to produce any vehicle different from a California certified vehicle. In fact, the OTC recommendation would require
that any new car sold in the OTR be a California-certified vehicle. Manufacturers are free to sell cars in the OTC that
are identical to those sold in California. Any design changes made by manufacturers would result from a manufacturer's
voluntary decision to effect such a change. There is no third vehicle violation where a manufacturer voluntarily
decides to sell a third vehicle in a state other than California. The court of appeals in the New York case, responding
to a similar ``third car'' challenge by manufacturers regarding ZEVs, found that whatever design change ``the manufacturers
choose to install on cars sold in New York is a marketing choice of theirs and not a requirement imposed by the [state].''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the ``third vehicle prohibition'' should not be read to apply to every design change, regardless of its nature
or scope. Section 177 uses the phrase ``third vehicle'' to refer to ``a motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine different
than a motor vehicle or engine certified in California under California standards.'' This statutory language indicates
that its meaning is tied to the concept of emission certification, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
that ``third vehicle'' should be read to refer to design changes needed to meet certification requirements. This
reading is consistent with the purpose of the third vehicle prohibition, which is to reinforce the identicality requirement
by prohibiting a state from administering standards identical to California's in a way that actually requires conformance
to more stringent standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``third vehicle'' itself suggests it should be so limited. It presumes the existence of ``first vehicles''
and ``second vehicles'' (vehicles that meet federal and California standards, respectively). Congress was plainly
aware that ``first vehicles'' include vehicles with widely differing physical characteristics. For example, ``first
vehicles'' include cars both with and without rear-window defrosters. This makes it clear that vehicles may contain
minor differences in design that are unnecessary to meet emission standards without creating ``third vehicles.''
The legislative history of section 177 confirms that the ``third vehicle prohibition'' does not require physical
identicality of vehicles and that design changes would not create a ``third car violation'' unless they create an
``undue burden'' on manufacturers.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Though one manufacturer has stated in other proceedings that it may need to use a different converter assembly (one
that is bolted, not welded) on vehicles sold in the OTR, the manufacturers have not provided evidence indicating that
significant design changes creating an ``undue burden'' are required to implement the OTC LEV program without California
fuels.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA proposes to find today that the ZEV sales requirement is not required to ensure consistency with section 177. Therefore,
as the OTC requested inclusion of the ZEV sales requirement only ``to the extent that a Zero Emission Vehicle sales
requirement must be a component of a LEV program adopted under Section 177,'' EPA proposes to approve the OTC recommendation
without the ZEV sales requirement. Individual states within the OTC may at their option include such a requirement
in the programs they adopt.

The OTC recommendation explicitly recommended that individual states within the OTR be allowed to implement the
ZEV sales mandate if they so choose. EPA believes that incorporation of the ZEV sales mandate into a state's LEV program
is not inconsistent with the requirements of section 177. The court of appeals in the New York case similarly found
that New York's incorporation of the ZEV sales mandate did not violate section 177's prohibition on sales limitations
on California-certified vehicles or section 177's ``third vehicle prohibition.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As EPA discussed in the NPRM, the first question presented by this issue is whether the ZEV sales requirement is a ``standard
relating to control of emissions.'' See 59 FR at 21735. EPA initially determined, in letters sent to New York and Virginia
state officials on January 7, 1993, that the ZEV sales requirement is not a standard, based on the belief that it had
no direct effect on emissions associated with the LEV program, given the existence of the NMOG fleet average requirement.
EPA stated: ``The ZEV sales mandate simply limits the flexibility otherwise accorded manufacturers to choose the
mix of vehicles produced to meet the NMOG fleet average requirement.'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Id.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Therefore, as EPA found that the ZEV sales mandate did not limit the quantity, rate or concentration of NMOG emissions,
EPA stated that the mandate was not an emission standard, but instead was an accompanying enforcement procedure.
In fact, the OTC stated in documents accompanying its recommendation that the ZEV sales mandate is an accompanying
enforcement procedure and is not required by section 177. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Indeed, the ZEV sales requirement does not require that overall tailpipe emissions of NMOG from California vehicles
be any lower than they would have been in the absence of the sales requirement. The amount of NMOG tailpipe emissions
produced by such vehicles is controlled by the NMOG fleet average requirement, not the sales mandate. However, current
EPA data indicates that the ZEV sales requirement clearly will have a beneficial effect on emissions of evaporative
hydrocarbons and tailpipe emissions of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 from vehicles in the LEV program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, it appears that the determination of whether the ZEV mandate is a ``standard'' must be based on other factors.
An argument that the ZEV sales requirement is not an emission standard would be based on the presumption that ``standards''
are only the numerical limits placed on sources restricting emissions of particular pollutants. This argument is
similar to certain language found in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

of the Act's motor vehicle emission program. EPA argued in that case that the term ``standard'' referred to ``a numerical
value setting the quantitative level of permitted emissions of pollutants by a new motor vehicle.''

 at 1111. The court neither adopted this definition nor did it take issue with EPA's definition. The court did state
that the legislative history ``indicates that Congress intended the word `standards' to mean quantitative levels
of emissions rather than regulations involving certification or in-use maintenance restrictions'' (emphasis
added).

 was later overruled legislatively twice by Congress. Congress first revised section 112 in 1978 and Congress then
revised section 302 in 1990 to ensure that EPA used a more expansive definition of ``emission standard.'') 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, this approach has some disadvantages. First, it divorces the term ``emission standard'' from actual emission
reductions. Without a mandate to sell cleaner cars, there is no enforceable benefit to having numerical emission
``standards'' for those cars. In addition, it can be argued that sales requirements do ``relate to the control of emissions
from new motor vehicles.'' Moreover, such a determination may have implications for other requirements in the LEV
program and other programs, particularly requirements that include averaging, banking and trading, requirements
that include fleet averaging, and requirements where a phase-in is used. (If a phase-in is not a standard, could a state
require 0% (or 100%) compliance, instead of partial compliance, with a standard being phased in over time?) Moreover,
the court in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
MEMA
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 stated that the ``only species of emissions control regulation which directly addresses air quality is a standard.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Id.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at 1113. This language seems consistent with a determination that the term ``standards'' includes sales requirements
because without a sales requirement, a numerical limitation on emissions from a type of vehicle by itself has no effect
on air quality.

Regardless of whether EPA were to find that the ZEV sales requirement is a standard, EPA believes that incorporation
of the sales requirement is not required for the OTC&hyph;LEV program to meet the requirements for identicality under
section 177. Section 177 allows a state to adopt and enforce ``for any model year standards relating to control of emissions
from new motor vehicles and *&blank;*&blank;* engines *&blank;*&blank;* if other such standards are identical
to the California standards for which a waiver has been granted for such model year.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that section 177 should not be read to require that once a state has promulgated one California standard
for a particular model, the state must adopt all of California's standards relating to the control of emissions from
all types of motor vehicles for that model year. The language of section 177 does not require adoption of all California
standards for a given model year. Section 177 requires only that if a state adopts motor vehicle standards, such standards
must be identical to California standards. Therefore, the identicality requirement only necessitates that the
specific standards adopted by the state be identical to the comparable California standards. As long as the state
adopts all standards that are necessary to implement a particular California vehicle program,
<FOOTCITE>72</FOOTCITE>
 and as long as the state adopts all standards necessitated by the other requirements of section 177 (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the state must not prevent a California-certified car from being sold in the state and must not create a ``third car''),
the state need not adopt other standards that are not integral to the particular program being adopted.

EPA believes that all standards applicable to a segregatable program must be implemented in order to assure that specific
vehicles required by a particular program are subject to the same emissions requirements (e.g. a state could not adopt
only California's NMOG standards for a LEV without adopting the NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 and CO standards.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Thus, as discussed in the NPRM, EPA believes that adoption of the California LEV program does not require adoption
of the California heavy-duty engine program. Similarly, EPA believes that section 177 does not require a state to
promulgate standards that are clearly segregable from one another.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that the ZEV sales requirement is clearly segregable from the rest of the LEV program. The LEV program
is essentially comprised of several requirements limiting the quantity of emissions that may be emitted from particular
types of vehicles (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 TLEVs, LEVs) and two requirements mandating sales of such vehicles. The first is the NMOG fleet average. The second
is the ZEV sales requirement. Without implementation of either of these mandates, the requirements defining emission
levels for types of vehicles are basically unenforceable because, unlike more traditional motor vehicle emission
programs, the LEV program separates emission levels from mandates to buy vehicles meeting such emission levels.
In other words, a statute defining the levels one must meet for a vehicle to be called a low emission vehicle may have
little enforceable emissions value, unless there is an enforceable requirement to manufacture such a vehicle. The
NMOG fleet average is the central provision of the LEV program to require manufacture of the low emission vehicles
in the program and to obtain enforceable emission reductions from such vehicles. The ZEV sales requirement, on the
other hand, is a technology requirement essentially designed to ensure the manufacture of technology-forcing vehicles.
It is designed to create a new generation of vehicles. As noted previously, however, the ZEV sales mandate also provides
NMOG evaporative and tailpipe NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions reduction benefits separate and distinct from the NMOG fleet average requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Though the two mandates are complementary, they are not essential for one another. The designs of the vehicles in the
LEV program will be based on the emission levels that manufacturers must meet. The mandates merely tell the manufacturers
how many vehicles of each type must be built. Each mandate creates a fully functional and enforceable motor vehicle
emissions program. Therefore, EPA believes that a LEV program designed to reduce emissions in the northeast that
includes the NMOG fleet average may, but need not, include the ZEV sales requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA continues to request comment on whether state incorporation of the ZEV sales requirement is necessary to satisfy
the identicality requirement of section 177.

4. Incorporation of Minor Provisions of the California LEV Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OTC's initial recommendation to EPA does not specifically identify every component of the California LEV program
that it intends to incorporate into the OTC LEV program; nor does the recommendation include proposed regulations.
Instead the recommendation identifies the main elements of the OTC LEV program and the timeframe for the regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that the implicit intent of the recommendation was incorporation of emission standards that were identical
to the California LEV program and incorporation of all provisions of California's LEV program necessary to ensure
consistency with section 177 for 1999 and later model year passenger cars and light-duty trucks (0&hyph;5750 pounds
loaded vehicle weight). This intent is evidenced by the implicit language of the recommendation. The recommendation
specifically notes that the OTC LEV program is to be applied ``[p]ursuant to the requirements of section 177.'' EPA
believes that the listing of the most important provisions of the California LEV program to be incorporated was not
meant to imply the exclusion of other provisions necessary to ensure consistency with section 177. The recommendation
adopted the OTC LEV program ``including'' the listed provisions, implying that other provisions would also be included.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's interpretation of the petition is further supported by the Response to Comments document submitted with the
recommendation (and in the docket), which clearly states, at page 27, that the recommendation has been made consistent
with section 177 and 184 of the Act. The Response to Comments document also notes, at pages 6 and 33, that the provisions
of the recommended program were constrained by section 177's identicality requirement. Another indication that
the OTC clearly intended the program to be consistent with section 177 is the fact that the recommendation requests
incorporation of the ZEV sales requirement only to the extent it is required for consistency. Thus, the OTC was willing
to include this controversial provision if consistency depended on its inclusion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, the Executive Director of the OTC, Bruce Carhart, stated explicitly, in an April 15, 1994 letter responding
to an EPA inquiry, that the OTC's ``intention is to maintain identicality with California as required by the Clean
Air Act.'' Mr. Carhart also indicated that the OTC intended to incorporate secondary provisions in California's
LEV program into the OTC LEV program. EPA believes that it is appropriate to use this letter as further evidence of the
intent of the Commission. Where there is ambiguity in the OTC petition, EPA does not believe that its ability to review
the OTC recommendation is limited to examining the explicit language of the recommendation. Certainly, EPA approval
of the recommendation cannot include provisions that were not contemplated by the recommendation and do not naturally
arise from the face of the recommendation. However, where the recommendation is ambiguous regarding a certain point,
EPA believes that, consistent with its requirement to consult with the Commission, it may request clarification
of the OTC petition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, under &sect;184(c)(3), if EPA must interpret a recommendation in a certain way in order to ensure consistency
with the Act, and such an interpretation is not inconsistent with the language of the recommendation, then EPA is constrained
to use that interpretation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these reasons, EPA interprets the recommendation to require emission standards identical to California's LEV
standards and to require promulgation of provisions that ensure consistency with section 177.

A commenter notes that the OTC recommendation for the NMOG standard is not consistent with California's NMOG standard
for light-duty trucks 3751&hyph;5750 lbs. This appears to have been an oversight on the part of the OTC. As the letter
from Mr. Carhart shows, the OTC intended separate fleet averages for both classes of light-duty vehicles. Consistent
with the discussion above, EPA interprets the recommendation to recommend NMOG fleet averages identical to California's
NMOG averages for light-duty vehicles 0&hyph;3750 lbs. and for light-duty vehicles 3751&hyph;5750 lbs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA does not intend at this time to delineate each portion of the California LEV program that is required for satisfaction
of the requirements of section 177. Such determinations will be made in the review of each state plan or in guidance
to be issued by EPA later. However, EPA notes that the April 15 letter from Bruce Carhart stated that the following specific
portions of the program have been included in the OTC recommendation: The NMOG banking and trading provisions, the
relevant exemptions for small and intermediate manufacturers, provisions for hybrid electric vehicles,
<FOOTCITE>73</FOOTCITE>
 and reactivity adjustment factors as necessary for California certification.

CARB's LEV program provides for the development and use of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) as part of the LEV fleet
in California. HEVs are expected to incorporate an electric motor and an auxiliary power unit, such as a combustion
engine, to allow for the efficient operation of the vehicle's propulsion system as well as its other systems, like
lighting. CARB provides for three different classifications of HEVs in its statutory formula used to calculate a
manufacturer's fleet average NMOG value. Additionally, HEVs are tested differently from LEVs. See Title 13, California

5. The NMOG Fleet Average
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed in the April 26, 1994 NPRM, EPA believes that the OTC's incorporation of the NMOG fleet average does not
violate section 177. Even if the identicality provision of section 177 does not require inclusion of the NMOG fleet
average, manufacturers have provided no clear argument regarding why inclusion of the NMOG average, which is identical
to the NMOG average promulgated by California, violates section 177. Given that identicality with California standards
is a primary goal of section 177, any argument that such an identical provision is forbidden by section 177 is dubious
on its face. Section 177 was designed to provide manufacturers with assurance that they would not be forced to produce
several different types of vehicles to comply with different state emission standards. Manufacturers have provided
no evidence that incorporation of the NMOG fleet average will in any way cause manufacturers to produce different
vehicles than those certified for use in California.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, as the Second Circuit articulated in the New York case in the context of the ZEV sales requirement, the fleet
average requirement does not violate the requirement of section 177 that states shall not prohibit the sale of California
cars. While the NMOG average requires that a certain number of lower-emitting vehicles must be sold in a state to assure
compliance, it does not prevent any California-certified car from being sold. Moreover, as the Second Circuit realized,
a finding that the fleet average violated section 177 would in effect nullify section 177 for all practical purposes
with regard to the LEV program and any other program that uses any sort of averaging or other flexible approach.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that it may be appropriate for the states in the OTC to enforce the NMOG fleet average provisions through
a regionwide averaging system. EPA has received comments supporting such an enforcement program. EPA intends to
issue guidance after this recommendation is approved (if it is finally approved) addressing the legal and policy
issues implicated by such a program.

6. Averaging, Banking, and Trading
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter noted that as California's LEV program includes a banking program and, as California's LEV program
will start prior to model year 1999, when the state programs under the OTC recommendation would begin, a manufacturer
may have banked credits under the California program by the time the 1999 model year begins.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA does not believe this raises any question regarding consistency with section 177. Once again, the state regulations
do not require the manufacture of a ``third vehicle''; nor do they prevent the sale of California certified vehicles
in the state, though a slightly different mix of vehicles might be required in the first model year for a manufacturer
who takes advantage of California's banking program. This amounts to a business decision by the manufacturer, and
it does not create any inconsistency. Moreover, a determination that such a situation would be inconsistent with
section 177 would render section 177 a nullity for any program that includes banking, because section 177's lead time
requirements make it very difficult for states to begin their programs at the same time California begins its program.

A comment notes that section 177 applies only to states with plan provisions approved under part D. All states in the
OTR have such approved plan provisions. All states except for Vermont currently contain nonattainment areas with
associated plans. Vermont has approved plan provisions approved under part D related to earlier nonattainment problems.

A. Explanation of Proposed SIP Call
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA recognizes that the timing of its action is critical for the states' SIP planning purposes. EPA intends to take
final action on the OTC's LEV recommendation in November 1994. Under section 184(c)(5), EPA is to issue a SIP call under
section 110(k)(5) upon approval. EPA intends that final action approving the OTC recommendation would also entail
the SIP call under section 110(k)(5), thus triggering the states' obligation to submit SIP revisions to include the
OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) program within one year, or in November 1995. Under any circumstances, and regardless
of EPA's final action on the OTC LEV recommendation, the states are not precluded from adopting and submitting a LEV
SIP revision at any time consistent with sections 177 and 209 of the Act, as they have always had the independent authority
to do.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA recognizes, however, that it is possible an alternative program could be promulgated in the future that would
achieve equivalent emissions reductions from new motor vehicles. Logically, such an alternative program that achieves
the emission reductions the OTC LEV program would achieve, could render the OTC LEV program no longer necessary. States
could then decide whether to give auto manufacturers the choice of meeting either OTC LEV standards or the alternative
federal program standards. The alternative program would create emissions standards applicable to new motor vehicles
that automobile manufacturers could, at their option, opt for EPA to apply to their new motor vehicles. EPA expects
that, as long as issues pertaining to the enforceability of such standards can be resolved, such alternative federal
standards could result in emissions benefits in the OTR equivalent to those that would result from the OTC LEV program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is currently working with the federally chartered Clean Air Act Advisory Committee (and a subcommittee created
to consider this topic) to allow for the possibility of such an alternative program that is in the interest of stakeholders
and the public at large. EPA expects to obtain the advice of the Clean Air Act Advisory Committee considering issues
related to such a program during the fall of 1994. Thereafter, if there is reason to proceed, EPA would undertake a notice-and-comment
rulemaking to establish the alternative federal standards program, and to promulgate such standards early in 1995.
EPA expects that it will provide a period of time following promulgation for the automakers to decide whether to opt
into the alternative federal standards program. Under a scheme EPA might consider, once automobile manufacturers
opt into this voluntary program, they would be subject to all provisions of the Act and its implementing regulations
(particularly provisions relating to EPA enforcement of standards) that apply to other mandatory standards currently
applicable to such vehicles. EPA believes that, in this manner, it can establish an alternative mechanism to achieve
emissions reductions from new motor vehicles equivalent to those that the OTC LEV program would achieve in the OTR.
The alternative rulemaking would need to address a number of questions, including whether auto companies should
be able to opt out of the program once they have opted in, whether states should give up their opportunity to adopt or
enforce the California LEV program under section 177, and whether a consent decree addressing certain discrete issues
would be useful.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's proposed SIP call requiring the OTR states to submit SIP revisions keeps open the option of an alternative federal
program while ensuring that necessary emission reductions are not delayed. Under EPA's proposed SIP call, each state
would be required to submit the OTC LEV program as a SIP revision, but the program could allow auto manufacturers either
to comply with the OTC LEV standards or to opt into and comply with EPA promulgated alternative standards, if such standards
are developed. The states' regulations could provide that the LEV program would not apply to auto manufacturers who
are subject to an equivalent federal program. The states' SIP revisions would have to limit this exception to automakers
subject to an alternative federal program that EPA has promulgated as equivalent to the OTC LEV program. EPA would
address the criteria for its determination of equivalence in any alternative federal standards rulemaking. Under
this approach, the automakers would not necessarily have to forfeit their ability to opt out when they opt into the
alternative standards program. Since the states would all have to adopt and submit an OTC LEV SIP revision, automakers
that either do not opt into or later opt out of the alternative standards program would be required to comply with the
states' OTC LEV program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If EPA approves the OTC petition within the time specified by the Act, states' SIP revisions would be due in November
1995. If states delayed only slightly in meeting this deadline, it could result in an inability to apply the standards
to all vehicles in model year 1999.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another benefit of EPA's proposed approach is that the automakers need not all make the same choice. Rather, automakers
could independently choose whether to achieve the necessary emissions reductions by opting into and complying with
an equivalent federal program or by complying with the OTC LEV program. Further, if the automakers were to attach any
conditions to their opt in to a federal program allowing them to escape its obligations and were to trigger such an escape
provision, they would then fall back to mandatory compliance with the states' adopted OTC LEV programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is taking comment on whether, if all automakers opted into an alternative federal standards program and did not
have a right to opt out, the states should have to adopt the OTC LEV program. The only benefit EPA sees to such an approach
is that the states' LEV program would then be necessary as a ``back-stop'' mechanism used solely to ensure that the
automakers would not opt out of the alternative standards program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is also considering another approach that would eliminate the burden of state adoption of the OTC LEV program if
all the automakers opt into an alternative federal program. Under this second option, if the Agency promulgates alternative
emissions standards and auto manufacturers opt into that program and commit not to opt out, the OTC states' obligation
to submit OTC LEV SIP revisions would automatically terminate as no longer necessary. EPA urges states to respond
under either approach to a final approval with immediate action to prepare to submit an OTC LEV SIP revision to EPA by
November 1995.

EPA recognizes that the states have authority to adopt whatever measures they choose beyond those mandated in the
Act in order to achieve the necessary emissions reductions. EPA is therefore also proposing that it would retain authority
in issuing the SIP call to change its necessary determination and withdraw its SIP call for those states that adopt
controls, including those applicable to stationary and mobile sources, sufficient to comply with section 110(a)(2)(D).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While EPA believes that the emissions reductions that the OTC LEV program would achieve are necessary, the Agency
recognizes that another program to achieve equivalent reductions from the same emissions sources could render the
OTC LEV program unnecessary. But at this juncture the Clean Air Act precludes EPA from mandating another program modifying
the Tier 1 controls on new light-duty vehicles to achieve further emission reductions.

 The OTC's recommendation specifically included in its recitation clauses the OTC's expectation that EPA would evaluate
alternatives comparable to the OTC LEV program, ``including the program presented by the automobile manufacturers
with enhancements.'' Especially in light of this statement, EPA believes it is appropriate to leave open the possibility
that an environmentally equivalent alternative to OTC LEV that is mutually acceptable to the states and automakers
could be developed that would eliminate any need for the states to apply the OTC LEV standard.

Section 209 of the Act preempts states (other than California) from establishing new motor vehicle emissions standards,
leaving such regulation to EPA under title II of the Act. See EPA's earlier notices regarding OTC LEV, 59 FR at 21734
(April 26, 1994); 59 FR at 12915 (March 18, 1994). Of course, section 177 of the Act provides an exception whereby the
OTC states could adopt standards that are identical to California's standards if certain conditions are satisfied.
It is this exception that the OTC has relied upon in recommending that EPA require the states to adopt LEV standards
identical to those California adopted in its LEV program. But the states in the OTR cannot establish alternative new
motor vehicle emissions standards different from but equivalent to California's standards. Likewise, Congress
explicitly provided that EPA may not modify the ``Tier 1'' auto emissions standards specified in subsections 202
(a)(3)(B)(ii), (g), (h), and (i) prior to model year 2004, and thus cannot mandate an alternative that would achieve
equivalent reductions. See 59 FR at 21730 (April 26, 1994).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA believes that it is legally appropriate for it to specify in its SIP call that the consummation of an alternative
federal program that achieves equivalent environmental benefits could alter the Agency's conclusion regarding
necessity. Thus, the Agency believes it may specify criteria in this regard that, if satisfied, will terminate the
states' obligations under the SIP call to apply the LEV standards to manufacturers subject to an equivalent alternative
program. At the same time, EPA does not believe there is any reason to wait to determine whether the alternative federal
program will be consummated before issuing the SIP call based on the finding that the OTC LEV program is necessary.
EPA believes that additional new-vehicle tailpipe emission reductions achievable by the OTC LEV program are necessary.
EPA cannot now assume, based on merely the prospect of an alternative federal program and permanent opt-in by all auto
manufacturers, that OTC LEV will become unnecessary. Moreover, as explained earlier, EPA believes it is important
to act now for several reasons, including the statutory deadline under section 184, the statutory requirement that
the states provide two years of lead-time before they can apply standards under section 177 and the length of time it
takes for the fleet to turn over.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes it may issue a SIP call that would require that states submit SIP revisions to include the OTC LEV program,
but that would allow the states to accept compliance with an equivalent alternative program instead. Under this option,
as discussed above, the states' obligation to submit the OTC LEV program SIP revision would not terminate upon the
automakers' opt-in to an alternative standards program. This would be necessary, for example, if EPA structured
the alternative program such that the automakers could opt out of it. Indeed, the automakers might insist that they
retain such an ``escape'' in case any state exercised its continuing authority under section 177 to adopt California
standards not consistent with the alternative federal program. Under this structure, the promulgation of the alternative
program would not guarantee that the OTC LEV program would not be necessary, even if all automakers were to opt in initially.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rather, EPA believes it might appropriately conclude that, as to any particular automaker that opts in and complies
with the alternative program for any period of time, the OTC LEV program would not be necessary for that automaker for
that time. Thus, EPA believes it might find the OTC LEV program necessary but allow states to withhold implementation
of the OTC LEV standards for automakers that opt into the alternative program for as long as they remain in that program.
EPA believes this approach, too, fits squarely within its authority under sections 184(c) and 110(k)(5). That is,
just as EPA believes it may take account of the possibility that an equivalent alternative program could render OTC
LEV no longer necessary, an equivalent alternative program could render OTC LEV unnecessary for particular manufacturers
only for as long as they are bound by that program. EPA believes it may fashion its approach to take account of this, so
that the states must revise their SIPs to include the necessary OTC LEV program, but need only apply it to those parties
for whom and when it is ``necessary'' in light of those parties' choices. In sum, under section 110(k)(5), EPA believes
it may require that states revise their SIPs as necessary to comply with section 110(a)(2)(D), but may allow states
to account in such SIP revisions for circumstances where application of the standards may not be necessary.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 179(a), if EPA finds that a state fails to make a submission required under the Act, one of the sanctions
specified in section 179(b) is to apply unless the deficiency has been corrected within 18 months after EPA's finding
of failure to submit or incompleteness under section 110(k). Section 179(b) specifies two sanctions available to
the Administrator: Withholding of certain highway funding under section 179(b)(1); and application of a 2:1 offset
ratio to new or modified stationary sources of emissions for which a new source review permit is required under part
D of title I. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA recently promulgated final regulations to implement section 179 of the Act, which specifies sanctions that are
to apply where states fail to make a submission required under the Act. See 59 FR 39832 (Aug. 4, 1994). These regulations
specify the order in which these sanctions will apply in the case of state non-compliance with provisions of the Act.
These regulations do not, however, address the imposition of sanctions in the case of state failure to comply with
a SIP call under section 110(k)(5) of the Act. Since EPA is proposing a SIP call in this rulemaking, EPA believes it is
appropriate to propose the order of sanctions for purposes of failure to comply if the SIP call is promulgated as a final
regulation. EPA believes that the general scheme promulgated for sanctions generally should also apply here. Under
that scheme, EPA will generally apply the 2:1 offset sanction first and the highway finding sanction second. EPA believes
the rationale for this approach in the sanctions rule applies with equal force here. In addition, EPA is considering
whether the particular circumstances here that states must adopt the OTC LEV program by January 2, 1996 in order to
comply with the two-year lead-time requirement prior to model year 1999 may merit acceleration of sanctions. That
is, EPA requests comment on whether it should provide in the final rule that discretionary sanctions under section
110(m) of the Act would apply beginning immediately upon a finding of failure to submit the OTC LEV program.

VI. Determination of Model Year
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing today to promulgate regulations determining, for the purposes of section 177 and Part A of Title II
of the Clean Air Act, the definition of the term ``model year'' as it applies to motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines.
This determination should remove any confusion regarding when a model year commences under section 177. EPA is proposing
this determination in this SNPRM because, if EPA approves the OTC's LEV recommendation, the OTR states will be required
to adopt the LEV program under the provisions of section 177 of the Act. The definition of the term ``model year,'' in
particular, the issue of when a model year begins, has been a major issue in the litigations that have resulted from
New York and Massachusetts's attempts to adopt California LEV standards under section 177. These litigations have
led to considerable confusion regarding when a model year commences under section 177. EPA intends to remove this
confusion by providing nationally consistent regulations providing detailed information regarding the term ``model
year,'' including when such model years commence.

B. Statutory and Regulatory Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 177 of the Act provides that any state which has plan provisions approved under part D may adopt and enforce
California standards for any model year if such standards are identical to the California standards for which a waiver
has been granted for such model year and if California and the state ``adopt such standards at least two years before
commencement of such model year (as determined by regulations of the Administrator).'' Section 202(b)(3)(A)(i)
of the Act defines model year as ``the manufacturer's annual production period (as determined by the Administrator)
which includes January 1 of such calendar year. If the manufacturer has no annual production period, the term `model
year' shall mean the calendar year.'' This definition of model year is repeated in regulations at 40 CFR &sect;86.082&hyph;2
(1992).

EPA has not promulgated regulations providing more specific EPA rules regarding determination of model year. Instead,
EPA has historically relied on Advisory Circulars to clarify agency policy on the determination of model year and
has used these policies and definitions in the enforcement of Federal programs such as vehicle certification. The
first guidance regarding model year was issued on March 27, 1972 (Mobile Source Pollution Control Program (MSPC)
Advisory Circular 6). This guidance was revised by MSPC Advisory Circular 6A (September 1, 1972). The most recent
iteration of this guidance was issued on December 31, 1987 (EPA Office of Mobile Sources Advisory Circular 6B).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While Advisory Circulars have been an adequate mechanism for the purposes of establishing Agency policies and using
such policies for enforcement matters, the fact that EPA relies on Advisory Circulars in addition to its regulations
has been an issue in litigation challenging the adoption of the California LEV program by New York and Massachusetts.
Section 177 states that the term ``model year'' shall be ``as determined by regulations of the Administrator.'' In
the New York litigation (

467 U.S. 837, 843 (1984). The Second Circuit found that the circulars were not ``regulations'' required under section
177 and were, in any case, not prepared specifically to implement section 177.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and thus was entitled to little deference. The court then provided its own opinion regarding the most appropriate
interpretation of the term ``model year'' in the section 177 context, and found that ``absent promulgated EPA regulations,
`model year' is best read as applying on an industry-wide basis.''

if ``model year'' were defined by engine family, rather than industry-wide, given the existence of the NMOG fleet
averaging program, as well as questions regarding Congressional intent, industry confusion and enforceability.

 However, the First Circuit noted that an argument could be raised that the EPA Advisory Circular is owed no deference
because section 177 specifically requires EPA to define ``model year'' by regulation, not policy statements. The
First Circuit found that since plaintiffs had not raised the argument in earlier proceedings, it was precluded from
raising the issue in its appeal.

In so doing, the First Circuit noted that the EPA's policy had not been newly minted for these litigations, but had been
issued in 1987 and had been applied to section 177 in a letter to Congressman John Dingell (D. Mich.) on March 7, 1991,
prior to litigation.

Judicial review of this issue has thus resulted in contrary results from the two courts of Appeals that have ruled on
the matter. However, while there was division in the circuit courts as to the final result, both courts commented on
the lack of EPA regulations that define model year for the purpose of determining compliance with section 177. Though
EPA continues to believe that the existing regulations and Advisory Circulars are entitled to Chevron deference,
EPA is proposing new regulations specifying its definition of model year as that term is used in section 177 of the Act
in an effort to remove further confusion regarding this issue and to provide national consistency. EPA is also proposing
to apply these regulations to ``model year'' as that term is used for regulation of motor vehicles under Part A of Title
II of the Act. EPA is not proposing to extend this determination at this time to regulation of nonroad engines and vehicles,
which may require somewhat different provisions for ``model year.''

D. Determination of Model Year
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The determination EPA is proposing today for implementation of section 177 shall include the regulatory definition
of model year as that term has been defined under section 202 of the Act. It shall also include the more specific determinations
regarding model year, including the definition of ``production period,'' delineated in Advisory Circular 6B (Dec.
31, 1987). This Advisory Circular addresses the duration of model year, defines production period and provides information
on EPA policy concerning the duration and applicability of certificates of conformity. It notes that a specific model
year must include January 1 of the calendar year for which it is designated and may not include a January 1 of any other
calendar year, thus limiting the duration of a model year to a calendar year plus 364 days. In addition, Advisory Circular
6B defines ``annual production period'' for any specific model within an engine family of light-duty vehicles or
heavy-duty engines as beginning either: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
``(1) When such vehicle or engine is first produced, or (2) on January 2 of the calendar year preceding the year for which
the model year is designated, whichever date is later. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The annual production period ends either: (1) when the last such vehicle or engine is produced, or (2) on December 31
of the calendar year for which the model year is named, whichever date is sooner.'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA believes that the definitions of ``duration of model year'' and ``production period for specific models within
an engine family'' which are contained in Advisory Circular 6B are the appropriate definitions to be used to determine
compliance with section 177 as well as to determine compliance with the programs for which the Advisory Circular has
been used in the past. EPA believes these definitions, and the fact that the production period is based on specific
models within engine families, provide vehicle manufacturers the maximum flexibility in terms of adjusting the
model year designation of their product line to marketing needs and product changes. By permitting the designation
of specific engine families, or models within families, as ``pull ahead'' model year families without affecting
the remainder of the vehicles in the model year they are presently building, a manufacturer will be able, for example,
to launch a new vehicle as a 1995 model year vehicle while the remainder of their models are being produced as 1994 models.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA also believes that a determination that model year should be determined on a ``model-by-model'' basis is more
appropriate than an interpretation that ``model year'' should begin at the same time industry-wide because the two-year
lead-time of section 177 is better fulfilled through a ``model-by-model'' approach. Manufacturers determine the
start date for manufacture of vehicle models on a model-by-model basis. Therefore, individual manufacturers are
in the best position to determine when each model they produce in a model year will begin production. The lead-time
provisions of section 177 were designed to give manufacturers sufficient lead-time to produce California vehicles
necessary to meet the supply needs of any state that promulgates standards under section 177 (``177 state''). There
is no indication that Congress intended that states be unable to regulate vehicle models that do not begin production
before the two-year deadline. Nor is there any practical reason why a particular vehicle model should not be covered.
Manufacturers are well aware of their own production schedules and can assure that any vehicle models that begin production
after the two-year lead-time ends meet the California requirements in a particular state.

Automobile dealerships in an affected state would be able to contact their manufacturers to find out which vehicle

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA does not agree with the Second Circuit that an ``industry-wide'' approach to model year would be more appropriate
in the context of California's NMOG fleet averaging program.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
79 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In fact, though a ``model-by-model'' approach might be more complicated, it actually provides to manufacturers
more control over the particular engine models that will be subject to an averaging program for a particular model
year, especially compared to an ``industry-wide'' approach. Under the ``industry-wide'' approach, a manufacturer
commencing production of its vehicles after the lead-time expires cannot determine for itself what models would
be subject to the California requirements, but must instead find out whether any of its competitor manufacturers
have begun production of a model for that model year prior to the deadline.

EPA notes that this model year determination must be geared toward application to all programs that may be promulgated
by California, not merely the programs promulgated as part of the LEV program. Therefore, application of the model
year determination to a particular program should not be given overwhelming weight in our determination. As the First
Circuit noted, ``[f]leet averaging for emissions programs is a concept devised by California, not Congress.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Moreover, the increased complexity that may be caused by different emission requirements for different vehicles
in a single model year is not unique to the Agency's approach to the term ``model year'' under section 177. In fact, any
program that includes a phase-in of standards (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the ``Tier I'' requirements of section 202(g)) results in different standards for different cars within a model year.
Moreover, the California LEV program itself contemplates that different cars will be certified to different standards
during a single model year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, any increased complexity must be balanced against the emissions benefits of such a decision. The best example
of the severe emissions detriment that will occur if the ``industry-wide'' approach is used is the example of Massachusetts'
implementation of the California vehicle program for model year 1995. Massachusetts' promulgation of rules requiring
model year 1995 cars to meet California standards was completed by January 31, 1992. This gave manufacturers a full
two years of lead-time for any vehicle model that began production after January 31, 1994. However, model year 1995
could begin, under EPA rules, by January 2, 1994, and a few vehicle models had begun production by that time. If the ``industry-wide''
approach had been used for the Massachusetts situation, then, conceivably, all manufacturers could continue to
provide all of their model year 1995 vehicles to Massachusetts until December 31, 1995 without meeting the California
standards for any of the vehicles. Thus, there would be close to four years between promulgation of the Massachusetts
rule and full compliance with such rule by manufacturers. Moreover, the ``industry-wide'' rule would require that
California standards not be enforced for any vehicles manufactured in the 1995 model year. Since the 1996 model year
does not begin for any vehicle until, at the earliest, January 2, 1995, the ``industry-wide'' rule would provide almost
three full years between promulgation and any enforcement of California standards. The emissions increases that
would result from the loss of a full model year from the California program could have a significant impact on air pollution
in ``177 states'' and on the ability of such states to meet the attainment deadlines provided in the Clean Air Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ``model-by-model'' approach is also preferable to the ``manufacturer-by-manufacturer'' approach
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
80 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
because it substantially lessens the competitiveness concerns that could otherwise result. Given that under the
``model-by-model'' approach, the determination of model year would be based on when each individual model begins
production, there would be less of an opportunity for a manufacturer to exempt its entire vehicle fleet for a full model
year by beginning production of one vehicle model before the two year deadline. Thus, there is considerably less likelihood
that two manufacturers will have to meet different emission standards for all of their vehicles for a particular year
based only on when one model for a particular manufacturer began production. Instead, the ``model-by-model'' approach
is likely to result in similar percentages of vehicles for each manufacturer being covered by California rules for
the ``split'' model year.

The ``manufacturer-by-manufacturer'' approach would allow any manufacturer that had begun production of any model
before the two year deadline to escape enforcement of the state regulations for every model produced by that manufacturer
during that model year. This approach had been mandated by the trial court in the New York LEV case before the Second
Circuit opinion was delivered,

Finally, EPA disagrees with the Second Circuit's belief that Congress did not contemplate a ``split'' model year
approach, differentiating manufacturers based on when each commences production. In fact, EPA's initial Advisory
Circulars explaining EPA's ``model-by-model'' approach were announced in 1972, five years before section 177 was
added to the Clean Air Act. Congress must have at least ``contemplated,'' if not in fact expected, that EPA would interpret
``model year'' for section 177 as it had for section 202.

Under Executive Order 12866, 58 FR 51735 (Oct. 4, 1993) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines
``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may:

(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order 12866, since this action could result in a rule that would have a substantial
impact, this notice is a ``significant regulatory action'' because the estimated range of annual costs of the California
LEV program in the OTC states is between $300 million and $1.6 billion. As such, this action was submitted to OMB for
review. Changes made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations will be documented in the public record. EPA
has prepared an economic analysis for this rule under E.O. 12866. A copy of this analysis has been placed in the docket.
Any written comments to EPA and any written EPA responses to those comments regarding this analysis will be included
in the docket for this proceeding.

IX. Impact on Small Entities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601(a), provides that, whenever an agency is required to publish a general
notice of rulemaking, it must prepare and make available a regulatory flexibility analysis (RFA). While EPA intends
to follow rulemaking procedures under 307(d) of the Clean Air Act, EPA believes it is not legally required to publish
a general notice of rulemaking here, and hence that it need not prepare a RFA. But even if EPA is required to publish a
general notice of rulemaking here, a RFA is required only for small entities which are directly regulated by the rule.

773 F. 2d 327 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (agency's certification need only consider the rule's impact on regulated entities
and not indirect impact on small entities not regulated). The OTC's recommended LEV program would directly regulate
auto manufacturers. Since these auto manufacturers generally do not qualify as small businesses within the meaning
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, EPA does not believe a RFA is needed for either the proposed or final rules, even
if a rulemaking is required. Accordingly, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator certifies that this rule
will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nevertheless, the Agency has considered the effect of an OTC LEV program on new and used car dealerships as part of its
regulatory impact analysis, even though such analysis is not required because these businesses would not be directly
regulated under the rule. The results of this analysis, set forth in the RIA, indicate that the OTC LEV would not have
a significant economic impact on automobile dealerships.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Model year means the manufacturer's annual production period (as determined under &sect;85.2304) which includes
January 1 of such calendar year, provided, that if the manufacturer has no annual production period, the term ``model
year'' shall mean the calendar year.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A specific model year must always include January 1 of the calendar year for which it is designated and may not include
a January 1 of any other calendar year. Thus, the maximum duration of a model year is one calendar year plus 364 days.

The extended coverage period described here for a certificate of conformity (i.e., up to one year plus 364 days) is
primarily intended to allow flexibility in the introduction of new models. Under no circumstances should it be interpreted
that existing models may ``skip'' yearly certification by pulling ahead the production of every other model year.
While this situation, to the Agency's knowledge, has not occurred in the past, a practice of producing vehicles for
a two year period would violate Congress's intent of annual certification based upon an annual production period.
The Agency is not currently setting forth rules for how to determine when abuse has occurred, since this has not been
a problem to date. However, the Agency is requiring that manufacturers shall continue to use normal yearly production
periods for existing models.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a certificate of conformity is deemed to be effective and cover
the vehicles or engines named in such certificate and produced during the annual production period, as defined in
&sect;85.2304. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Section 203 of the Clean Air Act prohibits the sale, offering for sale, delivery for introduction into commerce,
and introduction into commerce of any new vehicle or engine not covered by a certificate of conformity unless it is
an imported vehicle exempted by the Administrator or otherwise authorized jointly by EPA and U.S. Customs service
regulations. However, the Act does not prohibit the production of vehicles or engines without a certificate of conformity.
Vehicles or engines produced prior to the effective date of a certificate of conformity, as defined in paragraph (a)
of this section, may also be covered by the certificate if the following conditions are met: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The vehicles or engines conform in all respects to the vehicle or engines described in the application for the certificate
of conformity; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The vehicles or engines are not sold, offered for sale, introduced into commerce, or delivered for introduction
into commerce prior to the effective date of the certificate of conformity; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The Agency is notified prior to the beginning of production when such production will start, and the Agency is provided
full opportunity to inspect and/or test the vehicles during and after their production; for example, the Agency must
have the opportunity to conduct selective enforcement auditing production line testing as if the vehicles had been
produced after the effective date of the certificate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Vehicles or engines imported by an original equipment manufacturer after December 31 of the calendar year for
which the model year is named are still covered by the certificate of conformity as long as the production of the vehicle
or engine was completed before December 31 of that year. This paragraph does not apply to vehicles that may be covered
by certificates held by independent commercial importers unless specifically approved by EPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Vehicles or engines produced after December 31 of the calendar year for which the model year is named are not covered
by the certificate of conformity for that model year. A new certificate of conformity demonstrating compliance with
currently applicable standards must be obtained for these vehicles or engines, even if they are identical to vehicles
or engines built before December 31.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing to require that the sponsor of any drug, biological product, or
device submit certain information concerning the compensation to, and financial interests of, any clinical investigator
conducting clinical studies to determine whether that product meets the marketing requirements specified by the
agency. This requirement will apply to most clinical studies involving human subjects, as well as any study to establish
bioavailability or bioequivalence. The agency is proposing to require that sponsors certify to the absence of certain
financial interests of clinical investigators or disclose those financial interests when clinical studies are
submitted to FDA in support of product marketing. If the agency adopts this proposal, and the sponsor does not include
one of the required submissions with the application for marketing a covered product that contains clinical data,
the agency will refuse to file the application. FDA will propose to extend these requirements to submissions for marketing
approval related to human foods, animal foods, and animal drugs in a notice to be published in a subsequent issue of
the

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There is a growing recognition in the academic and scientific communities that certain financial arrangements between
clinical investigators and product sponsors, or the personal financial interests of clinical investigators, can
potentially bias the outcome of clinical trials. Although FDA and other government agencies, in parallel with these
communities, are increasingly concerned about the potential for such interests to bias data generated by these studies,
the agency currently has no mechanism to collect information concerning specific financial interests of clinical
investigators who conduct studies in support of product marketing. The creation of a system to collect and analyze
this information will strengthen the product review process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of June 28, 1994, the Public Health Service published a notice of proposed rulemaking on objectivity in research (59
FR 33242&hyph;33251); and the National Science Foundation published a statement of policy on financial disclosure
by scientific investigators (59 FR 33308&hyph;33312).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fact that these other government agencies have developed such policies and regulations reinforces FDA's concerns
and its decision to seek an appropriate approach to the issue. Of necessity, such an approach differs in some respects
among different agencies, based on differences in their responsibilities and the nature of their relationships
with external communities (i.e., the role of a regulatory agency versus a grant-making agency). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, the PHS and NSF documents are broader in scope than the FDA proposed rule and respond to principles that
govern federally funded grants and contracts. The concerns of PHS and NSF include the stewardship of public research
funds and the assurance of objectivity in the research supported by these funds. Receipt of Federal funds for research
is a privilege, and, just as such funds are granted for all types of research, PHS and NSF are interested in guarding
against bias in all research.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In contrast, drug and device manufacturers are required under statutory authority to submit clinical trial data
in order to gain FDA approval to market a product. FDA's concerns are more narrowly focused on evaluating the reliability
of clinical data submissions in support of marketing approval because FDA must rely on submitted clinical data in
making decisions on the safety and effectiveness of regulated products. FDA's primary interest is in the potential
of certain financial interests to bias the outcome of clinical studies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the agency's special regulatory responsibilities, FDA's proposed rule differs from the NIH regulation
and the NSF policy in terms of the research conducted by potentially affected investigators and in two other respects
as well. FDA's proposed rule does not include a financial interest of a clinical investigator in a firm that owns a product
that would compete with the tested product for market share, and FDA is not proposing to require disclosure of financial
interests and arrangements in or with the sponsor by full-time employees of the sponsor. In addition, FDA's proposed
rule does not identify a specific threshold dollar which would trigger disclosure of financial interests. Instead,
FDA is requesting public comment on whether setting a threshold amount is appropriate, and if so, what the dollar amount
should be. These additional differences, and FDA's interest in obtaining comment on them, are discussed further
in section II.D. of this document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is concerned about financial interests that are unknown or undisclosed to the agency and potentially unmanaged
by product sponsors to guard against purposeful or inadvertent bias. In particular, FDA is concerned about those
types of financial interests whose value is heavily influenced by the outcome of the research.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Clinical research data provide the basis for FDA's assessment of the safety and effectiveness of new human drugs,
devices, and biologics, the assessment of the bioequivalence of generic drugs and sometimes the substantial equivalence
of devices. It is essential that these data be reliable and that steps be taken to minimize possible effects on the data
resulting from potential bias on the part of an investigator. FDA acknowledges that there are many factors that could
give investigators a preference for a particular outcome, but a significant financial interest in the outcome of
the study is of particular concern. Bias, as used here, means a purposeful or inadvertent preference of the clinical
investigator for a particular study outcome that interferes with the clinical investigator's impartiality in conducting
a clinical study. Bias could, for example, interfere with a clinical investigator's impartiality in assessing the
outcome of therapy; in assigning patients to treatment (so that patients who receive the test product are those with
a better prognosis); in interpreting an adverse event: in assessing the outcome of the therapy; or in deciding upon
use of concomitant therapy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In any discussion of potential sources of bias, it is important to distinguish between the actual conduct of studies
and collection of data by clinical investigators, on the one hand, and the use of those studies, i.e., the analysis,
interpretation, and presentation of the data from those studies by the sponsor, on the other. In the analysis, interpretation,
and presentation of data, a commercial sponsor would be expected to have a clear preference for a particular result,
and FDA's review of the sponsor's submissions proceeds with awareness of the sponsor's interests and potential biases.
The agency regularly examines, and in some cases repeats, the statistical analysis carried out by sponsors for scientific
adequacy and for accuracy, basing these examinations on the raw data collected by clinical investigators. When there
is a choice of analysis or study endpoints, the agency can usually determine whether they were specified prospectively
or chosen without knowledge of the study outcome, and whether the choice appears scientifically credible. Where
more than one analysis is possible, FDA can independently weigh the arguments for and against a given approach. FDA
can, thus, deal with potential sponsor biases in the analyses and interpretation of submitted data because the agency
has complete access to the raw data and a complete description of the analyses the sponsor chose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In contrast, there is no way to assess completely the accuracy of the raw data themselves, although the agency can,
and does, take steps to help assure their validity. FDA provides guidance to sponsors of drugs, biologics and devices
on how to develop monitoring systems that their study monitors can use to ensure that data generated in clinical trials
are accurate and complete. As further protection against isolated unreliable data, the agency generally requires
findings to be replicated before they can serve as the basis for marketing decisions; and clinical data may also be
subjected to field inspections through the agency's bioresearch monitoring program. In many cases, clinical trial
results arise from the combined efforts of many investigators, so that a regulatory conclusion does not depend on
a single investigator's efforts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are, however, limits to the protection these steps provide against potential bias. Even if the primary responsibility
of the study monitor to the sponsor is discounted, monitors cannot verify many of the observations made independently
by investigators. Moreover, while the bioresearch monitoring program is immensely valuable in detecting certain
kinds of data problems, including errors or bias leading to an inconsistency between what is reported to FDA and information
in independently generated records (for example, nurses's notes, laboratory slips, office records, hospital records)
and can often detect sloppiness or deliberate fraud, it has limited ability to detect faulty assessment of study endpoints,
or failure to record adverse effects. Thus, although the agency tries to ensure that data are reliable, FDA relies
considerably on independent clinical investigators to provide valid and reliable data.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Assessing the reliability of data is a fundamental aspect of FDA's evaluation. It is just as critical as assessing
the adequacy of study design, the completeness of the studies carried out, and the meaning of the results. Therefore,
financial arrangements and interests that could affect reliability of data need to be identified and considered.
Such interests are already considered to exist and are taken into account when a clinical investigator is a full-time
employee of a sponsor. When the investigator is not a full-time employee, the interests and arrangements that need
to be identified and considered include financial arrangements in which the value of financial compensation received
by the clinical investigator could be affected by the study outcome; significant payments of other sorts, such as
grants for ongoing research, compensations in the form of equipment, retainers or honoraria; a proprietary interest
of the investigator in the tested product, such as a patent; or a significant equity interest in the sponsoring company.
Such arrangements and interests, especially if combined with such clinical trial features as open (unblinded) study
designs, studies with subjective endpoints, and single-investigator studies, may increase the risk that purposeful
or inadvertent bias could influence the outcome of the study. FDA needs to be aware of influences that could affect
data reliability.

II. Proposed Action

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. The Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In developing this proposal, the agency has considered three broad areas: (1) Identification of financial information
that should be reported by sponsors to FDA; (2) procedures for reporting this information; and (3) steps the agency
should take to deal with potential bias in data from studies by clinical investigators found to have potentially problematic
financial interests. FDA has also considered the proper balance between the agency's desire to detect and help to
minimize bias in clinical data and the need to avoid intrusion into the privacy of clinical investigators and unreasonable
administrative burdens on sponsors and on agency staff. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In considering procedures for reporting such information, the agency has sought to identify the method that would
be least burdensome for sponsors and for agency staff. FDA has determined that a simple, direct and effective method
of minimizing reporting requirements would be to give every sponsor the option of either certifying to FDA as to the
absence of certain financial interests and arrangements of the investigators conducting clinical studies of the
sponsor's product or alternatively, disclosing those interests and describing the steps taken to minimize the impact
of possible bias. Accordingly, FDA is proposing to require that the sponsor of any product submitted to the agency
for marketing approval submit a list of clinical investigators and make one of two alternative submissions for each
clinical investigator who is not identified by the sponsor as a full-time employee of the sponsor at the time reports
of clinical studies and their accompanying data are submitted in support of product marketing. The alternative submissions
are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The sponsor may certify that for any clinical study relied upon by the sponsor to establish that the product meets
the regulatory requirements for approval: (a) The sponsor has not entered into any financial arrangement with any
clinical investigator in which the value of financial compensation received by the clinical investigator for conducting
the studies could be affected by the outcome of the research; (b) the investigator has not received significant payments
of other sorts from the sponsor, such as a grant to fund ongoing research, compensation in the form of equipment, a retainer
for ongoing consultation, or honoraria; (c) the clinical investigator has no proprietary interest, such as a patent
or other direct financial interest in the clinically tested product; and (d) the clinical investigator holds no significant
equity interest in the sponsor's company.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) If the sponsor does not provide certification, the sponsor must disclose the specific financial arrangements
made with the clinical investigator, the investigator's proprietary and equity interests in the tested product
and the sponsor's company, and describe steps taken to minimize the potential for bias in data submitted in support
of product applications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a statement of certification or disclosure does not accompany an application containing clinical data, the agency
will refuse to file the application. The agency believes that clinical investigators are responsible for providing
the sponsor with sufficient accurate financial information to allow preparation of complete and accurate statements
and is proposing to require that investigators make such information available to sponsors. Disclosure and certification
requirements will extend not only to the clinical investigator, but also to the investigator's immediate family
(i.e., spouse and dependent children). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although this proposed regulation applies only to submissions for human drugs, biological products, and devices,
sponsors also submit data from independent clinical investigators_i.e., clinical investigators who are not the
sponsor's employees_in support of submissions such as food and color additives, infant formulas, health claims,
and animal drug applications (i.e., studies involving animals that are equivalent to clinical studies). The agency
will also propose to apply these requirements to submissions for marketing approval related to human foods, animal
foods, and animal drugs in a notice to be published in a subsequent issue of the

B. The Certification Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency is proposing in &sect;54.4(a)(1) the following language for use by sponsors as a certification statement:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
With respect to all covered clinical studies [or to specific clinical studies listed below] submitted in support
of this application, I certify that (name of applicant) has not entered into any financial arrangement with any clinical
investigator, whereby the value of compensation to the investigator to conduct the study could be affected by the
outcome of the study. I also certify that each clinical investigator was required to disclose to (name of applicant)
whether the investigator had a proprietary interest in this product, or a significant equity interest in (name of
applicant), and that no such interests were disclosed. I further certify that the investigator was not the recipient
of significant payments of other kinds as defined in 21 CFR 54.2(f). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of this statement, a clinical investigator includes the spouse, and each dependent child of the investigator
as defined in 21 CFR 54.2(d). This certification is made in compliance with 21 CFR part 54. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Rationale for the Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In developing this policy, FDA met with representatives of numerous scientific and health care organizations, as
well as industry, consumers and other Government agencies. On September 9, 1993, FDA's Science Board convened a public
meeting to discuss financial disclosure by clinical investigators. There was general support for development of
this policy expressed at the meeting by board members and most public speakers. The following Government groups were
represented at the meeting: PHS, the National Institutes of Health, NSF, and the National Academy of Sciences. The
discussion included updates by representatives of these government agencies on the development of their policies
and rules pertaining to conflict of interest and financial disclosure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Presentations were also made by the American Medical Association, the Society for Clinical Trials, the American
Federation for Clinical Research, the Association of American Medical Colleges, the Health Research Group, the
National Coalition of Hispanic Health and Human Service Organizations, the Women's Health Network, the Pharmaceutical
Manufacturers Association, and the Health Industry Manufacturers Association. The Biotechnology Industry Organization
submitted a written statement to the Board. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, FDA met informally with organizations representing major segments of the regulated industry, consumer
organizations, professional societies, and investigators. During the meetings, the following issues were discussed:
(1) The identification of financial arrangements that have the potential for generating bias; (2) the extent of disclosure
by clinical investigators to sponsors; (3) the impact of public disclosure of clinical investigators' financial
interests; and (4) to whom a requirement for disclosure of financial interests might apply (e.g., the investigator's
immediate family, significant business partners). Financial arrangements discussed included payments in the
form of equity, such as stock and stock options, and compensation tied to the sales of the product, such as royalty interests.
From these informal discussions, it appears that in most cases clinical investigators are not asked by sponsors to
divulge any financial interest held by the investigators in the sponsoring firm prior to performing a clinical study.
(Minutes and other disclosable statements are available at the Dockets Management Branch (address above)).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Requiring sponsors to obtain information on and either certify or disclose their clinical investigators' relevant
financial interests and arrangements is intended to help ensure that sponsors consider these matters in the early
stages of product development and, if necessary, consider how best to minimize potential sources of bias. FDA believes
that in most cases, sponsors would be able to provide certification for clinical investigators and would not need
to submit any further information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA recognizes that therapeutically beneficial products have been developed through investigations in which clinical
investigators were compensated in ways that may have influenced the outcome of the study and is therefore not intending
to prohibit such arrangements, or rule out reliance on affected studies as a basis for product approval, but intends
to give such studies particularly close scrutiny and evaluation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requiring certification or disclosure at the time of submission of marketing applications does not preclude a sponsor
from seeking the agency's advice at the early stages of product development with respect to a potentially problematic
financial arrangement with a clinical investigator. Indeed, FDA strongly encourages early consultation in cases
where the sponsor may be entering into problematic financial arrangements with a clinical investigator. The agency
will work with sponsors in planning careful management of such situations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to require certification or disclosure only with respect to the clinical data submissions in support
of marketing applications because if this information were submitted prior to beginning clinical studies, agency
staff would be unduly burdened with evaluating financial information for every clinical study undertaken, many
of which never lead to marketing applications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has tentatively chosen not to seek information on investigators carrying out preclinical or manufacturing and
controls operations for a number of reasons. Employees of the sponsor develop most of these data, and FDA already considers
the financial interests of these employees. Also, these data are often verified independently and are relatively
insensitive to inadvertent bias. In contrast, clinical data are more susceptible to inadvertent, unrecognized
bias on the part of investigators. FDA recognizes that, despite these reasons, biased preclinical or chemistry work
could also affect product approvals and welcomes comments on possible approaches the agency could take to ensure
the reliability of such work. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA believes that these requirements for certification or disclosure should apply not only to the clinical investigator's
interests, but to the interests of the investigator's immediate family as well. The financial interests of a clinical
investigator's immediate family are effectively shared by the investigator and thus would be as potentially biasing
as if they were under the investigator's name. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency envisions that the financial arrangements and steps taken to minimize bias will vary with different product
applications and will review these applications on a case-by-case basis. For example, if a study design is sufficiently
robust as a result of factors such as independent data monitoring, multiple investigators, blinding, and independent
endpoint assessment, FDA could determine that a problematic financial interest would not likely introduce bias.
In other situations, there might be sufficient replication of critical results to render the questionable data less
important, or it might be possible to carry out further analyses or observations (reexamination of hospital records
or patients) that would provide assurance as to the reliability of the data. In still others, intensified scrutiny
by FDA's bioresearch monitoring staff might be sufficient to permit FDA to accept the data in support of product marketing
applications. In some cases, however, FDA might not be able to conclude that the data were reliable and might require
sponsors to conduct further studies. The agency seeks comment as to other appropriate steps that FDA might take to
respond to applications that may be considered problematic with respect to potential bias.

D. Related Issues for Comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Public Disclosure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency also seeks comment on whether publicly disclosing a clinical investigator's financial interests would
serve a useful purpose. FDA also requests comment on what might constitute an appropriate forum for such release_for
example, whether it would be useful to disclose such information to an outside advisory committee considering the
tested product. Public disclosure of such information is subject to any limitations on disclosure imposed by the
Privacy Act, the Freedom of Information Act and other applicable Federal statutes. FDA requests comment on whether
the value of public release is outweighed by the right to privacy of clinical investigators with respect to their financial
affairs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Definition of a Clinical Investigator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the purposes of this proposed rule, FDA defines a clinical investigator as including the spouse and each dependent
child of the investigator. FDA is aware of instances in which problematic financial interests or arrangements have
been listed under the name of a business partner or business associate of a clinical investigator with whom the investigator
shared the interests or arrangements, so that the potentially biasing factor is not readily traceable to the clinical
investigator. The agency seeks comment on whether the definition of a clinical investigator should include business
partners of the investigator as well and, if so, how ``business partner'' should be defined. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Scope and Amount of Financial Interests that Should Be Disclosed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In proposing to require disclosure of any significant equity interest held by a clinical investigator in the sponsor,
the agency has defined a significant equity interest as ``any ownership interest, stock options, or other financial
interest whose value cannot be readily determined through reference to public prices, or any equity interest in a
publicly traded corporation that exceeds 5 percent of total equity (see proposed &sect;54.2(b)). FDA seeks public
comment on this definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA also seeks comment on whether to require information on other investigator interests or payments to investigators
that are not directly related to the conduct of a study. These types of arrangements might give the investigator an
``interest'' in the company, such as financial ties with a firm or other entity that supplies, or is likely to supply
equipment, materials, or services for work performed by the investigator; financial ties with parties whose financial
interests would be, or would seem to be, directly and significantly affected by the investigator's work; financial
ties with, or financial support from, any firm that markets, produces, or has in premarket testing a product that is,
or will likely be, affected by the investigator's research. FDA also requests comment on whether there should be a
``threshold of concern'' with respect to such payments, (i.e., whether the agency should be concerned only when these
forms of compensation to investigators exceed a certain threshold amount). Several academic institutions have
instituted de minimis levels for disclosure, such as $5,000 cash and $20,000 equity interest in a publicly held and
widely traded company. FDA has not identified a threshold amount and seeks public comment on whether a threshold dollar
amount should be set, and if so, what that amount should be. The agency also seeks comments on any other financial relationships
or arrangements that should raise concern.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Ownership by a Clinical Investigator of Stock in a Competing Product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The approach taken by FDA in this proposed rule differs from that of PHS and NSF in that the agency has not included ownership
by a clinical investigator of stock in a product that would compete with the tested product for market share. This issue,
FDA believes, is appropriately of concern to sponsors. The agency seeks comment on whether such ownership substantially
threatens an individual clinical investigator's objectivity and whether there is a manageable basis for reporting
this kind of interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Disclosure of Financial Interests by Full-Time Employees of the Sponsor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA's approach also differs from that of PHS and NSF in that FDA is not proposing to require disclosure of financial
interests and arrangements in or with the sponsor by full-time employees of the sponsor. FDA assumes the clinical
investigator who is a full-time employee of the sponsor has a clear interest in the outcome of research and accounts
for this potential bias in the level of scrutiny with which the agency reviews the submitted data. FDA seeks comment
as to what disclosure, if any, by a clinical investigator, who is a full-time employee of the sponsor, of interests
in the sponsor other than salary might contribute to minimizing bias. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Disclosure by Clinical Investigators to Both PHS and FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The PHS notice of proposed rulemaking on objectivity in research (59 FR 33242) would require that an institution receiving
a PHS grant for research must solicit and review financial disclosure statements from each investigator who is planning
to participate in PHS-funded research. The Institution would make available to the Department of Health and Human
Services, upon request, information regarding all significant financial interests identified by the institution
and how those interests have been managed, reduced, or eliminated to protect the research from bias. In this proposed
regulation, FDA would require that the sponsor of a marketing application for a regulated product either certify
as to the absence of certain financial interests and arrangements of the investigators conducting clinical studies
of the sponsor's product, or disclose those interests and describe the steps taken to minimize the impact of possible
bias.

As noted in Section I. of this document, these two proposed regulations respond to different principles and are based
on different relationships with external communities. Nevertheless, there is potential for the two regulations
to overlap in a small number of instances involving PHS-funded clinical research on FDA-regulated products. Public
comment is sought on whether, in such instances, clinical investigators should be required to disclose financial
interests both to the institution receiving PHS funds and to the sponsor submitting a marketing application to FDA,
and whether meeting the PHS requirement for disclosure to the institution should be considered to satisfy FDA's requirement
for disclosure to the sponsor of a marketing application.

III. Legal Authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency is generally authorized by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) and the Public Health Service
Act to approve drugs, devices, and biological products for marketing if the products are demonstrated to be safe and
effective for their intended uses and are properly labeled. More specifically, new drugs are approved for marketing
if they meet the safety and effectiveness criteria set forth in section 505(d) of the act (21 U.S.C. 355(d)) and the
implementing regulations (21 CFR part 314). To demonstrate effectiveness, the law requires evidence from adequate
and well-controlled clinical studies on the basis of which qualified experts could fairly and responsibly conclude
that the drug has the effect it is purported to have. Section 505(j)(3)(F) of the act authorizes the approval of an abbreviated
new drug application if, among other things, there is sufficient information to show that the drug is ``bioequivalent
to the listed drug referred to in the application.'' Under section 505(e) of the act, approval of a new drug application
is to be withdrawn if new information shows that the drug has not been demonstrated to be either safe or effective. Approval
may also be withdrawn if new information shows that the drug's labeling is false or misleading. Under section 505(d)(4)
of the act, in determining whether a drug is ``safe for use'' under the conditions proposed, the agency may consider
not only information such as data from clinical studies, but also ``any other information'' before the agency relevant
to the determination. In deciding whether the drug's proposed labeling would be ``false or misleading'' under section
505(d)(7) of the act, the agency is also to evaluate ``all material facts.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 505(k) of the act authorizes the agency to promulgate regulations requiring applicants to make records and
reports of data or other information that are necessary to enable the agency to determine whether there is reason to
withdraw approval of a new drug application or an abbreviated new drug application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is similar authority under section 351(d) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262) to approve biological
products if their ``safety, purity, and potency'' are demonstrated; section 351 also authorizes the promulgation
of regulations designed to ensure the continued safety, purity, and potency of the products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA's authority to regulate medical devices arises from the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938, as amended
by the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 (the 1976 amendments), the Safe Medical Device Amendments of 1990, and the
Medical Device Amendments of 1992.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the 1976 amendments, devices are divided into preamendments devices, i.e., those devices in commercial distribution
prior to May 28, 1976, the date of the enactment of the 1976 amendments, and postamendments devices, i.e., those devices
first in commercial distribution on or after the enactment of the 1976 amendments. All devices are then further classified
into class I, II, or III, depending on the degree of regulatory control necessary to ensure safety and effectiveness.
Class III devices are the most highly regulated category of devices and, unless exempted, are subject to premarket
approval by FDA. A device may be classified into class III: (1) By operation of law if the device is a ``new'' device,
i.e., it was not on the market before the date of the enactment of the 1976 amendments; (2) if FDA classifies or reclassifies
the device into class III; or (3) by operation of law under 21 U.S.C. 360j(l) because it is a transitional device that
was previously regarded as a new drug. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An unapproved class III device may be investigated for purposes of obtaining FDA approval under an investigational
device exemption (IDE) (21 U.S.C. 360j(g)). Under three IDE regulatory provisions, FDA can require any information
``relevant'' to the review of the application (21 CFR 812.20(b)(12), 812.20(c), and 813.20(b)(18)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Clinical data generated under an IDE and other data and information are used by FDA as a basis to grant marketing approval
for class III devices and as a basis to reclassify a device. The law requires that a premarket approval application
(PMA) contain ``full reports of all information,'' known to, or which should reasonably be known to, the applicant
concerning investigations concerning the safety and effectiveness of the device (21 U.S.C. 360e(c)(1)(A)). In
approving a PMA, FDA must make the determination, inter alia, that there is a showing of reasonable assurance that
the device is safe and effective under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed
labeling, and that based on a fair evaluation of all material facts the proposed labeling is not false or misleading
(21 U.S.C. 360e(b)). In deciding whether to grant or deny approval of a PMA, FDA relies upon ``valid scientific evidence''
which includes evidence from well-controlled investigations, partially controlled studies, studies and objective
trials without matched controls, well-documented case histories conducted by qualified experts, and reports of
significant human experience with a marketed device *&blank;*&blank;*.'' (21 CFR 860.7(c)(2)). FDA evaluates
the data submitted and determines whether it constitutes ``valid scientific evidence'' for the purpose of determining
the safety and effectiveness of a particular device ``and whether the available evidence, when taken as a whole is
adequate to support a determination that there is a reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for
its conditions of use.'' (21 CFR 860.7(c)(1)). In determining whether a device should be reclassified, FDA relies
upon the same regulatory definition of ``valid scientific evidence.'' Section 515(e)(1) of the act (21 U.S.C 360(e)(1))
authorizes the agency to withdraw approval of an application if, on the basis of ``new information,'' there is a lack
of a showing of reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective under the conditions of use, or the labeling
of the device is false or misleading in any particular. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA may also use clinical data to determine whether a ``new device,'' i.e. a device marketed after the date of the enactment
of the 1976 amendments, may be removed from its automatic statutory class III status and thereby be exempt from premarket
approval requirements (21 U.S.C. 360c(f)(1)). Such devices may be marketed without premarket approval if FDA issues
an order finding them ``substantially equivalent'' to a predicate device that does not require premarket approval
(21 U.S.C. 360c(i)(1)). In determining whether a device is ``substantially equivalent'' to a predicate device,
FDA must determine, on the basis of a premarket application submission (510(k) submission)(21 U.S.C. 360(k)), that
the device has the same intended use as the predicate device, and that the device ``has the same technological characteristics
as the predicate device, or *&blank;*&blank;* has different technological characteristics and the [submission]
*&blank;*&blank;* contains information, including clinical data if deemed necessary by the Secretary, that demonstrates
that the device is as safe and effective'' as the predicate device and does not raise different questions of safety
and efficacy than the predicate device. (Id.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to sections 519 and 701 of the act, (21 U.S.C. 360i and 371) FDA has broad authority to promulgate regulations
governing the approval of devices. Section 519(a) of the act requires manufacturers of devices to ``establish and
maintain such records, make such reports, and provide such information, as the Secretary may, by regulation, reasonably
require to assure that such device is not adulterated or misbranded and to otherwise assure its safety and effectiveness.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, a critical part of the agency's function is examining clinical data to determine if the safety and effectiveness
requirements of the act and the Public Health Service Act have been met. FDA is authorized by sections 505(i) and 701(a)
of the act to promulgate regulations governing the conduct of studies of investigational drugs, including unlicensed
biological products. There is similar authority relating to studies of devices under sections 510(k), 513, 515,
520(g), and 522 of the act (21 U.S.C. 360(k), 360c, 360e, 360j(g), and 360l). Pursuant to this authority, FDA has previously
promulgated regulations whose purpose is to ensure the reliability of data submitted to FDA in support of marketing
applications. FDA's investigational new drug application regulations (21 CFR part 312), promulgated under section
505(i) of the act, and its investigational device exemptions regulations (21 CFR parts 812 and 813), promulgated
under section 520(g) of the act, are intended, among other things, to help ensure the validity and reliability of clinical
study results submitted to FDA in support of new drug applications (NDA's) and supplements; premarket approval applications,
and premarket notification submissions (510(k) submissions) for devices; and license applications and supplements
for biological products. The Supreme Court has upheld the authority of the Commissioner of Food and Drugs to issue
regulations to ensure the reliability of clinical study results, including requirements to minimize bias. (See

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In recent years, the academic and scientific communities have turned their attention to the general issue of conflict
of interest on research. One issue that has received particular attention has been the potential for the financial
interests of investigators to bias the results of studies. There has been much discussion of the importance of protecting
study outcomes from potential bias resulting from investigator interests in the area of applied research, such as
research that supports the marketing applications for human medical products. This concern is shared by the PHS and
NSF, both of which are currently developing regulations and policies regarding financial disclosure by clinical
investigators and by FDA. FDA believes that it is important to the public health to ensure that the data submitted to
the agency in support of marketing applications are free of the effects of such bias as much as possible. The agency
has concluded that this regulation requiring certification and disclosure of certain financial information of
clinical investigators is necessary to enable FDA to approve human medical products on the basis of valid, reliable,
and unbiased data. FDA believes that the regulation is fully authorized under sections 505, 510(k), 513, 515, 519,
520(g), 522, and 701(a) of the act, and by section 351 of the Public Health Service Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing these reporting requirements because the information received will enable the agency to determine
the reliability of data submitted in marketing applications more effectively. More effective review of products
proposed for marketing provides greater protection to the public health, and therefore results in improved implementation
of the act. FDA believes that it is essential to be able to inspect the underlying documents forming the basis of a sponsor's
certification or disclosure statement. Access to these records is consistent with the agency's overall statutory
authority to ensure the safety and effectiveness of drugs, biological product, and devices. FDA's authority to require
maintenance of records and to provide for agency access to these records was upheld in

IV. Alternatives Considered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA considered several approaches to handling the issue of potential bias of research data resulting from the financial
interests of clinical investigators before deciding to adopt the certification and disclosure procedures described
in this document. Two other obvious possibilities would be the prohibition of certain financial interests by the
agency, e.g., compensation in the form of equity in the firm, and divestiture by the investigator of a prohibited interest.
FDA believes that prohibition and divestiture of financial interests might have a disproportionate and unduly severe
effect on certain industries in which an individual who has the closest financial ties, e.g., the inventor of a device
being tested, is often involved as an investigator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In other situations, such as small start up biotechnology firms, payments to clinical investigators are sometimes
made in the form of equity interests, such as stock options, because these firms have limited capital. These industries
rely heavily on such arrangements because they are young and not well capitalized and yet are highly creative and produce
many novel products. In addition, the agency believes that the proposed approach is more appropriate in light of the
fact that a number of Federal programs have been created in recent years specifically to encourage partnerships between
industry, academia, and Government in the belief that such relationships result in important innovation. Examples
of such programs include the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96&hyph;480), which encourages
technological transfer, particularly through collaboration between industry and the academic community. The
Patent and Trademark Act Amendments of 1980 (Pub. L. 96&hyph;517) allow universities and other funding recipients
to apply for patents developed with Federal funding (rather than awarding such rights to the Government), and expressly
promote collaboration between commercial concerns and nonprofit organizations. The Economic Recovery Tax Act
of 1981 (Pub. L. 97&hyph;34) is aimed at fostering research and development by small companies and associated university
partners. The Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99&hyph;502), which amended Pub. L. 96&hyph;480,
and Executive Order 12592, provide similar patent and licensing authority to Federal laboratories and encourage
them to participate in cooperative research and development agreements with the private sector and nonprofit organizations.

1In calculating this burden respondents are assumed to be sponsors of marketing applications. On average, 20 sponsors
submit marketing applications for biologics each year, 246 submit applications for drugs, and 125 submit applications
for devices. Responses are broken down into the number of investigators certifying and disclosing for each sponsor's
application. The average number of clinical investigators conducting studies related to a marketing application
for a biologic is 11; for a drug, 120; and for a device, 10. It is estimated that the sponsor for a marketing application
for a biologic will submit certification statements for 10 investigators and a disclosure statement for 1. It is estimated
that a drug sponsor will submit certification statements for 115 and disclosure statements for 5. It is estimated
that a device sponsor will submit certification statements for 8 investigators and disclosure statements for 2.
Finally, it is estimated that .5 hours (30 minutes) will be required per submission. In the absence of a firm basis for
estimating the frequency of either certification or disclosure, the agency is using the conservative estimate of
.5 hours per response, although it is estimated that .25 hours (15 minutes) will be required for the preparation and
submission of a certification statement and .5 hours (30 minutes) will be required for the preparation and submission
of a disclosure statement.

1In calculating this burden, recordkeepers are assumed to be sponsors. It is assumed that each sponsor will submit
one application. The hours per recordkeeper are arrived at by multiplying the average number of clinical investigators
involved in each sponsor's submitted application (11 for biologics, 120 for drugs, and 10 for devices) by the time
estimated for filing the financial information received from each investigator, which is .5 hours. This is considered
to be a one-time burden and one that would not be repeated on an annual basis.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
As required by section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, FDA is submitting a copy of this proposed rule
to OMB for its review of these information collection requirements. Other organizations and individuals desiring
to submit comments regarding this burden estimate or any aspect of these information collection requirements, including
suggestions for reducing the burden, should direct them to FDA's Dockets Management Branch (address above) and to
the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, rm. 3208, New Executive Office Bldg., Washington, DC 20503,

VI. Environmental Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(a)(8) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 -->
VII. Economic Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
FDA has examined the impacts of the proposed rule under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub.
L. 96&hyph;354). Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory
alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including
potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and
equity). The agency believes that this proposed rule is consistent with the regulatory philosophy and principles
identified in the Executive Order. In addition, the proposed rule is consistent on essential points with actions
proposed by other agencies of which FDA is aware. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to analyze regulatory options that would minimize any significant
impact of a rule on small entities. This rule will create costs in three areas: reporting, recordkeeping, and research.
The reporting and recordkeeping burdens, which are fully described in section V. of this document, are the minimum
necessary to achieve the goals of this proposed regulation. Research costs will amount to costs incurred by sponsors
in validating data that is potentially compromised and are difficult to estimate because these situations can be
expected to vary and will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. FDA will encourage sponsors to consult with agency
staff on management of potentially problematic situations early on so that verifying the reliability of the data
will be less burdensome. FDA has not proposed to prohibit certain financial interests, such as compensation to investigators
in the form of equity in the sponsor's firm, nor is the agency proposing to require divestiture by the investigator
of any financial interest, because such provisions could impact significantly on certain small entities and hinder
their ability to bring innovative products to market. For these reasons, the agency certifies that the proposed rule
will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, under the Regulatory
Flexibility Act, no further analysis is required.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 -->
A. Amendments to Regulations for Human Drug Products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
While the proposed rule would not require sponsors to submit certification and disclosure statements until they
submit a marketing application, FDA believes that sponsors should acquire financial information from investigators
before starting clinical investigations. Consequently, FDA is proposing to amend &sect;312.53(c), the regulation
governing the selection of investigators, to require sponsors to obtain financial information from clinical investigators.
The agency believes that early acquisition of financial information by sponsors would be prudent to enable sponsors
to discover any possible bias by the investigator that might affect the conduct of the clinical investigation before
the investigation begins. Additionally, this would permit sponsors to consult FDA regarding potential bias before
the sponsor and the agency have devoted resources to the clinical investigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment to &sect;312.57 would require sponsors to maintain records on compensation agreements and
all other financial interests of investigators and investigators' immediate families as described in part 54. The
agency notes that such information would be required to be made available for inspection under existing regulations.
The proposed amendment to &sect;312.64 would require clinical investigators to provide sponsors with sufficient
accurate information to allow the sponsor to submit complete and accurate certification or disclosure statements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is proposing to amend &sect;&sect;314.50 and 314.60 (21 CFR 314.50 and 314.60) to require that all new drug
applications, amendments to applications, and supplements that contain new data from a previously unreported study
include a certification or disclosure statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to amend &sect;314.94 to require certification or disclosure statements in abbreviated new drug
applications. While section 505(j)(2)(A) of the act does not specifically mention certification or disclosure
statements, section 505(j)(2)(A)(iv) of the act authorizes the agency to require ``information to show that the
new drug is bioequivalent to the listed drug.'' Thus, the proposed requirement would allow FDA to better judge the
reliability of bioequivalence data, and is within the scope of section 505(j)(2)(A)(iv) of the act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Under this proposal, the agency would refuse to file any application or abbreviated antibiotic application, and
refuse to receive any abbreviated new drug application that does not contain a certification or disclosure statement.
Current regulations allow FDA to refuse to file or receive incomplete applications. Proposed amendments to &sect;&sect;314.50
and 314.94 would require certification or disclosure to accompany applications and abbreviated applications,
therefore, any application or abbreviated application not containing a certification or disclosure statement
would be incomplete and would not be filed or received. If FDA refuses to file or receive an application or abbreviated
application, FDA will not review the application because the agency has determined that the application is not sufficiently
complete to allow substantive review. FDA is proposing to amend &sect;314.60 to allow the agency to refuse to accept
amendments that contain clinical data without a certification or disclosure statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency would amend &sect;&sect;314.200 and 314.300 to require any person who submits clinical data as part of
the hearing process for refusals to approve and for withdrawals of approvals for NDA's, abbreviated antibiotic drug
applications (AADA's), or abbreviated new drug applications (ANDA's) or the hearing process for issuing, amending,
and withdrawing antibiotic regulations to submit a certification or disclosure statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed amendments to &sect;320.36 (21 CFR 320.36) would require similar reporting and recordkeeping for certification
and disclosure statements accompanying bioequivalence studies as would be required under part 312. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed amendments to &sect;330.10 (21 CFR 330.10) would require certification or disclosure statements to accompany
clinical data submitted as a part of the over-the-counter (OTC) monograph process. FDA believes that the clinical
data submitted for OTC drug products are no less important than data submitted as part of the NDA or ANDA processes and
should be treated similarly. In the case of OTC monographs, because all data are publicly available, this disclosure
should also be part of the public record even if it is not made public for NDA's and ANDA's.

B. Amendments to Regulations for Biologicals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
FDA is proposing to amend the regulations at &sect;601.2(a) (21 CFR 601.2(a)) governing the filing of applications
for product licenses by adding a sentence to require the inclusion of a financial certification or disclosure statement
as follows: ``The applicant shall also include a financial certification or disclosure statement as required by
part 54 of this chapter.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 -->
C. Amendments to Regulations for Medical Devices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The agency realizes that not all 510(k) premarket notification submissions contain clinical data. Because current
regulations do not authorize FDA to require certification or disclosure statements, the agency proposes to specifically
require such statements by adding a new paragraph to &sect;807.87 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(21 CFR 807.87). After review of a 510(k), FDA does not ``file the application'' but has other options, depending upon
the information contained in the submission. Therefore, the agency proposes to withhold the decision on the 510(k)
submission until a certification or disclosure statement is submitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency recognizes that the historical file relating to a device may be retained in more than one location. FDA believes
however, that a copy of the certification or disclosure statement should be accessible pursuant to &sect;807.31
(21 CFR 807.31) and proposes to amend the regulation to accommodate accessibility. A proposed amendment to &sect;812.110
would require clinical investigators to provide to sponsors sufficient accurate financial information to allow
sponsors to submit complete and accurate certification or disclosure statements. Therefore, FDA is also proposing
to amend &sect;814.20 to require sponsors to include in premarket approval applications a financial certification
or disclosure statement as required by part 54, and to amend &sect;814.42 (21 CFR 814.42) to allow the agency to refuse
to file an application or amendments that contain clinical data without a certification or disclosure statement.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because supporting data are needed in a reclassification petition to satisfy the requirements of a determination
of safety and effectiveness of a device, FDA is proposing to amend 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;860.123 to require any sponsor who submits clinical data as part of a reclassification petition to include
a certification or disclosure statement.

Purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) evaluates clinical studies submitted in marketing applications as required
by law for new human drugs and biological products and marketing applications and reclassification petitions for
medical devices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The agency reviews data generated in these clinical studies to determine whether the applications are approvable
under the statutory requirements. FDA may consider clinical studies inadequate and the data inadequate if, among
other things, appropriate steps have not been taken in the design, conduct, reporting, and analysis of the studies
to minimize bias. One potential source of bias in clinical studies is a financial interest of the clinical investigator
in the outcome of the study, either because the amount of compensation the investigator receives may be influenced
by the outcome of the study, or because the investigator has a financial interest in the product under study or in the
sponsor of the marketing application. This section and conforming regulations require the sponsor of a marketing
application that relies in part on clinical data to disclose certain financial arrangements between the sponsor
and its clinical investigators and certain interests of the clinical investigators in the product or in the sponsor.
FDA will use this information, in conjunction with information about the design and purpose of the study, as well as
information obtained through on-site inspections, in the agency's assessment of the reliability of the data.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Compensation affected by the outcome of clinical studies 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
means compensation that could be higher for a favorable outcome than for an unfavorable outcome, such as compensation
explicitly greater in the event of a favorable result, or compensation to the investigator in the form of an equity
interest in the sponsor's company or in the form of compensation tied to sales of the product, such as a royalty interest.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Significant equity interest in the applicant means 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
any ownership interest, stock options, or other financial interest whose value cannot be readily determined through
reference to public prices, or any equity interest in a publicly traded corporation that exceeds 5 percent of total
equity.

in a marketing application subject to this part, that either: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The sponsor identifies as one that the sponsor relies on to establish that the product meets the regulatory requirements
for marketing, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) FDA identifies as one that it intends to rely on to support its decision to permit the marketing of the product. Studies
submitted as publications or in brief summary form will generally not be considered ``covered clinical studies''
unless FDA informs the sponsor otherwise. A sponsor may consult with FDA as to which clinical studies constitute ``covered
clinical studies'' for purposes of complying with financial disclosure requirements.

concerning the financial interests of a clinical investigator who is not a full-time employee of the sponsor, and
the investigator's spouse and dependent children for each covered clinical study. The clinical investigator must
provide the sponsor with sufficient accurate information to make the required disclosure or certification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The sponsor of an application submitted under sections 505, 506, 507, 510(k), 513, or 515 of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act, or section 351 of the Public Health Service Act that relies in part on clinical studies shall submit,

 For any application containing a covered clinical study for which the sponsor does not submit the certification described
in &sect;54.4(a)(1), the application shall contain a statement disclosing, completely and accurately, the following
information: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Any financial arrangement entered into between the applicant and any clinical investigator involved in the conduct

Evaluation of disclosure statement.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 FDA will evaluate the information disclosed under &sect;54.4(a)(2) about each covered clinical study in an application
to determine the impact of any disclosed financial interests on the reliability of the study. FDA may consider both
the size and nature of a disclosed financial interest (including the potential increase in the value of the interest
if the product is approved) and steps that have been taken to minimize the potential for bias.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Effect of study design. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In assessing the potential of an investigator's financial interests to bias a study, FDA will take into account the
design and purpose of the study. Study designs that utilize multiple investigators (most of whom do not have a disclosable
interest), blinding, objective endpoints, or measurement of endpoints by someone other than the investigator may
adequately protect against any bias created by a disclosable financial interest.
