The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) proposes to revise its regulations to consolidate excepted service authorities
for filling temporary, intermittent, and seasonal jobs, to remove coverage for appointments that no longer meet
the criteria for exception, and to establish a new excepted service authority which could be used by agencies to meet
urgent, short-term hiring needs.

supplementary information:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal is the second step in OPM's program to simplify temporary hiring authorities and ensure their appropriate
use. Regulations were proposed on February 1, 1994, (59 FR 4601) to set a uniform service limit for temporary appointments
in both the competitive and the excepted service at 1 year with no more than one 1-year extension. The regulations now
proposed would revise and consolidate paragraphs (i) and (m) of &sect;213.3102, which both cover temporary, intermittent,
and seasonal employment in the excepted service. The revision would eliminate overlapping and obsolete appointing
authorities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In July 1993, OPM advised all agencies that use Schedule A authorities which were established specifically for temporary
or seasonal employment that, if they wished to retain the authorities, they would need to justify why examining for
the positions is impracticable. Our intent was to identify the situations where excepted service hiring is appropriate
and to replace individual agencies' authorities with a Governmentwide authority that could be used by any agency
in those situations. However, agencies reported only one situation that would have general applicability and one
that may have general applicability. The rest are so agency-specific that creation of a Governmentwide authority
would serve no practical purpose.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Temporary and less-than-full-time hiring in remote locations. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several agencies need to hire short-term or supplemental staff, often on short notice, in locations that are remote
or isolated from a population center. Examining for these jobs is impracticable when: Only residents of the immediate
area can be expected to reach the work site whenever they are needed; the amount of employment involved would not encourage
outside applicants to move to the isolated area; and staff from an OPM or agency examining office could not readily
reach the location to administer tests or conduct recruiting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We propose to establish a Schedule A authority that would define ``remote/isolated location'' and would limit excepted
employment to 1,040 working hours in a service year. Any agency could use the authority, without prior OPM approval,
for jobs that meet the conditions set out in the regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Urgent, short-term hiring needs. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OPM is abolishing the Federal Personnel Manual (FPM), as recommended by the National Performance Review. OPM has
granted certain authorities to agencies through the FPM that are not specifically reflected in regulations. One
of those authorities (set out in section 2&hyph;9 of FPM Chapter 316) allows agencies to make temporary appointments
not to exceed 30 days and to extend those appointments for no more than 30 additional days without regard to normal appointment
procedures. Unless that authority is incorporated in a regulation, it will be lost when FPM Chapter 316 is abolished
in December 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe the special need authority serves a valid purpose and should be continued as an excepted service appointing
authority. (Competitive requirements have never applied to special need appointments.) Service limits and conditions
for use of the current special need authority would remain the same. The new Schedule A authority would be available
for use by any agency without prior OPM approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fellowships and related programs. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Three agencies suggested creation of a Governmentwide authority covering post-doctoral fellowships, internships,
and similar programs designed to increase the pool of candidates in a particular specialty for all employers, not
just the Federal Government. On May 13, 1994, we published proposed regulations that would create a consolidated
authority for employment of students. However, several agencies have internship or fellowship programs that provide
professional experience to individuals who have completed their formal education.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We agree that a consolidated authority for those appointments would be appropriate. We expect to consider consolidation
of most Schedule A and B appointing authorities_not only those covering temporary hiring_and may propose creation
of a fellowship authority. In the meantime, however, we are not sure that such an authority should be restricted to
temporary employment. Many appointments under existing programs are made for periods longer than 1 year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, we have not included a specific provision for internship or fellowship appointments in the proposed
authority for temporary Schedule A appointments. We welcome your comments on this issue, however, and will add such
a provision if there is sufficient interest. If there is not enough interest to justify a Governmentwide authority,
we would entertain requests for single-agency exceptions from agencies wishing to establish temporary fellowship
programs.

Other positions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several agencies reported specific situations in which competitive hiring procedures would not be appropriate
or effective. However, because each of these situations is unique to the agency involved, issuance of Governmentwide
Schedule A authorities would serve no practical purpose. Therefore, the proposed regulation would provide for exception
of additional positions with prior OPM approval.

(i) Temporary and less-than-full-time positions, as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Positions in remote/isolated locations where examination is impracticable. A remote/isolated location is
outside the local commuting area of a population center from which an employee can reasonably be expected to travel
on short notice under adverse weather and/or road conditions which are normal for the area. For this purpose, a population
center is a town with housing, schools, health care, stores and other businesses in which the servicing examining
office can schedule tests and/or reasonably expect to attract applicants. An individual appointed under this authority
may not be employed in the same agency under a combination of this and any other appointment for more than 1,040 working
hours in a service year. Temporary appointments under this authority may be extended in 1-year increments, with no
limit on the number of such extensions, as an exception to the service limits in &sect;213.104.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Positions for which a critical hiring need exists. This includes both short-term positions and continuing positions
that an agency must fill on an interim basis pending completion of competitive examining, clearances, or other procedures
required for a longer appointment. Appointments under this authority may not exceed 30 days and may be extended for
up to an additional 30 days if continued employment is essential to the agency's operations. The appointments may
not be used to extend the service limit of any other appointing authority. An agency may not employ the same individual
under this authority for more than 60 days in any 12-month period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In order to increase the opportunity for public participation in the development of policies relating to the reform
of Federal student aid for postsecondary education and training, the Assistant Secretary is convening a series of
meetings in different parts of the country and invites individuals and representatives of groups involved in student
financial assistance programs to attend these meetings. The Secretary particularly encourages students, legal
assistance organizations that represent students, institutions of higher education, guaranty agencies and lenders
to attend and participate in these meetings. These regional meetings are convened to discuss only reform of Federal
student aid programs for postsecondary education and training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To facilitate discussion, the Assistant Secretary has identified three major areas for discussion: (a) Can Federal
student aid be better targeted to ensure access to postsecondary education? (b) Can postsecondary vocational education
and training better meet the needs and objectives of students and institutions? (c) Can regulatory and administrative
simplicity help institutions better fulfill their educational missions and target their resources on educational
rather than administrative tasks? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
More specifically, the Assistant Secretary seeks comments, ideas, and suggestions on the following issues: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Would providing a larger amount of aid to poor students improve access and encourage persistence in postsecondary
education? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Would establishing a guaranteed amount of Federal aid that would be available to every individual promote better
awareness of and access to postsecondary education? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Would a merit-based supplement to need-based aid encourage students to excel academically and better position
them to reap the rewards of postsecondary education? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) How can the Department of Education better interact with the States and other Federal agencies to improve access
to and excellence in postsecondary education? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) What strategies for skills training and workforce preparation are most effective? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) How should the Federal government support basic education for disadvantaged adults? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Should there be separate student aid programs for vocational study compared with collegiate programs? How would
a vocational program be defined? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) What is the best way to coordinate among various local, State, and Federal programs that offer vocational education?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Would different rules and regulations for different groups of institutions assist in providing institutions
the flexibility to accomplish their educational mission? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) How could administrative workload be reduced while maintaining or improving accountability to taxpayers? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(k) What information is essential to collect from institutions and students to ensure accountability and integrity
of programs, while reducing the overall reporting burden? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(l) What performance measures should the Department use as a measure of institutional ability to reduce the regulatory
burden of administering the student aid programs? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Participants are welcome to raise other issues relating to Federal student aid programs in addition to the above questions.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a notice of data availability and request for comments on three reports that it is considering in developing the final
Guidance. The three reports made available in the August 30, 1994, notice are: ``Results of Simulation Tests Concerning
the Percent Dissolved Metal in Freshwater Toxicity Tests''; ``1991&hyph;1992 Michigan Sport Anglers Fish Consumption
Study''; and ``Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative Technical Support Document for the Procedure to Determine Bioaccumulation
Factors, July 1994.'' EPA wants to ensure that the public has adequate opportunity to comment on whether any of the
recommendations in these reports should be adopted in developing the final Great Lakes Water Quality Guidance.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 EPA announced the availability of three reports in the August 30, 1994, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 44678). The three reports are: ``Results of Simulation Tests Concerning the Percent Dissolved Metal in Freshwater
Toxicity Tests''; ``1991&hyph;1992 Michigan Sport Anglers Fish Consumption Study''; and ``Great Lakes Water Quality
Initiative Technical Support Document for the Procedure to Determine Bioaccumulation Factors, July 1994,'' have
been placed in the administrative record for the Great Lakes Guidance because EPA is considering information in these
documents as it finalizes the Great Lakes Guidance. A summary of the information provided in these three reports and
the issues relevant to the Great Lakes Guidance are discussed in the August 30, 1994, notice. Readers are referred
to that notice for additional details. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this notice, EPA is extending the public comment period for the three reports to October 14, 1994, to provide additional
time for public review and comment. EPA believes that extension of the comment period for this limited purpose is appropriate
because of the complexity of the issues raised in the three reports announced on August 30, 1994.

A. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) issued Policy Letter 91&hyph;1, Governmentwide Small Business
and Small Disadvantaged Business Goals for Procurement Contracts, which requires agencies to report the number
and dollar value of subcontracts awarded to small business concerns, small disadvantaged business concerns and
women-owned small businesses. Currently, the SF 295, Summary Subcontract Report, which is used to compile agency-wide
data for subcontracting programs, collects dollar value of subcontracts awarded but does not collect the number
of subcontracts awarded.

B. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within
the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
because small businesses are exempt from the requirement to submit the report form. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility
Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will
also be considered in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and cite 5

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This notice follows NHTSA's partial granting of a petition filed by Michael Robinson, Director, Michigan Department
of State Police. The petitioner suggested making mandatory the standardized display of a permanent metal vehicle
manufacturer's label for all motor vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating of over 4,536 kilograms (kg) (10,000
pounds (lb)). The petitioner suggested that the label be fabricated of a minimum gauge metal with raised or recessed
letters and numbers, be riveted to the vehicle body at specified standard locations and, in the case of trailers, be
given reasonable protection from damage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency proposes to amend its vehicle certification regulation to require the standardized display of a permanent
metal vehicle manufacturer's label for all motor vehicles with a GVWR greater than 4,536 kg (10,000 lb). The label
would contain the same information as currently required, with either raised or recessed letters, and be riveted
or otherwise permanently secured to the vehicle at specified locations. The petitioner's suggestions that the label
be constructed of a specified heavy gauge metal and that the label on trailers be given special protection are denied.

Part 567, Certification, sets forth the agency's requirements for the content and location of the label certifying
the compliance of a motor vehicle with the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. The regulation requires manufacturers
of motor vehicles, except vehicles manufactured in two or more stages, to affix a label to each vehicle they produce
containing the information relating to that vehicle required by &sect;567.4(g). The labels are not required to be
made out of any particular type of material but, unless riveted, must be permanently affixed so that they cannot be
removed without destroying or defacing them.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For motor vehicles other than trailers and motorcycles, the label shall be affixed either to the hinge pillar, door-latch
post, or the door edge that meets the door-latch post next to the driver's seating position. If those locations are
not practicable, the label may be placed on the left side of the instrument panel or if that is not practicable, the inward-facing
surface of the door next to the driver's seating position. If none of the above locations are practicable, the manufacturer
must notify NHTSA of that fact and, with appropriate drawings or photographs, suggest an alternative location. Such
suggestion must be submitted for approval to the Administrator, NHTSA. Whatever its location, the label must be easily
readable without moving any part of the vehicle except the outer door, and the lettering on the label must be of a color
that contrasts with the label's background. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Trailer labels must be located on the left forward half of the vehicle. Labels on motorcycles must be affixed to a permanent
member of the vehicle and as close as possible to the intersection of the steering post with the handle bars. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
49 CFR 567.5 prescribes the labeling requirements for vehicles manufactured in two or more stages. Section 567.5(a)
requires chassis-cab manufacturers to affix a label in the form and location specified in &sect;567.4 to each chassis-cab
manufactured by them. Section 567.5(b) requires intermediate-stage manufacturers to affix a label in the form and
location specified in &sect;567.4 to each chassis-cab to which they are required to furnish an addendum to the incomplete
vehicle document prescribed in &sect;568.4, if such chassis-cab has been certified by its manufacturer in accordance
with &sect;567.5(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, &sect;567.5(c) requires final-stage manufacturers to affix a label of the type and in the manner and form
specified in &sect;567.4 to each vehicle, containing the information specified in that section relating to that
vehicle.

II. The Petition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Michael Robinson, Director of the Michigan Department of State Police, petitioned the agency to amend &sect;567.4
to require that manufacturers' labels on vehicles weighing more than 4,536 kg (10,000 lb) be made of a heavy gauge metal
of a specified thickness with raised or recessed letters and numbers and be riveted to the vehicle. He further suggested
that the labels be located on the door latch post near the driver's seating position. If that is not practicable, then
he wanted the label to be placed on a permanent vertical section of the cab's floor area to the left of the driver's seating
position and which would be immediately visible with the driver's side door open. If that location is still not practicable,
he wanted the label to be affixed to the portion of the instrument panel to the left of the steering wheel. He suggested
that the label for a bus be affixed, if practicable, to the ceiling area above the windshield or windows in the driver's
seating area. If none of the suggested locations are practicable, then the manufacturer must notify NHTSA as currently
required by &sect;567.4(c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Robinson stated that he submitted his petition because the Motor Carrier Division of his Department has identified
a significant problem in locating information on the gross vehicle weight ratings (GVWR) and vehicle identification
numbers (VIN) of commercial vehicles. He asserted that there are currently no Federal standards requiring labels
of standard size, thickness, or format displaying either the GVWR or the VIN on commercial vehicles. Under current
requirements, the label containing that information may be located in any one of several different places and in one
of several different formats, including decals, adhesive labels, and riveted metal plates. Mr. Robinson alluded
to the current requirement that each vehicle have a label showing the GVWR and VIN affixed when the vehicle is manufactured,
but stated that there is no Federal requirement that the label remain affixed thereafter. Thus, the labels on many
vehicles either fall off or are otherwise removed or obliterated after manufacture, usually by accident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Robinson stated that prior to the inception of the Commercial Driver License (CDL) requirements, the GVWR was
not normally used by law enforcement officers. Now, however, it is very important for officers to be able to determine
the GVWR of commercial vehicles. Under the CDL program, drivers are licensed to operate only those vehicles within
the GVWR ranges of vehicles for which the drivers have met the qualifications. Law enforcement officers often have
difficulty determining the GVWRs of commercial vehicles because the labels on those vehicles are often damaged,
painted over or removed, usually accidently, during the life of the vehicle. The reason for the absence of the GVWRs
is that many labels are not designed or constructed to hold up under the rigors of commercial vehicle operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner asserted that the manufacturer's label is a prime source of the VIN and the only means that law enforcement
officers have to determine the GVWR of a given vehicle. Without the GVWR, police officers who are unfamiliar with commercial
vehicle operation are unable to determine the CDL GVWR range into which a particular vehicle falls. In such a case,
officers cannot determine the correct enforcement action. As a result, drivers may be allowed to continue operating
vehicles which they are not qualified to operate. Thus, with more certain access to VIN and GVWR information, police
officers could more readily inspect and investigate commercial vehicles during routine traffic stops. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Robinson further stated that a review of reports about truck and bus accidents over the several months prior to
submission of the petition revealed a large number of discrepancies in entries in the reports regarding the GVWR,
presumably stemming from the investigating officers' inability to locate or read the vehicle label. He argued that
this difficulty results in collection of erroneous data which is then submitted to the SAFETYNET data management
system established and maintained by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). The SAFETYNET system is a cooperative
effort to share commercial vehicle data electronically between the FHWA and the various states. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On another point, Mr. Robinson stated that as of July, 1991, the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) estimated
that approximately 10,494 commercial trucks and 18,865 commercial-type trailers were classified as unrecovered
stolen vehicles in the United States. He argued that identification and recovery of those vehicles is greatly hampered
by the lack of uniform display of VINs on commercial vehicles. He believed that if a more standardized and permanent
manufacturer's label were used on commercial vehicles, law enforcement personnel could more easily and reliably
inspect and identify commercial vehicles and could possibly locate and recover many more of such vehicles.

III. Analysis of the Petition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although NHTSA has no independent information indicating a problem in determining the GVWR of commercial vehicles
in use or, if there is such a problem, its magnitude, the agency nevertheless has no reason to doubt Mr. Robinson's assertions.
Further, if the problem exists in Michigan, it is reasonable to assume that it exists in other states.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The apparent existence of this problem concerns the agency. For example, the Surface Transportation Assistance
Act of 1982, 49 U.S.C. App. at section 2302, authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to provide grants to states
for enforcement programs applicable to commercial motor vehicle safety. Pursuant to that authority, the Federal
Highway Administration (FHWA) established the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program (MCSAP) (49 CFR 350). MCSAP
provides grants to states to support a national motor carrier safety enforcement program. The program is designed
to reduce the number and severity of accidents and hazardous materials incidents of commercial motor vehicles by
substantially increasing the level and effectiveness of enforcement activity and the likelihood that safety defects,
driver deficiencies, and unsafe carrier practices will be detected and corrected. The increasing Federal and state
involvement in that program has led to a corresponding increase in the number of functions common to both Federal and
state officers. This increase has, in turn, led to an increasing need for efficient communications and exchange of
accurate data. SAFETYNET, therefore, has become even more important to this effort by combining all functions into
a single user-friendly data-sharing system for the use of both Federal and state personnel involved in commercial
motor carrier operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A typical SAFETYNET profile consists, among other things, of the type of operation, GVWR, cargo, any accident data,
inspection data including any violations and out-of-service actions, work performance reports, and data entry
verification. Thus, if law enforcement officers are collecting incomplete or incorrect data because of lack of GVWR
information, as Mr. Robinson asserts, the effectiveness of the SAFETYNET system could be compromised. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency agrees that, assuming the accuracy of the petitioner's figures relating to stolen vehicles, a permanent
metal label could assist in the identification and recovery of at least some of the great number of unrecovered stolen
commercial vehicles in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FHWA has informed NHTSA that it supports the suggestions in Mr. Robinson's petition, believing that a permanent metal
label will help enforce Federal as well as state motor carrier safety regulations. While the petitioner's primary
focus seems to be enforcement of CDL requirements, FHWA believes that the importance of this rulemaking is broader
in scope than that. The gross vehicle weight rating (or gross combination weight rating (GCWR) for a combination vehicle)
is one of three independent criteria used to determine the applicability of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations
(FMCSR) for vehicles and drivers engaged in interstate commerce. The FMCSRs cover driver qualifications, hours
of service, accident record keeping, vehicle inspection, repair and maintenance, controlled substances and alcohol
testing, in addition to the CDL. The GVWR/GCWR weight threshold for the general applicability of the FMCSRs is 10,001
pounds. The recently published final rules on controlled substances and alcohol testing apply to every person who
operates a commercial vehicle in interstate or intrastate commerce, and is subject to the CDL requirements of 49 CFR
383. Part 383 includes a 26,001 pound threshold as one if its applicability criteria. The FHWA believes, therefore,
that implementing the suggestions in this petition will help motor carriers in identifying vehicles and drivers
that are subject to the FMCSRs and Federal and state officials responsible for enforcing the regulations. The permanent
metal labels should provide more comprehensive enforcement of such regulations by making possible better identification
of the vehicles concerned. FHWA also expressed support for the petitioner's suggestion that the labels on trailers
be given reasonable protection since trailer labels are particularly susceptible to damage during commercial vehicle
operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Robinson suggested that the thickness of the metal label be specified. NHTSA does not believe that is necessary,
at least not at this time. NHTSA tentatively concludes that the primary benefit is to be obtained from specifying the
use of a metal label. The agency has no information indicating that specifying a particular minimum thickness would
increase that benefit significantly. NHTSA understands the petitioner's reasoning that a label of a specified heavy
gauge would be more durable and more likely to survive the rigors of commercial operation. On the other hand, the agency
also believes that manufacturers must have the flexibility to accommodate the thickness of the labels to the door
designs of the various vehicles they produce. NHTSA is confident that manufacturers will affix labels whose sturdiness
is consistent with the designs of their vehicles. If, in the future, information obtained from actual commercial
vehicle experience indicates that it might be appropriate to specify a minimum thickness, appropriate rulemaking
action can be taken at that time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency questions whether the petitioner's four suggested permissible locations for the labels on vehicles other
than trailers are too limited as compared to the five permissible locations currently allowed. In addition, the petitioner
suggested the floor area as a permissible location for the label. The agency is concerned that locating the label on
the vehicle floor or even on the instrument panel could place the inspecting officer in an awkward position, perhaps
even in jeopardy, by having to lean into the cab of the truck and turn his or her head to read the label. Further, the possibly
limited ambient light on the vehicle floor could make it difficult for an inspector to read a label there. On the other
hand, inspecting officers routinely stand on the running boards of trucks to check inside for the driver's log, labels,
as well as for drugs and/or alcohol. Thus, a label on the floor or the instrument panel could normally be seen by the inspector
from the running board.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The petitioner also suggested locating the label for buses inside the vehicle and above the driver's side windshield
or window. NHTSA has no objection to that. The agency's purpose in specifying the locations for the manufacturer's
certification label was to provide an unobstructed view of the label, i.e., to ensure that the labels are easy to see
and read in any vehicle. Since it is not practicable to inspect buses with passengers on board, buses are usually mounted
on hoists or platforms for inspection either at the beginning or at the end of their runs. Therefore, the inspectors
usually walk through buses during their inspections, making the label easily visible to the inspector if it is mounted
on or above the driver's side windshield or window as the petitioner suggested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA recognizes the merit in the petitioner's suggestion that the location of the label should be standardized in
only a limited number of places so that there would be greater predictability about precisely where law enforcement
personnel can expect to find the label. Nevertheless, NHTSA solicits comments on whether the permissible locations
of the permanent metal label, including those on buses, should be standardized as proposed by the petitioner, or whether
the larger number of permissible locations should be maintained as currently allowed. NHTSA further solicits comments
on the locations in which labels should be permitted, if not in the currently-permitted locations or in the locations
suggested by the petitioner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, Mr. Robinson suggested that the labels for trailers be located so as to provide reasonable protection from
damage. NHTSA does not believe that this change is necessary at this time. NHTSA believes that specifying a permanent
metal label with either raised or recessed letters and numbers, riveted or otherwise permanently affixed to the vehicle,
would sufficiently enhance the durability of the label on trailers to make the data readable even after many years
of use. Again, should actual experience in the future indicate that further action is appropriate to protect trailer
labels, rulemaking can be initiated at that time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA made a preliminary cost analysis of the proposed requirements. The analysis suggests that the incremental
cost range of metal labels as proposed would be between $0.25 and $2.50 per label, depending on size, thickness, and
quantity ordered. NHTSA estimates that for those manufacturers that purchase labels in large quantities, the incremental
cost could range between $0.25 and $0.75. For those manufacturers that would purchase labels in smaller quantities,
the cost range could be between $2.00 and $2.50 per label. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Label manufacturers typically put only certain information on labels. The vehicle manufacturer then applies the
remainder of the required information at the plant, such as the GVWR, GAWR, VIN, etc. Thus, if letters and numbers are
raised or recessed, vehicle manufacturers, as well as possibly some label manufacturers, may have to purchase the
equipment to emboss the metal labels at a cost of between $300 and $1,500. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency data shows that 263,580 motor vehicles with GVWR greater than 4,536 kg (10,000 lb) and 126,904 trailers were
sold in 1992. Another 35,444 school buses, which would also be included in the vehicles covered by this notice, were
sold in 1991, bringing the combined total affected vehicles to approximately 425,928. The agency has no data on how
many vehicles, if any, already meet the proposed requirements. Assuming that none do, the agency calculates that
the total range of incremental annual costs of this proposal would be $106,482 to $1,064,810.

V. Agency Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the assertions by Mr. Robinson in his petition and the analysis discussed above, NHTSA proposes to amend 49
CFR 567.4 to require that, for vehicles with GVWR greater than 4,536 kg (10,000 lb), the manufacturer's certification
label required by that part be made of metal. The agency also proposes that the letters and numbers on the label be raised
or recessed, and that the label be riveted or otherwise permanently affixed to each vehicle in the locations suggested
by the petitioner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency believes that by requiring permanent metal labels, commercial vehicle safety would be enhanced by ensuring
that commercial vehicles are being driven by drivers who are duly qualified and licensed to operate them. This would
have the effect of identifying and removing unfit and unqualified drivers from the nation's highways, thereby enhancing
the safety of the motoring public. In addition, a permanent metal label on which the GVWR and VIN remain legible throughout
all or the greater part of the service life of a commercial vehicle would help to ensure that the information supplied
to the SAFETYNET system would be more accurate, thus contributing directly to the enforcement efforts discussed
above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, to reflect rulemaking conducted by the agency pursuant to the Imported Vehicles Safety Compliance Act of
1988, Pub. L. 100&hyph;562, 102 Stat. 2818 (49 U.S.C. 30141, 30146), NHTSA proposes to amend existing &sect;567.4(k)
to substitute ``49 CFR 591.5(f)'' in place of the current ``19 CFR 12.80(b)(1).''

VI. Rulemaking Analyses and Notices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. EO 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice was not reviewed under E.O. 12866. NHTSA has considered the impact associated with this rulemaking action
and has concluded that it is not significant under the Department of Transportation's regulatory policies and procedures.
As explained above, this action merely would require that the motor vehicle manufacturer's label, which is already
required for all motor vehicles, be made of metal and be permanently affixed to those vehicles with a GVWR greater than
4,536 kg (10,000 lb). The costs would range from $0.25 to $2.50 per vehicle, for a total incremental annual cost of between
$106,482 and $1,064,820. NHTSA has concluded, therefore, that the effect of this proposed action would be so minimal
as not to warrant preparation of a full regulatory evaluation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA has considered the impacts of this rulemaking action under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. I hereby certify
that the proposed amendments would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
Accordingly, the agency has not prepared a preliminary regulatory flexibility analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency believes that few, if any, motor vehicle manufacturers qualify as small businesses, although some label
manufacturers might so qualify. Those small businesses would be affected only to the extent that they may be required
to purchase equipment to emboss information on metal labels, if they do not already have such equipment, at a one-time
cost of between $300 and $1,500. Such cost could be amortized over the life of the equipment, and/or passed on to customers
and, eventually, to consumers. Small organizations and small governmental units would be affected by the proposed
amendment only to the extent of having to pay an additional $0.25 to $2.50 per large vehicle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. National Environmental Policy Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA has analyzed this rulemaking action for purposes of the National Environmental Policy Act and has determined
that implementation of this action would have no significant impact on the quality of the human environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. EO 12612 (Federalism) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA has analyzed this proposal in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612
and has determined that this proposal does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant preparation of
a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Civil Justice Reform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would not have any retroactive effect. Under 49 U.S.C. 30103(b), whenever a Federal motor vehicle
safety standard is in effect, a state or political subdivision may prescribe or continue in effect a standard applicable
to the same aspect of performance of a motor vehicle only if the standard is identical to the Federal standard. However,
the United States Government, a state, or a political subdivision of a state may prescribe a standard for a motor vehicle
or item of motor vehicle equipment obtained for its own use that imposes a higher performance requirement than that
required by the Federal standard. 49 U.S.C. 30161 sets forth a procedure for judicial review of final rules establishing,
amending or revoking Federal motor vehicle safety standards. A petition for reconsideration or other administrative
proceedings is not required before parties may file suit in court.

at the street address shown above, and 7 copies from which the purportedly confidential information has been deleted
should be submitted to the Docket Section. A request for confidentiality should be accompanied by a cover letter setting
forth the information specified in 49 CFR part 512, the agency's confidential business information regulation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All comments received on or before the close of business on the comment closing date indicated above for the proposal
will be considered, and will be available to the public for examination in the docket at the above address both before
and after the closing date. To the extent possible, comments received after the closing date will be considered. Comments
received too late for consideration in regard to the final rule will be considered as suggestions for further rulemaking
action. Comments on the proposal will be available for public inspection in the docket. NHTSA will continue to file
relevant information in the docket after the closing date, and it is recommended that interested persons continue
to monitor the docket for new material. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(i) Except for the label specified in paragraph (c) of this section, the lettering on the label shall be of a color that
contrasts with the background of the label. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) The label shall contain the following statements, in the English language, lettered in block capitals and numerals
not less than three thirty-seconds of an inch high, in the order shown: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Name of manufacturer: Except as provided in paragraphs (j) (1) (i), (ii), and (iii) of this section, the full corporate
or individual name of the actual assembler of the vehicle shall be spelled out, except that such abbreviations as ``Co.''
or ``Inc.'' and their foreign equivalents, and the first and middle initials of individuals, may be used. The name
of the manufacturer shall be preceded by the words ``Manufactured By'' or ``Mfd By.'' In the case of imported vehicles,
where the label required by this section is affixed by the Registered Importer, the name of the Registered Importer
shall also be placed on the label in the manner described in this paragraph, directly below the name of the final assembler.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If a vehicle is assembled by a corporation that is controlled by another corporation that assumed responsibility
for the conformity with the standards, the name of the controlling corporation may be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If a vehicle is fabricated and delivered in complete but unassembled form, such that it is designed to be assembled
without special machinery or tools, the fabricator of the vehicle may affix the label and name itself as the manufacturer
for the purposes of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If a trailer is sold by a person who is not its manufacturer, but who is engaged in the manufacture of trailers and
assumes legal responsibility for all duties and liabilities imposed by the Act with respect to that trailer, the name
of that person may appear on the label as the manufacturer. In such a case the name shall be preceded by the words ``Responsible
Manufacturer'' or ``Resp Mfr.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Month and year of manufacture: This shall be the time during which work was completed at the place of main assembly
of the vehicle. It may be spelled out, as ``June 1970,'' or expressed in numerals, as ``670.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) ``Gross Vehicle Weight Rating'' or ``GVWR,'' followed by the appropriate value in kilograms with the commensurate
weight in pounds shown in parentheses, which shall not be less than the sum of the unloaded vehicle weight, rated cargo
load, and 68 kilograms (150 pounds) times the vehicle's designated seating capacity. However, for school buses the
minimum occupant weight shall be 55 kilograms (120 pounds). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) ``Gross Axle Weight Rating'' or ``GAWR,'' followed by the appropriate value in kilograms with the commensurate
weight in pounds shown in parentheses, for each axle, identified in order from front to rear (e.g. front, first intermediate,
second intermediate, rear). The ratings for any consecutive axles having identical gross axle weight ratings when
equipped with tires having the same tire size designation may, at the option of the manufacturer, be stated as a single

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This notice denies a petition for rulemaking submitted by the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators
(AAMVA) concerning vehicle identification numbers (VINs). One of this agency's Federal motor vehicle safety standards
requires all motor vehicles to have a VIN. In addition, NHTSA's certification regulation requires the certification
label on each motor vehicle to bear that vehicle's VIN. AAMVA suggested that NHTSA amend its certification regulation
to require the VIN of each trailer to be marked in a second location on the trailer to ensure the VIN is present on the vehicle
in the event the certification label becomes illegible or lost. The petitioner also believes marking the VIN in a second
location will help state officials find the VIN during vehicle inspections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA is denying the petition because the agency has an ongoing rulemaking on the issue of improving the permanency
and legibility of vehicle certification labels on trailers and other motor vehicles. Since those labels include
the VIN, possible improvements to certification labels would address petitioner's concerns about the permanency
and legibility of the VIN.

NHTSA's certification regulation, 49 CFR 567, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Certification,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 requires motor vehicle manufacturers to affix a certification label to each motor vehicle. The label constitutes
the manufacturer's certification that the vehicle complies with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards.
Section 567.4 specifies where the label must be located and what information it must include. With respect to trailers,
the label must be located on the forward half of the left side of the vehicle such that it is easily readable from outside
the vehicle without moving any part of the vehicle. One of the items of information required to be displayed on the label
is the VIN. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The VIN is a unique identifier that facilitates NHTSA's analysis of accident data and assessment of vehicle recall
campaigns. Standard No. 115, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Vehicle Identification Number_Basic Requirements, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
49 CFR 571.115, requires each motor vehicle to have a VIN. It further requires the VIN to be marked clearly and indelibly
either on a part of the vehicle that is not designed to be removed or on a separate plate or label, such as the vehicle certification
label required by 49 CFR 567. 49 CFR 565, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Vehicle Identification Number_Content Requirements,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 specifies the content and format for the VIN. Among other things, Part 565 requires the VIN to provide information
on the characteristics of the vehicle, such as its gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since a trailer's VIN is placed on the certification label, the extent to which a trailer's VIN remains legible throughout
the life of the vehicle depends on the permanency of that label. Part 567 specifies that, unless riveted, the label
must be permanently affixed such that it cannot be removed without destroying it (&sect;567.4(b)). However, Part
567 does not specify any other requirements that ensure the permanency of the certification label, such as requiring
the label to be fabricated from a durable material.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
The Petition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
AAMVA petitioned NHTSA to improve the permanency of the VIN marking. AAMVA petitioned on behalf of its members, state
motor vehicle administrators. They use the VIN to register vehicles, to determine proper ownership of vehicles,
and to find the GVWR that the vehicle manufacturer assigned to the vehicle. The petitioner said that state officials
use the GVWR information for, among other purposes, determining whether a vehicle is overloaded on the highways.
AAMVA suggested that NHTSA require trailers to have the VIN stamped, etched or otherwise permanently marked in a location
other than the certification label. AAMVA stated that certification labels are typically plastic coated and become
illegible with age and exposure to the elements. Thus, the information on the label_particularly the VIN_becomes
``illegible long before the useful life of the trailer'' ends. Petitioner believed that a second VIN marking would
provide a backup means for determining the weight ratings and other pertinent information for the trailer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Agency Decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA is denying AAMVA's petition. The petitioner's justification for its suggestion, missing GVWR information,
is being addressed for trailers in a separate NHTSA rulemaking. That rulemaking action seeks to improve the permanency
and legibility of the certification labels used on commercial motor vehicles. It was initiated when NHTSA granted
in part a petition for rulemaking submitted by the Michigan Department of State Police (MDSP). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The MDSP raised concerns similar to those of the AAMVA regarding the ability of state officials to locate GVWR and VIN
information on commercial vehicles. The MDSP stated that law enforcement officers often have difficulty determining
the GVWRs of commercial vehicles because the labels on those vehicles are often damaged, painted over or removed,
usually accidently, during the life of the vehicle. The petitioner believed that a vehicle's VIN and GVWR information
should be made more accessible and legible on commercial vehicles to enable police officers to more readily inspect
and investigate commercial vehicles during routine traffic stops. Among other things, the MDSP suggested requiring
certification labels for large commercial vehicles, including trailers, to be made of metal, with raised or recessed
letters and numbers (see RIN 2127&hyph;AE71). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the MDSP petition, NHTSA will consider the need to improve the permanency and legibility of the certification
labels for large trailers, and possible ways to improve the labels. Since these labels include the VIN, any improvements
to the certification label will have the effect of improving the permanency and legibility of the VIN. In addition,
NHTSA will request comments in that rulemaking on whether small trailers should also meet the requirements being
proposed for large trailers, and whether some different approach, other than the proposed metal label requirement,
would be more effective for the certification labels. Since that rulemaking will address AAMVA's concerns about
the permanency and legibility of VIN markings, AAMVA's petition is moot.

The Quino checkerspot, is a small member of the brush-footed butterfly family (Nymphalidae). It is about 3 cm (1 inch)
in length and checkered with dark brown, reddish, and yellowish spots. The Quino checkerspot is restricted to sunny
openings on clay soils formed from gabbro parent materials within shrubland habitats of the interior foothills of
southwestern California and northwestern Baja California, Mexico. The Quino checkerspot may have been one of the
most abundant butterflies in San Diego, Orange, and western Riverside Counties during the early part of the twentieth
century. Currently five to six populations remain in San Diego and southern Riverside Counties.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) regulates certain international
trade in plant and animal species. Export of plants and animals listed in CITES Appendix II may occur only if the Scientific
Authority has advised the permit-issuing Management Authority that such export will not be detrimental to the survival
of the species and if the Management Authority is satisfied that the plant or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
animal specimens to be exported were not obtained in violation of laws for their protection. Export of cultivated
specimens of plants listed in Appendix II may occur under certificates issued by the Management Authority if it is
satisfied that the plants to be exported were artificially propagated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This document announces proposed findings on export of American ginseng 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(Panax quinquefolius)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 from the 1994&hyph;1996 harvest seasons in 22 States. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) reviews information
and data on the topics described in this proposed rule as a basis for determining whether to continue approval of export
from specified States for the 1994&hyph;96 harvest seasons or to initiate changes. For Iowa and Wisconsin, approval
is only for 1994. In addition, the State of North Dakota has applied to export cultivated ginseng under a State program;
the State of Maine has submitted legislation which has been signed to set up a State program for the export of cultivated
ginseng and is working to finalize the details of the program and to apply for export approval; and the State of Michigan
has submitted draft legislation and is intending to complete its application to export cultivated ginseng under
a State program soon. The Service proposes to approve only exports of cultivated ginseng from those three States,
contingent on submission of adequate final State information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Monitoring State ginseng programs for 16 years has shown that the States from which ginseng export has been approved
are likely to continue to satisfy CITES requirements. To ensure that this is so, the Service plans to continue its monitoring
in accordance with the procedures described herein, which have been somewhat streamlined and clarified. This monitoring
includes analysis of program reports made available to the Service no later than May 31 each year from each State from
which ginseng export is approved. These annual reports document the most recent previous harvest and the current
status of the State's program for ginseng.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
all wild
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 ginseng be inspected and certified by State officials. Cultivated ginseng may be certified by licensed or registered
dealers approved by the State to make such an accounting. This change is being considered since: (1) The origin of the
roots is declared as to whether the plant was cultivated or taken from the wild; and (2) the marked difference in appearance
and price between wild and cultivated ginseng make it reasonably unlikely that wild ginseng would be sold as cultivated
ginseng.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) regulates certain international
trade in CITES-listed species. Export of specimens of species listed in Appendix II of the treaty may only occur upon
approval of a Scientific Authority and a Management Authority of the country of export. In the United States, the Scientific
Authority and Management Authority responsibilities are assigned to the Secretary of the Interior and are carried
out by offices of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
CITES provides for listing of whole plants and specifically designated parts and derivatives of Appendix II plants.
Since 1973, whole plants and roots of American ginseng 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(Panax quinquefolius) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
have been so listed. In 1985, for reasons unrelated to the trade in American ginseng, the CITES Parties (member countries)
revised listing practices and decided to regulate not only whole specimens of plants on Appendix II, but also all their
readily recognizable parts and derivatives, unless they were specifically excluded. As a consequence, the listing
for ginseng needed restatement, and the listing proposal adopted by the Parties (November 22, 1985, 50 FR 48212) continues
to regulate ginseng exports, including plants, whole roots, essentially intact roots, and root chunks and slices
[50 CFR 23.23(d)(3)]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service may issue findings yearly or for more than one year. It began making multiyear findings for the export of
American ginseng on a State-by-State basis with issuance of the Scientific Authority and Management Authority findings
to cover the 1982&hyph;84 harvest seasons. On October 4, 1982 (47 FR 43701), the Service reported that it found that
the status of wild ginseng did not appear to vary greatly from one year to the next within any given State, and that the
existing information compiled was adequate to justify findings under CITES for 3 years. The initial multiyear rule
was followed by a second such rule for the 1985&hyph;87 harvest seasons (50 FR 39691, September 30, 1985; 50 FR 42027,
October 17, 1985), and subsequent rules for the 1988&hyph;90 seasons (53 FR 33815, September 1, 1988) and the 1991&hyph;93
seasons (56 FR 41806, August 23, 1991). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service uses information compiled since 1977 to make the multiyear findings. This notice concerns the Service's
proposed findings to approve the export of American ginseng to be collected in certain States in the 1994&hyph;96
harvest seasons. The Service plans to continue to review current biological and harvest information concerning
ginseng and those State programs approved for exporting of their ginseng. The State information previously submitted
need not be resubmitted if it is incorporated by reference and its validity reaffirmed. The Service is retaining the
option to revise 3-year findings whenever warranted by information that shows the need for change. The procedures
herein have been somewhat streamlined and clarified, and the Service would welcome comments concerning further
simplification of these procedures.

Scientific Authority Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The overall criteria used by the Scientific Authority in finding whether export will not be detrimental to the survival
of a species are generally as follows (summarized from a notice of July 11, 1977; 42 FR 35800): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Whether such export has occurred in the past and has appreciably reduced numbers or distribution of the species;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Whether such export has or is expected to increase, remain constant, or decrease; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Whether the life-history parameters of the species and relevant structure and function in its ecosystems indicate
that the present or proposed levels of export, considered with the potential impacts of other factors, are expected
to appreciably reduce the numbers or distribution of the species, or cause signs of appreciable ecological stress
within the species and/or in other species within its ecosystems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For ginseng, the evaluation for nondetriment by the Scientific Authority, in accordance with these general criteria,
is based on the information and data submitted on the following topics by each affected State and from other appropriate
sources. Information previously submitted that remains valid need only be referenced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following information and data for wild ginseng can be conveniently recorded by natural region(s) of the State
or by county, preferably on a State map, or in a table of the counties. Ginseng is to be considered wild if it occurs in
naturally perpetuated habitat where the species is naturally propagated or with only limited planting of seeds and
with no subsequent tending of plants or habitat before harvest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Historic distribution of ginseng, with indication of optimal habitat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Location and approximate acreage of statute-protected lands in the State on which wild ginseng occurs and where
collecting is prohibited. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Present abundance of ginseng, using the indices of 0 = absent, 1 = rare, 2 = occasional, 3 = frequent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Density within the ginseng populations for each natural region (or county) where present, using the indices of
1 = sparse, 2 = moderate, 3 = dense. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Harvest collecting intensity, using the indices of 0 = none, 1 = light, 2 = moderate, 3 = heavy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Preferably by natural regions of the State (or by county) rather than statewide, the average number of roots per
pound (dry weight) as purchased by dealers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Information on trends in wild ginseng populations for the State or, if possible, natural regions of the State, indicating
whether populations are apparently increasing, stable, decreasing, or being extirpated.

6. The State's opinion, based on the information and data provided on the topics above and any other information and
data that the State may provide, as to whether the removal of the ginseng from the wild in the State might have been adverse
for the State's entire population of the species.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 For cultivated ginseng, the following information and data can be provided in map, tabular, or narrative form. Ginseng
is considered cultivated when it is artificially propagated and maintained under controlled conditions, for example
in intensively or intermittently prepared or managed gardens or patches under artificial or natural shade. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Counties in which ginseng is commercially cultivated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The number of pounds (dry weight) of cultivated ginseng roots certified by the State for export.

Management Authority Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the Scientific Authority finding that ginseng exports will not be detrimental to the survival of the
species, the Management Authority must be satisfied (1) that the ginseng was not obtained in contravention of laws
for its protection, and (2) as to whether it was of wild or cultivated origin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Criteria used by the Management Authority in determining a State program's qualifications for export are that the
State has adopted and is implementing the following regulatory measures (see 50 FR 39691, September 30, 1985): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. A State ginseng law and regulations mandating State licensing or registration of persons purchasing or selling
ginseng collected or grown in that State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. State requirements that these licensed or registered ginseng dealers maintain true and complete records of their
commerce in the annually harvested ginseng and provide copies of such records to the State in a signed and dated statement
at least every 90 days (within 15 days of end of each quarter of calendar year) and a year-end accounting of the total
commerce for the year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Dealer records required to show date of transaction, whether roots and plants were wild or cultivated, if roots
were dried or fresh (green) at time of transaction, weight of roots, weight or number of plants, State of origin of roots
or plants, and identification numbers of the State certificates used to ship ginseng from the State of origin. The
name and address of the seller or buyer of record of the ginseng shall be maintained by the dealer on his/her own copy
of commerce record forms supplied by the State(s) of licensing and shall be made available to the State ginseng-program
manager(s) upon request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Inspection and certification by State personnel of all wild ginseng harvested in the State to authenticate that
ginseng was legally obtained from wild sources within the State. Cultivated ginseng harvested in the State may be
certified by licensed or registered dealers approved by the State to make such an accounting of this ginseng. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Experience has shown the value of an inspection and certification program by State official(s) who can document both
the weight of the ginseng roots (weight or number of plants) involved and that they were legally taken from the wild
or cultivated in that State. Dealer certification for cultivated ginseng is being considered because the declared
origin of the root is indicative of whether it is wild or cultivated and the marked difference in appearance and price
between wild and cultivated ginseng makes it reasonably unlikely that wild ginseng would be certified by a State-approved
dealer as cultivated. Cultivated ginseng may be recorded by such a dealer and exported with appropriate CITES export
documents without further certification by State officials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Ginseng unsold by March 31 of the year after harvest must be weighed by the State, and the dealer, digger, or root owner
given a State weight receipt. Future State export certification of this stock for export is to be issued against the
State weight receipt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Certificate of origin forms for wild ginseng must remain in State control until issued at certification. The certificate
of origin forms for all ginseng must contain the following information:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

7. State regulations that (a) prohibit export from the State of its ginseng without certification by the State of origin,
and (b) require uncertified ginseng supplied to State-registered dealers to be returned to the State of origin within
30 calendar days for certification. Failure to have such ginseng certified will render those roots illegal for commerce
under State law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each State from which ginseng export is approved shall, without further notice, make program information on each

Program for Cultivated Ginseng

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 21, 1980 (45 FR 68944), the Service announced that it would approve export of cultivated ginseng only from
States for which the export of wild-collected ginseng was approved because those States had programs that could adequately
document the source of the ginseng. On October 4, 1982 (47 FR 43701), the Service announced that it would approve export
of cultivated ginseng from other States if procedures had been implemented to minimize the risk that wild-collected
plants would be claimed as cultivated. The Service continues to consider granting such approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of North Dakota has applied to export cultivated ginseng, and the Service is proposing to approve such exports
from this State. North Dakota is considered outside the native range of ginseng. The State of Michigan (which is within
the native range of the species) was granted interim approval to export cultivated ginseng from the 1993 harvest.
The State has been working with the Service to finalize procedures under a new State law and is planning on completing
their submission requesting approval of their ginseng program prior to the publication of the final rule. The Service
is considering the approval of such exports from this State. The Service's proposal to approve Michigan's program
is dependent upon receiving the required information. The State of Maine (which is within the native range of the species)
has passed legislation setting up a State program for cultivated ginseng and is working to complete their submission
for export approval for cultivated ginseng only. The Service is considering the approval of such exports pending
satisfactory completion of the application for export approval.

Previous Export Approval

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 23, 1991 (56 FR 41806), the Service approved multiyear export of 1991&hyph;93 harvested ginseng only from
States with a legally regulated ginseng program that provided for a State certification and inspection system and
that satisfied the other criteria of the Management Authority and the Scientific Authority. The export of wild and
cultivated ginseng harvested from 1991 through 1993 was approved only from the 19 States indicated in the Code of Federal
Regulations [50 CFR 23.51(e)(1)]_see the 1991&hyph;1993 column in the table at the end of this document. Documents
containing information that provided the basis for the Service's findings of legal take and origin are on file at the
Office of Management Authority at the address given above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Such export approval means that any ginseng legally harvested during those years from Service-approved State programs
may be exported at any time when accompanied by appropriate State certification and valid Federal export documents
granted by the U.S. Management Authority. For example, ginseng legally harvested in 1992 under a Service-approved
State program may be exported in 1994 when accompanied by the 1992 State certificate of origin, a 1994 export document
issued by the Management Authority, and an exporter's invoice.

Multiyear Findings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a result of monitoring State ginseng programs and the status of ginseng since 1977, the Service expects that States
from which the export of ginseng has been approved will continue to satisfy CITES requirements and that continued
export of ginseng from these States will not be detrimental to the survival of the species. Therefore, States previously
approved for export of ginseng for the 1991&hyph;93 harvest seasons need not submit completely new applications
for export program approval for the 1994&hyph;96 harvest seasons. However, in relation to both the set of criteria
used by the Scientific Authority and the set used by the Management Authority, each State needs to reaffirm the validity
of its existing program and to notify the Service of any modifications or changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This report with information on the 1993 harvest, reaffirmation of the ongoing State program, and any new program
information should have been received by May 31, 1994, from all States from which ginseng export has been approved
for the 1991&hyph;93 harvest years (see 56 FR 41806; August 23, 1991). The States of Iowa and Wisconsin have been notified
of the Service's concerns over the lack of State certification for wild ginseng. Therefore, the Service is proposing
to approve export of wild and cultivated ginseng from these two States for 1 year only. Findings allowing further export
will be made based on compliance with Service requirements. The Service is proposing to find that the status of the
species and State programs is such that the 1994&hyph;96 harvests of ginseng for export will not be detrimental to
the survival of the species for 17 of the 19 States approved for the 1991&hyph;93 harvest seasons. In addition, the
Service is proposing the approval of exports of cultivated ginseng from Maine and Michigan, pending receipt of required
information, and from North Dakota, which is outside the species' native range. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any States wishing to initiate export programs for ginseng should begin working with the Service early so that their
finalized request for approval can be submitted by March 31 of the year in which the State anticipates certifying that
season's ginseng for export. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service export approval is subject to revision prior to the 1995 and 1996 harvest seasons if a review of information
reveals that Management Authority or Scientific Authority findings on any approved State may need to be changed.
The Service proposes not to grant general approval for export of ginseng originating in any State not named in the 1994
codification of 50 CFR 23.51(e), for one or more of the following reasons: (1) The species does not occur there; (2)
no harvest of the species is allowed by the State; or (3) the Service does not have current information needed for Management
Authority and/or Scientific Authority findings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure that States for which ginseng export is approved by the Service maintain successful programs so that export
is not detrimental to the survival of this species, the Service plans to annually review the export documents returned
from U.S. Department of Agriculture ports and the information and data submitted by the States, including any unexplained
changes in harvest levels and any other concerns presented in the State-submitted reports. Taking into account the
State evaluations, the Service will continue to make an overall evaluation on the status of ginseng. Notices will
be published in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Valid Federal CITES documents are necessary to export wild or cultivated ginseng roots, major root parts, or plants.
Applications for these documents should be sent to the Office of Management Authority at the address given above.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ginseng may only be exported through ports with personnel and/or facilities of the U.S. Department of Agriculture
(USDA ports) that have been designated by the U.S. Department of the Interior (49 FR 49238, October 25, 1984; see 50
CFR 24.12). For each export, the exporter must present to the port inspector of the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service, Plant Protection and Quarantine (APHIS/PPQ), the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Ginseng roots or plants being exported. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Original State certificates of origin for the ginseng (or foreign export documents for American ginseng imported
into the United States). An exporter or dealer may split an original State certificate by striking a line through the
original weight on the certificate and stating in numbers and words the new lower weight of ginseng to be exported.
This change in weight must be certified by the dealer or exporter with the written words ``I made these changes on (date)''
followed by the full legal signature of the dealer or exporter. The modified State certificate of origin must bear
this certified change in ink, in original form, and be readily legible or also given in printed style. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. One completed Federal CITES export document (permit or certificate) with two copies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. One copy of the exporter's executed invoice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The APHIS/PPQ port inspector may sign and validate the CITES documents only after a satisfactory inspection of the
contents of the State certificate(s) of origin, the exporter's invoice, CITES export documentation, and the shipment.
Once the CITES documents are validated, the inspector will forward the State certificates, one copy of the CITES export
document, and the exporter's invoice to the Office of Management Authority for recordkeeping and reporting. The
second copy of the Federal CITES export document goes to the exporter. The original CITES export document authorizes
the international shipment of the ginseng and will be collected by the importing country for its recordkeeping and
reporting.

Request for Information and Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service requests information and comments on (1) the status of ginseng throughout its range or in any portion of
its range; (2) the proposed findings that the export of ginseng from any of the 22 States with programs to be approved
will not be detrimental to the survival of the species; and (3) the status criteria used. Information and comments
also are requested on the criteria and procedures and their implementation for determining (1) that exported specimens
are accurately declared as wild or cultivated; (2) that the ginseng (roots) originated in a particular State; and
(3) that the ginseng is not collected in contravention of laws for its protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service also requests information on environmental or economic impacts and effects on small entities (including
small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions) that would result from findings
for or against export approval. This information may aid the Service in further evaluating the conclusions stated
below. This proposed rule is issued under authority of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

; 87 Stat. 884, as amended), and was prepared by Mark R. Albert and Carol L. Carson, Office of Management Authority,
and Charles W. Dane, Bruce MacBryde, and Wayne L. Milstead, Office of Scientific Authority.

Effects of the Rule and Required Determinations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service has determined that these proposed findings are not a major Federal action significantly affecting the
quality of the human environment under the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321&hyph;4347), and therefore
the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement is not required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review under Executive Order 12866. For the 1994&hyph;96
harvest seasons, the Service analyzed the impacts and again concluded that the 3-year rule will not have significant
economic effects on a substantial number of small entities as outlined under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.
601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Exporters normally derive their product from ginseng roots harvested in a number of States. Therefore, the approval
or disapproval of wild ginseng export from any one State would not significantly affect the industry. Moreover, because
the proposed rule would treat exports on a State-by-State basis and proposes to approve export in accordance with
State programs, the rule would have little effect on small entities in and of itself. The proposed rule would allow
continued international trade in ginseng from the United States in accordance with CITES, and it does not contain
any Federalism impacts as described in Executive Order 12612. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It also has been determined that this proposed rule does not contain information collection requirements that require
approval by OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS proposes regulations to delay the opening of the first (roe) directed fishing season for the offshore component
pollock fishery in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI) management area from January 1 to January 26 of each fishing
year. This action is necessary to achieve optimum roe quality and increase revenues from the BSAI pollock processed
by the offshore component during the roe season. The proposed action also would prohibit vessels used to fish for BSAI
or Gulf of Alaska (GOA) groundfish or BSAI king or Tanner crab prior to January 26 from participating in the offshore
component pollock fishery until February 5. This 10-day prohibition on entry into the offshore component fishery
would not apply to vessels used to participate in the Community Development Quota (CDQ) program prior to January 26
and is necessary to discourage participants in the offshore component pollock fishery from contributing to increased
fishing effort in other fisheries prior to the start of the offshore component roe season. This action is intended
to promote the fishery management objectives of the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Groundfish Fishery of the
BSAI.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Fishing for groundfish by vessels in the exclusive economic zone of the BSAI is managed by the Secretary of Commerce
(Secretary) according to the FMP for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI. The FMP was prepared by the North Pacific Fishery
Management Council (Council) under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act and is implemented by regulations
governing the U.S. groundfish fisheries at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current regulations authorize all BSAI trawl fisheries, including the pollock fisheries, to start on January 20
of each year. Existing regulations at &sect;675.20(a)(2)(ii) also authorize the establishment of separate pollock
total allowable catch (TAC) amounts for the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands subareas and the Bogoslof District. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Through 1995, the pollock TACs specified for each subarea and district initially are allocated among the Western
Alaska CDQ reserve (7.5 percent), the BSAI operational reserve (7.5 percent), and the open access fisheries (85 percent,
of which 35 percent is allocated to the inshore component and 65 percent to the offshore component). The portion of
the TACs allocated to the inshore and offshore components is further apportioned into two seasonal allowances. The
first allowance (roe season) is available for directed fishing from January 1, until April 15, and the second allowance
(non-roe season) is available for directed fishing from August 15, until December 31. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bering Sea pollock fishery has experienced increased harvesting and processing capacity and increased effort
in recent years under the existing open access management regime. While the TAC annually specified for pollock in
the last few years has remained fairly stable between 1.2 and 1.3 million metric tons, the increase in harvesting and
processing capacity has led to increasing daily catch rates and reduced season lengths for both the inshore and offshore
components. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three major factors affect the length of the pollock roe season: Annual TAC, the amount of pollock TAC apportioned
to the pollock roe season, and amount of fishing effort. Regulations authorizing the seasonal apportionment of pollock
TACs have been effective since 1991. In 1991 and 1992, 40 percent of the Bering Sea pollock initial TAC was apportioned
to the roe season, and 45 percent was apportioned in 1993 and 1994. Since 1991, the length of the Bering Sea pollock roe
season has decreased each year. The roe season pollock quota was harvested in 52 days in 1991 and 46 days in 1992. Effective
June 1, 1992, through December 31, 1995, pollock TACs are apportioned among the offshore component, inshore component,
and CDQ pollock fisheries. The 1993 roe season allowance apportioned to the offshore component was harvested in 33
days. The inshore component roe fishery lasted 63 days from January 20, through March 24. However, a strike by vessels
delivering onshore delayed fishing until the first week of February. The inshore component's roe season pollock
apportionment was harvested in about 48 days. In 1994, the offshore component roe season closed on February 18 (29
days), and the inshore component roe season closed on March 2 (41 days).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pollock roe produced from the roe season harvests represents a substantial portion of the gross wholesale value of
the pollock fishery and roe maturity is one of the most important factors in determining product value. Good quality
mature roe receives the highest price, followed by immature and over-mature roe. Therefore, in order to maximize
the value of roe production, industry prefers to harvest as much roe as possible during the period of peak roe maturity
and to minimize the harvest of immature and over-mature roe. Although the timing of peak roe maturity varies depending
on the age of the fish, the location where fish spawn, and ocean conditions, industry sources report that the period
of peak roe maturity usually occurs between February 10 and February 20. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The pollock roe season length has shortened to the degree that some offshore processors participating in the open
access fishery believe that the fishery closes before or during the timing of peak roe maturity. Consequently, the
value of the pollock harvest is significantly lower than it could be if the season were delayed. This trend likely will
continue under the open access management system.

Concerns about a shortened roe season do not appear to be shared by participants in the inshore component pollock fishery
or some of the offshore processors who also participate in the CDQ pollock fisheries, which occur after the close of
the open access fishery. Inshore processors report that peak roe maturity generally occurs during the first 2 weeks
of February and, because the 1994 roe season extended into early March, the fishery fully encompassed the period of
peak roe maturity. Delay of the inshore component roe season would likely increase the harvest of pollock with lower
valued, over-mature roe. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the request of offshore component processors, the Council first considered alternatives for delaying the pollock
roe season at its June 1993 meeting. Lack of industry consensus on a preferred alternative prevented the Council from
taking action. The continued shortening of the roe season in 1994 prompted the Council again to consider alternative
season opening dates for the pollock roe season. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At its June 1994 meeting, the Council considered the testimony and recommendations of its Advisory Panel, Scientific
and Statistical Committee, fishing industry representatives, and the public on alternative dates for the start
of the pollock roe season. For the reasons given below, the Council determined that delaying the offshore component
roe season opening date to January 26 would provide the most benefit to the fishing industry and recommended that NMFS
initiate rulemaking to delay the opening of the offshore component pollock roe season until this date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To discourage a shift in fishing effort into other fisheries by pollock vessels prior to January 26, the Council also
recommended that vessels used to fish for BSAI or GOA groundfish or BSAI king or Tanner crab prior to January 26 be prohibited
from participating in the offshore component pollock fishery until February 5. This prohibition would not apply
to vessels participating in a CDQ fishery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 14.3 of the FMP requires that the Council consider the following criteria when recommending a regulatory
amendment to change season opening dates: Biological, bycatch, exvessel and wholesale prices, product quality,
safety, cost, other fisheries, coordinated season timing, enforcement and management costs, and allocation effects.
The EA/RIR/IRFA prepared for this action addresses anticipated effects of the proposed delay relative to these criteria.
The following discussion summarizes these effects relative to how the Council's objectives for an offshore component
roe season delay are met under the proposed action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Biological or bycatch effects. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A delay of the roe season opening date for the offshore component pollock fishery to January 26 would affect neither
the amount of pollock harvested during the roe season nor the overall duration of the fishery. Although the proposed
action would result in a 6-day shift of trawl effort, significant spatial differences in trawl effort distribution
would not be expected because the location of spawning stocks of pollock likely would not vary significantly during
this 6-day period. Similarly, a 6-day delay in the opening date of the pollock roe season would not affect the size of
pollock taken in this fishery. When female pollock are entering a spawning condition, their energy is going into the
production of eggs and maintenance, and not into growth. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the BSAI, Pacific halibut, red king crab, C. bairdi Tanner crab, and herring are prohibited species for which bycatch
limits are established and apportioned each year to the pollock and other groundfish trawl fisheries based on Council
recommendations. Pacific salmon also are prohibited species that may not be retained in the groundfish fisheries;
however, no salmon bycatch limits currently are established. Few data exist to suggest that the proposed change in
the pollock roe season would have any positive or negative impact on the prohibited species bycatch amounts. Observer
data indicate that an opening date later into the season could help to reduce chinook salmon bycatch in the trawl fisheries.
However, the effects of a change of less than 1 week for a start date are difficult to measure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed action would not have an adverse effect on marine mammals or seabirds, because it would not increase pollock
harvests or significantly change the temporal or spatial distribution of this harvest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Product quality and value. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed delay of the offshore component pollock roe season is intended to increase the value of the pollock harvested
during the roe season by delaying the offshore component fishery so the season fully encompasses the period of optimum
roe maturity. This action likely would affect the roe product quality and value experienced in the CDQ pollock fisheries.

Participants in the CDQ pollock fisheries include the Western Alaska community groups that have been allocated pollock
quota and the processors with which they contract for the harvest and processing of the quota. In 1993 and 1994, the
roe season CDQ pollock fisheries occurred immediately after the close of the open access roe season, when the proportion
of mature roe produced was still quite high. Under the proposed action, CDQ harvests likely would occur between January
20 and January 26 and after the offshore component fishery closed. In either case, if the offshore component roe season
delay achieves the primary objective of allowing this fishery to be prosecuted when pollock roe maturity is optimum,
the overall gross wholesale value of the pollock CDQ fishery would be reduced. However, based on the volume of pollock
harvested and the number of participants in the fisheries, an increase in the value of roe production during the offshore
component fishery (due to increased roe quality) probably would be greater than the decrease in the value of roe production
in the CDQ fisheries.

Allocation, coordinated season timing, and impacts on other fisheries. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action is intended to discourage vessels participating in the offshore component pollock fishery from
contributing to increased fishing effort in other fisheries prior to the start of the offshore component roe season
on January 26. Under the proposed action, vessels used to participate in a BSAI groundfish fishery, a GOA groundfish
fishery, or the BSAI king or Tanner crab fishery would be prevented from entering the offshore component pollock fishery
until February 5_10 days after the opening of the offshore component roe season. The intent of this action is to encourage
vessel owners to choose between fishing for pollock or for another species, thus minimizing any preemptive impacts
on other fisheries that may otherwise occur under the proposed delay of the pollock roe season.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Costs. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Vessels used to participate in a BSAI or GOA groundfish fishery or the BSAI king or Tanner crab fisheries prior to January
26 would be prohibited from participating in the offshore pollock fishery before February 5. This limitation could
impose costs on those vessels that target on more than one species during the pollock roe season. These vessels would
be precluded from participating in other fisheries prior to the roe season if they also wanted to continue their pollock
target fisheries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If approved by NMFS, the Council's recommended action to delay the offshore component pollock roe season would be
effective only through December 31, 1995, when regulations authorizing the allocation of pollock between the inshore
and offshore component expire. Continued effectiveness of the proposed delay would require new rulemaking contingent
on the implementation of a separate FMP amendment that would authorize inshore/offshore groundfish allocations
beyond 1995.

NMFS prepared an IRFA as part of the RIR, which concludes that this proposed rule, if adopted, could have significant
effects on a substantial number of small entities (i.e., small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental
jurisdictions with limited resources). The Western Alaska community groups that have received CDQs in the pollock
fishery are considered small entities, because they are government jurisdictions with populations less than 50,000.
The proposed action would delay the start date of the offshore pollock roe season in the BSAI in order to increase the
wholesale value of roe production in the open access fishery. If this action is successful in its purpose, the value
of roe production in the CDQ pollock fisheries would probably decline, thereby reducing revenue to the Western Alaska
community groups. The reduction in revenue generated from the CDQ program could have a ``significant impact'' on
these small entities by reducing their annual gross revenues by more than 5 percent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This action proposes restrictions or prohibitions on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substitutes for ozone depleting substances (ODSs) under the U.S. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Significant New Alternatives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Policy (SNAP) program. SNAP implements section 612 of the amended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Clean Air Act of 1990 which requires EPA to evaluate and regulate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substitutes for the ODSs to reduce overall risk to human health and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the environment. Through these evaluations, SNAP generates lists of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptable and unacceptable substitutes for each of the major 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industrial use sectors. The intended effect of the SNAP program is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to expedite movement away from ozone depleting compounds while 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
avoiding a shift into high-risk substitutes posing other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental problems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 18, 1994, EPA promulgated a final rulemaking setting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forth its plan for administering the SNAP program, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issued decisions on the acceptability and unacceptability of a number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substitutes. In this notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), EPA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issuing its preliminary decisions on the acceptability of certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substitutes not previously reviewed by the Agency. To arrive at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determinations on the acceptability of substitutes, the Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completed a cross-media evaluation of risks to human health and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment by sector end-use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's action proposes new additions to the list of controlled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or prohibited substitutes. As described in the final rule for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SNAP program, EPA does believe that notice-and-comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking is required to place any alternative on the list of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prohibited substitutes, to list an alternative as acceptable only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under certain use conditions or certain narrow end-use applications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA does not, however, believe that rulemaking procedures are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to list alternatives as acceptable with no limitations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Such listings do not impose any sanction, nor do they remove any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior license to use a substitute. Consequently, EPA is adding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substitutes to the list of acceptable alternatives without first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requesting comment on new listings. Updates to the acceptable lists 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are published as separate notices in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

II. Section 612 Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Statutory Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 612 of the Clean Air Act authorizes EPA to develop a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program for evaluating alternatives to ozone-depleting substances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is referring to this program as the Significant New Alternatives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Policy (SNAP) program. The major provisions of section 612 are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Rulemaking_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 612(c) requires EPA to promulgate rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
making it unlawful to replace any class I 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(chlorofluorocarbon, halon, carbon tetrachloride, methyl 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chloroform, methyl bromide, and hydrobromofluorocarbon) or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
class II (hydrochlorofluorocarbon) substance with any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substitute that the Administrator determines may present 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse effects to human health or the environment where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Administrator has identified an alternative that: (1) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reduces the overall risk to human health and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment; and (2) is currently or potentially available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Listing of Unacceptable/Acceptable Substitutes_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
612(c) also requires EPA to publish a list of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substitutes unacceptable for specific uses. EPA must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
publish a corresponding list of acceptable alternatives for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific uses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Petition Process_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 612(d) grants the right to any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
person to petition EPA to add a substitute to or delete a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substitute from the lists published in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 612(c). The Agency has 90 days to grant or deny a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petition. Where the Agency grants the petition, EPA must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
publish the revised lists within an additional 6 months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
90-day Notification_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 612(e) requires EPA to require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any person who produces a chemical substitute for a class I 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substance to notify the Agency not less than 90 days before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new or existing chemicals are introduced into interstate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commerce for significant new uses as substitutes for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
class I substance. The producer must also provide the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency with the producer's unpublished health and safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies on such substitutes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Outreach_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 612(b)(1) states that the Administrator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall seek to maximize the use of federal research 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities and resources to assist users of class I and II 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substances in identifying and developing alternatives to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the use of such substances in key commercial applications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Clearinghouse_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 612(b)(4) requires the Agency to set 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
up a public clearinghouse of alternative chemicals, product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substitutes, and alternative manufacturing processes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are available for products and manufacturing processes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which use class I and II substances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Regulatory History 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 18, 1994, EPA published the Final Rulemaking (FRM) (59 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FR 13044) which described the process for administering the SNAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program and issued EPA's first acceptability lists for substitutes in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the major industrial use sectors. These sectors include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigeration and air conditioning; foam blowing; solvent cleaning; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fire suppression and explosion protection; sterilants; aerosols; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adhesives, coatings and inks; and tobacco expansion. These sectors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comprise the principal industrial sectors that historically consume 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
large volumes of ozone-depleting compounds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency defines a ``substitute'' as any chemical, product, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substitute, or alternative manufacturing process, whether existing or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new, that could replace a class I or class II substance. Anyone who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produces a substitute must provide the Agency with health and safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies on the substitute at least 90 days before introducing it into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interstate commerce for significant new use as an alternative. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement applies to chemical manufacturers, but may include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importers, formulators or end-users when they are responsible for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
introducing a substitute into commerce. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Proposed Listing of Substitutes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To develop the lists of unacceptable and acceptable substitutes, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA conducts screens of health and environmental risks posed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
various substitutes for ozone-depleting compounds in each use sector. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The outcome of these risks screens can be found in the public docket, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as described above in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 portion of this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 612, the Agency has considerable discretion in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk management decisions it can make in SNAP. The Agency has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified five possible decision categories: acceptable, acceptable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to use conditions; acceptable subject to narrowed use limits; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unacceptable; and pending. Acceptable substitutes can be used with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no limits for all applications within the relevant sector end-use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Conversely, it is illegal to replace an ODS with a substitute listed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by SNAP as unacceptable. A pending listing represents substitutes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for which the Agency has not received complete data or has not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completed its review of the data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After reviewing a substitute, the Agency may make a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination that a substitute is acceptable only if conditions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use are met to minimize risks to human health and the environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Use of such substitutes in ways that are inconsistent with such use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions renders these substitutes unacceptable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even though the Agency can restrict the use of a substitute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on the potential for adverse effects, it may be necessary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permit a narrowed range of use within a sector end-use because of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lack of alternatives for specialized applications. Users intending 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to adopt a substitute acceptable with narrowed use limits must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ascertain that other acceptable alternatives are not technically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
feasible. Companies must document the results of their evaluation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and retain the results on file for the purpose of demonstrating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance. This documentation shall include descriptions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substitutes examined and rejected, processes or products in which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substitute is needed, reason for rejection of other alternatives, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e.g., performance, technical or safety standards, and the anticipated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date other substitutes will be available and projected time for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
switching to other available substitutes. Use of such substitutes in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application and end-uses which are not specified as acceptable in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
narrowed use limit renders these substitutes unacceptable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), EPA is issuing its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preliminary decision on the acceptability of certain substitutes not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously reviewed by the Agency. As described in the final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the SNAP program (59 FR 13044), EPA believes that notice-and-comment rulemaking is required to place any alternative
on the list 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of prohibited substitutes, to list a substitute as acceptable only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under certain use conditions or narrowed use limits, or to remove an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative from either the list of prohibited or acceptable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substitutes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA does not believe that rulemaking procedures are required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
list alternatives as acceptable with no limitations. Such listings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
do not impose any sanction, nor do they remove any prior license to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use a substitute. Consequently, EPA is adding substitutes to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
list of acceptable alternatives without first requesting comment on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new listings. Updates to the acceptable and pending lists are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published as separate notices in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Parts A. through E. below present a detailed discussion of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substitute listing determinations by major use sector. Tables 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
summarizing listing decisions in this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are in Appendix A. The comments contained in Appendix A provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional information on a substitute. Since comments are not part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the regulatory decision, they are not mandatory for use of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substitute. Nor should the comments be considered comprehensive with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respect to other legal obligations pertaining to the use of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substitute. However, EPA encourages users of acceptable substitutes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to apply all comments in their use of these substitutes. In many 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instances, the comments simply allude to sound operating practices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that have already been identified in existing industry and/or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
building-code standards. Thus, many of the comments, if adopted, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not require significant changes in existing operating practices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the affected industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

A. Refrigeration and Air Conditioning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Overview 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The refrigeration and air conditioning sector includes all uses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of class I and class II substances to produce cooling, including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mechanical and non-mechanical refrigeration, air conditioning, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heat transfer. Please refer to the final SNAP rule (59 FR 13044) for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a more detailed description of this sector. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The refrigeration and air conditioning sector is divided into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the following end-uses: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;commercial comfort air conditioning;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;industrial process refrigeration system;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;industrial process air conditioning;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;ice skating rinks;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;uranium isotope separation processing;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;cold storage warehouses;

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;refrigerated transport; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;retail food refrigeration; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;vending machines; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;water coolers; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;commercial ice machines; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;household refrigerators;

&bull;motor vehicle air conditioning; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;residential air conditioning and heat pumps; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;non-mechanical heat transfer; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;very low temperature refrigeration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, each end-use is divided into retrofit and new equipment applications. EPA has not necessarily reviewed
substitutes in every 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
end-use for this NPRM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has modified the list of end-uses for this sector for this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SNAP update. First, EPA has changed the name of the heat transfer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
end-use to non-mechanical heat transfer. This change is intended to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
avoid confusion between systems that move heat from a cool area to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warm one (mechanical refrigeration) and systems that simply aid the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
movement of heat away from warm areas (non-mechanical heat transfer). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second change is that EPA added a new end-use, very low 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature refrigeration. Substitutes for this end-use have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reviewed since the final rule, and therefore have been added for this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SNAP update. Finally, EPA has also reviewed substitutes for CFC&hyph;13, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
R&hyph;13B1, and R&hyph;503 industrial process refrigeration. Please refer to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the final SNAP rule (59 FR 13044) for a detailed description of end-uses other than these three. EPA may continue to
add other end-uses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in future SNAP updates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a. Non-mechanical Heat Transfer.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As discussed above, this end-use includes all cooling systems that rely on a fluid to remove heat from a heat source
to a cooler area, rather than relying on mechanical refrigeration to move heat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from a cool area to a warm one. Generally, there are two types of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems: systems with fluid pumps, referred to as recirculating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coolers, and those that rely on natural convection currents, known as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thermosyphons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b. Very Low Temperature Refrigeration.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Medical freezers, freeze-dryers, and other small appliances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require extremely reliable refrigeration cycles. These systems must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meet stringent technical standards that do not normally apply to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigeration systems. They usually have very small charges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because they operate at very high vapor pressures, and because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance is critically affected by any charge loss, standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintenance for these systems tends to reduce leakage to a level 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considerably below that for other types of refrigeration and air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditioning equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
c. CFC&hyph;13, R&hyph;13B1, and R&hyph;503 Industrial Process Refrigeration.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This end-use differs from other types of industrial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigeration only in the extremely low temperature regimes that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required. Although some substitutes may work in both these extremely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
low temperatures and in systems designed to use R&hyph;502, they are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptable only for this end-use because of global warming and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
atmospheric lifetime concerns. These concerns are discussed more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fully below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Substitutes for Refrigerants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Substitutes fall into eight broad categories. Seven of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categories are chemical substitutes used in the same vapor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compression cycle as the ozone-depleting substances being replaced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
They include hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), hydrofluorocarbons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(HFCs), hydrocarbons, refrigerant blends, ammonia, perfluorocarbons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(PFCs), and chlorine systems. The eighth category includes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative technologies that generally do not rely on vapor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compression cycles. Please refer to the final SNAP rule (59 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FR
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13044) for more discussion of these broad categories. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a. Acceptable Subject to Use Conditions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) CFC&hyph;12 Automobile and Non-automobile Motor Vehicle Air Conditioners, Retrofit and New. EPA is concerned
that the existence of several substitutes in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this end-use may increase the likelihood of significant refrigerant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cross-contamination and potential failure of both air conditioning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems and recovery/recycling equipment. In addition, a smooth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transition to the use of substitutes strongly depends on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continued purity of the recycled CFC&hyph;12 supply. In order to prevent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cross-contamination and preserve the purity of recycled refrigerants, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing several conditions on the use of all motor vehicle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
air conditioning refrigerants. For the purposes of this rule, no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distinction is made between ``retrofit'' and ``drop-in'' refrigerants; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retrofitting a car to use a new refrigerant includes all procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that result in the air conditioning system using a new refrigerant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In particular, when retrofitting a CFC&hyph;12 system to use any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substitute refrigerant, the following conditions must be met: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Each refrigerant may only be used with a set of fittings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that is unique to that refrigerant. These fittings (male 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or female, as appropriate) must be used with all containers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the refrigerant, on can taps, on recovery, recycling, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and charging equipment, and on all air conditioning system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service ports. These fittings must be designed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mechanically prevent cross-charging with another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

&bull;No substitute refrigerant may be used to ``top-off'' a system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that uses another refrigerant. The original refrigerant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be recovered in accordance with regulations issued 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under section 609 of the CAA prior to charging with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substitute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since these use conditions necessitate unique fittings and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
labels, it will be necessary for developers of automotive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigerants to consult with EPA about the existence of other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternatives. Such discussions will lower the risk of duplicating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fittings already in use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No determination guarantees satisfactory performance from a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigerant. Consult the original equipment manufacturer or service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personnel for further information on using a refrigerant in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) HFC&hyph;134a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HFC&hyph;134a is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 in retrofitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and new motor vehicle air conditioners, subject to the use conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable to motor vehicle air conditioning described above.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HFC&hyph;134a does not contribute to ozone depletion. HFC&hyph;134a's GWP and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
atmospheric lifetime are close to those of other alternatives which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been determined to be acceptable for this end-use. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HFC&hyph;134a's contribution to global warming could be significant in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
leaky end-uses such as motor vehicle air conditioning systems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(MVACS). EPA has determined that the use of HFC&hyph;134a in these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications is acceptable because industry continues to develop 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technology to limit emissions. In addition, the number of available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substitutes for use in MVACS is currently limited. HFC&hyph;134a is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flammable and its toxicity is low. While HFC&hyph;134a is compatible with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most existing refrigeration and air conditioning equipment parts, it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is not compatible with the mineral oils currently used in such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems. An appropriate ester-based, polyalkylene glycol-based, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other type of lubricant should be used. Consult the original 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment manufacturer or the retrofit kit manufacturer for further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) R&hyph;401C. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
R&hyph;401C, which consists of HCFC&hyph;22, HFC&hyph;152a, and HCFC&hyph;124, is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 in retrofitted and new motor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle air conditioners, subject to the use conditions applicable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
motor vehicle air conditioning described above.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 HCFC&hyph;22 and HCFC&hyph;124 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contribute to ozone depletion, but to a much lesser degree than CFC&hyph;12. The production of HCFC&hyph;22 will
be phased out according to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accelerated phaseout schedule (published 12/10/93, 58 FR 65018). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GWP of HCFC&hyph;22 is somewhat higher than other alternatives for this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
end-use. Experimental data indicate that HCFC&hyph;22 may leak through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flexible hosing in mobile air conditioners at a high rate. In order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to preserve the blend's composition and to reduce its contribution to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
global warming, EPA strongly recommends using barrier hoses when hose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assemblies need to be replaced during a retrofit procedure. The GWPs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the other components are low. Although this blend does contain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one flammable constituent, the blend itself is not flammable. Leak 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing demonstrated that the blend never becomes flammable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) HCFC Blend Beta. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HCFC Blend Beta is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 in retrofitted and new motor vehicle air conditioners,
subject to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use conditions applicable to motor vehicle air conditioning described 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The composition of this blend has been claimed confidential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the manufacturer. This blend contains at least one HCFC, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore contributes to ozone depletion, but to a much lesser degree 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than CFC&hyph;12. Regulations regarding recycling and reclamation issued 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under section 609 of the Clean Air Act apply to this blend. Its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production will be phased out according to the accelerated schedule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(published 12/10/93, 58 FR 65018). The GWPs of the components are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
moderate to low. This blend is nonflammable, and leak testing has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrated that the blend never becomes flammable.

N. PFCs offer high dielectric resistance and they are low in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxicity and nonflammable. The principal characteristic of concern 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for PFCs is that they have long atmospheric lifetimes and have the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential to contribute to global climate change. For instance, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
12
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 has a lifetime of 4,100 years and a 100-year GWP of 5,600. PFCs are also included in the Climate Change Action Plan which

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
broadly instructs EPA to use section 612 of the CAA, as well as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
voluntary programs, to control emissions. Despite these concerns, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing to list PFCs as acceptable in certain small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications because they may be the only substitutes that can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfy safety or performance requirements. For example, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transformer may require very high dielectric strength, or a heat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transfer system for a chlorine manufacturing process could require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compatibility with the process stream. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Users should note, however, that use of a PFC should be a last 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resort. As the proposed determination states, PFCs should be used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``only where no other alternatives are technically feasible due to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety or performance requirements.'' This statement requires users 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to conduct a thorough search for other substitutes. Although EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not require users to submit information on such a search, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
companies must keep the results on file for future reference. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In cases where users must adopt PFCs, they should make every effort to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Recover and recycle these fluids during servicing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Adopt maintenance practices that reduce leakage as much as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is technically feasible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Recover these fluids after the end of the equipment's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
useful life and either recycle them or destroy them 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Continue to search for other long-term alternatives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Users of PFCs should note that if other alternatives become 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available, EPA could be petitioned to list PFCs as unacceptable due 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the availability of other suitable substitutes. If such a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petition were granted, EPA may grandfather existing uses but only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upon consideration of cost and timing of testing and implementation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of new substitutes. In addition, while this listing allows for use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of PFCs in some new systems, a petition indicating widespread design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of systems using PFCs where other alternatives exist could adversely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact any grandfathering decisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes these end-uses are covered under section 608 of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CAA and encourages voluntary compliance with the recycling and leak 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repair provisions of that rule until new rulemakings specifically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
address non-ozone-depleting refrigerants.

R&hyph;403B, which consists of HCFC&hyph;22, R&hyph;218, and propane, is proposed unacceptable as a substitute
for R&hyph;502 in the following new and retrofitted end-uses:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;industrial process refrigeration;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;cold storage warehouses;

&bull;commercial ice machines; and

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
R&hyph;218, perfluoropropane, has an extremely high GWP and lifetime. Although this substitute may offer energy
efficiency gains, its lifetime and direct GWP pose additional risk beyond that of other substitutes for these end-uses.
In particular, the lifetime of R&hyph;218 is over 2000 years, which means that global warming and other effects would
be essentially irreversible. EPA believes that while other substitutes may have high GWPs, they do not exhibit such
long lifetimes.

R&hyph;405A was listed as HCFC/HFC/fluoroalkane Blend A in previous notices. R&hyph;405A contains a high proportion
of R&hyph;c318, cycloperfluorobutane, which has an extremely high GWP and lifetime. Although this substitute may
offer energy efficiency gains, its lifetime and direct GWP pose additional risk beyond that of other substitutes
for these end-uses. In particular, the lifetime of R&hyph;c318 is over 3000 years, which means that global warming
and other effects would be essentially irreversible. EPA believes that while other substitutes may have high GWPs,
they do not exhibit such long lifetimes.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Flammability is the primary concern. EPA believes the use of this substitute in very leaky uses like motor vehicle
air conditioning may pose a high risk of fire. EPA requires a risk assessment be conducted to demonstrate this blend
may be safely used in any CFC&hyph;12 end-uses. The manufacturer of this blend has not submitted such a risk assessment,
and EPA therefore finds it unacceptable.

(4) Flammable Substitutes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Flammable substitutes, defined as having flammability limits as measured according to ASTM E&hyph;681 with modifications
included in Society of Automotive Engineers Recommended Practice J1657, including blends which become flammable
during fractionation, are proposed unacceptable as substitutes for CFC&hyph;12 in retrofitted motor vehicle air
conditioning systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Flammable refrigerants differ from traditional substances in several ways: potential gains in energy efficiency,
reductions in direct contribution to global warming, and additional risks from fire. Flammable refrigerants may
be good substitutes in systems designed with fire risks in mind. In addition, in certain circumstances, they may serve
well as substitutes in retrofit uses. EPA encourages research efforts into the use of flammable refrigerants, but
remains concerned about the dangers. Because of these concerns, EPA has established the requirement that manufacturers
of flammable refrigerants conduct detailed risk assessments in all end-uses. The risks from flammability are extremely
sensitive to the size of charge and end-use.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In MVACS, flammable refrigerants pose risks not found in stationary equipment, including the potential for collisions,
the placement of the condenser directly behind the grille, flexible hoses which could be punctured, the hazard to
technicians who are expecting to handle flammable fluids, the danger to passengers from evaporator leaks, and the
dangers to personnel involved in disposal of old automobiles. Due to the length of SNAP review, certain substitutes
have been marketed which EPA believes may pose substantial risk to users. The intent of the 90-day review process was
not to allow manufacturers to market risky substitutes, but rather to ensure a thorough review. Because of potential
risks to users and service personnel, EPA finds it necessary to find all flammable substitutes unacceptable in retrofitted
automotive air conditioning to prevent hazardous substitutes from being marketed prior to a thorough risk assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA continues to encourage investigation of all substitute refrigerants, including flammable substances. This
unacceptable determination only applies to retrofitted MVACS. If a manufacturer wishes an acceptable determination
for a flammable substitute in MVACS, this risk assessment must be conducted in a scientifically valid manner. EPA
will consider such a risk assessment in any determination on the substitute.

I (Halon 13001) is a fluoroiodocarbon with an atmospheric lifetime of only 1.15 days due to its rapid photolysis in
the presence of light. The resulting GWP of this agent is less than one, and its ODP when released at ground level is likely
to be extremely low, with current conservative estimates ranging from .008 to .01. Complete analysis of the ozone

I from aircraft, and the associated likelihood of a higher ODP value when released at altitude, the military has conducted
an analysis of historical releases of Halon 1301 from both military and commercial aircraft. Initial assessment
indicate that emissions from U.S. military aircraft appear to have averaged about 56 pounds annually, of which 2 pounds
were emitted above 30,000 feet. Commercial aircraft worldwide released an estimated average of 933 pounds of Halon
1301 annually, of which 158 pounds was released above 30,000 feet. While EPA is awaiting the results of the ODP calculations

Interest in this agent is very high because it may constitute a drop-in replacement to Halon 1301 on a weight and volume
basis. Initial tests have shown its weight equivalence for fire extinguishment to be 1.36, and its volume equivalence
to be 1.0, while for explosion inertion it is 1.42 and 1.04 respectively. The research community is continuing to qualify

The manufacturer is proposing to blend either of two halocarbons (HFC&hyph;125 or HFC&hyph;134a) with either ammonium
polyphosphate (which is not corrosive) or monoammonium phosphate (which is corrosive on hard surfaces). An initial
assessment of inhalation toxicology of fine particulates indicates that some risk exists of inhalation exposure
when the particles are below a certain size compared to the mass per cubic meter in air. Particle sizes less than 10 to
15 microns and a mass above the ACGIH nuisance dust levels raise concerns which need to be further studied. In a total
flooding application, the exposure levels may be of concern. In addition, because the discharge of powders obscures
vision, evacuation could be impeded. EPA is asking manufacturers of total flooding systems using powdered aerosols
to submit to the Agency a review of the medical implications of inhaling atmospheres flooded with fine powder particulates.
While the manufacturer requested a SNAP listing for unoccupied areas only, EPA would not consider its use in occupied
areas until the requested peer review is complete. Meanwhile, EPA is finding this technology acceptable for use in
normally unoccupied areas.

This alternative agent is formulated from a mixture of dry powders pressed together into pill form. Upon exposure
to heat from a fire, a pyrotechnic charge initiates a series of exothermic, gas-producing reactions composed mainly
of a mixture of nitrogen, carbon dioxide and water vapor, with small amounts of carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide, nitrogen
dioxide, and solid residues. The oxygen level in the room is largely depleted, thus extinguishing the fire.

or safety requirements: a) due to their physical or chemical properties or b) where human exposure to the agents may
approach cardiosensitization levels or result in other unacceptable health effects under normal operating conditions.

This agent is subject to the use conditions stipulated for all total flooding agents, that is: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Where egress from an area cannot be accomplished within one minute, the employer shall not use this agent in
concentrations exceeding its NOAEL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Where egress takes longer than 30 seconds but less than one minute, the employer shall not use the agent in a concentration
greater than its LOAEL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Agent concentrations greater than the LOAEL are only permitted in areas not normally occupied by employees
provided that any employee in the area can escape within 30 seconds. The employer shall assure that no unprotected
employees enter the area during agent discharge.

 can extinguish fires in a total flood application at concentrations of 7.30 per cent and therefore has a design concentration
of 8.8 per cent. The cardiotoxic NOAEL of 30 per cent for this agent is well above its extinguishment concentration;
therefore, it is safe for use in occupied areas. This agent has a weight equivalence of two-to-one by weight compared
to Halon 1301. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Using agents in high concentrations poses a risk of asphyxiation by displacing oxygen. With an ambient oxygen level
of 21 per cent, a design concentration of 22.6 per cent may reduce oxygen levels to approximately 16 per cent, the minimum
level considered to be required to prevent impaired judgement or other physiological effects. Thus, the oxygen level
resulting from discharge of this agent must be at least 16 per cent.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This agent has been developed by the U.S. Navy as a test gas simulant in place of halon in new halon total flooding systems
on ships which have been under construction prior to identification and qualification of substitute agents. Halon
systems are no longer included in designs for new ships. The Navy estimates its annual usage to be less than 10,000 pounds
annually, decreasing over time. Thus, the Agency believes that the quantities involved are not significant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

While SF

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is not currently used in the commercial sector and new halon systems are rarely installed, EPA is proposing a narrowed
use limit to ensure that emissions of this agent remain minimal. The NFPA 12a and NFPA 2001 standards recommend that
halon or other total flooding gases not be used in discharge testing, but that alternative methods of ensuring enclosure
and piping integrity and system functioning be used. Alternative methods can often be used, such as the ``door fan''
test for enclosure integrity, UL 1058 testing to ensure system functioning, pneumatic test of installed piping,
and a ``puff'' test to ensure against internal blockages in the piping network. These stringent design and testing
requirements have largely obviated the need to perform a discharge test for total flood systems containing either
Halon 1301 or a substitute agent.

HFC&hyph;32 is proposed unacceptable as a total flooding agent. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HFC&hyph;32 has been determined to be flammable, with a large flammability range, and is therefore inappropriate
as a halon substitute when used as a pure agent. This agent was proposed acceptable in the first SNAP proposed rulemaking
(58 FR 28093, May 12, 1993) but public comment received indicated agreement about the flammability characteristics
of this agent. EPA is not aware of any interest in commercializing this agent as a fire suppression agent.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866, (58 FR 51735; October 4, 1993) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines
``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the
economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity,
competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities;
(2) create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
alter the budgetary impact of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients
thereof; or (4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the
principles set forth in the Executive Order.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has been determined that this rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the terms of Executive Order
12866 and is therefore not subject to OMB review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;602, requires that federal agencies examine the effects of their
regulations on small entities. Under 5 U.S.C. 604(a), whenever an agency is required to publish a final rule-making,
it must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis (RFA). Such an analysis is not required if the head of the Agency
certifies that a rule will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities, pursuant
to 5 U.S.C. 605(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency believes that this final rule will not have a significant effect on a substantial number of small entities
and has therefore concluded that a formal RFA is unnecessary. Because costs of the SNAP requirements as a whole are
expected to be minor, the rule is unlikely to adversely affect businesses, particularly as the rule exempts small
sectors and end-uses from reporting requirements and formal Agency review. In fact, to the extent that information
gathering is more expensive and time-consuming for small companies, this rule may well provide benefits for small
businesses anxious to examine potential substitutes to any ozone-depleting class I and class II substances they
may be using, by requiring manufacturers to make information on such substitues available.

<!-- PJG 007 0104 intable -->
EPA is concerned that the existence of several substitutes in this end-use may increase the likelihood of significant
refrigerant cross-contamination and potential failure of both air conditioning systems and recovery/recycling
equipment. In addition, a smooth transition to the use of substitutes strongly depends on the continued purity of
the recycled CFC&hyph;12 supply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0120 intable -->
For the purposes of this rule, no distinction is made between ``retrofit'' and ``drop-in'' refrigerants; retrofitting
a car to use a new refrigerant includes all procedures that result in the air conditioning system using a new refrigerant.

Users must observe the limitations on PFC acceptability by making reasonable efforts to undertake the following
measures: 
<!-- PJG 007 0120 intable -->
(i) conduct an evaluation of foreseeable conditions of end use; 
<!-- PJG 007 0120 intable -->
(ii) determine that human exposure to the other alternative extinguishing agents may approach or result in cardiosensitization
or other unacceptable toxicity effects under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
normal operating conditions; and 
<!-- PJG 007 0120 intable -->
(iii) determine that the physical or chemical properties or other technical constraints of the other available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agents preclude their use; 
<!-- PJG 007 0120 intable -->
Documentation of such measures must be available for review upon request.

The principal environmental characteristic of concern for PFCs is that they have high GWPs and long atmospheric lifetimes.
Actual contributions to global warming depend upon the quantities of PFCs emitted.
