SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) hereby adopts regulations for specific crop provisions to insure
cotton. These provisions will supplement the Common Crop Insurance Policy (&sect;457.8) which contains standard
terms and conditions common to most crops. The intended effect of this rule is to move specific crop provisions for
insuring cotton from the General Crop Insurance Policy (&sect;401.8) to the Common Crop Insurance Policy (&sect;457.8)
for ease of use by the public and conformance among policy terms.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This action has been reviewed under USDA procedures established by Executive Order 12866 and Departmental Regulation
1512&hyph;1. This action constitutes a review as to the need, currency, clarity, and effectiveness of these regulations
under those procedures. The sunset review date established for these regulations is March 1, 1999.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has been determined under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, that this rule does not have sufficient
federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a federalism assessment. The policies and procedures contained
in this rule will not have substantial direct effects on states or their political subdivisions, or on the distribution
of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The amount of work required
of the insurance companies delivering these policies will not increase from the amount required to deliver previous
policies. Therefore, this action is determined to be exempt from the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act
and no Regulatory Flexibility Analysis was prepared.

The Office of the General Counsel has determined that these regulations meet the applicable standards provided in
subsections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12788. The provisions of this rule will preempt state and local laws
to the extent such state and local laws are inconsistent herewith. The administrative appeal provisions located
at 7 CFR part 400, subpart J must be exhausted before judicial action may be brought.

This action is not expected to have any significant impact on the quality of the human environment, health, and safety.
Therefore, neither an Environmental Assessment nor an Environmental Impact Statement is needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By separate rule, 7 CFR 401.119 will be amended to restrict the crop years of application to those prior to the crop year
for which this rule will be effective. FCIC will terminate the provisions of the present policy at the end of the crop
year and remove and reserve the cotton endorsement contained in 7 CFR 401.119.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On Tuesday, May 31, 1994, FCIC published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at 59 FR 28022 proposing to revise the Common Crop Insurance Regulations by adding new provisions for cotton crop insurance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following publication of the proposed rule, the public was afforded 30 days to submit written comments, data, and
opinions. The comments received and FCIC responses are as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Two comments suggested that the crop provisions should not be implemented for the 1995 crop year because:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Crop insurance reform will require many policy changes. Implementation of these crop provisions should be tabled
until reform decisions are reached because impacts on policy terms are not yet clear. Delaying common policy implementation
until it can be implemented in an orderly fashion should be beneficial to everyone concerned; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Common Crop Insurance Policy should be thoroughly reviewed and revised as needed before any additional crop
provisions are implemented under it.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Program changes necessary to comply with crop insurance reform will have the same effects on either the existing cotton
policy or these Cotton Crop Provisions. Any necessary changes can be made to the Cotton Crop Provisions as easily as
they can be made to the existing policy. FCIC has recently completed a review of the Common Crop Insurance Policy Basic
Provisions (&sect;457.8). Any necessary changes required to be made to the Basic Provisions as a result of reform
will be required whether or not the Cotton Crop Provisions have been implemented. Therefore, FCIC does not find it
necessary to delay implementation for either of the reasons stated in the comments.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One comment questioned requirements contained in the definition of ``Practical to replant.'' This definition indicated
that the replanted acreage must have the potential to produce at least ninety percent (90%) of the production guarantee.
The late planting provisions provide production guarantees much lower than the ninety percent (90%) potential requirement
contained in the definition even though the late planted and replanted crop may be planted at the same time. The comment
recommended removing the production potential requirement from the definition of ``practical to replant.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 FCIC agrees that the production potential required by the definition of ``practical to replant'' and the production
guarantee for late planted acreage may be inconsistent depending on the time of planting. Acreage initially planted
twenty-five (25) days after the final planting date would have a production guarantee equal to sixty percent (60%)
of the guarantee for timely planted acreage, while the definition of ``practical to replant'' would require acreage
replanted at the same time to have a production potential equal to ninety percent (90%) of the production guarantee.
However, expected yield does have an effect on whether it is practical to replant. The ninety percent (90%) production
potential requirement has been removed from the definition of ``practical to replant.'' However, the expected yield
must be sufficient to cover production costs and must be at a level that growers in the area would normally care for and
harvest.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One comment recommended changing the term ``approved yield'' to ``approved APH yield'' in the definition of ``Production
guarantee'' to correspond with terminology in underwriting procedure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Underwriting procedure contains several methods which may be used to determine approved yields. These include the
use of yields which may not represent actual production history (APH). Using the term ``APH'' could be misleading
to readers not familiar with administrative procedures, and, therefore, will not be used in the crop insurance policy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Three comments disagreed with the definition of ``Written agreement''. This definition required written agreements
to be requested at least 15 days prior to the sales closing date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) One comment recommended keeping the current deadlines for written agreements as specified in procedures. These
procedures require that requests be made not later than 15 days after the acreage reporting date for most types of written
agreements. Setting a deadline 15 days prior to the sales closing date will either force insureds to submit requests
for written agreements they may not need, or result in uninsurable acreage if requests are not made for all possible
situations. Unnecessary requests will increase paperwork for the insured, agent, FCIC Regional Service Office
and company. The comment also recommended deleting the last sentence of the definition, which required written agreements
to contain all variable terms including, but not limited to, crop variety, guarantee, premium and price election.
The comment indicated it was not necessary to include this information on every written agreement because many written
agreements do not alter these items.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) One comment recommended keeping the deadline of 15 days after the acreage reporting date because there are many
instances when it is not known that a written agreement is necessary until the acreage is reported. The comment stated
that the change would be an unreasonable requirement and would create difficulties since the sales closing dates
will be 30 days earlier than in prior years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) One comment stated that it is hard to understand why the written agreement deadline is 15 days prior to the time a
producer has to purchase coverage, and that a more appropriate date should be established. The comment also stated
that the sales closing dates are not listed in the proposed crop provisions. If these are the same date as the cancellation
and termination date, the policy should so indicate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed definition was intended to require that requests for written agreements be made far enough ahead of the
sales closing date to allow the insurer to make the offer, and for the insured to accept the offer, by the sales closing
date. Since the insurance policy is a written contract, both parties must have a meeting of the minds before the contract
is valid. The terms and conditions of the policy must be known by the final date for establishing the insurance contract.
In this program, the final date is the sales closing date. FCIC has determined that some situations may allow written
agreements at other times. FCIC is preparing proposed written agreement regulations which will specify when written
agreements must be completed. Until these regulations have been published, the written agreement must be completed
by the sales closing date, or, in specific instances, a written agreement may be requested or approved after the sales
closing date if the crop is physically inspected and a determination made that the crop has an expectancy of making
the guaranteed yield. No prevented planting liability will be established as a result of any request submitted after
the sales closing date. FCIC does not agree that the final sentence should be deleted. Specifying all variable terms
in the written agreement is necessary to assure a clear understanding of the terms in effect.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the sales closing dates normally will be the same as the cancellation and termination dates this is not always
the case. Therefore, the sales closing dates will not be included in the crop provisions. Federal regulations authorize
the Manager of FCIC to extend the sales closing date in any county upon the Manager's determination that no adverse
selection will result during the extended period. The extended date is placed on file in the applicable service offices
and a notice is placed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If the sales closing dates were contained in the crop provisions, the crop provisions would need to be amended each
time a sales closing date is extended.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment stated that unit division language contained in subsection 2.(b) should allow for situations in which
the insured creates a discernible break via some tillage operation. The proposed provision states that the insured
must plant the crop in a manner that results in a clear and discernible break in the planting pattern at the boundaries
of each optional unit. There is no required method of creating a boundary as long as a discernible break is provided.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The intent of the policy language is to allow separate optional units if acreage is farmed separately. Farming separately
includes planting separately and keeping separate records of inputs, production, etc. Creating a boundary after
the crop is planted by means of a tillage operation along a section line may or may not meet the policy requirement of
planting the crop in a manner that results in a clear and discernible break at the units boundary. FCIC believes the
present language clearly sets out the requirements for unit division.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two comments were received regarding the changes in the cancellation and termination dates.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) One comment stated the assumption that since cancellation and termination dates were changed, that the sales
closing dates will be changed to align with the new cancellation and termination dates.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) One comment expressed the concern that an earlier cancellation date would decrease the amount of time available
for producers to make decisions regarding their insurance coverage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The sales closing dates, as contained in the Special Provisions, will be changed generally to be the same as, but no
later than, the new cancellation and termination dates. Earlier cancellation and sales closing dates are intended
to reduce the possibility that a producer's decision to cancel or purchase insurance is based on favorable or unfavorable
growing conditions. FCIC expects this change to have favorable impact on insurance experience. Favorable results
will be considered when calculating future premium rates.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One comment stated that section 6 (Insured Crop) indicates that colored cotton will be insurable under the cotton
crop provisions. However, the introductory information in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 indicates the FCIC Regional Service Offices will issue production guarantees for colored cotton via written agreement
until adequate actual production history is available for individual policyholders. The comment recommended that
language to this effect be added to the policy, either in section 3 of the crop provisions or in the special provisions.
The comment asked if the Crop Insurance Handbook will be revised to state that insureds must keep production history
separate for colored cotton, what constitutes ``adequate production history,'' and what information must be sent
in with the request for a written agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FCIC's research indicates that the production potential for some colored cottons is significantly less than white
upland cotton and that the value may be significantly higher. Insufficient data are currently available to establish
production guarantees, prices, quality adjustment methods, etc. for colored cottons. Because data are insufficient,
FCIC believes that colored cotton should be insurable only with a written agreement. Therefore, the provisions in
section 6 (Insured Crop) have been changed accordingly. When requesting a written agreement, the insured should
submit any available production history, the number of acres intended for planting in the current crop year, and other
information normally required when requesting insurance for an uninsurable crop type. The Crop Insurance Handbook
will be revised to indicate specific requirements as soon as it is practical to do so.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two comments were received regarding the elimination of provisions that provided coverage while cotton stored in
modules remains in the field.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) One comment stated that changing the end of the insurance period from ``removal from the field'' to ``harvest''
creates some concerns which need to be addressed. Specifically, the comment asks how quality will be accurately determined
for cotton stored in modules when the modules may be stored in the field for a significant period of time?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) One comment opposed the removal of coverage for modules stored in the field. The comment stated that: (a) Large
amounts of cotton are stored in modules and that the practice allows for timely and efficient harvest of the crop; (b)
losses do not occur frequently once cotton is moduled, but there is some risk of weather-related loss until the modules
are removed from the field; and (c) continuing the practice of insurance coverage until removal from the field would
be consistent with recent ad hoc disaster rulings that deemed weather-damaged, field stored modules eligible for
assistance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Upon further review, FCIC has determined that coverage for modules stored in the field should be provided. Approximately
seventy percent (70%) of the U.S. crop is stored in modules until ginning can take place, and cotton stored in modules
is not as susceptible to loss as cotton remaining on the stalk. The provisions in section 8 (Insurance Period) have
been revised accordingly.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment recommended either revising or deleting provisions that allow the insured to leave representative samples
if they disagree with the insurer's appraisal. In the event the provision cannot be deleted, the comment recommended
changing the provision so that the insurer can decide when using representative samples is appropriate. In many situations,
samples are more susceptible to loss and do not accurately represent what the entire unit would have produced.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FCIC agrees that there are situations in which it may not be reasonable to leave representative strips from which production
to count would ultimately be determined. The samples could be more vulnerable to damage than an entire field, or the
insurer may be confident that the appraisal made accurately reflects production potential. However, the entire
provision should not be removed. The provision has been changed to allow the insurer to determine those situations
in which it is reasonable to leave representative samples to determine the amount of production to be counted. In cases
where it is necessary to defer determinations the insured must be advised how production to count will ultimately
be determined and the consequences of failure to leave or care for the samples.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment recommended that language in subsection 12.(b) be changed to require only one notice for prevented planting
acreage rather than requiring notice three days after the final planting date and three days after the date the insured
stops planting within the late planting period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The crop provisions provide two distinct periods during which the insured may be prevented from planting (i.e., by
the final planting date and during the late planting period). The notice requirement allows the insurer the opportunity
to verify that the acreage could not have been planted during such periods. FCIC agrees that an insured should only
be required to give one notice if it is sufficient to cover all acreage for prevented planting purposes. Subsection
12.(b) has been modified to clarify that written notice must be given not later than three days after the final planting
date for acreage the insured was prevented from planting by the final planting date, and not later than three days after
the date the insured discovers that planting will not be possible if the insured was not prevented from planting such

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment indicated that the proposed provisions in paragraph 12.(d)(3) will allow an insured to request a written
agreement for prevented planting coverage for acreage exceeding the policy limitations, and to subsequently enroll
in a USDA program that allows less acreage to be planted. The comment recommended revising the paragraph to limit eligible
acreage to the amount allowed by any applicable USDA program, regardless of when the insured enrolls in such program
or any previously approved written agreement.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FCIC agrees that, if the farm is enrolled in an USDA program that limits the number of acres planted, acreage in excess
of the amount allowed under an USDA program should not be eligible for prevented planting coverage. Paragraph 12.(d)(3)
has been amended accordingly.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment recommended that language be added to paragraph 12.(d)(3) to allow prevented planting coverage by written
agreement for acreage added to the insured's farming operation after the sales closing date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The insurance period for prevented planting coverage begins on the sales closing date. Allowing additional coverage
to attach after the beginning of this period would likely result in coverage being requested primarily when conditions
are favorable for a prevented planting indemnity. This adverse selection should be avoided to help maintain an actuarially
sound program and to keep premium rates from rising to cover such losses. The definition of ``written agreement''
has been amended to specifically disallow any prevented planting liability as a result of any request submitted after
the sales closing date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the changes indicated in the responses to comments, FCIC has determined that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
skip-row 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
should reference United States Department of Agriculture qualification requirements for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
skip-row 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
patterns. These requirements are used to determine the land area that is considered to be planted to cotton.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Provisions in section 6 (Insured Crop) are modified to allow coverage on crops planted into an established grass
or legume in certain instances. The increased emphasis on Highly Erodible Land Conservation had made conservation
tillage and no-till more acceptable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. New small grain and cotton varieties that mature earlier than previously available varieties make ``double cropping''
more practical. However, in areas where soil moisture may be depleted by the first crop planted, this practice may
not be feasible or may result in significantly more risk to the insurer. To allow insurance for this practice, yet limit
the insurer's vulnerability in areas where ``double cropping'' may not be practical, section 6 of the crop provisions
have been modified to allow insurance for ``double cropped'' cotton only if allowed by a written agreement or the Special
Provisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the rule, ``Common Crop Insurance Regulations; Cotton Crop Insurance Provisions'' published at 59
FR 28022 as revised as set out below is hereby adopted as final rule.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) You must have records, which can be independently verified, of planted acreage and production for each optional
unit for at least the last crop year used to determine your production guarantee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) You must plan the crop in a manner that results in a clear and discernable break in the planting pattern at the boundaries
of each optional unit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) You must have records of measurement of stored or marketed production from each optional unit maintained in such
a manner that we can verify the production from each optional unit or the production from each optional unit must be
kept separate until after loss adjustment under the policy is completed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Each optional unit must meet one or more of the following criteria as applicable;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Optional Units by Section, Section Equivalent, or ASCS Farm Serial Number:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Optional units may be established if each optional unit is located in a separate legally identified Section. In the
absence of Sections, we may consider parcels of land legally identified by other methods of measure including, but
not limited to: Spanish grants, railroad surveys, leagues, labors, or Virginia Military Lands an equivalent of Sections
for unit purposes. In areas which have not been surveyed using the systems identified above, or another system approved
by us, or in areas where such systems exist but boundaries are not readily discernable, each optional unit must be located
in a separate farm identified by a single ASCS Farm Serial Number.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Optional Units on Acreage Including Both Irrigated and Non-irrigated Practices:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 In addition to or instead of establishing optional units by Section, section equivalent, or ASCS Farm Serial Number,
optional units may be based or irrigated acreage or non-irrigated acreage if both are located in the same Section,
section equivalent, or ASCS Farm Serial Number. The irrigated acreage may not extend beyond the point at which your
irrigation system can deliver the quantity of water needed to produce the yield on which your guarantee is based and
you may not continue into non-irrigated acreage in the same rows or planting pattern. You must plant, cultivate, fertilize,
or otherwise care for the irrigated acreage in accordance with recognized good irrigated farming practices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Basic units may not be divided into optional units on any basis including, but not limited to: Production practice,
type, variety, or planting period, other than as described above. If you do not comply fully with these provisions,
we will combine all optional units which are not in compliance with these provisions into the unit from which they were
formed. We may combine the optional units at any time we discover that you have failed to comply with these provisions.
If failure to comply with these provisions on all optional units is determined to be inadvertent, and the optional
units are combined, premium paid for the purpose of electing optional units will be refunded to you.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 -->
11. Settlement of Claim
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide records of production:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) For any optional unit, we will combine all optional units for which acceptable records of production were not provided;
or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For any basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the
harvested acreage for each unit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim on any unit by:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Multiplying the insured acreage by the production guarantee;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Subtracting from this the total production to count;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(iii) Unharvested production (mature unharvested production of white cotton may be adjusted for quality deficiencies
in accordance with subsection 11.(d)); and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Potential production on insured acreage you want to put to another use or you wish to abandon or no longer care for,
if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage
will end if you put the acreage to another use or abandon the crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production
is not reached:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop we may give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree
to leave intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the crop in locations acceptable to us
(The amount of production to count for such acreage will be based on the harvested production of appraisals from the
samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not leave the required samples intact, or you fail to provide
sufficient care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put the acreage to another use will
be used to determine the amount of production to count); or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of production to count for the acreage will be the harvested
production, or our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not harvested; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage, including any mature cotton retrieved from the ground.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Mature white cotton may be adjusted for quality when production has been damaged by insured causes. Such production
to count will be reduced if the price quotation for cotton of like quality (price quotation ``A'') for the applicable
growth area is less than seventy-five percent (75%) of price quotation ``B.'' Price quotation ``B'' is defined as
the price quotation for the applicable growth area for cotton of the color and leaf grade, staple length, and micronaire
reading designated in the Special Provisions for this purpose. Price quotations ``A'' and ``B'' will be the price
quotations contained in the Daily Spot Cotton Quotations published by the USDA Agricultural Marketing Service on
the date the last bale from the unit is classed. If the date the last bale classed is not available, the price quotations
will be determined on the date the last bale from the unit is delivered to the warehouse, as shown on the producer's account
summary obtained from the gin. If eligible for adjustment, the amount of production to be counted will be determined
by multiplying the number of pounds of such production by the factor derived from dividing price quotation ``A'' by
seventy-five percent (75%) of price quotation ``B.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Colored cotton lint will not be eligible for quality adjustment.

12. Late Planting and Prevented Planting
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) In lieu of paragraph 8.(b)(2) and subsection 1.(aa) of the Common Crop Insurance Policy (&sect;457.8), insurance
will be provided for acreage planted to the insured crop during the late planting period (see subsection (c)), and
acreage you were prevented from planting (see subsection (d)). These coverages provide reduced production guarantees.
The reduced guarantees will be combined with the production guarantee for timely planted acreage for each unit. The
premium amount for late planted acreage and eligible prevented planting acreage will be the same as that for timely
planted acreage. If the amount of premium you are required to pay (gross premium less our subsidy) for late planted
acreage or prevented planting acreage exceeds the liability on such acreage, coverage for those acres will not be
provided (no premium will be due and no indemnity will be paid for such acreage). (For example, assume you insure one
unit in which you have a 100 percent (100%) share. The unit consists of 150 acres, of which 50 acres were planted timely,
50 acres were planted 7 days after the final planting date (late planted), and 50 acres are unplanted and eligible for
prevented planting coverage. To calculate the amount of any indemnity which may be due to you, the production guarantee
for the unit will be computed as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) For timely planted acreage, multiply the per acre production guarantee for timely planted acreage by the 50 acres
planted timely;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For late planted acreage, multiply the per acre production guarantee for timely planted acreage by ninety-three
percent (0.93) and multiply the result by the 50 acres planted late; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) For prevented planting acreage, multiply the per acre production guarantee for timely planted acreage by thirty-five
percent (0.35) and multiply the result by the 50 acres eligible for prevented planting coverage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total of the three calculations will be the production guarantee for the unit. Your premium will be based on the
result of multiplying the per acre production guarantee per acre for timely planted acreage by the 150 acres in the
unit.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) You must provide written notice to us if you were prevented from planting (see subsection 1.(n)). This notice must
be given not later than three days after:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The final planting date for acreage you were prevented from planting by the final planting date if you have unplanted
acreage that may be eligible for prevented planting coverage; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The date you discover that planting will not be possible within the late planting period for acreage that may be
eligible for prevented planting coverage if you were not prevented from planting such acreage by the final planting
date, but were prevented from planting such acreage during the late planting period.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(c) Late Planting
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) For cotton acreage planted after the final planting date but on or before 25 days after the final planting date,
the production guarantee for each acre will be reduced for each day planted after the final planting date by:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) One percent (.01) for the first through the tenth day; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Two percent (.02) for the eleventh through the twenty-fifth day.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In addition to the requirements of section 6 (Report of Acreage) of the Common Crop Insurance Policy (&sect;457.8),
you must report the dates the acreage is planted within the late planting period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If planting of cotton continues after the final planting date, or you are prevented from planting during the late
planting period, the acreage reporting date will be the later of:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The acreage reporting date contained in the Special Provisions; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Five (5) days after the end of the late planting period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Prevented Planting (Including Planting After the Late Planting Period)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If you were prevented from planting cotton (see subsection 1.(n)), you may elect:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) To plant cotton during the late planting period (The production guarantee for such acreage will be determined
in accordance with paragraph 12.(c)(1));
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Not to plant this acreage to any crop that is intended for harvest in the same crop year, (the production guarantee
for such acreage will be thirty-five percent (0.35) of the production guarantee for timely planted acres. For example,
if your production guarantee for timely planted acreage is 700 pounds per acre, your prevented planting production
guarantee would be equivalent to 245 pounds per acre (700 pounds multiplied by 0.35). This subparagraph does not prohibit
the preparation and care of the acreage for conservation practices, such as planting a cover crop, as long as such crop
is not intended for harvest.); or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) To plant cotton after the late planting period, (the production guarantee for such acreage will be thirty-five
percent (0.35) of the production guarantee for timely planted acres. For example, if your production guarantee for
timely planted acreage is 700 pounds per acre, your prevented planting production guarantee would be equivalent
to 245 pounds per acre (700 pounds multiplied by 0.35). Production to count for such acreage will be determined in accordance
with subsections 11.(c) and (d)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In addition to the provisions of section 11 (Insurance Period) of the Common Crop Insurance Policy (&sect;457.8),
the insurance period for prevented planting coverage begins on the sales closing date contained in the Special Provisions
for the insured crop in the county.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The acreage to which prevented planting coverage applies will be limited as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If you participate in any program administered by the United States Department of Agriculture for the crop year
which limits the number of acres that may be planted, prevented planting acreage will not exceed the ASCS base acreage
for the insured crop, reduced by any acreage reduction applicable to the farm under such program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If you do not participate in any program administered by the United States Department of Agriculture which limits
the number of acres that may be planted, unless a written agreement exists to the contrary, eligible acreage will not
exceed the greater of:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The ASCS base acreage for the insured crop, if applicable;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The number of acres planted to cotton on each ASCS Farm Serial Number during the previous crop year (adjusted for
any reconstitution which may have occurred prior to the sales closing date); or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) One hundred percent (100%) of the simple average of the number of acres planted to cotton during the crop years that
were used to determine your yield.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Acreage intended to be planted under an irrigated practice will be limited to the number of acres properly prepared
to carry out an irrigated practice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) A prevented planting production guarantee will not be provided for:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Any acreage that does not constitute at least 20 acres or 20 percent (20%) of the acres in the unit, whichever is less;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Land for which the actuarial table does not designate a premium rate unless a written agreement is in place designating
such premium rate;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Land used for conservation purposes or intended to be or considered to have been left unplanted under any program
administered by the United States Department of Agriculture;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Land on which any crop, other than cotton, has been planted and is intended for harvest, or has been harvested in
the same crop year; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) Land which planting history or conservation plans indicate would remain fallow for crop rotation purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) For the purpose of determining eligible acreage for prevented planting coverage, acreage for all units will be
combined and reduced by the number of cotton acres timely planted after the final planting date. (For example, assume
you have 100 acres eligible for prevented planting coverage in which you have a 100 percent (100%) share. The acreage
is located in a single ASCS Farm Serial Number which you insure as two separate optional units consisting of 50 acres
each. If you planted 60 acres of cotton on one optional unit and 40 acres of cotton on the second optional unit, your prevented
planting eligible acreage would be reduced to zero. (100 acres eligible for prevented planting coverage minus 100
acres planted equals zero). If you report more cotton acreage under this contract than is eligible for prevented planting
coverage, we will allocate the eligible acreage to insured units based on the number of prevented planting acres and
share your report for each unit.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) When the ASCS Farm Serial Number covers more than one unit, or a unit consists of more than one ASCS Farm Serial Number,
the covered acres will be pro-rated based on the number of acres in each unit or ASCS Farm Serial Number that could have
been planted to cotton in the crop year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) In accordance with the provisions of section 6 (Report of Acreage) of the Common Crop Insurance Policy (&sect;457.8),
you must report any insurable acreage you were prevented from planting. This report must be submitted on or before
the acreage reporting date, even though you may elect to plant the acreage after the late planting period. Any acreage
you report as eligible for prevented planting coverage which is not eligible will be deleted from prevented planting
coverage.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) hereby adopts regulations for specific crop provisions to insure
coarse grains (corn, grain sorghum, and soybeans). These provisions will supplement the Common Crop Insurance Policy
which contains standard terms and conditions common to most crops. This rule consolidates the provisions for insuring
coarse grains into one policy and provides insurance for corn intended to be harvested as silage and corn intended
to be harvested as grain without the previously required corn silage option. The intended effect of this rule is to
move specific crop provisions for insuring coarse grains from the General Crop Insurance Policy (&sect;401.8) to
the Common Crop Insurance Policy for ease of use by the public and conformance among policy terms.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This action has been reviewed under USDA procedures established by Executive Order 12866 and Departmental Regulation
1512&hyph;1. This action constitutes a review as to the need, currency, clarity, and effectiveness of these regulations
under those procedures. The sunset review date established for these regulations is March 1, 1999.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule has been determined to be ``not significant'' for purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore, has not
been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

), the information collection or record-keeping requirements included in this rule can be found in 7 CFR part 400,
subpart H.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has been determined under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, that this rule does not have sufficient
federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. The policies and procedures contained
in this rule will not have substantial direct effects on states of their political subdivisions, or on the distribution
of power and responsibilities among various levels of government.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The amount of work required
of the insurance companies delivering these policies will not increase from the amount of work required to deliver
previous policies. The combination of a number of previously independent policies into one policy should ease program
administration and increase efficiency. Therefore, this action is determined to be exempt from the provisions of
the Regulatory Flexibility Act and no Regulatory Flexibility Analysis was prepared.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This program is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation
with state and local officials. See the Notice related to 7 CFR Part 3015, Subpart V, published at 48 FR 29115, June 24,
1983.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Office of General Counsel has determined that these regulations meet the applicable standards provided in subsections
2(a) and 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12788. The provisions of this rule will preempt state and local laws to the extent
such state and local laws are inconsistent herewith. The administrative appeal provisions located at 7 CFR part 400,
subpart J must be exhausted before judicial action may be brought.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action is not expected to have any significant impact on the quality of the human environment, health, and safety.
Therefore, neither an Environmental Assessment nor an Environmental Impact Statement is needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule will provide one policy form for insuring corn, grain sorghum, and soybeans and provide insurance for corn
intended to be harvested as silage and corn intended to be harvested as grain without the previously required corn
silage option. Using one policy for these three crops will: (1) Substantially reduce paperwork by issuing one policy
form rather than the three separate policies previously used; (2) reduce the time involved to amend or revise the provisions
by eliminating repetitious review processes; and (3) continue to allow insured the flexibility to elect any of the
three coarse grain crops they wish to insure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By separate rule, FCIC will revise and later remove the corn, grain sorghum and soybean endorsements contained in
7 CFR 401.111, 7 CFR 401.113 and 7 CFR 401.117 and the Corn Silage Option contained in 7 CFR 401.112. These regulations
will be amended to restrict the crop years of application to those prior to the crop year for which this rule will be effective.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On Tuesday, May 31, 1994, FCIC published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at 59 FR 28016 proposing to revise the Common Crop Insurance Regulations by adding new provisions for corn, grain sorghum,
and soybean crop insurance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following publication of the proposed rule, the public was afforded 30 days to submit written comments, data, and
opinions. Comments were received from the crop insurance industry. The comments received and FCIC responses are
as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Two comments suggested that the crop provisions should not be implemented for the 1995 crop year because:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Crop insurance reform will require many policy changes. Implementation of these crop provisions should be tabled
until reform decisions are reached because impacts on policy terms are not yet clear. Delaying common policy implementation
until it can be implemented in an orderly fashion should be beneficial to everyone concerned; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Common Crop Insurance Policy should be thoroughly reviewed and revised as needed before any additional crop
provisions are implemented under it.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Program changes necessary to comply with crop insurance reform will have the same effects on either the existing policies
or these Coarse Grains Crop Provisions. Any necessary changes can more easily be made to the Coarse Grains Crop Provisions
as to the existing policies since only one policy will need to be amended. FCIC has recently completed a review of the
Common Crop Insurance Policy Basic Provisions (&sect;457.8). Any necessary changes required to be made to the Basic
Provisions as a result of this review or as a result of reform will be required whether or not the Coarse Grains Crop Provisions
have been implemented. Therefore, FCIC does not find it necessary to delay implementation for either of the reasons
stated in the comments.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Two comments were received regarding the proposed definition of ``Planted acreage.'' This definition requires
the crop to be planted in rows far enough apart to permit mechanical cultivation unless otherwise provided by the Special
Provisions, or allowed by written agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) One comment stated that drilling soybeans is a widespread practice and that the definition should include drilling
as an insurable planting practice for soybeans. The comment also suggested that the Special Provisions could contain
restrictions for any counties where drilled soybeans are uninsurable unless a written agreement is requested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) One comment assumed that the Special Provisions will continue to allow for drilling the crops in the same areas
as in the past.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 FCIC acknowledges that planting of soybeans and grain sorghum with a grain drill rather than a row planter is a common
practice in some areas. The definition has been modified by removing the requirement to plant soybeans and grain sorghum
in rows far enough apart to permit mechanical cultivation. Since the crop provisions allow insurance for drilled
soybeans and grain sorghum, it will not be necessary for the Special Provisions to specifically allow such practice.
If necessary, the Special Provisions which are provided to the insured could restrict the insurability of this planting
method in a particular area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One comment questioned requirements contained in the definition of ``Practical to replant.'' This definition indicated
that the replanted acreage must have the potential to produce at least ninety percent (90%) of the production guarantee.
Late planting provisions provide production guarantees much lower than the ninety percent (90%) potential requirement
contained in the definition even though the late planted and replanted crop may be planted at the same time. The comment
recommended removing the production potential requirement from the definition of ``Practical to replant.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 FCIC agrees that the production potential required by the definition of ``Practical to replant'' and the production
guarantee for late planted acreage may be inconsistent depending on the time of planting. Acreage initially planted
twenty-five (25) days after the final planting date would have a production guarantee equal to sixty (60%) of the guarantee
for timely planted acreage, while the definition of ``Practical to replant'' would require acreage replanted at
the same time to have a production potential equal to ninety percent (90%) of the production guarantee. However, expected
yield does have an effect on whether it is practical to replant. The ninety percent (90%) production potential requirement
has been removed from the definition of ``Practical to replant''. However, the expected yield must be sufficient
to cover production costs and must be at a level that growers in the area would normally care for and harvest.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One comment recommended changing the term ``approved yield'' to ``approved APH yield'' in the definition of ``Production
guarantee'' to correspond with terminology in underwriting procedure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Underwriting procedure contains several methods which may be used to determine approved yields. These include the
use of yields which may not represent actual production history (APH). Using the term ``APH'' could be misleading
to readers not familiar with administrative procedures, and, therefore will not be used in the crop insurance policy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Three comments disagreed with the definition of ``Written agreement.'' This definition required written agreements
to be requested at least 15 days prior to the sales closing date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) One comment recommended keeping the current deadlines for written agreements as specified in procedures. These
procedures require that requests be made not later than 15 days after the acreage reporting date for most types of written
agreements. Setting a deadline 15 days prior to the sales closing date will either force insureds to submit requests
for written agreements they may not need, or result in uninsurable acreage if requests are not made for all possible
situations. Unnecessary requests will increase paperwork for the insured, agent, FCIC Regional Service Office
and company. The comment also recommended deleting the last sentence of the definition, which required written agreements
to contain all variable terms including, but not limited to, crop variety, guarantee, premium and price election.
The comment did not believe it was necessary to include this information on every written agreement because many written
agreements do not alter these items.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) One comment recommended keeping the deadline of 15 days after the acreage reporting date because there are many
instances when it is not known that a written agreement is necessary until the acreage is reported. The comment stated
that the change would be an unreasonable requirement and would create difficulties since the sales closing dates
will be 30 days earlier than in prior years.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) One comment stated that it is hard to understand why the written agreement deadline is 15 days prior to the time a
producer has to purchase coverage and that a more appropriate date should be established. The comment also stated
that the sales closing dates are not listed in the proposed crop provisions. If these are to be the same dates as the cancellation
and termination dates, the policy should so indicate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed definition was intended to require that requests for written agreements be made far enough ahead of the
sales closing date to allow the insurer to make the offer, and the insured to accept the offer, by the sales closing date.
Since the insurance policy is a written contract, both parties must have a meeting of the minds before the contract
is valid. The terms and conditions of the policy must be known by the final date for establishing the insurance contract.
In this program, the final date is the sales closing date. FCIC has determined that some situations may allow written
agreements at other times. FCIC is preparing proposed written agreement regulations which will specify when written
agreements must be completed. Until these regulations have been published, the written agreement must be completed
by the sale closing date, or, in specific instances, a written agreement may be requested or approved after the sales
closing date if the crop is physically inspected and a determination made that the crop has an expectancy of making
the guaranteed yield. No prevented planting liability will be established as a result of any request submitted after
the sales closing date. FCIC does not agree that the final sentence should be deleted. Specifying all variable terms
in the written agreement is necessary to assure a clear understanding of the terms in effect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the sales closing dates normally will be the same as the cancellation and termination dates, this is not always
the case. Therefore, the sales closing dates will not be included in the crop provisions. Federal regulations authorize
the Manager of FCIC to extend the sales closing date in any county upon the Manager's determination that no adverse
selection will result during the extended period. The extended date is placed on file in the applicable service offices
and a notice is placed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. If the sales closing dates were contained in the crop provisions, the crop provisions would need to be amended each
time a sales closing date is extended.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One comment stated that unit division language contained in subsection 2.(b) should allow for situations where the
insured creates a discernible break by some tillage operation. The proposed provision states that the insured must
plant the crop in a manner that results in a clear and discernible break in the planting pattern at the boundaries of
each optional unit. There is no required method of creating a boundary as long as a discernible break is provided.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The intent of the policy language is to allow separate optional units if acreage is farmed separately. Farming separately
includes planting separately and keeping separate records of inputs, production, etc. Creating a boundary after
the crop is planted by means of a tillage operation along a section line may or may not meet the policy requirement of
planting the crop in a manner that results in a clear and discernable break at the units boundary. FCIC believes the
present language clearly sets out the requirements for unit division.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One comment stated that subsection 3.(b) requires the application to be revised when corn is harvested in a manner
other than reported, and that procedure should indicate how this revision is to be made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Language in subsection 3.(b) does not require the application to be revised to elect a price election for the method
of harvest (grain/silage) when the insured did not select an appropriate price election. The price specified in this
provision will only be used to establish ``the dollar amount of production to count for indemnity purposes.'' If an
insured only selected a grain price election and reported the acreage as intended for harvest as grain, but harvested
the acreage for silage, the amount of insurance is determined by multiplying the production guarantee for grain by
the price election selected by the insured for grain. The value of any silage production is determined by multiplying
the number of tons of silage to count by a price that bears the same relationship to the maximum silage price election
as the selected price for grain does to the maximum grain price. FCIC has amended this subsection to clarify that this
price is assigned by us only for the purpose of determining the dollar value of production to count for indemnity purposes
and will not affect the premium or amount of insurance.

Comment:

 One comment assumed that since cancellation and termination dates were changed, that the sales closing dates will
be changed to align with the new cancellation and termination dates.

Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The sales closing dates as contained in the Special Provisions will be changed generally to be the same as, but no later
than, the new cancellation and termination dates.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment expressed concerns regarding changes that will be required in underwriting and loss procedure since
the new policy allows both grain and silage to be insured. The comment stated that procedure should be developed concurrently
with policy language to avoid major confusion. Specifically, underwriting procedure should clearly address how
grain and silage types are to be reported and insured, how production can or cannot be converted for APH purposes and
whether appraisals are required if there is no loss, but the crop is harvested in a manner other than as reported. The
comment also requested that FCIC consider previously submitted information when developing the procedure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment stated that a definition of ``silage variety'' is necessary. The comment stated that subparagraph 6.(b)(2)(ii)
refers to ``a variety of corn adapted for silage use only,'' but that their understanding is that there are no varieties
adapted strictly for use as silage. The comment asked if FCIC intends to designate silage varieties on the Special
Provisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There is no uniform agreement regarding the existence or definition of a ``silage variety.'' However, due to ongoing
attempts to develop new ``silage varieties,'' FCIC believes that language should remain in these crop provisions
to prevent insuring corn on a grain basis for a variety of corn adapted for silage use only. Since there is no uniform
agreement regarding the existence of silage varieties, a definition will not be added. FCIC has modified subparagraph
6.(b)(2)(ii) to delete the term ``silage variety.'' If research succeeds in developing silage varieties, FCIC will
evaluate placing specific silage variety restrictions in the Special Provisions.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment suggested subsection 1.(m) conflicts with subsection 10.(a), stating that: (1) Subsection 1.(m) specifies
that it may be considered practical to replant after the end of the late planting period if replanting is generally
occurring in the area; and (2) subection 10.(a) specifies that a replant payment may be made if replanting occurs no
later than 25 days after the final planting date. The comment further stated that if it is determined to be practical
to replant after the late planting period, a replanting payment must be made and subsection 10.(a) should indicate
the same.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment stated that subsections 10.(b) and 10.(c) are confusing because: (1) Subsection 10.(c) allows a replant
payment, based on the total insured shares, to be made to one party if an agreement exists to that effect between the
insured persons; and (2) subsection 10.(b) uses ``your share'' in calculating the maximum replant payment. The comment
suggested that a qualifier should be added to subsection 10.(b) to reflect paying a replant payment based on the total
insured share if 10.(c) applies. The comment also asked which company pays the entire replant payment when persons
sharing in the crop are insured with different companies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FCIC agreed that a replant payment should be calculated using the insured share or the share determined in subsection
10.(c), if applicable and has modified subsection 10.(b) accordingly. The proposed language contained in subsection
10.(c) would have required the company insuring the person given the right to the replant payment to pay the entire
amount due. Upon further review, FCIC has determined it is not appropriate to require an insurer to pay replant payments
based on a share in excess of the share they actually insure. Therefore, subsection 10.(c) has been revised to allow
replant payments based on the total shares insured with the insurer.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment questioned whether FCIC intends to incorporate language contained in subsection 10.(d) into every crop
provision that provides for a replant payment. This language requires that when the crop is replanted using a practice
that is uninsurable as an original planting, the liability for the unit will be reduced by the amount of the replanting
payment which is attributable to the insured's share and that the premium amount will not be reduced.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment questioned whether a person who insured grain and silage within one unit, but did not discover damage until
after the beginning of grain harvest, could give timely notice of damage more than 15 days after the end of the insurance
period for silage but within the period timely notice could be given for grain.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice would be considered timely as long as the silage acreage within the unit was not damaged. If the silage acreage
within the unit was damaged, notice would be required within 72 hours of the insured's initial discovery of damage
to the silage acreage (but not later than 15 days after the end of the insurance period for silage). FCIC has clarified
paragraph 11.(b)(1).

One comment recommended that subparagraph 12.(b)(2)(ii) be revised to read ``Multiplying each result by the price
election for that type;'' because the phrase ``price election for each type'' indicates multiplying by both grain
and silage price elections.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment recommended either revising or deleting provisions that allow the inured to leave representative samples
if they disagree with the insurer's appraisal. In the event the provision cannot be deleted the comment recommended
changing the provision so that the insurer can decide when using representative samples is appropriate. In many situations,
samples are more susceptible to loss and do not accurately represent what the entire unit would have produced.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FCIC agrees that there are situations in which it may not be reasonable to leave representative strips from which production
to count would ultimately be determined. The samples could be more vulnerable to damage than an entire field, or the
insurer may be confident that the appraisal made accurately reflects production potential. However, the entire
provision should not be removed. The provision has been changed to allow the insurer to determine those situations
in which it is reasonable to leave representative samples to determine the amount of production to be counted. In cases
where it is necessary to defer determinations, the insured must be advised how production to count will ultimately
be determined and the consequences of failure to leave or care for the samples.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment recommended amending subsection 12.(f) to require that moisture adjustments for silage, if applicable,
will be made prior to any adjustment for quality for grain-deficient silage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subsection 12.(f) contains the requirements that must be met for silage production to be adjusted for moisture and
for grain-deficiency. Current FCIC procedure specifies that when both adjustments apply, the silage moisture adjustment
factor is to be multiplied by the silage grain-deficient factor and the result multiplied by the number of tons of silage
that qualify for both adjustments. This method of adjustment results in a proportionate adjustment of the silage
production based on both factors. FCIC does not agree with the comment because adjusting for moisture first may result
in a disproportionate adjustment of the silage production. FCIC has not amended subsection 12.(f).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment assumed that moving to a factor-based quality adjustment process as specified in paragraph 12.(e)(4)
removes any reliance on local market price, except for quality, such as aflatoxin, not addressed by the factor table
in the Special Provisions. The comment also stated that if language in subparagraph 12.(e)(3)(ii) remains in the
policy, an insured would have strong justification for requesting adjustment of production that meets the grade
requirements in the policy, but which has a value less than the local market price. The comment recommends deletion
of subparagraph 12.(e)(3)(ii).

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FCIC agrees that quality adjustment should not apply if grain meets minimum grade requirements and other substances
or conditions are not present causing a value less than the local market price. The Special Provisions will specify
how the quality factor will be determined for quality deficiencies, substances and conditions. Subparagraph 12.(e)(3)(ii)
has been deleted.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment recommended that language in subsection 13.(b) be changed to require only one notice for prevented planting
acreage rather than requiring notice three days after the final planting date and three days after the date the insured
stops planting within the late planting period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The crop provisions provide two distinct periods during which the insured may be prevented from planting (i.e., by
the final planting date and during the late planting period). The notice requirement allows the insurer the opportunity
to verify that the acreage could not have been planted during such periods. FCIC agrees that an insured should only
be required to give one notice if it is sufficient to cover all acreage for prevented planting purposes. Subsection
13.(b) has been modified to clarify that written notice must be given not later than three days after the final planting
date for acreage the insured was prevented from planting by the final planting date, and not later than three days after
the date the insured discovers that planting will not be possible if the insured was not prevented from planting such
acreage by the final planting date but was prevented from planting such acreage during the late planting period.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment indicated that the proposed provisions in paragraph 13.(d)(3) will allow an insured to request a written
agreement for prevented planting coverage for acreage exceeding the policy limitations, and to subsequently enroll
in a USDA program that allows less acreage to be planted. The comment recommended revising the paragraph to limit eligible
acreage to the amount allowed by any applicable USDA program, regardless of when the insured enrolls in such program
or any previously approved written agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FCIC agrees that if the farm is enrolled in a USDA program that limits the number of acres planted, acreage in excess
of the amount allowed under a USDA program should not be eligible for prevented planting coverage. Paragraph 13.(d)(3)
has been amended accordingly.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment recommended that language be added to paragraph 13.(d)(3) to allow prevented planting coverage by written
agreement for acreage added to the insured's farming operation after the sales closing date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The insurance period for prevented planting coverage begins on the sales closing date. Allowing additional coverage
to attach after the beginning of this period would likely result in coverage being requested primarily when conditions
are favorable for a prevented planting indemnity. This adverse selection should be avoided to help maintain an actuarially
sound program and to keep premium rates from rising to cover such losses. The definition of ``Written agreement''
has been amended to specifically disallow any prevented planting liability as a result of any request submitted after
the sales closing date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the changes indicated in the responses to comments, FCIC has made the following changes:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. FCIC has modified paragraph 3.(a)(2) to require that the price elections for grain and silage have the same percentage
relationship to the maximum price election offered for grain and silage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2 FCIC has modified subsection 5.(b) to simplify the cancellation and termination dates in Texas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The provisions in section 6 have been modified to allow insurance for coarse grains planted into an established
grass or legume if allowed by the Special Provisions or by written agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. FCIC has modified paragraph 12.(b)(2) to specify that the production guarantee for a unit will be computed by multiplying
the insured acreage of each type (grain/silage) by the production guarantee for the applicable type. The proposed
language contained in subparagraph 12.(b)(1)(i) has been modified in a similar manner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

to, crop variety, guarantee, premium rate and price election must be set out in the written agreement. In specific
instances, a written agreement may be applied for after the sales closing date and approved if, after a physical inspection
of the acreage, there is a determination that the crop has the expectance of making at least the guaranteed yield. However,
no prevented planting liability will be established as a result of any request submitted after the closing date. All
applications for written agreements as submitted by the insured must contain all variable terms of the contract between
the company and the insured that will be in effect if the written agreement is disapproved.

of each optional unit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) You must have records of measurement of stored or marketed production from each optional unit maintained in such
a manner that we can verify the production from each optional unit or the production from each unit must be kept separate
until after loss adjustment under the policy is completed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Each optional unit must meet one or more of the following criteria as applicable:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Optional Units by Section, Section Equivalent, or ASCS Farm Serial Number: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Optional units may be established if each optional unit is located in a separate legally identified Section. In the
absence of Sections, we may consider parcels of land legally identified by other methods of measure including, but
not limited to: Spanish grants, railroad surveys, leagues, labors, or Virginia Military Lands as the equivalent
of Sections for unit purposes. In areas which have not been surveyed using the systems identified above or another
system approved by us, or in areas where such systems exist but boundaries are not readily discernable, each optional
unit must be located in a separate farm identified by a single ASCS Farm Serial Number.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Optional Units on Acreage Including Both Irrigated and Non-Irrigated Practices: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to or instead of establishing optional units by Section, section equivalent, or ASCS Farm Serial Number,
optional units may be established based on irrigated acreage or non-irrigated acreage if both are located in the same
Section, section equivalent, or ASCS Farm Serial Number.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The irrigated acreage may not extend beyond the point at which your irrigation system can deliver the quantity of water
needed to produce the yield on which your guarantee is based and you may not continue into non-irrigated acreage in
the same rows or planting pattern. You must plant, cultivate, fertilize, or otherwise care for the irrigated acreage
in accordance with recognized good irrigated farming practices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Basic units may not be divided into optional units on any basis (production practice, type, variety, planting period,
etc.) other than as described under this section. If you do not comply fully with these provisions, we will combine
all optional units which are not in compliance with these provisions into the basic unit from which they were formed.
We may combine the optional units at any time we discover that you have failed to comply with these provisions. If failure
to comply with these provisions is determined to be inadvertent, and all the optional units are combined, the premium
paid for the purpose of electing optional units will be refunded to you.

3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) In addition to the requirements of section 3 (Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining
Indemnities) of the Common Crop Insurance Policy (&sect;457.8) you may select:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) For grain sorghum and soybeans, only one price election for each crop in the county insured under this policy; and

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For corn, only one price election for all the corn in the county insured as grain under this policy, and only one price
election for all the corn in the county insured as silage under this policy. The price elections you choose for grain
and silage must have the same percentage relationship to the maximum price election offered by us for grain and silage.
For example, if you choose one hundred percent (100%) of the maximum grain price election and you also insure corn on
a silage basis, you must choose one hundred percent (100%) of the maximum silage price election.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) For corn only, if you harvest the crop in a manner other than the manner you reported (for example, you reported grain
but harvested as silage) and you did not select a price election for the type harvested, we will assign a price election
for the type harvested that bears the same percentage relationship to the maximum price election you selected for
the type reported (for example, if you selected a grain price election in the amount of eighty percent (80%) of the maximum
price election for grain and you did not select a silage price election, we will assign a silage price election in the
amount of eighty percent (80%) of the maximum price election for silage specified in the Special Provisions if you
harvest for silage). This assigned price election will be used only to determine the dollar value of production to
count for indemnity purposes and will not be used to determine the amount of insurance or premium.

9. Causes of Loss
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the provisions of section 12 (Causes of Loss) of the Common Crop Insurance Policy (&sect;457.8),
insurance is provided only against the following causes of loss which occur within the insurance period:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Adverse weather conditions;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Fire;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Insects, but not damage due to insufficient or improper application of pest control measures;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Plant disease, but not damage due to insufficient or improper application of disease control measures;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Wildlife;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Earthquake;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Volcanic eruption; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Failure of the irrigation water supply, if applicable, due to an unavoidable cause of loss occurring within the
insurance period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 -->
10. Replanting Payments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) In accordance with section 13 (Replanting Payment) of the Common Crop Insurance Policy (&sect;457.8), replanting
payments for coarse grains are allowed if the coarse grains are damaged by an insurable cause of loss to the extent that
the remaining stand will not produce at least ninety percent (90%) of the production guarantee for the acreage and
it is practical to replant (see subsection 1.(m)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The maximum amount of the replanting per acre will be the lesser of twenty percent (20%) of the production guarantee
or the number of bushels (tons for corn insured as silage) set out herein, multiplied by your price election multiplied
by your insured share or the share determined under 10.(c), if applicable. The number of bushels or tons are 8 bushels
for corn grain; 1 ton for corn silage; 7 bushels for grain sorghum; and 3 bushels for soybeans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) When more than one person insures the same crop on a share basis, a replanting payment based on the total shares insured
by us may be made to the insured person who incurs the total cost of replanting. Payment will be made in this manner only
if an agreement exists between the insured persons which:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Requires one person to incur the entire cost of replanting; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Gives the right to all replanting payments to one person.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) When the insured crop is replanted using a practice that is uninsurable as an original planting, the liability
for the unit will be reduced by the amount of the replanting payment which is attributable to your share. The premium
amount will not be reduced.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 -->
11. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) In accordance with the requirements of section 14 (Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss) of the Common Crop Insurance
Policy (&sect;457.8), if you initially discover damage to any insured crop within 15 days of or during harvest, you
must leave representative samples of the unharvested crop for our inspection. The samples must be at least 10 feet
wide and extend the entire length of each field in the unit, and must not be harvested or destroyed until the earlier
of our inspection or 15 days after harvest of the balance of the unit is completed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) For any corn unit that has separate dates for the end of the insurance period (grain and silage):
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) In lieu of paragraph 14.(a)(2) of the Common Crop Insurance Policy (&sect;457.8), if damage occurs:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Before the earliest end of insurance period date (grain or silage), you must give us notice within 72 hours of your
initial discovery of damage (but not later than 15 days after that earliest end of insurance period date); or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If damage does not occur before the earliest end of insurance period date (grain or silage), but occurs before
the latest end of insurance period date (grain or silage), you must give notice within 72 hours of your initial discovery
of damage (but not later than 15 days after that latest end of insurance period date).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In lieu of subsection 14.(c) of the Common Crop Insurance Policy (&sect;457.8), in addition to complying with
all other notice requirements, you must submit a claim for indemnity declaring the amount of your loss not later than
60 days after the latest date for the end of insurance period for the unit. This claim must include all the information
we require to settle the claim.

12. Settlement of Claim
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide records of production:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) For any optional unit, we will combine all optional units for which acceptable records of production were not provided;
or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For any basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the
harvested acreage for each unit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim on any unit:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) For grain sorghum and soybeans by:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Multiplying the insured acreage by the production guarantee;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Subtracting from this the total production to count;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Multiplying the remainder by your price election; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Multiplying this result by your share.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For corn by:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Multiplying the insured acreage of each type (grain/silage) by the production guarantee for the applicable type;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Multiplying each result by the price election for the applicable type;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Adding these values;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Multiplying the production to count of each type (see subsection 12.(d)) by the price election for that type (see
the provisions under section 3 (Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities));
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Adding these dollar values;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Subtracting the result of step (v) from the result of step (iii); and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) Multiplying the result by your share.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The total production in bushels (tons for corn silage) (see subsection 12.(d)) to count from all insurable acreage
on the unit will include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) All appraised production as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Not less than the production guarantee for acreage:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) That is abandoned;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Put to another use without our consent;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Damaged solely by uninsured causes; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) For which you fail to provide records of production that are acceptable to us;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Unharvested production (mature unharvested production may be adjusted for quality deficiencies and excess
moisture in accordance with subsection 12.(e)); and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Potential production on insured acreage you want to put to another use or you wish to abandon and no longer care
for, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement the insurance period for that acreage
will end if you put the acreage to another use or abandon the crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production
is not reached:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop we may give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree
to leave intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the crop in locations acceptable to us
(The amount of production to count for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals from the
samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not leave the required samples intact, or you fail to provide
sufficient care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put the acreage to another use will
be used to determine the amount of production to count); or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of production to count for the acreage will be the harvested
production, or our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not harvested; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The production to count for corn will be in bushels for grain and in tons for silage as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) For harvested acreage, according to the method of harvest; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For unharvested acreage, according to the information contained on your acreage report;

except as otherwise provided in paragraph 12.(c)(1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(e) Mature coarse grain production (excluding corn insured or harvested as silage) may be adjusted for excess moisture
and quality deficiencies. If moisture adjustment is applicable it will be made prior to any adjustment for quality.
Corn insured or harvested as silage will be adjusted for excess moisture and quality only as specified in subsection
12.(f).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Production will be reduced by 0.12 percent for each 0.1 percentage point of moisture in excess of:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Fifteen percent (15%) for corn (If moisture exceeds 30 percent (30%), production will be reduced 0.2 percent for
each 0.1 percentage point above 30 percent (30%));
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Fourteen percent (14%) for grain sorghum; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Thirteen percent (13%) for soybeans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We may obtain samples of the production to determine the moisture content.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Production will be eligible for quality adjustment if:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Deficiencies in quality, in accordance with the Official United States Standards for Grain, result in:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Corn not meeting the grade requirements for U.S. No. 4 (grades U.S. No. 5 or worse) because of test weight or kernel
damage (excluding heat damage) or having a musty, sour, or commercially objectionable foreign odor;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Grain sorghum not meeting the grade requirements for U.S. No. 4 (grades U.S. Sample grade) because of test weight
or kernel damage (excluding heat damage) or having a musty, sour, or commercially objectionable foreign odor (except
smut odor), or meets the special grade requirements for smutty grain sorghum; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Soybeans not meeting the grade requirements for U.S. No. 4 (grades U.S. Sample grade) because of test weight or
kernel damage (excluding heat damage) or having a musty, sour, or commercially objectionable foreign odor (except

(ii) All determinations of these deficiencies, substances, or conditions are made using samples of the production
obtained by us or by a disinterested third party approved by us; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The samples are analyzed by a grader licensed under the authority of the United States Grain Standards Act or
the United States Warehouse Act with regard to deficiencies in quality, or by a laboratory approved by us with regard
to substances or conditions injurious to human or animal health. (Test weight for quality adjustment purposes may
be determined by our loss adjuster.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Coarse grain production that is eligible for quality adjustment, as specified in paragraphs 12.(e) (2) and (3),
will be reduced by the quality adjustment factor contained in the Special Provisions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) For corn insured or harvested as silage:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Whenever our appraisal of grain content is less than 4.5 bushels of grain per ton of silage, the silage production
will be reduced by 1 percentage point for each 0.1(1/10) of a bushel less than 4.5 bushels per ton (If we cannot make a
grain appraisal before harvest and you do not leave a representative unharvested sample, in accordance with the policy
no reduction for grain-deficient silage will be made.); and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the normal silage harvesting period has ended, or for any acreage harvested as silage or appraised as silage

13. Late Planting and Preventing Planting
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) In lieu of paragraph 8.(b)(2) and subsection 1.(aa) of the Common Crop Insurance Policy (&sect;457.8), insurance
will be provided for acreage planted to the insured crop during the late planting period (see subsection 13.(c)),
and acreage you were prevented from planting (see subsection 13.(d)). These coverages provide reduced production
guarantees. The reduced guarantees will be combined with the production guarantee for timely planted acreage for
each unit. The premium amount for late planted acreage and eligible prevented planting acreage will be the same as
that for timely planted acreage. If the amount of premium you are required to pay (gross premium less our subsidy) for
late planted acreage or prevented planting acreage exceeds the liability on such acreage, coverage for those acres
will not be provided (no premium will be due and no indemnity will be be paid for such acreage). (For example, assume
you insure one unit in which you have a 100 percent (100%) share. The unit consists of 150 acres, of which 50 acres were
planted timely, 50 acres were planted 7 days after the final planting date (late planted), and 50 acres are unplanted
and eligible for prevented planting coverage. To calculate the amount of any indemnity which may be due to you, the
production guarantee for the unit will be computed as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) For timely planted acreage, multiply the per acre production guarantee for timely planted acreage by the 50 acres
planted timely;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For late planted acreage, multiply the per acre production guarantee for timely planted acreage by 93 percent
(0.93) and multiply the result by the 50 acres planted late; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) For prevented planting acreage, multiply the per acre production guarantee for timely planted acreage by 50 percent
(0.5) and multiply the result by the 50 acres eligible for prevented planting coverage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total of the three calculations will be the production guarantee for the unit. Your premium will be based on the
result of multiplying the per acre production guarantee for timely planted acreage by the 150 acres in the unit.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) You must provide written notice to us if you were prevented from planting (see subsection 1.(n)). This notice must
be given not later than three (3) days after:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The final planting date for acreage you were prevented from planting by the final planting date if you have unplanted
acreage that may be eligible for prevented planting coverage; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The date you discover that planting will not be possible within the late planting period for acreage that may be
eligible for prevented planting coverage if you were not prevented from planting such acreage by the final planting
date, but were prevented from planting such acreage during the late planting period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Life Planting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) For acreage planted to the insured crop after the final planting date but on or before 25 days after the final planting
date, the production guarantee for each acre will be reduced for each day planted after the final planting date by:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) One percent (.01) for the first through the tenth day; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Two percent (.02) for the eleventh through the twenty-fifth day.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In addition to the requirements of section 6 (Report of Acreage) of the Common Crop Insurance Policy (&sect;457.8),
you must report the dates the acreage is planted within the late planting period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If planting of the insured crop continues after the final planting data, or you are prevented from planting during
the late planting period, the acreage reporting date will be the later of:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The acreage reporting date contained in the Special Provisions for the insured crop; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Five (5) days after the end of the late planting period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Prevented Planting (Including Planting After the Late Planting Period)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If you were prevented from planting the insured crop (see subsection 1.(n)), you may elect:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) To plant the insured crop during the late planting period (the production guarantee for such acreage will be determined
in accordance with paragraph 13.(c)(1));
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Not to plant this acreage to any crop that is intended for harvest in the same crop year, (the production guarantee
for such acreage will be fifty percent (0.5) of the production guarantee for timely planted acres, (For example, if
your production guarantee for timely planted acreage is 30 bushels per acre, your prevented planting production
guarantee would be equivalent to 15 bushels per acre (30 bushels multiplied by 0.5). This paragraph does not prohibit
the preparation and care of the acreage for conservation practices, such as planting a cover crop, as long as such crop
is not intended for harvest.); or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) To plant the insured crop after the late planting period, (the production guarantee for such acreage will be
fifty percent (0.5) of the production guarantee for timely planted acres, (For example, if your production guarantee
for timely planted acreage is 30 bushels per acre, your prevented planting production guarantee would be equivalent
to 15 bushels per acre (30 bushels multiplied by 0.5). Production to count for such acreage will be determined in accordance
with subsections 12.(c) through (g)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In addition to the provisions of section 11 (Insurance Period) of the Common Crop Insurance Policy (&sect;457.8),
the insurance period for prevented planting coverage begins on the sales closing date contained in the Special Provisions
for the insured crop in the county.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The acreage to which prevented planting coverage applies will be limited as follows:

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) If you participate in any program administered by the United States Department of Agriculture for the crop year
which limits the number of acres that may be planted, prevented planting acreage will not exceed the ASCS base acreage
for the insured crop, reduced by any acreage reduction applicable to the farm under such program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If you do not participate in any program administered by the United States Department of Agriculture which limits
the number of acres that may be planted, unless a written agreement exists to the contrary, eligible acreage will not
exceed the greater of:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The ASCS base acreage for the insured crop, if applicable;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The number of acres planted to the insured crop on each ASCS Farm Serial Number during the previous crop year (adjusted
for any reconstitution which may have occurred prior to the sales closing date); or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) One hundred percent (100%) of the simple average of the number of acres planted to the insured crop during the crop
years that were used to determine your yield.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Acreage intended to be planted under an irrigated practice will be limited to the number of acres properly prepared
to carry out an irrigated practice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) A prevented planting production guarantee will no be provided for:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Any acreage that does not constitute at least 20 acres or 20 percent (20%) of the acres in the unit, whichever is less;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Land for which the actuarial table does not designate a premium rate unless a written agreement is in place designating
such premium rate;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Land used for conservation purposes or intended to be or considered to have been left unplanted under any program
administered by the United States Department of Agriculture;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Land on which any crop, other than the insured crop, has been planted and is intended for harvest, or has been harvested
in the same crop year; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) Land which planting history or conservation plans indicate would remain fallow for crop rotation purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) For the purpose of determining eligible acreage for prevented planting coverage, acreage for all units will be
combined and be reduced by the number of acres of the insured crop timely planted and planted after the final planting
date. (For example, assume you have 100 acres eligible for prevented planting coverage in which you have a 100 percent
(100%) share. The acreage is located in a single ASCS Farm Serial Number which you insure as two separate optional units
consisting of 50 acres each. If you planted 60 acres of the insured crop on one optional unit and 40 acres of the insured
crop on the second optional unit, your prevented planting eligible acreage would be reduced to zero. (100 acres eligible
for prevented planting coverage minus 100 acres planted equals zero). If you report more insured crop acreage under
this contract than is eligible for prevented planting coverage, we will allocate the eligible acreage to insured
units based on the number of prevented planting acres and share you reported for each unit.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) When the ASCS Farm Serial Number covers more than one unit, or a unit consists of more than one ASCS Farm Serial Number,
the covered acres will be pro-rated based on the number of acres in each unit or ASCS Farm Serial Number that could have
been planted to the insured crop in the crop year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) In accordance with the provisions of section 6 (Report of Acreage) of the Common Crop Insurance Policy (&sect;457.8),
you must report any insurable acreage you were prevented from planting. This report must be submitted on or before
the acreage reporting date, even though you may elect to plant the acreage after the late planting period. Any acreage
you report as eligible for prevented planting coverage which is not eligible will be deleted from prevented planting
coverage.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) hereby adopts regulations for specific crop provisions to insure
extra long staple (ELS) cotton. These provisions will supplement the Common Crop Insurance Policy (&sect;457.8)
which contains standard terms and conditions common to most crops. The intended effect of this rule is to move specific
crop provisions for insuring ELS cotton to the Common Crop Insurance Policy (&sect;457.8) for ease of use by the public
and conformance among policy terms.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This action has been reviewed under USDA procedures established by Executive Order 12866 and Departmental Regulation
1512&hyph;1. This action constitutes a review as to the need, currency, clarity, and effectiveness of these regulations
under those procedures. The sunset review date established for these regulations is March 1, 1999.

This rule has been determined to be ``not significant'' for purposes of Executive Order 12866, and therefore has not
been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).

), the information collection or record-keeping requirements included in this rule are found in 7 CFR part 400, subpart
H.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has been determined under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, that this rule does not have sufficient
federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a federalism assessment. The policies and procedures contained
in this rule will not have substantial direct effects on states or their political subdivisions, or on the distribution
of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The amount of work required
of the insurance companies delivering these policies will not increase from the amount required to deliver previous
policies. Therefore, this action is determined to be exempt from the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act
and no Regulatory Flexibility Analysis was prepared.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

 Two comments suggested that the crop provisions should not be implemented for the 1995 crop year because:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Crop insurance reform will require many policy changes. Implementation of these crop provisions should be tabled
until reform decisions are reached because impacts on policy terms are not yet clear. Delaying common policy implementation
until it can be implemented in an orderly fashion should be beneficial to everyone concerned; and

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Program changes necessary to comply with crop insurance reform will have the same effects on either the existing ELS
cotton policy or these ELS Cotton Crop Provisions. Any necessary changes can be made to the ELS Cotton Crop Provisions
as easily as they can be made to the existing policy. FCIC has recently completed a review of the Common Crop Insurance
Policy Basic Provisions (&sect;457.8). Any necessary changes required to be made to the Basic Provisions as a result
of reform will be required whether or not the ELS Cotton Crop Provisions have been implemented. Therefore, FCIC does
not find it necessary to delay implementation for either of the reasons stated in the comments.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One comment questioned requirements contained in the definition of ``practical to replant.'' This definition indicated
that the replanted acreage must have the potential to produce at least ninety percent (90%) of the production guarantee.
The late planting provisions provide production guarantees much lower than the ninety percent (90%) potential requirement
contained in the definition even though the late planted and replanted crop may be planted at the same time. The comment
recommended removing the production potential requirement from the definition of ``practical to replant.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The ELS Cotton Crop Provisions do not provide for a late planting period or late planting production guarantees. However,
acreage initially planted to ELS cotton may be replanted to American Upland cotton. FCIC agrees that the production
potential required by the definition of ``practical to replant'' and the production guarantee for late planted American
Upland cotton acreage may be inconsistent depending on the time of planting. American Upland cotton acreage initially
planted twenty-five (25) days after the final planting date would have a production guarantee equal to sixty percent
(60%) of the guarantee for timely planted acreage, while the definition of ``practical to replant'' would require
acreage replanted at the same time to have a production potential equal to ninety percent (90%) of the production guarantee.
However, expected yield does have an effect on whether it is practical to replant. The ninety percent (90%) production
potential requirement has been removed from the definition of ``practical to replant.'' However, the expected yield
must be sufficient to cover production costs and must be at a level that growers in the area would normally care for and
harvest.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One comment recommended changing the term ``approved yield'' to ``approved APH yield'' in the definition of ``Production
guarantee'' to correspond with terminology in underwriting procedure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Underwriting procedure contains several methods which may be used to determine approved yields. These include the
use of yields which may not represent actual production history (APH). Using the term ``APH'' could be misleading
to readers not familiar with administrative procedures, and, therefore, will not be used in the crop insurance policy.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Three comments disagreed with the definition of ``written agreement''. This definition requires written agreements
to be requested at least 15 days prior to the sales closing date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) One comment recommended keeping the current deadlines for written agreements as specified in procedures. These
procedures require that requests be made not later than 15 days after the acreage reporting date for most types of written
agreements. Setting a deadline 15 days prior to the sales closing date will either force insureds to submit requests
for written agreements they may not need, or result in uninsurable acreage if requests are not made for all possible
situations. Unnecessary requests will increase paperwork for the insured, agent, FCIC Regional Service Office
and company. The comment also recommended deleting the last sentence of the definition, which required written agreements
to contain all variable terms including, but not limited to, crop variety, guarantee, premium and price election.
The comment indicated it was not necessary to include this information on every written agreement because many written
agreements do not alter these items. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) One comment recommended keeping the deadline of 15 days after the acreage reporting date because there are many
instances when it is not known that a written agreement is necessary until the acreage is reported. The comment stated
that the change would be an unreasonable requirement and would create difficulties since the sales closing dates
will be 30 days earlier than in prior years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) One comment stated that it is hard to understand why the written agreement deadline is 15 days prior to the time a
producer has to purchase coverage, and that a more appropriate date should be established. The comment also stated
that the sales closing dates are not listed in the proposed crop provisions. If these are the same date as the cancellation
and termination date, the policy should so indicate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed definition was intended to require that requests for written agreements be made far enough ahead of the
sales closing date to allow the insurer to make the offer, and for the insured to accept the offer, by the sales closing
date. Since the insurance policy is a written contract, both parties must have a meeting of the minds before the contract
is valid. The terms and conditions of the policy must be known by the final date for establishing the insurance contract.
In this program, the final date is the sales closing date. FCIC has determined that some situations may allow written
agreements at other times. FCIC is preparing proposed written agreement regulations which will specify when written
agreements must be completed. Until these regulations have been published, the written agreement must be completed
by the sales closing date, or, in specific instances, a written agreement may be requested or approved after the sales
closing date if the crop is physically inspected and a determination made that the crop has an expectancy of making
the guaranteed yield. No prevented planting liability will be established as a result of any request submitted after
the sales closing date. FCIC does not agree that the final sentence should be deleted. Specifying all variable terms
in the written agreement is necessary to assure a clear understanding of the terms in effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the sales closing dates normally will be the same as the cancellation and termination dates this is not always
the case. Therefore, the sales closing dates will not be included in the crop provisions. Federal regulations authorize
the Manager of FCIC to extend the sales closing date in any county upon the Manager's determination that no adverse
selection will result during the extended period. The extended date is placed on file in the applicable service offices
and a notice is placed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. If the sales closing dates were contained in the crop provisions, the crop provisions would need to be amended each
time a sales closing date is extended.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One comment stated that unit division language contained in subsection 2.(b) should allow for situations in which
the insured creates a discernible break via some tillage operation. The proposed provision states that the insured
must plant the crop in a manner that results in a clear and discernible break in the planting pattern at the boundaries
of each optional unit. There is no required method of creating a boundary as long as a discernible break is provided.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The intent of the policy language is to allow separate optional units if acreage is farmed separately. Farming separately
includes planting separately, keeping separate records of inputs, production, etc. Creating a boundary after the
crop is planted by means of a tillage operation along a section line may or may not meet the policy requirement of planting
the crop in a manner that results in a clear and discernable break at the units boundary. FCIC believes the present language
clearly sets out the requirements for unit division.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Two comments were received regarding the changes in the cancellation and termination dates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) One comment stated the assumption that since cancellation and termination dates were changed, that the sales
closing dates will be changed to align with the new cancellation and termination dates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) One comment expressed the concern that an earlier cancellation date would decrease the amount of time available
for producers to make decisions regarding their insurance coverage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The sales closing dates, as contained in the Special Provisions, will be changed generally to be the same as, but no
later than, the new cancellation and termination dates. Earlier cancellation and sales closing dates are intended
to reduce the possibility that a producer's decision to cancel or purchase insurance is based on favorable or unfavorable
growing conditions. FCIC expects this change to have favorable impact on insurance experience. Favorable results
will be considered when calculating future premium rates.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two comments were received regarding the elimination of provisions that provided coverage while cotton stored in
modules remains in the field.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) One comment stated that changing the end of the insurance period from ``removal from the field'' to ``harvest''
creates some concerns which need to be addressed. Specifically, the comment asks how quality will be accurately determined
for cotton stored in modules when the modules may be stored in the field for a significant period of time?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) One comment opposed the removal of coverage for modules stored in the field. The comment stated that: (a) Large
amounts of cotton are stored in modules and that the practice allows for timely and efficient harvest of the crop; (b)
losses do not occur frequently once cotton is moduled, but there is some risk of weather-related loss until the modules
are removed from the field; and (c) continuing the practice of insurance coverage until removal from the field would
be consistent with recent ad hoc disaster rulings that deemed weather-damaged, field stored modules eligible for
assistance.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Upon further review, FCIC has determined that coverage for modules stored in the field should be provided. The provisions
in section 8 (Insurance Period) have been revised accordingly.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment recommended either revising or deleting provisions that allow the insured to leave representative samples
if they disagree with the insurer's appraisal. In the event the provision cannot be deleted, the comment recommended
changing the provision so that the insurer can decide when using representative samples is appropriate. In many situations,
samples are more susceptible to loss and do not accurately represent what the entire unit would have produced.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FCIC agrees that there are situations in which it may not be reasonable to leave representative strips from which production
to count would ultimately be determined. The samples could be more vulnerable to damage than an entire field, or the
insurer may be confident that the appraisal made accurately reflects production potential. However, the entire
provision should not be removed. The provision has been changed to allow the insurer to determine those situations
in which it is reasonable to leave representative samples to determine the amount of production to be counted. In cases
where it is necessary to defer determinations the insured must be advised how production to count will ultimately
be determined and the consequences of failure to leave or care for the samples.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment indicated that the proposed provisions in subsection 12.(e) will allow an insured to request a written
agreement for prevented planting coverage for acreage exceeding the policy limitations, and to subsequently enroll
in a USDA program that allows less acreage to be planted. The comment recommended revising the paragraph to limit eligible
acreage to the amount allowed by any applicable USDA program, regardless of when the insured enrolls in such program
or any previously approved written agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FCIC agrees that if the farm is enrolled in an USDA program that limits the number of acres planted, acreage in excess
of the amount allowed under an USDA program should not be eligible for prevented planting coverage. Subsection 12.(e)
has been amended accordingly.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment recommended that language be added to subsection 12.(e) to allow prevented planting coverage by written
agreement for acreage added to the insured's farming operation after the sales closing date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The insurance period for prevented planting coverage begins on the sales closing date. Allowing additional coverage
to attach after the beginning of this period would likely result in coverage being requested primarily when conditions
are favorable for a prevented planting indemnity. This adverse selection should be avoided to help maintain an actuarially
sound program and to keep premium rates from rising to cover such losses. The definition of ``written agreement''
has been amended to specifically disallow any prevented planting liability as a result of any request submitted after
the sales closing date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the changes indicated in the responses to comments, FCIC has determined that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

patterns. These requirements are used to determine the land area that is considered to be planted to cotton.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Provisions in section 6 (Insured Crop) are modified to allow coverage on crops planted into an established grass
or legume in certain instances. The increased emphasis on Highly Erodible Land Conservation has made conservation
tillage and no-till more acceptable.

Designated terms of this policy may be altered by written agreement. Each agreement must be applied for by the insured
in writing prior to the sales closing date and is valid for one year only. If not specifically renewed the following
year, continuous insurance will be in accordance with the printed policy. All variable terms including, but not limited
to, crop variety, guarantee, premium rate and price election must be set out in the written agreement. In specific
instances a written agreement may be applied for after the sales closing date and approved if, after a physical inspection
of the acreage, there is a determination that the crop has the expectancy of making at least the guaranteed yield. However,
no prevented planting liability will be established as a result of any request submitted after the sales closing date.
All applications for written agreements as submitted by the insured must contain all variable terms of the contract
between the company and the insured that will be in effect if the written agreement is disapproved.

Unless limited by the Special Provisions, a unit as defined in subsection 1.(tt) of the Common Crop Insurance Policy
(&sect;457.8), may be divided into optional units if, for each optional unit you meet all the conditions of this section
or if a written agreement to such division exists. All optional units must be reflected on the acreage report for each
crop year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) You must have records, which can be independently verified, of planted acreage and production for each optional
unit for at least the last crop year used to determine your production guarantee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) You must plant the crop in a manner that results in a clear and discernable break in the planting pattern at the boundaries
of each optional unit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) You must have records of measurement of stored or marketed production from each optional unit maintained in such
a manner that we can verify the production from each optional unit or the production from each optional unit must be
kept separate until after loss adjustment under the policy is completed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Each optional unit must meet one or more of the following criteria as applicable:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Optional Units by Section, Section Equivalent, or ASCS Farm Serial Number: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Optional units may be established if each optional unit is located in a separate legally identified Section. In the
absence of Sections, we may consider parcels of land legally identified by other methods of measure including, but
not limited to: Spanish grants, railroad surveys, leagues, labors, or Virginia Military Lands as equivalent of Sections
for unit purposes. In areas which have not been surveyed using the systems identified above, or another system approved
by us, or in areas where such systems exist but boundaries are not readily discernable, each optional unit must be located
in a separate farm identified by a single ASCS Farm Serial Number.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Optional Units on Acreage Including Both Irrigated and Non-irrigated Practices: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to or instead of establishing optional units by Section, section equivalent, or ASCS Farm Serial Number,
optional units may be based on irrigated acreage or non-irrigated acreage if both are located in the same Section,
section equivalent, or ASCS Farm Serial Number. The irrigated acreage may not extend beyond the point at which your
irrigation system can deliver the quantity of water needed to produce the yield on which your guarantee is based and
you may not continue into non-irrigated acreage in the same rows or planting pattern. You must plant, cultivate, fertilize,
or otherwise care for the irrigated acreage in accordance with recognized good irrigated farming practices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Basic units may not be divided into optional units on any basis (production practice, type, variety, planting period,
etc.) other than as described under this section. If you do not comply fully with these provisions, we will combine
all optional units which are not in compliance with these provisions into the basic unit from which they were formed.
We may combine the optional units at any time we discover that you have failed to comply with these provisions. If failure
to comply with these provisions on all optional units is determined to be inadvertent, and the optional units are combined,
premium paid for the purpose of electing optional units will be refunded to you.

11. Settlement of Claim
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide records of production:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) For any optional unit, we will combine all optional units for which acceptable records of production were not provided;
or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For any basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the
harvested acreage for each unit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim on any unit by:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Multiplying the insured acreage by the production guarantee;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Subtracting from this the total production to count;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Multiplying the remainder by your price election; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Multiplying this result by your share.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The total production (pounds) to count from all insurable acreage on the unit will include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) All appraised production as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Not less than the production guarantee for acreage:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) That is abandoned;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Put to another use without our consent;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Damaged solely by uninsured causes;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(E) On which the cotton stalks are destroyed in violation of section 10; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Unharvested production (mature unharvested production may be adjusted for quality deficiencies in accordance
with subsection: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) 11.(d) and (e) if it is mature ELS cotton; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) 11.(f) if it is AUP cotton insured under these crop provisions); and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Potential production on insured acreage you want to put to another use or you wish to abandon or no longer care for,
if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement the insurance period for that acreage
will end if you put the acreage to another use or abandon the crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production
is not reached: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you
agree to leave intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the crop in locations acceptable
to us (The amount of production to count for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals from
the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not leave the required samples intact, or you fail to
provided sufficient care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put the acreage to another
use will be used to determine the amount of production to count.); or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of production to count for the acreage will be the harvested
production, or our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not harvested; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage, including any mature cotton retrieved from the ground.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Mature ELS cotton production may be adjusted for quality when production has been damaged by insured causes. Such
production to count will be reduced if the price quotation for ELS cotton of like quality (price quotation ``A'') is
less than seventy-five percent (75%) of price quotation ``B.'' Price quotation ``B'' will be the price quotation
for ELS cotton of the grade, staple length, and micronaire reading designated in the Special Provisions for this purpose.
The price quotations for prices ``A'' and ``B'' will be the price quotations contained in the Weekly Cotton Market
Review published by the USDA Agricultural Marketing Service the week the last bale from the unit is classed. If the
date the last bale is classed is not available, the price quotations will be determined the week the last bale from the
unit is delivered to the warehouse as shown on the producer's account summary obtained from the gin. In the absence
of either price quotation for the applicable week, the price quotations for the nearest prior week for which an ELS
cotton price quotation was listed for both prices will be used. If eligible for adjustment, the amount of production
to be counted will be determined by multiplying the number of pounds of such production by the factor derived from dividing
price quotation ``A'' by seventy-five percent (75%) of price quotation ``B.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) For ELS cotton to be eligible for quality adjustment as shown in subsection 11.(d), ginning must have been completed
at a gin using roller equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Any AUP cotton harvested or appraised from acreage originally planted to ELS cotton in the same growing season
will be reduced by the factor obtained by dividing the price per pound of the AUP cotton by the price quotation for ELS
cotton of the grade, staple length, and micronaire reading designated in the Special Provisions for this purpose.
The price used for the ELS cotton will be the price contained in the Weekly Cotton Market Review published by the USDA
Agricultural Marketing Service the week the last bale from the unit is classed. The price used for the AUP cotton will
be the price contained in the Daily Spot Cotton Quotations published by the USDA Agricultural Marketing Service the
day the last bale from the unit is classed. If the date the last bale is classed is not available, the price quotations
will be determined when the last bale from the unit is delivered to the warehouse, as shown on the producers account
summary obtained from the gin. If either price quotation is unavailable for the dates stated above, the price quotations
for the nearest prior date for which price quotations for both the AUP and ELS cotton are available will be used. If prices
are not yet available for the insured crop year, the previous season's average prices will be used.

12. Prevented Planting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) In lieu of paragraph 8.(b)(2) and subsection 1.(aa) of the Common Crop Insurance Policy (&sect;457.8), insurance
will be provided for acreage you were prevented from planting (see subsections 12.(b) through (g)). This coverage
provides a reduced production guarantee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reduced guarantee will be combined with the production guarantee for timely planted acreage for each unit. The
premium amount for eligible prevented planting acreage will be the same as that for timely planted acreage. If the
amount of premium you are required to pay (gross premium less our subsidy) for prevented planting acreage exceeds
the liability on such acreage, coverage for those acres will not be provided (no premium will be due and no indemnity
will be paid for such acreage). (For example, assume you insure one unit in which you have a 100 percent (100%) share.
The unit consists of 100 acres, of which 50 acres were planted by the final planting date and 50 acres are unplanted and
eligible for prevented planting coverage. To calculate the amount of any indemnity which may be due to you, the production
guarantee for the unit will be computed as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) For timely planted acreage, multiply the per acre production guarantee for timely planted acreage by the 50 acres
planted; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For prevented planting acreage, multiply the per acre production guarantee for timely planted acreage by thirty-five
percent (0.35) and multiply the result by the 50 acres eligible for prevented planting coverage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total of the two calculations will be the production guarantee for the unit. Your premium will be based on the result
of multiplying the per acre production guarantee for timely planted acreage by the 100 acres in the unit). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) If you were prevented from planting ELS cotton (see subsection 1.(l)), you may elect: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Not to plant this acreage to any crop that is intended for harvest in the same crop year, (The production guarantee
for such acreage will be thirty-five percent (0.35) of the production guarantee for timely planted acres. For example,
if your production guarantee for timely planted acreage is 600 pounds per acre, your prevented planting production
guarantee would be equivalent to 210 pounds per acre (600 pounds multiplied by 0.35). This paragraph does not prohibit
the preparation and care of the acreage for conservation practices, such as planting a cover crop, as long as such crop
is not intended for harvest.); or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) To plant ELS cotton after the final planting date (The production guarantee for such acreage will be thirty-five
percent (0.35) of the production guarantee for timely planted acres. For example, if your production guarantee for
timely planted acreage is 600 pounds per acre, your prevented planting production guarantee would be equivalent
to 210 pounds per acre (600 pounds multiplied by 0.35). Production to count for such acreage will be determined in accordance
with subsections 11.(c) through (e)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) In addition to the provisions of section 11 (Insurance Period) of the Common Crop Insurance Policy (&sect;457.8),
the insurance period for prevented planting coverage beginning on the sales closing date contained in the Special
Provisions for the insured crop in the county. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) You must provide written notice to us if you were prevented from planting (see subsection 1.(l)). This notice must
be given not later than three (3) days after the final planting date if you have unplanted acreage that may be eligible
for prevented planting coverage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The acreage to which prevented planting coverage applies will be limited as follows:

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) If you participate in any program administered by the United States Department of Agriculture for the crop year
which limits the number of acres that may be planted, prevented planting acreage will not exceed the ASCS base acreage
for the insured crop, reduced by any acreage reduction applicable to the farm under such program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If you do not participate in any program administered by the United States Department of Agriculture which limits
the number of acres that may be planted, unless a written agreement exists to the contrary, eligible acreage will not
exceed the greater of:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The ASCS base acreage for the insured crop, if applicable;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The number of acres planted to ELS cotton on each ASCS Farm Serial Number during the previous crop year (adjusted
for any reconstitution which may have occurred prior to the sales closing date); or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) One hundred percent (100%) of the simple average of the number of acres planted to ELS cotton during the crop years
that were used to determine your yield;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Acreage intended to be planted under an irrigated practice will be limited to the number of acres properly prepared
to carry out an irrigated practice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A prevented planting production guarantee will not be provided for:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Any acreage that does not constitute at least 20 acres or 20 percent (20%) of the acres in the unit, whichever is less;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Land for which the actuarial table does not designate a premium rate unless a written agreement is in place designating
such premium rate;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Land used for conservation purposes or intended to be or considered to have been left unplanted under any program
administered by the United States Department of Agriculture;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Land on which any crop, other than ELS cotton, has been planted and is intended for harvest, or has been harvested
in the same crop year; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Land which planting history or conservation plans indicate would remain fallow for crop rotation purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) For the purpose of determining eligible acreage for prevented planting coverage, acreage for all units will be
combined and reduced by the number of ELS cotton acres timely planted. (For example, assume you have 100 acres eligible
for prevented planting coverage in which you have a 100 percent (100%) share. The acreage is located in a single ASCS
Farm Serial Number which you insure as two separate optional units consisting of 50 acres each. If you planted 60 acres
of ELS cotton on one optional unit and 40 acres of cotton on the second optional unit, your prevented planting eligible
acreage would be reduced to zero. (100 acres eligible for prevented planting coverage minus 100 acres planted equals
zero). If you report more ELS cotton acreage under this contract than is eligible for prevented planting coverage,
we will allocate the eligible acreage to insured units based on the number of prevented planting acres and share you
reported for each unit.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) When the ASCS Farm Serial Number covers more than one unit, or a unit consists of more than one ASCS Farm Serial Number,
the covered acres will be pro-rated based on the number of acres in each unit or ASCS Farm Serial Number that could have
been planted to ELS cotton in the current crop year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) In accordance with the provisions of section 6 (Report of Acreage) of the Common Crop Insurance Policy (&sect;457.8),
you must report any insurable acreage you were prevented from planting. This report must be submitted on or before
the acreage reporting date, even though you may elect to plant the acreage after the final planting date. Any acreage
you report as eligible for prevented planting coverage which is not eligible will be deleted from prevented planting
coverage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Small Business Administration (SBA) amends its regulations governing waivers to its nonmanufacturer rule.
In essence, this rule reflects more accurately the statutory language set forth in section 8(a)(17)(B)(iv) of the
Small Business Act to ensure that SBA's size regulations are consistent with the statute.

Section 210 of the Small Business Administration Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 1990, Public Law 101&hyph;574,
104 Stat. 2814, 2821, revised section 8(a)(17)(B)(iv) of the Small Business Act (the Act), 15 U.S.C. 637(a)(17)(B)(iv),
by providing for the possibility of a contract-specific waiver to SBA's nonmanufacturer rule (the requirement that,
for a supply contract, a small business concern that is not itself the manufacturer must provide the product of a domestic
small business manufacturer in order to be considered a small business). An earlier statute, the Business Opportunity
Development Reform Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100&hyph;656, 102 Stat. 3853) provided for the possibility of waivers to the
nonmanufacturer rule for classes of products for which there were no small business manufacturers in the federal
market.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In a final rule (the ``Rule'') published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
on September 21, 1993, 58 FR 48956, SBA defined the nonmanufacturer rule as ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
the requirement 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
set forth in 13 CFR 121.906 and 121.1106 that a contractor *&blank;*&blank;* provide its own product or that of another

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
domestic small business *&blank;*&blank;*'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(Emphasis added). 13 CFR 121.2102(e). The final rule defined the term ``Federal market'' as acquisitions by the Federal
government from ``offerors located in the entire geographic United States'' or a more restricted market area. 13
CFR 121.2102(d). The final rule also set forth procedures for waiver of the nonmanufacturer rule as to classes of products.
On March 18, 1994, SBA published a final rule amending 13 CFR 121.906 and 121.1106 to provide for a contract-specific
waiver. 59 FR 12811. These regulations permit waivers of the nonmanufacturer rule for either classes of products
or specific procurements after a determination ``that no small business manufacturer or processor is available
to participate in the Federal procurement market.'' 13 CFR 121.906(b)(3) and 121.1106(b)(3). As further background,
the prior wording of 13 CFR 121.906(b)(3) and 121.1106(b)(3) also referred to waivers for classes of products for
which there were no small business manufacturers or processors ``in the Federal market''. Thus, SBA has consistently
regarded the nonmanufacturer rule and its waivers of that rule as involving a single, non-severable requirement
for domestic small business suppliers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 30, 1994, the SBA published a proposed rule that would make various revisions to its section 8(a) program.
59 FR 44652. Included within this rule was a proposal to clarify the nonmanufacturer rule by specifically authorizing
a small business nonmanufacturer to supply other than a product made in the United States for a small business set aside
or section 8(a) contract where the procuring agency makes a non-availability determination under the Buy American
Act and section 25.102(a)(4) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations.

at 44653&hyph;54, 44659&hyph;60. This reference was designed to take note expressly of the separate domestic business
requirement imposed by the Buy American Act. The proposed rule allowed a thirty-day comment period, or until September
29, 1994.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After a careful legal review of Section 210 of Pub. L. 101&hyph;574 (the statutory provision authorizing a waiver
to SBA's nonmanufacturer rule), its accompanying legislative history, and a written comment received prior to the
publication of the August 30, 1994 proposed rule that pertains to the ``domestic'' portion of the nonmanufacturing
rule, SBA has concluded that the correct interpretation of the Act is that a waiver of the nonmanufacturer rule under
section 8(a)(17)(B)(iv) is a waiver of the entire requirement that a nonmanufacturer must supply the product of a
domestic small business. In this regard, section 8(a)(17)(B)(iv) of the Act states that a nonmanufacturer must ``supply
the product of a domestic small business manufacturer or processor, unless [the Administrator grants] a waiver of

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
such requirement
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.'' SBA believes that the statutory reference to ``such requirement'' relates to the entire requirement that, absent
a waiver, a nonmanufacturer must supply the product of a domestic small business. A waiver issued pursuant to this
statutory authority therefore serves to authorize a nonmanufacturer to supply other than the product of a domestic
small business while still qualifying as a small business under the Act. It should be noted, however, that SBA's waiver
of its nonmanufacturer rule does not waive other government-wide requirements applicable to government procurement,
such as the Buy American Act, and any statements of SBA to the effect that the domestic requirement could not be waived
by SBA were intended only to make this point.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SBA recognizes that its current regulations may still cause some confusion on this point. Currently, 13 CFR 121.906(b)(1),
for small business set asides, and 13 CFR 121.1106(b)(1), for 8(a) procurement, each contain a separate paragraph
(iv) ostensibly suggesting that a nonmanufacturer must supply a product that was manufactured or produced in the
United States regardless of whether a waiver has been granted. As indicated above, SBA believes that the waiver of
any domestic manufacture requirement is statutorily contained within any waiver of the nonmanufacturer rule granted.
These paragraphs are also inconsistent with the other regulatory provisions described above which have dealt with
definitions relevant to the nonmanufacturer rule and its waiver. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SBA believes clarification to its regulations is advisable to eliminate any such inconsistency or confusion. This
final rule incorporates, without substantive change, the statutory language of section 8(a)(17)(B)(iv) of the
Act into SBA's size regulations at 13 CFR 121.906(b)(1)(iii) for small business set aside procurements and at 13 CFR
121.1106(b)(1)(iii) for section 8(a) procurements, and eliminates any inconsistency in the regulations. It also
adds clarifying language by adding new paragraphs 121.906(b)(4) and 121.1106(b)(4) to explain that an SBA waiver
of the nonmanufacturer rule has no effect on other laws and regulations dealing with domestic or foreign sources for
government acquisitions which may exist outside the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the statutory requirement regarding waivers to the nonmanufacturer rule of section 8(a)(17)(B)(iv) of
the Act is being implemented in this final rule, SBA believes that the portion of the August 30, 1994 proposed rule regarding
such waivers has been superseded. The remainder of that proposed rule has not been affected by this final rule, and
will be completed upon publication of a further final rule on revisions to the section 8(a) program.

Compliance With Executive Orders 12612, 12778, and 12866, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601, et seq.),

This rule was not reviewed under Executive Order 12866.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SBA certifies that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is necessary to resolve a possible discrepancy between the Small Business Act and SBA's size regulations
concerning the size eligibility of certain nonmanufacturers for small business set aside and section 8(a) contracts.
It will have no significant effect, however, on the amount or dollar value of any contract requirement or the number
of requirements set aside for small business or the 8(a) program. As such, it is not likely to have an annual economic
effect of $100 million or more, result in a major increase in costs or prices, or have a significant adverse effect on
competition or the United States economy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. Ch. 35, SBA certifies that this final rule contains no new reporting
or record keeping requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of Executive Order 12612, SBA certifies that this rule does not have any federalism implications warranting
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of Executive Order 12778, SBA certifies that this rule is drafted, to the extent practicable, in accordance
with the standards set forth in Section 2 of that Order.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document corrects information in an existing airworthiness directive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(AD), applicable to certain Learjet Model 60 airplanes, that currently requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deactivation of the auxiliary cabin and cockpit heating systems and installation of

placards. This action corrects the applicability of the rule. This action is necessary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure that only airplanes subject to the addressed unsafe condition are subject to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of the rule.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On November 22, 1993, the FAA issued AD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
93&hyph;23&hyph;12, amendment 39&hyph;8748 (58 FR 63060, November 30, 1993), to require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deactivation of the auxiliary cabin and cockpit heating systems on all Learjet Model 60 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplanes, and the installation of a placard stating, ``Cabin and Cockpit Heat Inop.'' That 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action was prompted by a report of a fire in the aft fuselage of one airplane, which had 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resulted from miswiring that was installed in an auxiliary cabin heater during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacture. The actions required by that AD are intended to prevent overheating of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
auxiliary cabin and cockpit heaters, which potentially could result in a fire. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Recently, the FAA has become aware of the fact that the applicability of the AD is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unnecessarily broad. In developing the AD, the FAA intended that its applicability be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coextensive with the effectivity listing of Learjet Alert Service Bulletin SB A60&hyph;21&hyph;1, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dated November 1, 1993. (That service bulletin was referenced in the rule as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate source of service information.) That service bulletin indicates that only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplanes having serial numbers 60&hyph;002 through 60&hyph;021, inclusive, are subject to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addressed unsafe condition; all other airplanes of this model were modified during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production in such a way so as to preclude the unsafe condition. However, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicability of the AD, as published, inadvertently indicated that all airplanes of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
model were applicable to the requirements of the AD, rather than just those having serial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
numbers 60&hyph;002 through 60&hyph;021. That inadvertent action incorrectly made the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of the AD redundant for airplanes other than those with the specified serial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
numbers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that it is appropriate to take action to correct the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicability of AD 93&hyph;23&hyph;12 to specify only airplanes that are subject to the addressed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unsafe condition. Therefore, action must be taken to correctly limit the AD's applicability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to only Learjet Model 60 airplanes having serial numbers 60&hyph;002 through 60&hyph;021, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inclusive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Action is taken herein to correct the error and to correctly add the AD as an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendment to section 39.13 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 39.13). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective date of the rule remains December 15, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule is being reprinted in its entirety for the convenience of affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operators. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since this action only corrects an inadvertent error in the applicability of the rule, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
so as to eliminate airplanes not subject to the identified unsafe condition, it has no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse economic impact and imposes no additional burden on any person. Therefore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice and public procedures hereon are unnecessary.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Pratt &amp; Whitney (PW) JT8D series turbofan
engines, that requires a determination of the utilization rate and coating type of the 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, and
12th high pressure compressor (HPC) disks, and removal, inspection for corrosion, and recoating of those HPC disks
based on utilization rate. This amendment is prompted by an investigation into an uncontained PW JT8D engine failure
caused by severe corrosion on the 9th stage HPC disk. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent fracture
of the HPC disks, which can result in uncontained release of engine fragments, inflight engine shutdown, and airframe
damage.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to Pratt &amp; Whitney (PW) JT8D series turbofan engines was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 27, 1993 (58 FR 40079). That action proposed to require a record search, initial and repetitive on-wing and
shop inspections to detect corrosion on high pressure compressor (HPC) disks, and removal from service of engines
with HPC disks corroded beyond serviceable limits. The inspections, and replacement, if necessary, would be accomplished
in accordance with PW Alert Service Bulletin (ASB) No. 6038, Revision 3, dated May 8, 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter states that disks that are recoated when complying with the inspection requirement of the AD should
be zero-timed with regard to the next inspection interval. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) concurs. A
paragraph has been added to the compliance section that addresses recoated disks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter states that there have not been enough disk failures to warrant issuance of an AD. The FAA does not concur.
The need for an AD is based on a determination that an unsafe condition exists that is likely to exist in a product of the
same type design. That determination rests on many factors, including the risk and hazard level of the failure mode,
which in turn are based on several factors, one of which is the number of failures that have occurred. Other data, such
as inspection data, analytical models, and potential consequences are also considered when determining risk and
hazard level. The FAA has determined in these instances that an unsafe condition exists that is likely to exist in engines
of the same type design, and, therefore, an AD is warranted.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA received several comments that state that the borescope inspection for corrosion assessment of Nickel-Cadmium
(NiCad) disks is unreliable and can cause unnecessary engine removals. The FAA concurs. The borescope inspection
for corrosion assessment of NiCad disks has been eliminated and only in-shop inspections are now required. In addition,
high utilization disks require this inspection only at next part access. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA received two comments that state that the four month grace period for the records search should be extended.
The FAA concurs in part. The records search is no longer specifically required, and can be replaced by a simple utilization
determination and an eddy current probe inspection for coating type identification. In addition, the utilization
determination is based on a fleet or sub-fleet average. The AD, however, requires that a utilization determination
must be conducted for each HPC disk within four months of the effective date of this AD for low utilization operations.
But, the FAA believes that it is now a much simpler task. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA received several comments that state that the AD does not adequately address disks that have been used in both
high and low utilization operations. The FAA concurs. The utilization rate determination now includes an adjustment
for disks that have experienced mixed utilization rates, and both an initial and a yearly recalculation that will
account for changes in utilization rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter states that the AD should contain a provision to allow for incorporation of the inspection requirements
into the operator's FAA-approved maintenance program. The FAA does not concur. The criticality of the inspections
required by the AD require that they be separate and distinct from the operator's routine maintenance tasks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA received several comments that state that the records search and inspection requirements of this AD pose an
undue burden on operators of PW JT8D engines. The FAA concurs in part. The records search is no longer specifically
required, and has been replaced by a simpler utilization determination together with an eddy current probe inspection
for coating type identification. In addition, the utilization determination is based on a fleet or sub-fleet average.
The borescope inspection has been eliminated, the disk removal (for inspection) requirements have been relaxed
based on additional analysis and disk inspections, and high utilization disks, fleets, and sub-fleets will not require
a forced engine removal to comply with the AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA received two comments that state that the compliance schedule for disk inspections is complex and requires
extensive recordkeeping. The FAA concurs. The compliance schedule has now been simplified by eliminating the borescope
inspection and by requiring high utilization operators to inspect the disks at the next access regardless of coating
type. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA received two comments that state that the issuance of the Final Rule should be delayed until additional analytical
and statistical analyses can be performed to further refine disk fracture predictions and required inspection intervals.
The FAA does not concur. The FAA performed extensive additional analysis since the issuance of the proposed rule which
has resulted in the revised compliance requirements discussed in the FAA's responses to several comments. Based
on this additional analysis, the FAA believes that the Final Rule should not be delayed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter states that the cost to drill the borescope hole would place an undue burden on the operator. The FAA concurs
in part. The borescope inspection has been eliminated from the AD and borescope access is not specifically required.
However, borescope access is required if an operator elects to forgo a records search and elects to use the eddy current
probe to determine coating type. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter states that the disk records do not always allow for identification of the coating. The FAA concurs.
The identification of disk coating can now be accomplished by use of an eddy current probe.

One commenter states that the AD should allow for incorporation of an engine heater/de-humidifier to be installed
on low utilization engines when not in operation. This type of device would reduce the accumulation of moisture in
the engine, which can cause disk corrosion. The FAA concurs in part and does not dispute that an engine heater/de-humidifier
would probably reduce the moisture content in low utilization engines. This type of device, however, would need to
be tested to produce data to quantify its effect on moisture and associated disk corrosion. Since this data has not
been submitted to the FAA, it cannot be included in the AD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter agreed with the rule as proposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since publication of the NPRM, the FAA has reviewed and approved the technical contents of PW ASB No. 6038, Revision
5, dated August 17, 1994. This final rule AD references the latest revision of the ASB.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes described previously. The FAA has determined
that these changes that include elimination of the borescope inspection and associated tables, changes to the compliance
intervals, elimination of the records search, addition of the optional eddy current probe inspection, addition
of the adjustment for mixed utilization, and simplification of the utilization determination, are introduced in
response to comments received to the NPRM. The format of the compliance section is revised to incorporate the above
changes and to simplify the readability by eliminating duplication of compliance instructions that are now included
in PW ASB 6038, Revision 5, dated August 17, 1994. The FAA has determined that these changes do not increase the economic
burden on any operator, however, the economic analysis has been recalculated to reflect the total scope of the compliance
program. The FAA has also determined that the above changes do not compromise the safety impact of the compliance program
and do not increase the scope of the AD.

There are approximately 11,119 PW JT8D&hyph;1, &hyph;1A, &hyph;1B, &hyph;7, &hyph;7A, &hyph;7B, &hyph;9, &hyph;9A,
&hyph;11, &hyph;15, &hyph;15A, &hyph;17, &hyph;17A, &hyph;17R, and &hyph;17AR turbofan engines of the affected
design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that approximately 6,815 engines installed on aircraft of U.S. registry
will be affected by this AD, and 2 work hours will be necessary to determine the utilization rate and type of surface
treatment. Based on domestic fleet-wide data, the FAA estimates that approximately 8.7% or 593 engines are considered
to have low utilization rates. Approximately 8.6 work hours will be required to remove these engines from the aircraft,
500 work hours to tear down, deblade, and to reassemble the engine, and 8.6 work hours to reinstall the reassembled
engines. The FAA estimates 69% of the removed engines will require scrapping the disks. The FAA assumes that three
disks per engine may require replacement, and the cost of a new disk is approximately $7,000. The average labor rate
is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, and a forecast 20-year compliance program, the annual cost impact of the
AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,308,958.

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA), OSM is approving a proposed amendment to the
Navajo Nation's AMLR plan (hereinafter referred to as the ``Navajo Nation plan'') and, on behalf of the Secretary
of the Interior, in concurring with the Navajo Nation's certification that the Navajo Nation has abated or reclaimed
all coal-related AML problems on its lands under the Navajo Nation plan. The amendment, which the Navajo Nation proposed
in order for its plan to meet the requirements of the Federal regulations and SMCRA, to clarify ambiguities, and to
improve operational efficiency, consists of statute and rule revisions pertaining to reclamation of interim program
abandoned coal mines, coal priorities, certification of completion of coal reclamation, establishment of a noncoal
reclamation program subsequent to certification including the authority to undertake community impact assistance
and public facilities projects, and creation of a future reclamation set-aside fund. OSM's concurrence with the
Navajo Nation's certification of the completion of all coal-related problems, which was requested by the President
of the Navajo Nation, means that the Navajo Nation is now authorized to use monies from the Navajo Abandoned Mine Reclamation
(AMR) fund for noncoal reclamation purposes, including the construction of public facilities.

Title IV of SMCRA establishes an AMLR program for the purposes of reclaiming and restoring lands and waters adversely
affected by past mining. It also provides for Tribal or State submittal to OSM of an AMLR plan. The Secretary of the Interior
adopted regulations in 30 CFR 870 through 888 that implement Title IV of SMCRA. Under these regulations, the Secretary
reviewed the Tribe's or State's AMLR plan and solicited and considered comments of State and Federal agencies and
the public. Based upon the comments received, the Secretary determined whether a Tribe or State had the ability and
necessary legislation to implement the provisions of Title IV. After making such a determination, the Secretary
decided whether to approve the Tribe or State AMLR plan. Approval granted the Tribe or State exclusive authority to
administer its approved plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following approval of a Tribe's or State's AMLR plan by the Secretary, an application may be submitted to OSM by a Tribe
or State on an annual basis for funds to be expended by that Tribe or State on specific projects necessary to implement
the approved plan. Such annual grant applications are reviewed and approved by OSM in accordance with the requirements
of 30 CFR 886.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Federal Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund (Federal Fund), which is administered by the Secretary through OSM,
is financed by a reclamation fee assessed on every ton of mined coal. Expenditures from the Federal Fund are subject
to appropriation by Congress. The Federal Fund is divided into Tribal or State and Federal shares with each Indian
tribe or State under a federally approved reclamation program entitled to 50 percent of the reclamation fees collected
from coal operations on Indian lands or within the State. Annually, the Indian tribes or States receive reclamation
project construction grants and administrative grants from their share of the Federal Fund. Subject to OSM approval,
Tribes and States are also authorized to create special interest-bearing Tribe or State trust accounts into which
up to 10 percent of their annual grants can be deposited. These ``set-aside'' accounts may be used to achieve the priorities
of section 403(a) of SMCRA after September 30, 1995, or be deposited into an acid mine drainage abatement and treatment
fund.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Noncoal AMLR projects can be undertaken by a Tribe or State under two scenarios, both of which are subject to OSM approval
in the grants process. Prior to a Tribe or State certifying in accordance with section 411(a) of SMCRA that it has completed
the reclamation of all eligible abandoned coal projects, it can expend Tribal or State share monies for those noncoal
projects that are a hazard to public health and safety. After a Tribe or State has certified that it has completed reclamation
of all eligible abandoned coal projects, it can then use the full amount of its Tribal or State share for abandoned noncoal
mine land reclamation projects. Such noncoal projects include the construction of public facilities related to
the coal or minerals industry.

On May 16, 1988, the Secretary of the Interior approved, with one exception, the Navajo Nation plan as originally submitted
in June 1983, resubmitted on September 6, 1983, and amended in February 1988. General background information on the
Navajo Nation plan, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, the decision deferring any
action on the Navajo Nation's proposal to assume the emergency response authority, and the approval of the Navajo
Nation plan can be found in the May 16, 1988,

III. Proposed Amendment and Request for Concurrence With Certification of Completion of Coal Reclamation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letters dated April 7 and 22, 1994, the Navajo Nation submitted a proposed amendment to its AMLR plan pursuant to
SMCRA (administrative record Nos. NA&hyph;207, NA&hyph;208, and NA&hyph;212). The Navajo Nation submitted the
proposed amendment at its own initiative with the intent of revising its AMLR plan so it could use AMR funds to reclaim
remaining interim program coal sites and for noncoal reclamation purposes, including the construction of public
facilities. Interim program coal sites are eligible lands and water mined after August 3, 1977, but prior to September
28, 1984 (the date the permanent Federal regulatory program took effect on Navajo Nation lands), for which available
funds for reclamation or abatement pursuant to a bond or other form of financial guarantee or from any other source
are not sufficient to provide for adequate abatement or reclamation at a site.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Navajo Nation proposed revisions to its AMLR Code of 1987 at (1) the introduction to the Navajo AMLR Code; (2) Title
I, section 101, findings, and section 102, purposes; (3) Title II, sections 201(a), (b), (c) and (d), duties of the
Navajo Abandoned Mine Lands Reclamation Department (NAMLRD); and (4) Title IV, sections 401(a), (b)(5), (b)(6),
(c)(5) and (c)(8), Navajo AMR fund and purposes; section 402, reclamation fee; sections 403(a) and (b), objectives
of the fund; section 404, eligible lands and water; sections 405(a), (b), (c), and (f), Tribal reclamation program;
section 407, acquisition and reclamation of lands within the Navajo Nation adversely affected by past mining practices;
section 408, liens; section 409, filling voids and sealing tunnels; section 410, emergency powers; section 411,
certification of completion of coal reclamation; section 412, fund report; section 413, miscellaneous powers;
and section 414, interagency cooperation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Navajo Nation also proposed revisions to the Navajo Nation Rules implementing the AMLR Code of 1987 at (1) section
II, Part D, subsections 1 and 2, reclamation priorities; Part L, subsections 1 and 2, general reclamation requirements;
Part M, subsections 1 and 2, certification of completion of coal reclamation; Part N, subsection 1, eligible lands
and water subsequent to certification; Part O, subsection 1, exclusion of noncoal reclamation sites; Part P, subsections
1, 2, and 3, utilities and other facilities, and (2) section III, Part E, subsection 1, future reclamation set-aside
program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, by letter dated May 4, 1994, the President of the Navajo Nation notified the Secretary of the Interior
that the Navajo Nation was certifying that it had completed all of its coal reclamation projects (administrative
record No. NA&hyph;213) and stated that NAMLRD intends to complete all remaining priority 1 and 2 coal reclamation
projects, including interim coal reclamation projects, as required by section 403(a) of SMCRA. Reclamation projects
are funded under a priority schedule, such that ``priority 1'' projects concern those that involve the protection
of public health, safety, general welfare and property from extreme danger of the adverse effects of coal mining practices
while ``priority 2'' projects concern those that involve protection of public health, safety, and general welfare
from adverse effects of coal mining practices. The Navajo Nation submitted the request for the Secretary's concurrence
with certification of completion of all known coal-related problems with the intent that, if the Secretary concurred
with the certification, the Nation would request AMR funds to pursue projects under the provisions of section 411
of SMCRA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment and the Navajo Nation's request for the Secretary's concurrence
with its certification of completion of coal reclamation in the May 18, 1994,

 (59 FR 25852, administrative record No. NA&hyph;214), provided an opportunity for a public hearing or meeting and
public comment on the substantive adequacy of the Navajo Nation's proposed amendment and certification, and requested
information concerning any known or suspected unreclaimed lands and water resources on Navajo Nation lands that
would be eligible for expenditures from the AMR fund under the provisions of the Navajo Nation's reclamation program.
Because no one requested a public hearing or meeting, none was held. The public comment period ended on June 17, 1994.

c. Title IV. Section 401(b)(5), Interest Credited to the AMR Fund
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Navajo Nation proposed new language in its AMLR Code of 1987 at Title IV, section 401(b)(5) to provide that the Navajo
AMR Fund shall consist, in part, of amounts derived from ``interest credited to the fund under subsection (e) of section
401 of SMCRA.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 401(e) of SMCRA provides that interest can be earned on that portion of the Federal AMR Fund (administered
by the Secretary) not required to meet current withdrawals. Interest earned on the invested portion of the Federal
Fund is distributed only to the Secretarial share of the Federal Fund. Therefore, none of the interest earned on the
invested portion of the Federal Fund is distributed to any portion of the Tribal or State share of the Federal Fund which
each Tribe or State receives in annual grants as provided at 30 CFR 886. Section 401(e) of SMCRA does not restrict a Tribe
or State from earning interest on the AMR fund created by a Tribe or State as part of its AMLR program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, section 401(b)(5) of the Navajo Nation AMLR Code of 1987 is interpreted to mean that the interest credited
to the Navajo AMR fund is not the interest earned on the Federal Fund but is limited to interest credited from the deposit
of other monies as provided in the Navajo Nation AMLR Code of 1987 by sections 401(b)(2), (3), (4), and (6) which include
reclamation fees, user charges, donations, recovered monies, and other reclamation fees lawfully imposed by the
Navajo Nation. The Director approves proposed section 401(b)(5) of the Navajo Nation AMLR Code of 1987 with the understanding
that the interest earned is limited to the aforementioned monies deposited to the Navajo AMR fund.

d. Title IV, Section 410, Emergency Powers
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Navajo Nation proposed deletion of its emergency powers provisions at Title IV, section 410 of its AMLR Code of
1987. Deletion of these provisions is consistent with the approval of the Navajo Nation's AMLR plan (53 FR 17186, 17190;
May 16, 1988) where the Secretary deferred decision on the emergency response program pending additional documentation
addressing the specific criteria concerning assumption of emergency response authority. Because the Navajo Nation
did not submit such additional documentation, the emergency powers program was never approved. The Director, therefore,
approves deletion of the provisions for emergency powers at section 410 of the Navajo Nation AMLR Code of 1987 and notes
that it is the Navajo Nation's intent to delete all references to emergency powers within its AMLR Code of 1987.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Navajo Nation proposed new language in its AMLR Code of 1987 at Title IV, section 414 to provide for interagency
cooperation in implementing and administering the provisions of the Navajo Nation plan ``where such cooperation
does not conflict with existing Navajo Nation and/or applicable federal laws.'' Section 413(a) of SMCRA provides,
in part, that a Tribe has the authority to engage in any work and to do all things necessary or expedient to implement
and administer the provisions of Title IV. Therefore, the limitation of interagency cooperation to instances where
no conflict with existing Navajo Nation or applicable Federal laws occur meets the requirements of section 413 of
SMCRA. Accordingly, the Director approves section 414 of the Navajo Nation AMLR Code of 1987.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM notes that the Navajo Nation plan provides the authority for the Tribe to conduct a reclamation program on Navajo
(Indian) lands as that term is defined in section 701(9) of SMCRA. Indian lands occur within and outside traditional
reservation boundaries. Although there may be jurisdictional limitations to the Navajo Nation's authority to undertake
certain reclamation actions outside the reservation, the Navajo Nation plan presents a variety of reclamation procedures
and activities which would allow the Tribe to undertake its reclamation program without violating the jurisdictional
rights of other parties. Because certain lands within the boundaries of the Navajo Nation Reservation are ``disputed
lands'' and other lands are under the control of the Office of the Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation, it is understood
by OSM that any reclamation or abatement action proposed by the Navajo Nation will be coordinated with and due consideration
given to concerns raised by all parties asserting ownership of these lands.

f. Navajo Nation II(L)(1)(d), Interim Program Coal Sites
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Navajo Nation proposed the addition of provisions in its Navajo Nation Rules at II(L)(1)(d) that address interim
program coal sites.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 402(g)(4) of SMCRA provides for the reclamation of interim coal program sites and further provides that sections
403(a) (1) and (2) of SMCRA determine which sites to reclaim.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Navajo Nation does not have a statutory requirement that addresses reclamation of interim program coal sites.
OSM acknowledges that the Navajo Nation has submitted a grant application in accordance with the provisions of 30
CFR 886 to fund reclamation of all remaining priority 1 and 2 abandoned coal mine sites, including interim program
coal reclamation projects, as required by section 403(a) of SMCRA. The Navajo Nation has also demonstrated to OSM's
satisfaction that the Navajo Nation AMR fund contains enough monies in reserve to address reclamation of the remaining
sites. On this basis and upon approval of the proposed plan amendment that is the subject of this notice, OSM will begin
reviewing the pending grant application. OSM also understands that the Navajo Nation is in the process of revising
its AMLR Code of 1987 to provide for the reclamation of interim program coal sites. The Director, therefore, approves
the Navajo Nation's proposed rule at section II, Part L, subsection 1(d) addressing interim program coal reclamation.

2. Request for Concurrence With Certification of Completion of Coal Reclamation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The President of the Navajo Nation notified the Secretary of the Interior that the Navajo Nation certifies to the completion
of all its coal reclamation projects. Section 411(a) of SMCRA provides that the head of an Indian tribe may certify
to the Secretary that all of the priorities stated in section 403(a) of SMCRA for eligible lands and water have been
achieved and that the Secretary, after notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and opportunity for public comment, shall concur with such certification if the Secretary determines that such certification
is correct.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the Secretary's approval of the Navajo Nation plan, the Navajo Nation has conducted reclamation to correct
or mitigate problems caused by past coal mining. The Navajo Nation has completed this reclamation in the order of priority
set forth in section 403(a) of SMCRA. OSM acknowledges that there are remaining priority 1 and 2 abandoned coal mine
sites yet to be reclaimed by the Navajo Nation, but upon approval of the grant application submitted by the Navajo Nation
in accordance with 30 CFR 886 and as discussed in finding No. 1.e. above, the Navajo Nation will have addressed all known
remaining pre-SMCRA and interim program abandoned coal mine lands.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the Navajo Nation's May 4, 1994, certification, and the absence of any known unreclaimed coal-related
impacts, the Director of OSM, on behalf of the Secretary, concurs with the Navajo Nation's certification that all
coal-related abandoned mine land problems have been abated or reclaimed, and finds that the Navajo Nation has satisfied
the requirements of section 403 of SMCRA. If a coal problem occurs or is identified in the future, the Navajo Nation
would have to seek immediate funding to reclaim the coal-related problem. Concurrence with the Navajo Nation's certification
of completion of coal reclamation means that the Navajo Nation may now use annual grants made available under section
402(g)(1) of SMCRA to carry out activities or construction of specific public facilities related to the coal or minerals
industry in accordance with section 411(f) of SMCRA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 411 of SMCRA and 30 CFR 884.15(a) and 884.14(a)(1), OSM invited public comment and provided an
opportunity for a public hearing on the Navajo Nation's proposed amendment and certification of completion of coal
reclamation (administrative record No. NA&hyph;214). No public comments were received, and because no one requested
an opportunity to testify at a public hearing, no hearing was held.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 30 CFR 884.15(a) and 884.14(a)(2), OSM solicited comments on the proposed amendment and request for concurrence
with the Navajo Nation's certification of completion of coal reclamation from Federal, State, and Tribal agencies
with an actual or potential interest in the Navajo Nation plan (administrative record Nos. NA&hyph;209 and NA&hyph;215).

Navajo Environmental Protection Administration (Navajo EPA)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Navajo EPA stated that the proposed amendment of the Navajo Nation plan differed from SMCRA and provided comments
in a letter dated May 27, 1994 (administrative record No. NA&hyph;219), including editorial comments pertaining
to the specific language proposed in the plan amendment and suggestions on how to improve such language. These editorial
comments are available in the administrative record for this amendment, and a copy has been provided to the Navajo
Nation. However, because these comments are nonsubstantive in nature, OSM has not addressed them below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Navajo EPA stated that the title of the Navajo Nation plan should be changed to the ``Navajo Abandoned Mine Lands
Reclamation Plan'' to clarify that the plan refers only to abandoned mine land reclamation, and not to any active mines,
over which NAMLRD has no jurisdiction. OSM responds that the Navajo Nation's Reclamation Plan is approved under Title
IV, Abandoned Mine Reclamation, of SMCRA and not under Title V, Control of the Environmental Impacts of Surface Coal
Mining, which provides the authority for States to administer coal mining regulatory programs. No legislation exists
granting Indian tribes the authority to regulate coal mining on Indian lands.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Navajo EPA indicated that the plan amendment did not incorporate standards to be used by NAMLRD for air, water,
soil, radioactivity, and other topics, when deciding whether a site has been completely reclaimed. Title IV of SMCRA
and the implementing Federal regulations do not require specific reclamation standards. OSM, during field reviews,
provides the necessary oversight to ensure that projects funded using AMR funds meet the goals established when funding
was approved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Navajo EPA suggested that section II(D)(1)(a&hyph;e) of the Navajo Nation Rules concerning reclamation priorities
may need a clarifying statement to indicate that ``Priority A'' is the same as ``priority 1,'' and so forth, as used
in SMCRA and by NAMLRD (to designate priorities of eligible lands and water for expenditures from the Navajo AMR fund).
OSM agrees that a clarifying statement would be helpful, but the dual designations are not so confusing as to affect
their implementation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Navajo EPA expressed concern that section II(L)(1) of the Navajo Nation Rules pertaining to general reclamation
requirements does not state that the eligibility requirements are set under SMCRA and were not devised by the Navajo
Nation. OSM responds that, while the Navajo Nation Rules do not specifically reference SMCRA in this section, these
rules implement the Navajo Nation AMLR Code of 1987 which is the Navajo Nation's counterpart to SMCRA. The eligibility
requirements established by these rules are consistent with section 404 of SMCRA. Therefore, a specific reference
to this SMCRA citation is not necessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Navajo EPA stated that because it had found no indication that any ``State'' has held a reclamation bond for mining
activities conducted within the Navajo Nation, the word ``State'' in the Navajo Nation Rules at section II(L)(2)(b)(3)
concerning reclamation bonds should be deleted. This is an editorial comment, and the implication that the State
may hold a bond for reclamation activities on Navajo Nation lands is immaterial.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Navajo EPA commented that section II(M)(2) of the Navajo Nation Rules, which states that ``[f]ollowing the concurrence
by the Director [with the Navajo Nation's certification of completion of coal reclamation], the Nation may implement
a noncoal reclamation program pursuant to the provisions of section 411 of SMCRA,'' should be revised to clarify that
the ``Director'' is the Director of OSM. While Navajo EPA's comment is consistent with section 411 of SMCRA, which
indicates that the Secretary (in this case, the Director of OSM for the Secretary) has the authority to concur with
a Tribe's or State's certification, OSM does not find it necessary to require the Navajo Nation to revise this rule.
In requesting the Secretary's concurrence on the Director of NAMLRD's certification of completion of coal reclamation,
the Navajo Nation has complied with section 411 of SMCRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Navajo EPA stated that the reference to ``the Act'' in section II(P)(1)(c) of the Navajo Nation Rules concerning
utilities and other facilities is unclear. OSM interprets the term ``the Act'' as used in this rule to be the Navajo
Nation AMLR Code of 1987 and does not agree with the statement by Navajo EPA that such term is unclear.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Navajo EPA felt that section III(E) of the Navajo Nation Rules pertaining to creation of a future reclamation set-aside
program did not clearly indicate what happens to Navajo AMR funds after all known coal reclamation has been completed.
Navajo EPA asked whether the monies will become general funds, subject then to reappropriation by the Navajo Nation
Council and whether the funds can be used for purposes other than coal reclamation. As discussed in finding No. 2 above,
upon concurrence by the Director of OSM with the Navajo Nation's certification of completion of coal reclamation,
the Navajo Nation may, in accordance with section 411(f) of SMCRA, request AMR grant monies from OSM to pursue public
facilities projects related to coal or mineral development. The Navajo Nation cannot reappropriate these monies
for uses other than what has been approved by OSM.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(9) Navajo EPA stated that because NAMLRD had already received Council approval for the revised code, its review seems
after the fact unless suggested revisions are also put through the SAS (signature approval sheet) process and presented
to the Council. As required by 30 CFR 884.15 and 884.14, OSM must approve the Navajo Nation plan amendment, of which
the Navajo Nation AMLR Code of 1987 is a part, before it is effective. If Navajo EPA identified inconsistencies between
the code and SMCRA and the implementing Federal regulations, OSM would require the Navajo Nation to revise its AMLR
Code of 1987.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) Navajo EPA expressed concern that although NAMLRD prepares all environmental documents required under Federal
law, the documents are only reviewed by OSM, but none of the documents are reviewed by Navajo EPA, as required. This
comment concerns Tribal policy and procedures, which are not inconsistent with the requirements of SMCRA and the
Federal regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(11) Navajo EPA noted that Title II, section 201(d) of the Navajo Nation AMLR Code of 1987 provides that NAMLRD shall
be protected from suite by sovereign immunity, and that no employee can waive this immunity. However, Navajo EPA suggested
that this right may be abrogated by the Federal government as provided in section 405(1) of SMCRA. Section 405(1) of
SMCRA provides for Tribe or State immunity from lawsuits except those resulting from gross negligence or intentional
misconduct by the Tribe or State, so to the extent that the Tribe or State is liable under Federal law, it is held liable.
Therefore, OSM responds that the sovereign immunity claimed by the Navajo Nation extends to all liability situations
except those involving gross negligence or intentional misconduct by the Navajo Nation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(12) Title IV, section 401(b)(2) of the Navajo Nation AMLR Code of 1987 indicates that the Navajo AMR fund shall consist
of monies deposited in the fund from sources including any user charges imposed by the Navajo Nation on or for land reclaimed
pursuant to the code, after expenditures for maintenance have been deducted. Navajo EPA asked that the type of user
charges be clarified, because the code does not specify if these charges refer to grazing or other non-mining activities,
whether fees are already appropriated to other departments, what maintenance expenditures are being referred to,
and who will conduct said maintenance. Navajo EPA stated that this section was copied directly from SMCRA and may have
limited relevance as applied to the Navajo Nation. Specific criteria pertaining to the type of user charges, appropriation
of fees, and maintenance are not addressed in Title IV of SMCRA or the implementing Federal regulations. Therefore,
decisions made by the Navajo Nation regarding user charges it imposes under its AMLR program are limited only to the
extent that they are not inconsistent with SMCRA. Because this provision of the Navajo Nation AMLR Code of 1987 is substantively
identical to section 401(b)(2) of SMCRA, it meets the requirements of SMCRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(13) Title IV, section 401(b)(6) of the Navajo Nation AMLR Code of 1987 indicates that the AMR fund shall consist of
monies deposited in the fund from sources including ``all other reclamation fees lawfully imposed by the Navajo Nation.''
Navajo EPA expressed concern that the statement ``all other reclamation fees'' is extremely broad, and wondered
if it is meant to include reclamation fees for active coal and non-coal mines, for sand and gravel, or oil and gas activities;
whether it applies only to reclamation bonds held by the Nation, or by Federal agencies; and suggested that it is in
direct conflict with regulations outlining how those fees are held and allocated. Section 402 of SMCRA provides for
payment of a reclamation fee on mined coal to be deposited in the Federal AMR Fund. SMCRA and the implementing Federal
regulations do not require the payment of any additional fees and do not restrict a Tribe or State from collecting other
kinds of reclamation fees. Therefore, for these reasons and for the same reasons discussed in comment No. 12 above,
OSM finds this provision of the Navajo Nation AMLR Code of 1987 to be consistent with section 401(b) of SMCRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(14) Navajo EPA pointed out a typographical error in Title IV, section (401)(c)(1) of the Navajo Nation AMLR Code of
1987. The phrase ``prevent abatement'' should be ``prevention, abatement *&blank;*&blank;*'' as in the counterpart
section 401(c)(1) of SMCRA. OSM agrees with Navajo EPA in its comment and recommends that the Navajo Nation review
its plan amendment to correct grammatical, punctuation, and typographical errors and inconsistencies.

(15) Navajo EPA stated that it would be in the Navajo Nation's best interests if NAMLRD inventoried and listed their
priority 3, 4, 5, and 6 projects, since that would include all public facilities projects. This comment was not made
in reference to a specific provision of the Navajo Nation AMLR Code of 1987 or the Navajo Nation Rules; however, the
comment appears to be directed at noncoal reclamation and having NAMLRD complete an inventory and list of public facilities
projects. A Tribe or State is required only to inventory priority 1 and 2 coal sites in accordance with section 403(a)
of SMCRA. NAMLRD, in accordance with section 403(c) of SMCRA, has already inventoried priority 1 and 2 coal sites.
Navajo EPA also stated that it is interested in receiving a copy of the inventory of priority 1 and 2 sites to assist it
in ongoing abandoned uranium mine joint reclamation projects. OSM suggests that Navajo EPA request the information
from NAMLRD or contact OSM's Albuquerque Field Office.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(16) Navajo EPA suggested that since section 405(f)(7) of SMCRA requires NAMLRD to report to OSM annually on projects
funded under the previous year's grant, Title IV, section 405(f) of the Navajo Nation AMLR Code of 1987 should be revised
to require that the same kind of information be provided to the Division of Natural Resources and the Navajo Nation
Council at the same time such information is reported as required under SMCRA. OSM responds that the Navajo Nation
is complying with SMCRA reporting requirements, and if Navajo EPA requires information contained in the documentation
provided by NAMLRD to OSM on an annual basis, then Navajo EPA should request this information directly from NAMLRD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(17) Navajo EPA expressed concern that Title IV, section 407 of the Navajo Nation AMLR Code of 1987 pertaining to acquisition
and reclamation of lands adversely affected by past mining practices does not clearly state whether its provisions
apply only to private lands within the Navajo Nation boundaries, or to lands such as homesite leases, and individual
allotments. Section 407 of SMCRA does not specify the applicability of its provisions as they relate to Indian lands.
However, the Navajo Nation's jurisdiction over Navajo Nation lands was clearly defined in the approval of the Navajo
Nation plan (53 FR 17186, 17187; May 16, 1988) and is addressed in finding No. 1.e.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(18) Navajo EPA stated that Title IV, section 411(a) of the Navajo Nation AMLR Code of 1987 should be changed to be consistent
with the Navajo Nation Rules and provide that the Navajo Nation President will certify completion of coal reclamation
rather than the Director of NAMLRD. Section 411(a) of SMCRA provides that the head of an Indian tribe will certify to
the completion of coal reclamation. The request from the Navajo Nation for the Secretary's concurrence with its certification
of completion of coal reclamation was made by the President of the Navajo Nation, which meets the requirements of section
411(a) of SMCRA and which is the tribal authority Navajo EPA asserted should make the certification. Therefore, although
consistency between the Navajo Nation AMLR Code of 1987 and Navajo Nation Rules is desirable, it is not an issue in this
instance.

(19) Navajo EPA stated that agreements for cooperative projects by the Navajo Nation with any Federal or State agency
should be entered into with the advice of the Navajo Nation Department of Justice and the Division of Natural Resources,
in addition to the Intergovernmental Relations Committee and Resources Committee of the Navajo Nation Council already
indicated in Title IV, section 413(b) of the Navajo Nation AMLR Code of 1987. SMCRA does not require Tribes or States
to conform to a specific administrative process but does provide the power and authority to engage in cooperative
projects. (See finding No. 1.e.) OSM reviews any cooperative projects during its annual oversight of the Navajo Nation
plan and AMLR grant program and determines at that time whether such projects are conducted in a manner that meets the
requirements of SMCRA and the implementing Federal regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(20) Navajo EPA stated that Title IV, section 413(d) of the Navajo Nation AMLR Code of 1987 should require that NAMLRD
will turn over management and operation of water treatment facilities to the appropriate Tribal department, which
will have the continuing staffing and expertise to run said facilities in perpetuity. This provision of the code is
substantively identical to section 413(d) of SMCRA. SMCRA does not require that the management and operation of such
a treatment plant be turned over to another agency for continued management and operation. The administration of
the Navajo Nation's AMLR program is addressed during OSM's annual oversight and any deficiencies in the program are
handled through the oversight process. If, during oversight, OSM determines that a problem exists with effective
management of any part of the program, OSM would require resolution of the problem.

EPA responded on June 13, 1994, with the following comments (administrative record No. NA&hyph;220).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) EPA commented that the Navajo Nation plan does not address or reference environmental requirements that may be
applicable under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and that sites found to pose an environmental problem
should be coordinated through NEPA to identify the appropriate clean up remedies and standards. OSM responds, as
it did at comment No. 2 of the Navajo EPA comments, that Title IV of SMCRA and the implementing Federal regulations do
not require specific reclamation standards. Prior to the Navajo Nation initiating AMLR construction projects,
OSM complies with the requirements of NEPA to identify environmental impacts and mitigation measures.

(2) EPA commented that the authority for certifying the completion of coal reclamation resides with the President

to the Director of NAMLRD. As stated in response to the same comment by Navajo EPA (comment No. 18), OSM responds that
the request for concurrence with the Navajo Nation's certification was actually submitted by the President of the
Navajo Nation in compliance with section 411(a) of SMCRA and in conformance with EPA's comment on which tribal authority

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) EPA expressed concern that the Navajo Nation AMLR Code of 1987 does not provide for the Secretary's concurrence
with the certification of completion of coal reclamation. SMCRA provides that the Secretary shall concur with a Tribe's
or State's certification of completion of coal reclamation. Therefore, OSM responds that the Navajo Nation plan
does not require revision for an action taken by the Secretary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) EPA stated that it had understood that NAMLRD's Reclamation Plan would be revised to include work at priority 3
abandoned uranium mine sites, meaning NAMLRD would conduct work on abandoned uranium mine sites that exhibited environmental
hazards and degradation. EPA stated further that it appeared no priority had been assigned to uranium sites in the
Navajo Nation Rules at II(D)(2), pertaining to noncoal reclamation priorities prior to certification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 403(a) of SMCRA provides, prior to certification of completion of coal reclamation, that ``priority 3''
is the restoration of lands and water and the environment previously degraded by adverse effects of coal mining practices.
After certification, section 411(c) of SMCRA provides that priority 3 is the restoration of lands and water and the
environment previously degraded by the adverse effects of mineral mining and processing practices. Title IV of SMCRA
does not prioritize noncoal commodities, and sections 411 (e) and (f) of SMCRA provide that community impact assistance
and public facilities projects may be undertaken as they relate to the priorities for noncoal reclamation. In this
notice, OSM found that the Navajo Nation plan has been revised to meet the requirements of SMCRA and the implementing
Federal regulations for noncoal reclamation subsequent to certification. OSM is aware that EPA, among others, continues
to work with the Navajo Nation to develop a plan to address abandoned uranium mine sites.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) EPA asked that the Navajo Nation clarify provisions of its AMLR Code of 1987 and the Navajo Nation Rules to provide
that the Nation's President has the authority to undertake action at a noncoal site before certification of completion
of coal reclamation. The rules provide that this authority resides with the President of the Navajo Nation, but the
code allows the Director of NAMLRD to conduct reclamation activities and take other remedial actions on noncoal sites.
This comment is immaterial in light of the Secretary's concurrence in this notice with the Navajo Nation's certification
of completion of coal reclamation on Navajo Nation lands.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) In a related manner, EPA suggested that the community participation process for reclamation at noncoal sites
is not consistent between provisions of the Navajo Nation AMLR Code of 1987 and the Navajo Nation Rules. Specifically,
EPA asked what mechanism ensures that a request for noncoal reclamation to the Director of NAMLRD will reach the President
who has authority to request reclamation at noncoal sites and what feedback mechanism existed to inform the community
of what actions will be taken. OSM, in approving the proposed Navajo Nation plan amendment that is the subject of this
notice, has determined that the Tribe's public participation process for determining the priority of community
assistance projects meets the requirements of SMCRA and the implementing Federal regulations.

(7) Finally, EPA stated that there appear to be no check-and-balance systems between NAMLRD and Navajo EPA, NAMLRD
and the Division of Natural Resources, and NAMLRD and OSM. EPA feels systems are needed to ensure inter- and intra-governmental
consistency and harmony within the Navajo Nation's various programs. SMCRA does not require coordination between
Tribal agencies but does provide for interagency cooperation at section 414. The Navajo Nation AMLR Code of 1987 provides
a similar provision at section 414. Therefore, OSM responds that it is up to the Navajo Nation itself to determine how
its various departments will interact, coordinate, and establish and maintain relationships that are conducive
to meeting the requirements of the Navajo Nation plan. Coordination between the Tribe and OSM already occurs as required
by SMCRA and the Federal regulations. OSM also responds that it provides input into these relationships through oversight
of the Navajo Nation's AMLR program.

By letter dated May 5, 1994, the Utah State Historical Society provided the concurrence of the Utah Preservation Office
with the determination that no part of the amendment pertains to cultural resources (administrative record No. NA&hyph;216).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Arizona State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) responded on June 1, 1994, that it assumed OSM had the concurrence
of the Navajo Nation Historic Preservation Department (NNHPD) as to a determination of no effect on cultural resources
under the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 with respect to the consultation requirements of 36 CFR Part
800. Therefore, it would defer the determination of no effect on the NNHPD (administrative record No. NA&hyph;218).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the Arizona SHPO response, OSM contacted NNHPD on June 28, 1994. NNHPD stated it had elected not to respond
and presumed that OSM would proceed as if a determination of no effect was in place (administrative record No. NA&hyph;221).
OSM is not aware of any adverse effects on cultural resources that would result from the proposed amendment and certification
of completion of coal reclamation, and on this basis, OSM is proceeding with its decision on the Navajo Nation submission.

V. Director's Decision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the above findings, the Director approves the Navajo Nation's proposed amendment as submitted on April 7
and 22, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in finding No. 1.a., the Director approves nonsubstantive revisions to the Navajo Nation AMLR Code of
1987 at sections 101, 102, 401, 402, 403, 405, 407, 408, 409, 412, and 413.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in finding Nos. 1.b., c., d., and e., the Director approves substantive revisions to the Navajo Nation
AMLR Code of 1987 at sections 201, 401, 403, 404, 409, 410, 411, and 414.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in finding Nos. 1.b and f., the Director approves substantive revisions to the Navajo Nation Rules at
Section II, Parts D, L, M, N, O, and P, and Section III, Part E.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director approves the proposed revisions of the Navajo Nation AMLR Code of 1987 and Navajo Nation Rules implementing
the code with the provision that they be fully promulgated in identical form to the code and rules submitted to and reviewed
by OSM and the public.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director of OSM, on behalf of the Secretary, also concurs with the Navajo Nation's certification, as submitted
by the Nation on May 4, 1994, that all abandoned coal mine related problems have been abated or reclaimed under its AMLR
plan in accordance with Title IV of SMCRA.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The effect of the Director's concurrence with the Tribe's certification is to allow the Navajo Nation to use its AMR
funds for community impact assistance and construction of public facilities in areas of the Navajo Nation lands impacted
by coal or minerals development, mining, or processing as provided in section 411 of SMCRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director is codifying this AMLR plan decision and concurrence with the Navajo Nation's certification of completion
of coal reclamation at 30 CFR Part 756.14. The Director is also taking this opportunity to revise the addresses at 30
CFR 756.13 for OSM and the Navajo Nation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory
Planning and Review).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Executive Order 12778
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of Tribal AMLR plans and revisions thereof since
each such plan is drafted and promulgated by a specific Tribe, not by OSM. Decisions on proposed Tribal AMLR plans and
revisions thereof submitted by a Tribe are based on a determination of whether the submittal meets the requirements
of Title IV of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1231&hyph;1243) and the applicable Federal regulations at 30 CFR Parts 884 and 888.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

3. National Environmental Policy Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since agency decisions on proposed Tribal AMLR plans
and revisions thereof are categorically excluded from compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (42
U.S.C. 4332) by the Manual of the Department of the Interior (516 DM 6, appendix 8, paragraph 8.4B(29)).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by OMB under the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The Tribal submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon Federal regulations for which an economic analysis
was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic effect upon a substantial
number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements established by SMCRA or
previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the Tribe. In making the determination as to whether this rule
would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions in the analyses for
the corresponding Federal regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM is approving, with certain exceptions and additional requirements, a proposed amendment to the Utah regulatory
program and abandoned mine plan (hereinafter, the ``Utah program'' and Utah plan'') under the Surface Mining Control
and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). Utah proposed revisions to the Utah Coal Mining and Reclamation Act pertaining
to hearings and appeals, civil and criminal penalties, recovery of costs for reclaimed abandoned mine land, liens
against reclaimed abandoned mine lands, and certification of completion of abandoned coal mine reclamation. The
amendment is intended to incorporate the additional flexibility afforded by SMCRA, clarify ambiguities, and improve
operational efficiency.

By letter dated March 7, 1994, Utah submitted a proposed amendment to its program and plan pursuant to SMCRA (administrative
record No. UT&hyph;900). Utah submitted the proposed amendment at its own initiative. The program provisions of
the Utah Coal Mining and Reclamation Act that Utah proposed to revise were Utah Code Annotated (UCA) 40&hyph;10&hyph;14,
appeals to district court of decisions by the Board of Oil, Gas and Mining (Board) and further review, and UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;20,
civil and criminal penalties. The plan provisions of the Utah Coal Mining and Reclamation Act that Utah proposed to
revise were UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;28, recovery of reclamation costs and liens against reclaimed land, and UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;28.1,
certification of completion of coal reclamation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 14591), OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment, provided an opportunity for a public hearing or meeting
on its substantive adequacy, and invited public comment on its adequacy (administrative record No. UT&hyph;911).
Because no one requested a public hearing or meeting, none was held. The public comment period ended on April 28, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During its review of the amendment, OSM identified concerns relating to the provsions of the Utah Coal Mining and Reclamation
Act at UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;14 (3) and (6), procedural guidance for formal hearings and appeals of decisions by the
Board and district court decisions; UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;20(3), waiver of rights to contest the violation or amount
of a civil penalty if the operator fails to forward the amount of the penalty within the time allowed; UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;20(8),
review proceedings of a civil penalty assessed for failure to correct a violation; and UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;28 (1)(a)(ii)
and (2)(a), sale price of reclaimed abandoned mine land and waiver of liens when certain criteria are met. OSM notified
Utah of the concerns by letter dated June 10, 1994 (administrative record No. UT&hyph;935).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For each of the issues identified by OSM, Utah responded in a letter dated July 5, 1994, by submitting additional explanatory
information (administrative record No. UT&hyph;949).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the additional explanatory information for the proposed program and plan amendment submitted by Utah,
OSM reopened the public comment period in the July 29, 1994,

III. Director's Findings
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed below, the Director, in accordance with SMCRA and 30 CFR 732.15, 732.17, 884.15(a), and 884.14 finds,
with certain exceptions and additional requirements, that the proposed program and plan amendment submitted by
Utah on March 7, 1994, and supplemented with additional explanatory information on July 5, 1994, is no less stringent
than SMCRA. Accordingly, the Director approves the proposed amendment.

1. Nonsubstantive Revisions to Utah's Statutes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Utah proposed revisions to the following previously-approved provisions of the Utah Coal Mining and Reclamation
Act that are nonsubstantive in nature and consist of minor editorial, punctuation, grammatical, and recodification
changes (the corresponding SMCRA provisions are listed in parentheses):

2. Substantive Revisions to Utah's Statutes That Are Substantively Identical to Provisions of SMCRA and the Federal
Regulations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Utah proposed revisions to the following provisions of the Utah Coal Mining and Reclamation Act that are substantive
in nature and contain language that is substantively identical to the provisions of SMCRA and the Federal regulations
(listed in parentheses).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;20(3)(e) (section 518(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 723.20), public hearings, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;28.1(6) (section 411(f) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 875.15(d)), certification of completion of coal

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because these proposed revisions to the Utah Coal Mining and Reclamation Act are substantively identical to the corresponding
provisions of SMCRA and the Federal regulations, the Director finds that they are no less stringent than SMCRA and
no less effective than the Federal regulations. The Director approves the proposed revisions.

3. UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;14(6), Appeal to District Court
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Previously-approved UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;14(6), regarding Board decisions on permit applications, provided,
in part, that:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Any applicant, or any person with an interest which is or may be adversely affected who has participated in the proceedings
as an objector, and who is aggrieved by the decision of the board, or if the board fails to act within the time limits specified
in [Title 40, Chapter 10], has the right to appeal in the district court for the county in which the proposed operation
is located.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this amendment, Utah proposed to add language to UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;14(6) to provide that any party to the action
in district court may appeal from the final judgment, order, or decree of the district court. Utah also proposed deletion
of the provision that required that review of the adjudication of the district court is by the Utah Supreme Court.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By way of clarification, Utah provided additional information, stating, among other things, that, where an appeal
of the Board's decision is the issue at hand, ``the record established by the Board in the hearing transcript becomes
the trial record which is reviewed by the Utah Supreme Court'' (administration record No. UT&hyph;949). Utah further
stated that where the Board fails to act, relief may be sought by an applicant or interested person in the State district
court for the county where the proposed operation is located. ``Under these conditions, the case or controversy is
heard by state District Court and it then becomes the court of record. Appeals are thereafter to the Utah Supreme Court.''
The State cited provisions of the Utah Judicial Code at UCA Title 78, Chapter 2, as support for its explanation of the
appellate process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 526(e) of SMCRA provides, in part, that action taken by a State regulatory authority under an approved State
program is subject to judicial review by a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with State law. Although
the Director finds the clarifying information to be consistent with section 526(e) of SMCRA, the Director finds that
the currently-approved Utah program contains some apparent internal inconsistencies regarding the appellate
process for Board decisions on permit applications. That is, although UCA 78&hyph;2&hyph;2(3)(e)(iv) appears
to specify, as Utah stated in its clarifying information, that appeals of Board decisions are to the Utah Supreme Court,
the first sentence of UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;14(6), previously approved by OSM, appears to require that such appeals
are to the State district court in the county where the proposed operation is located.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Director finds that the proposed revision at UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;14(6) is not consistent with section 526(e)
of SMCRA and does not approve it. The Director requires Utah to amend its program to eliminate the discrepancy in the
appellate procedures that govern Board decisions on permit applications in a manner no less stringent than the requirements
of section 526(e) of SMCRA.

4. UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;20 (1)(a) and (3)(a), Delegation of Authority for Assessing Civil Penalties in Certain Circumstances
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;20 (1)(a) and (3)(a), Utah proposed to change the responsible party from the Board to the Division
of Oil, Gas and Mining (Division) for assessing civil penalties when a violation of permit condition or other provision
of Chapter 10, Title 40 occurs. Section 518(i) of SMCRA provides, in part, that States shall incorporate into their
programs, civil and criminal penalty provisions that are no less stringent than section 518 of SMCRA and procedural
requirements relating to these provisions that are the same or similar to those set forth in SMCRA. Utah's proposed
transfer of authority for civil penalty assessments from the Board to the Division is not inconsistent with section
518(i) of SMCRA. Therefore, the Director approves the proposed revision to UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;20 (1)(a) and (3)(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
5. UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;20(3), Contest of Violation or Amount of Penalty
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Utah proposed to delete existing UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;20(3) in its entirety. Most of the requirements of existing
UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;20(3) are recodified in this amendment as UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;20(2) (see finding No. 2). One
requirement of existing UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;20(3) that is not retained and recodified elsewhere in the statute
pertains to a waiver of rights to contest the violation or the amount of the penalty when the operator fails to forward
to the Board within 30 days of receipt of the notice of violation the proposed civil penalty for placement in an escrow
account.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 518(c) of SMCRA provides, in part, that failure to forward the amount of a proposed civil penalty to the Secretary
within the specified time ``shall result in a waiver of all legal rights to contest the violation or the amount of the
penalty.'' In order to be no less stringent than SMCRA, the Utah program must include a similar provision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although this amendment does not include the waiver requirement, OSM notes that Utah has in another amendment dated
April 14, 1994, proposed a provision that is intended to resolve this deficiency (administrative record No. UT&hyph;917).
In order to consider the additional proposal prior to making a final determination, the Director has decided to defer
decision on the deletion of the part of existing UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;20(3) that provided that an operator's failure
to forward the amount of a proposed civil penalty to Utah within 30 days results in a waiver of all legal rights to contest
the violation or the amount of the penalty.

6. UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;20(8), Civil Penalty for Failure to Correct Violation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Utah proposed editorial revisions to UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;20(8). However, aside from these revisions, OSM noted
in its letter dated June 10, 1994, that, while section 518(h) of SMCRA specifically references section 525, regarding
administrative reviews, and section 526, regarding judicial reviews, UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;20(8) did not contain
any specific cross-references to counterpart provisions of the Utah program. Utah responded (administrative record
No. UT&hyph;949) that the reviews provided in SMCRA by reference are found in the State program at UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;22.
The Director finds that the reference provided by Utah meets the requirements of section 518(h) of SMCRA. Accordingly,
the Director approves the proposed revisions to UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;20(8).

7. UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;28 (1)(a)(ii), Recovery of Reclamation Costs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;28 (1)(a)(ii), provides a formula for determining the sale price of reclaimed abandoned mine
lands to be sold to a State or local government for public purposes, but the formula does not include the cost of purchase
as required by section 407(e) of SMCRA. This apparent deficiency in the Utah plan would render Utah's plan less stringent
than section 407(e) of SMCRA, but OSM notes that Utah has proposed to address this deficiency in a separate amendment
dated April 14, 1994 (administrative record No. UT&hyph;914). In order to consider the additional proposal prior
to making a final determination, the Director has decided to defer decision on proposed UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;28 (1)(a)(ii).

8. UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;28 (1)(b)(i) and (2)(b), Delegation of Authority to Waive Fees and Liens Against Reclaimed
Land
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Utah proposed to revise its provisions at UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;28 (1)(b)(i) and (2)(b) to provide that the Division
rather than the Board may waive special charges for use of reclaimed land or liens against reclaimed land in certain
circumstances. Title IV of SMCRA does not prohibit a State regulatory authority from delegating responsibility
for administering and enforcing the Federal provisions. Section 413(a) of SMCRA provides, in part, that a State with
an approved State program shall have the power and authority to engage in any work and to do all things necessary or expedient
in order to implement and administer the provisions of Title IV. Utah's proposed transfer of authority to waive special
charges for use of or liens against reclaimed land in certain circumstances from the Board to the Division is not inconsistent
with section 413(a) of SMCRA. Therefore, the Director approves the proposed revision to UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;28
(1)(b)(i) and (2)(b).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Utah proposed editorial revisions to UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;28(2)(a), which requires that the Division shall place
a lien against reclaimed abandoned mine land, the market value of which has increased as a result of the reclamation
work, except where the surface owner neither consented to, participated in, nor exercised control over the mining
operations which necessitated the reclamation work.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 408(a) of SMCRA has the same provisions, but it additionally specifies, with respect to the surface owner,
that the provisions apply to a person owning the surface prior to May 2, 1977.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i) and 884.14(a)(2), OSM solicited comments on the proposed amendment from various
Federal agencies with an actual or potential interest in the Utah program and Utah plan (administrative records Nos.
UT&hyph;903 and UT&hyph;952).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By memorandum dated June 8, 1994, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service stated that it had reviewed the proposed changes

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letter dated August 15, 1994, the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) stated that it had reviewed the (administrative
record No. UT&hyph;966). No revisions to the proposed amendment were suggested.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(ii), OSM is required to solicit the written concurrence of EPA with respect to those
provisions of the proposed program amendment that relate to air or water quality standards promulgated under the
authority of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 12512 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) or the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
None of the revisions that Utah proposed to make in its amendment pertain to air or water quality standards. Therefore,
OSM did not request EPA's concurrence. Pursuant to 732.17(h)(11)(i), OSM solicited comments on the proposed amendment
from EPA (administrative record Nos. UT&hyph;903 and UT&hyph;952). It responded on March 31 and July 28, 1994, that
it had no comments and did not believe that there would be any impacts to water quality standards promulgated under
authority of the Clean Water Act, as amended (33 U.S.C. 1251 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

The Director approves, as discussed in: finding No. 1, UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;20(1) (b) and (c), concerning civil penalty
for violation of chapter, UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;20(3) (b), (c), and (d), concerning public hearings, UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;20

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the requirement that Utah further revise its statute, the Director does not approve, as discussed in: finding
No. 3, UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;14(6), concerning appeals to district court.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director is taking this opportunity to revise 30 CFR 944.20 to include the date Utah's plan was approved by OSM.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal regulations at 30 CFR Part 944 codifying decisions concerning the Utah program and Utah plan, are being
amended to implement this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program
and plan amendment process and to encourage States to bring their programs and plans into conformity with the Federal
standards without undue delay. Consistency of State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VI. Effect of Director's Decision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 503 of SMCRA provides that a State may not exercise jurisdiction under SMCRA unless the State program is approved
by the Secretary. Similarly, 30 CFR 732.17(a) requires that any alteration of an approved State program be submitted
to OSM for review as a program amendment. Thus, any changes to the State program are not enforceable until approved
by OSM. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.17(g) prohibit any unilateral changes to approved State programs. In
the oversight of the Utah program, the Director will recognize only the statutes, regulations and other materials
approved by OSM, together with any consistent implementing policies, directives and other materials, and will require
the enforcement by Utah of only such provisions.

VII. Procedural Determinations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory
Planning and Review).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Executive Order 12778
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs, abandoned mine
land reclamation (AMLR) plans, program amendments, and plan revisions since each such program or plan is drafted
and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1253 and 12550) and the
Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed State regulatory programs
and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination of whether the submittal is
consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other requirements of 30 CFR Parts
730, 731, and 732 have been met. Decisions on proposed State AMLR plans and revisions thereof submitted by a State are
based on a determination of whether the submittal meets the requirements of Title IV of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1231&hyph;1243)
and the applicable Federal regulations at 30 CFR Parts 884 and 888.

3. National Environmental Policy Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)) while State AMLR
plans and revisions thereof are categorically excluded from compliance with the National Environmental Policy
Act (42 U.S.C. 4332) by the Manual of the Department of the Interior (516 DM 6, appendix 8, paragraph 8.4B(29)).

This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by OMB under the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

5. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.). The State submittal that is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an
economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements
established by SMCRA or previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination
as to whether this rule would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions
in the analyses for the corresponding Federal regulations.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM is approving a proposed amendment to the Utah regulatory program (hereinafter referred to as the ``Utah program'')
under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). Utah proposed revisions to the Utah Coal Mining
Rules pertaining to coal exploration subject to provisions of 43 CFR 3480 through 3487, responsibilities of the Division
of Oil, Gas and Mining (Division) regarding coal exploration, requirements for coal exploration approval, notices
of intention to conduct minor coal exploration, coal exploration compliance and required documents to be available
in the exploration area, and performance standards for coal exploration operations that substantially disturb
the natural land surface. Utah proposed the amendment with the intent of streamlining the Utah regulatory program
and making the exploration process more responsive to field needs for coal seam information.

I. Background on the Utah Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On January 21, 1981, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Utah program for the regulation of coal
exploration and coal mining and reclamation operations on non-Federal and non-Indian lands. General background
information on the Utah program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the conditions
of approval of the Utah program can be found in the January 21, 1981, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Rederal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(46 FR 5899). Subsequent actions concerning Utah's program and program amendments can be found at 30 CFR 944.15, 944.16,
and 944.30.

II. Proposed Amendment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated January 27, 1994, Utah submitted a proposed amendment to its program pursuant to SMCRA (administrative
record No. UT&hyph;888). Utah submitted the proposed amendment at its own initiative. The provisions of the Utah
Coal Mining Rules that Utah proposed to revise pertain to its coal exploration rules at Utah Administrative Rule (Utah
Admin. R.) 645&hyph;200&hyph;100, scope of rules for coal exploration; Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;200&hyph;200,
responsibilities of the Division; Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;201&hyph;100, requirements for coal exploration approval;
Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;201&hyph;200, notices of intention to conduct minor coal exploration; and Utah Admin. R.
645&hyph;202&hyph;100, required documents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the February 25, 1994, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 9153), provided an opportunity for a public hearing or meeting on its substantive adequacy, and invited public
comment on its adequacy (administrative record No. UT&hyph;897). Because no one requested a public hearing or meeting,
none was held. The public comment period ended on March 28, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During its review of the amendment, OSM (1) identified concerns relating to the provisions of the Utah Coal Mining
Rules at Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;202&hyph;232, roads and other transportation facilities, and Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;202&hyph;235,
disturbance of the hydrologic balance, and (2) provided editorial comments. OSM notified Utah of the concerns by
letter dated April 15, 1994 (administrative record No. UT&hyph;915).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Utah responded in a letter dated May 10, 1994, by submitting a revised amendment (administrative record No. UT&hyph;921).
Utah proposed revisions to Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;200&hyph;200, responsibilities; Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;201&hyph;100,
responsibilities for coal exploration plan review; Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;201&hyph;200, notices of intention
to conduct minor coal exploration; Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;201&hyph;300, major coal exploration permits; Utah
Admin. R. 645&hyph;202&hyph;100, required documents; and Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;202&hyph;200, performance
standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM announced receipt of the proposed revised amendment in the May 24, 1994,

comment period ended on June 8, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During its review of the revised amendment, OSM identified additional concerns relating to (1) Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;200&hyph;122,
645&hyph;200&hyph;123, and 645&hyph;201&hyph;210, lands designated as unsuitable for surface coal mining, and
(2) Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;202&hyph;235, disturbance of the hydrologic balance. OSM notified Utah of the concerns
by letter dated July 7, 1994 (administrative record No. UT&hyph;943).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Utah responded in a letter dated July 11, 1994, by submitting a revised amendment (administrative record No. UT&hyph;950).
Utah proposed revisions to Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;200&hyph;100, scope of rules for coal exploration; Utah Admin.

III. Director's Findings
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed below, the Director, in accordance with SMCRA and 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17, finds that the proposed program
amendment submitted by Utah on January 27, 1994, and as revised by it on May 10 and July 11, 1994, is no less effective
than the corresponding Federal regulations.

1. Nonsubstantive Revisions to Utah's Coal Mining Rules
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Utah proposed revisions to the following previously approved rules that are nonsubstantive in nature and consist
of minor editorial or grammatical changes (the corresponding Federal regulation provisions are listed in parentheses):
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;201&hyph;323.100 (30 CFR 772.12(b)(8)(iv)), narrative description of the proposed exploration
area, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;201&hyph;342.200 (30 CFR 772.12(d)(2)(ii)), approval or disapproval of an application

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the proposed revisions to these previously approved rules are nonsubstantive in nature, the Director finds
that the proposed Utah rules are no less effective than the corresponding Federal regulations. The Director approves
these proposed rules.

2. Substantive Revisions to Utah's Coal Mining Rules That Are Substantially Identical to the Corresponding Provisions
of the Federal Regulations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Utah proposed revisions to the following rules that are substantive in nature and contain language that is substantially
identical to the requirements of the corresponding Federal regulation provisions (listed in parentheses):
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;200&hyph;121 (30 CFR 772.1), coal exploration which is subject to 43 CFR parts 3480 through
3487,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;201&hyph;200 through 220 (30 CFR 772.11), notices of intention to conduct minor coal exploration,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;202&hyph;100 (30 CFR 815.13), required documents,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;202&hyph;232 (30 CFR 815.15(b)), performance standards for roads or other transportation
facilities used for coal exploration, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;202&hyph;235 (30 CFR 815.15(i), performance standards which minimize disturbance of the

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because these proposed Utah rules are substantially identical to the corresponding provisons of the Federal regulations,
the Director finds that they are no less effective than the Federal regulations. The Director approves these proposed
rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;200&hyph;122, R. 645&hyph;200&hyph;123, 645&hyph;201&hyph;223, and 645&hyph;201&hyph;310,
Coal Exploration in Relation to an Approved Permit Area
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Utah proposed that its rules at Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;200&hyph;122, 645&hyph;200&hyph;123, 645&hyph;201&hyph;223,
and 645&hyph;201&hyph;310 setting forth the scope of Utah's coal exploration rules, would apply to ``coal exploration''
instead of coal exploration that occurs ``outside an approved permit area'' or coal exploration that occurs'' ``in
relation to an approved permit area.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The corresponding Federal regulations at 30 CFR 772.11, for coal exploration operations removing 250 tons or less
of coal, and at 30 CFR 772.12, for coal exploration operations removing more than 250 tons of coal, apply to coal exploration
conducted ``outside a permit area.'' In promulgating this language, OSM explained in the preamble for these Federal
regulations that a coal exploration permit is not appropriate for coal exploration on lands covered by a surface coal
mining permit because exploration within the permit area should have been planned as an integral part of the surface
coal mining and reclamation operations (44 FR 14901, 15017&hyph;8; March 13, 1979). The effect of these Federal regulations
is that, for proposed coal exploration within the permit area, the State regulatory authority would review and approve,
as appropriate, the proposed coal exploration in conjunction with the review and approval of a permit application,
and for coal exploration outside the permit area, would review and approve the proposed coal exploration pursuant
to the appropriate rules for coal exploration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Utah's proposed deletions of the phrases concerning approved permit areas are consistent with OSM's regulations
and the rationale for them in the preamble to the Federal regulations. Therefore, the Director finds that Utah's proposed
revisions to Utah Amin. R. 645&hyph;200&hyph;122, 645&hyph;200&hyph;123, 645&hyph;201&hyph;223, and 645&hyph;201&hyph;310
are no less effective than the corresponding Federal regulations at 30 CFR 772.11 and 772.12. The Director approves
these proposed rules.

Responsibilities of the Division and Coal Exploration Plan Review
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Utah proposed revisions to its rules at (1) Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;200&hyph;220 to provide that it is the Division's
responsibility to review and enforce the terms of each notice of intention to conduct coal exploration; (2) Utah Amin.
R. 645&hyph;200&hyph;230 to provide that it is the Division's responsibility to review and approve or disapprove
major coal exploration applications and issue, condition, suspend, revoke, and enforce major coal exploration
permits and coordinate with other government agencies; and (3) Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;201&hyph;100 through 645&hyph;201&hyph;130
to provide that it is the Division's responsibility to review coal exploration plans on lands which are not subject
to the requirements of 43 CFR 3480 through 3487, and to provide that, on lands [Federal lands] where the requirements
of 43 CFR 3480 through 3487 apply, the review of coal exploration plans will be guided by the appropriate part of 43 CFR.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal regulations at 30 CFR part 772 establish the requirements and procedures applicable to coal exploration
operations on all lands except for Federal lands subject to the requirements of 43 CFR parts 3480 through 3487. The
Federal regulations at 43 CFR 3480 through 3487 pertain to operations for the exploration, development, and production
of Federal coal under Federal coal leases, licenses, and permits, regardless of surface ownership, pursuant to the
Mineral Leasing Act of February 25, 1920, as amended (30 U.S.C. 181, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The responsibility for administration of the Mineral Leasing Act is vested with the Bureau of Land Management.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Utah's proposed revision at Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;201&hyph;110 and 645&hyph;201&hyph;120 to provide that only
coal exploration operations on lands which are not subject to 43 CFR parts 3480&hyph;3487 will be regulated by the
Division is thus an appropriate limitation on the Division's regulatory authority and is consistent with the corresponding
limitation in the Federal regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, although the specific responsibilities of a State regulatory authority in administering the coal exploration
program within a State are not addressed in the Federal regulations at 30 CFR Part 772 for coal exploration, the Federal
regulation at 30 CFR 731.14(c)(1) requires each State to have enacted and promulgated laws and regulations which
will allow the State to implement, administer, and enforce its program, and to regulate coal exploration and surface
coal mining and reclamation operations in accordance with SMCRA. Utah's proposed regulations at Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;200&hyph;220
and 645&hyph;200&hyph;230, specifying the regulatory responsibilities of the Division, are thus consistent with
the requirements of 30 CFR 731.14(c)(1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, based on the foregoing discussion, the Director finds that Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;200&hyph;220, 645&hyph;200&hyph;230,
and 645&hyph;201&hyph;100 through 645&hyph;201&hyph;130 are not inconsistent with the Federal regulations at
30 CFR Part 772. The Director approves these proposed rules.

OSM invited public comments on the proposed amendment (administrative record No. UT&hyph;891), but none were received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Federal Agency Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 732.17(h)(11)(i), OSM solicited comments on the proposed amendment from various Federal agencies with
an actual or potential interest in the Utah program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In separate telephone conversations on February 11, June 1, and July 29, 1994, the Bureau of Mines stated it had no comments
on the proposed amendment (administrative record Nos. UT&hyph;893, UT&hyph;933, and UT&hyph;965).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service responded by letter dated March 7, 1994, that it found nothing of significant concern
to the agency and again, by letters dated June 8 and August 9, 1994, that it had reviewed the proposed changes and had
no comment on them (administrative record Nos. UT&hyph;901, UT&hyph;937, and UT&hyph;960).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letters dated March 23 and August 29, 1994, the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) stated that it had reviewed
the amendment and that there appeared to be no conflict with the requirements of 30 CFR (administrative record No.
UT&hyph;904).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers responded by letters dated June 6 and August 10, 1994, that it found the changes to be
satisfactory (administrative record Nos. UT&hyph;934 and UT&hyph;962).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Concurrence and Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(ii), OSM is required to solicit the written concurrence of EPA with respect to those
provisions of the proposed program amendment that relate to air or water quality standards promulgated under the
authority of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) or the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
None of the revisions that Utah proposed to make in its amendment pertained to air or water quality standards. Therefore,
OSM did not request EPA's concurrence with the proposed amendment. However, pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i),
OSM solicited comments on the proposed amendment from EPA (administrative record No. UT&hyph;891). EPA responded
by letters dated February 15 and June 8, 1994 (administrative record Nos. UT&hyph;894 and UT&hyph;936), that it had
no comments on the proposed amendment and that it did not believe there would be any impacts to water quality standards
promulgated under authority of the Clean Water Act, as amended (33 U.S.C. 1251 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(4), OSM solicited comments on the proposed amendment from the SHPO and ACHP (administrative
record No. UT&hyph;891). By letter dated August 4, 1994, the SHPO indicated, after review of Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;202&hyph;300,
that it concurred with the content of the rule and OSM's determination of no effect with respect to the consultation
requirements of 36 CFR Part 800 (administrative record No. UT&hyph;959). The ACHP did not respond to OSM's request.

Based on the above findings, the Director approves Utah's proposed amendment as submitted on January 27, 1994, and
revised on May 10 and July 11, 1994. The Director approves, as discussed in: Finding No. 1, Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;201&hyph;323.100,
concerning the narrative description of the proposed exploration area, and Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;201&hyph;342.200,
concerning approval or disapproval of an application for a major coal exploration permit; finding No. 2, Utah Admin.

Admin. R. 645&hyph;202&hyph;100, concerning required documents, Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;202&hyph;232, concerning
performance standards for roads or other transportation facilities used for coal exploration, and Utah Admin. R.
645&hyph;202&hyph;235, concerning performance standards which minimize disturbance of the hydrologic balance;
finding No. 3, Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;200&hyph;122, 645&hyph;200&hyph;123, 645&hyph;201&hyph;223, and 645&hyph;201&hyph;310,
concerning coal exploration in relation to an approved permit area; and finding No. 4, Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;200&hyph;220,
645&hyph;200&hyph;230, and 645&hyph;201&hyph;100 through 645&hyph;201&hyph;130, concerning the Division's
responsibilities and coal exploration plan review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal regulations at 30 CFR Part 944, codifying decisions concerning the Utah program, are being amended to
implement this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program amendment
process and to encourage States to bring their programs into conformity with the Federal standards without undue
delay. Consistency of State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12886 (Regulatory
Planning and Review).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Executive Order 12778
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA
(30 U.S.C. 1253 and 12550) and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed
State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the State must be based solely on a determination of
whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other requirements
of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.

3. National Environmental Policy Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).

The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an
economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements
previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule
would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart
Federal regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM is announcing the approval, with exceptions, of a proposed amendment to the Virginia regulatory program (hereinafter
referred to as the Virginia program) under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The proposed
amendment includes changes to Virginia's regulations relative to siltation structures and impoundments, revegetation
standards for success, and roads and road construction. The amendment is intended to revise the State program to be
consistent with the corresponding Federal standards and to clarify and correct inconsistencies in Virginia's rules.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated October 22, 1993 (Administrative Record No. VA&hyph;829), Virginia submitted proposed amendments
to its regulatory program. The amendments address issues initially submitted to OSM on October 1, 1990 (Administrative
Record Number VA&hyph;768), but subsequently withdrawn by Virginia in a letter dated May 12, 1992 (Administrative
Record No. VA&hyph;818), as discussed in the final rule issued July 7, 1992 (57 FR 29788). Virginia submitted the request
to withdraw portions of the October 1, 1990, submission (as modified April 18, 1991) in order to reconsider various
proposals. Virginia's October 22, 1993, submission addresses the sections that Virginia withdrew in its May 12,
1992, letter except for &sect;&sect;773.16(c)(4)(ii) and 773.16(c)(7).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Set forth below, pursuant to SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17 are the Director's findings
concerning the proposed amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revisions not specifically discussed below concern nonsubstantive wording changes, or revised cross-references
and paragraph notations to reflect organizational changes resulting from this amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Section 480&hyph;03&hyph;19.816/817.49(a)(3)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Virginia proposes to add new stability design requirements at &sect;480&hyph;03&hyph;19.816/817.49(a)(3)(ii)
for impoundments not meeting the size or other criteria of 30 CFR 77.216(a), except for a coal mine waste impounding
structure. The impoundments, located where failure would not be expected to result in loss of life or serious property
damage, shall have a minimum static safety factor of 1.3 for a normal pool with steady state seepage saturation conditions.
These proposed provisions are substantively identical to the Federal rule at 30 CFR 816/817.49(a)(3)(ii). The amendment
further provides for use of earth embankments whose top widths are no less than 10 feet and whose embankment slopes
are 2h:1v or flatter, provided the permittee documents that a minimum static safety factor of 1.3 can be met using the
graphical solution methods outlined in the ``Bureau of Mines Report of Investigations/1981, RI 8564, Factor of Safety
Charts for Estimating the Stability of Saturated and Unsaturated Tailings Pond Embankments, United States Department
of the Interior.'' By letter dated February 23, 1994 (Administrative Record No. VA&hyph;836), OSM advised Virginia
that the graphical solution methods could be used in lieu of engineering tests, for low hazard impoundments not meeting
the size or other criteria of 30 CFR 77.216(a) if all the appropriate parameters needed to use the graphs in RI 8564 are
adequately documented for each embankment. OSM pointed out that the appropriate parameters included:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_Unit weight of the soil
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Height of the embankment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Internal friction angle
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Cohesion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Pore pressure ratio
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Slope of the embankment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Depth factor
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to satisfying these parameter requirements, OSM stated that the embankment would have to be constructed
of homogeneous material and the stiff base under the foundation must be flat. By letter dated March 16, 1994 (Administrative
Record No. VA&hyph;837), Virginia agreed that the parameters set forth in OSM's letter of February 23, 1994, will
be required by the State for use with the graphs in RI 8564 and that the parameters must be documented for each embankment.
Virginia further agreed that the embankment will be required to be constructed of homogeneous material and the stiff
base under the foundation will be required to be flat. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816/817.49(a)(3)(ii), 780.25(c)(3)
and 784.16(c)(3) provide for an alternative to engineering tests that establish for impoundments a minimum static
safety factor of 1.3. If a State regulatory authority, through the State program amendment process, can establish
engineering design standards that ensure stability comparable to the 1.3 minimum static safety factor, then such
design standards are no less effective than 816/817.49(a)(3)(ii). The Director has determined that the proposed
amendment to the Virginia regulations at &sect;VR 480.03.19.816/817.49(a)(3)(ii), as clarified by Virginia on
March 16, 1994, ensures stability comparable to the 1.3 minimum static safety factor and is no less effective than
the Federal rules at 30 CFR 816/817.49(a)(3)(ii).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

2. Section VR 480&hyph;03&hyph;19.816/817.116(b)(3)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Virginia proposes to revise &sect;VR 480&hyph;03&hyph;19.816/817.116(b)(3)(v)(A) regarding the stocking of
trees, shrubs, half-shrubs, and the ground cover established on the revegetated area where woody plants are used
for wildlife management, recreation, shelter belts, or forest uses other than commercial forest land, by deleting
the phrase ``approximate the stocking and ground cover on the surrounding unmined area.'' The Director finds the
deleted language to be duplicative of requirements already found in the Virginia program. Therefore, the proposed
deletion will not render Virginia's regulations less effective than the Federal requirements at 30 CFR 816.116(b)(3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Section VR 480&hyph;03&hyph;19.816/817.116(c)(3)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Virginia proposed to revise these subsections by deleting the term ``conservation'' and replacing that term with
the term ``husbandry.'' In its submittal of this amendment Virginia stated that the wording change was made to make
the language consistent with the counterpart Federal provisions at 30 CFR 816/817.116(c)(4). In addition to the
proposed wording change, Virginia submitted administrative record information containing a list of normal husbandry
practices and related reference materials intended to support the practices identified by Virginia as normal husbandry
practices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816/817.116(c)(4) allow State regulatory authorities to select certain husbandry
practices that will not extend the period of responsibility for successful revegetation and the bond liability of
the permittee. These practices must be expected to continue as part of the postmining land use or that after discontinuance,
the likelihood of permanent success is not reduced. Such practices must be submitted through the State program amendment
process and must be approved by OSM before the State can implement such practices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon review of the materials provided by Virginia, OSM determined that there was no document establishing the list
of practices as Virginia policy. In addition, there was no information explaining how the lists and technical references
would be used. In a letter to Virginia dated February 23, 1994 (Administrative Record No. VA&hyph;836), OSM addressed
its concerns with the proposed husbandry practices amendment. Virginia responded by letter dated May 12, 1994 (Administrative
Record No. VA&hyph;838). The State provided the following clarification.

The Virginia program at 480&hyph;03&hyph;19.816/817.116(c)(3) provides that the Division may approve selective
husbandry practices that may be utilized without extending the period of responsibility for revegetation success
and bond liability. On October 1, 1990, DMLR submitted for OSM's approval a limited list of the selected practices
that can be used in Virginia. On

 its final approval of the selected husbandry practices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to this program amendment, there are a finite number of husbandry practices that have been approved by OSM.
Coal surface mining operations may utilize only this list of practices without extending the bond liability period.

In its May 12, 1994, letter to OSM, Virginia also clarified the following points concerning its implementation of
the husbandry practices provision. Virginia proposes to limit the extent of reseeding or spot seeding that it will
allow as husbandry practice to a maximum of 10 percent of the applicable area. Virginia will also use the 10-percent
figure to limit areas where liming, fertilization, and irrigation may be used in excess of the levels normally applied
to similar lands with the same land use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 10-percent figure is inspired by the Virginia regulations concerning revegetation success. Specifically,
VR 480&hyph;03&hyph;19.816.116(a)(2) provides that ground cover, production, or stocking shall be considered
equal to the approved success standard when they are not less than 90 percent of the approved success standard. The
Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.116(a)(2) have a similar standard.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While the 10-percent statistical standard in the revegetation rules does not directly apply to husbandry practices,
the proposed limiting of reseeding or spot seeding to 10 percent is reasonable. However, the Director finds that some
additional limits must apply. For example, normal husbandry practices do not include large barren blocks of the reclaimed
area. On the contrary, large blocks of barren areas (such as a block representing 10 percent of the applicable area)
would indicate failed reclamation, not successful revegetation. Additionally, in revegetated areas which pass
the established 90-percent standard bare or poorly revegetated areas are likely to be scattered about the applicable
area, and not large blocks of barren land. Again, large blocks of barren areas would indicate failed reclamation.
Consequently, the reseeding of such large blocks of barren areas representing failed reclamation would be augmentative
seeding and would necessitate the restarting of the period of responsibility for reclamation success and bond liability.
In addition, the reestablished vegetation must be in place for a sufficient length of time so as not to adversely affect
Virginia's ability to make a valid determination at the time of bond release of the success of the reclamation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the special case of the repair of rills and gullies as part of a forestry postmining land use, the administrative
record contains a September 27, 1990, letter from the Virginia Department of Forestry. In that letter, the Regional
Forester states that rills and gullies need not be repaired ``as a part of typical forest management unless the magnitude
of the gully would interfere with the land use (of forestry).'' The letter goes on to say that rills and gullies often
occur naturally in the steep slope areas of the Appalachian Region. OSM agrees that the repair of occasional and minor
rills and gullies where proper grading and erosion management is practiced could be considered part of normal forestry
management practice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Virginia clarified its interpretation of the degree of allowable repair of rills and gullies. Since erosion is a natural
phenomenon, the repair of minor rills and gullies is not viewed by the Virginia program as a violation, nor does it require
restarting of the bonding clock. However, the State added, the Virginia program considers erosion that repeatedly
creates rills and gullies over a large area as a violation of at least one performance standard and potentially a violation
of several standards. When the permittee fails to comply with the Virginia performance standards and rills and gullies
repeatedly develop over a large area, Virginia will require restarting of the responsibility period. Virginia has
demonstrated, and the Director finds through this amendment, and Virginia's clarifications and administrative
record information, that in the State of Virginia, certain specified instances of rill and gully repair associated
with land used for Forestry, Commercial forestry, Commercial, industrial, residential, or recreational, and Hayland/pasture
will be considered a normal husbandry practice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Virginia also clarified that the husbandry practices for areas designed to enhance fish and wildlife will be consistent
with the practices set forth for unmanaged forestry. The Director finds this to be reasonable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Virginia stated that since the Virginia coalfields are primarily located on steep slopes, there has been no incident
where cropland, other than hay, has been developed on the postmining land use. Consequently, Virginia has not developed
nor proposes any husbandry practice for such croplands. Should the Virginia coalfields expand or crop production
become a viable option, the State will develop husbandry practices relevant to those crops and submit them to OSM for
approval. Such practices will not be permitted by the State until approved by OSM. The Director concurs with the understanding
that the State will submit any new husbandry practices to OSM for approval prior to their being permitted in Virginia.

With the exceptions listed below, the Director finds the proposed amendment as augmented by the administrative record
information submitted with this amendment, and as clarified by Virginia by letter dated May 12, 1994, is no less effective
than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816/817.116(c)(4). This finding is made with the understanding that the policy
statement to be issued by Virginia concerning normal husbandry practices will be identical in meaning to the draft
language of that policy statement submitted to OSM by letter dated May 12, 1994. The Director is not approving as normal
husbandry practice the reseeding of large blocks of areas made barren by poor reclamation, or where the reestablished
vegetation has not been in place for a sufficient length of time for Virginia to make a valid determination of the success
of the reclamation at the time of bond release.

Virginia proposes to revise this section by changing the title from ``Embankments'' to ``Safety factor,'' and by
changing the language in (b)(1) to (1) reference ``organic material'' rather than ``vegetative material,'' and
(2) add the phrase ``or other unsuitable material.'' These changes were proposed by Virginia in response to an issue
letter from OSM dated March 20, 1991 (Administrative Record No. VA&hyph;792). The issue letter refers to the proposed
program amendment submitted by Virginia on October 1, 1990, as discussed herein at II. Submission of Amendment. In
that letter, OSM also asked Virginia to amend this rule to reflect that keyway cuts extend a minimum of two feet below
the toe of the fill and that material placed in road embankments will be within acceptable moisture content levels.
In its current submission, Virginia did not make the suggested changes, but provided clarification intended to show
that its current regulations adequately address OSM's concerns.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Virginia's Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy (DMME) interprets its existing regulations to require keyway
cuts beneath embankments on steep slopes to provide for stability of road embankments. The design of the keyway will
be prepared by, or under the direction of, the applicant's registered professional engineer and will be reviewed
by a DMME engineer. A minimum width of ten feet is specified and the keyway must be sloped inward in all cases. While other
specifications may be proposed by the applicant or required by DMME, taking into account the conditions of the site,
DMME believes the general requirement that keyway cuts be constructed at the toe of the road fills on steep slopes and
the specific width and slope standards provide sufficient detail to ensure road embankment stability in most site
specific cases. However, DMME interprets its regulations to require appropriate design given unusual site specific
conditions. DMME retains the authority to require a keyway that has a two foot minimum depth below the toe of a road fill
embankment as necessary when the foundations of the embankment is located in bedrock.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DMME also feels that its current regulations adequately address OSM's concerns regarding moisture content of materials
placed in road embankments on steep slopes. According to DMME, its regulations require such road embankments to be
constructed in uniform compacted layers. In order to achieve a desired degree of compaction, materials must be placed
within the acceptable range of moisture content. The DMME interprets its rule to embody the requirement that materials
must be within the acceptable range of moisture content if the larger performance standard, that of placement in compacted
layers, is to be achieved. DMME believes that its existing regulation is as effective as the Federal regulation. The
Director finds that based upon the March 20, 1991, letter and the clarification provided by Virginia, that VR 480&hyph;03&hyph;19.816/817.151(b)(1)
through (4) as set forth in Virginia's October 22, 1993, submission is consistent with the Federal rules set forth
at 30 CFR 816/817.151, 780.37(c) and 784.24(c).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Virginia proposes to revise the language of this rule relating to the waiver of design standards for existing roads.
As originally submitted on October 22, 1993, the proposed language could be read to imply that existing roads do not
have to meet the performance standards of VR 480&hyph;03&hyph;19.816/817.150 and 816/817/151. In its issue letter
dated February 23, 1994, OSM suggested new language which would resolve the controversy. In its March 16, 1994, response
to the issue letter, Virginia revised the proposed language consistent with OSM's suggestion. The current proposal
provides that where existing roads that are to be used meet the performance standards of 816/817.150 and 816/817.151
and it can be demonstrated that reconstruction to meet the design standards of those provisions would result in greater
environmental harm, the Division may waive the design requirements. Therefore, the Director finds that the provisions
of VR 480&hyph;03&hyph;19.816/817.152, as revised on March 16, 1994, are not inconsistent with the requirements
of 30 CFR 701.11(e) which allow existing structures that meet the performance standards but not the design requirements
to be exempt from meeting the design requirements.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the above findings, the Director approves, with the exceptions noted in Finding 3 above, the proposed amendment
with supplemental administrative record information which was submitted by Virginia on October 22, 1993, and as
revised on March 16, 1994, and on May 12, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 946, codifying decisions concerning the Virginia program, are being amended to
implement this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program amendment
process and to encourage States to bring their programs into conformity with the Federal standards without undue
delay. Consistency of State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA.

Effect of Director's Decision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 503 of SMCRA provides that a State may not exercise jurisdiction under SMCRA unless the State program is approved
by the Secretary. Similarly, 30 CFR 732.17(a) requires that any alteration of an approved State program be submitted
to OSM for review as a program amendment. Thus, any changes to the State program are not operational until approved
by OSM. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.17(g) prohibit any unilateral changes to approved State programs. In
the oversight of the Virginia program, the Director will recognize only the statutes, regulations and other materials
approved by him, together with any consistent implementing policies, directives and other materials, and will require
the enforcement by Virginia of only such provisions.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that, to the extent allowed by law, this rule meets the applicable standards of subsection
(a) and (b) of that section. However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory
programs and program amendments since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM.
Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1253 and 1255) and 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15 and 732.17(h)(10), decisions
on proposed State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an
economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements
previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule
would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart
Federal regulations.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard is establishing a safety zone on the Ohio River. This regulation is needed to control vessel traffic
in the regulated area to prevent potential safety hazards for transiting vessels resulting from pipelaying operations,
including underwater blasting, as part of a gas pipeline construction project in the vicinity of mile 314.0, Ohio
River, Ceredo-Kenova, West Virginia. Vessel movements within this safety zone are permitted under the criteria
set forth in this regulation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking was not published for this regulation and good cause
exists for making it effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. Following normal rulemaking procedures
would have been impracticable. Specifically, anticipated pipelaying operations, including underwater blasting,
as part of a gas pipeline construction project in the vicinity of mile 314.0, Ohio River, Ceredo-Kenova, West Virginia,
have created a situation which presents an immediate hazard to navigation, life, and property. As a result, the Coast
Guard deems it to be in the public's best interest to issue a regulation immediately.

Background and Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The activity requiring this regulation is a gas pipeline construction project. The Captain of the Port Huntington
did not receive notice of the project until September 2, 1994. Pentzien, Inc. of Omaha, Nebraska, working under contract
for Columbia Gas of Charleston, West Virginia, will begin construction September 12, 1994 on an open-cut, dredged
crossing in which a new gas line will replace the old gas line between Wayne County, West Virginia and Lawrence County,
Ohio at mile 314.0 on the Ohio River. Pentzien, Inc. engineers anticipate completion of the construction on or before
October 31, 1994. The presence of a drill barge and dredging equipment, conducting dredging and underwater blasting
operations, will pose an obstructive and, at times, explosive hazard to waterborne traffic transiting in the vicinity
of the construction project work site. In order to provide for the safety of vessel traffic, the Captain of the Port
Huntington intends to regulate vessel traffic in that portion of the Ohio River where dredging and blasting operations
will be taking place until the hazard is mitigated. All transiting vessels must contact the M/V JOE KIZZIAH, which
will be tending the dredging and drill barges, on either channel 13 or 16 in order to transit the area during dredging
operations. No vessels will be allowed to transit during the blasting portion of these operations. Notice of this
safety zone will be published in the Local Notice to Mariners and in regularly scheduled Broadcast Notice to Mariners.

Description of the Dredging
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The dredging operation will be taking place 24 hours per day, seven (7) days a week. Excavation of the river bottom will
be with a 100 ton bucket dredge mounted on a 120 foot by 45 foot spud barge, MANITOWAC. The MANITOWAC will be tended by
M/V JOE KIZZIAH and should always be in position to allow safe passage to either its left or right. Mariners should contact
M/V JOE KIZZIAH for passing instructions. Upon request, the MANITOWAC will cease dredging operations and move to
allow sufficient distance for the safe passage of commercial traffic. The M/V JOE KIZZIAH, as well as the dredging
and drill barges, will display proper day marks, and lighting during night operations. Such night operations will
not involve explosives.

Description of the Blasting
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On the average, contractors plan to blast just once a day, occurring sometime after 3:00 p.m., but before dark. No blasting
will take place when there is restricted visibility (the contractor must be able to see from bank to bank before blasting).
The purpose of the blasting is to form a trench across the subsurface of the Ohio River into which sections of piping
will be laid. The drill barge, DRILL BARGE NO. 1, will work in concert with the dredge MANITOWAC drilling into the dredged
subsurface of the river and place explosives in the drilled holes as it goes. Drilling will cease each day at 3:00 p.m.
at which time contractors will put detonators in place and prepare the area for blasting. Both the dredge and drill
barges will be removed to a position well distant from the blasting. Notification of blasting will take place two hours,
one hour, forty-five (45) minutes, thirty (30) minutes, fifteen (15) minutes, and immediately prior to blasting.
Notification will be via VHF radio channels 13 and 16. After the drill and supply barges have been moved to a safe distance,
two boats will be available for the security of the immediate blast area. The boats will be placed up and downriver of
the blasting area. These boats will patrol and warn any recreational/commercial vessels traffic of the impending
blast. No blasting will be permitted unless all river traffic is removed to a safe location outside of the blasting
area. In addition to radio transmissions, contractors will sound warning signals. The warning signal will be a one
(1) minute series of long blasts three (3) minutes prior to the blast signal. The blast signal will be a series of short
blasts one (1) minute prior to the blast. Immediately following the blast and an inspection of the blast area, an all
clear signal will be sounded. The all clear signal will be a prolonged blast, followed by radio notification on VHF
channels 13 and 16. Signals will only be sounded by the person responsible for blasting operations. If a vessel not
involved with blasting operations is within the safety zone, the contractor will not conduct the detonation until
that vessel has cleared the regulated area. The drill barge and blasting equipment will be moved off site to the river
bank every night to reduce the obstructive river hazard. The establishment of this safety zone regulation ensures
that vessels transiting in the vicinity of the blasting area will maintain a safe distance to eliminate the associated
risk. The safety zone also ensures that communication is established between the contractors and vessels transiting
the waters within the safety zone. With proper communication between all parties, the contractor is assured of having
ample time to comply with a request to move his operation temporarily to allow a vessel to navigate through the zone
safely.

Regulatory Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This regulation is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review
by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not under the regulatory policies and procedures of the
Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the impact of this regulation
to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of
DOT is unnecessary, due to the limited duration of actual river closures.

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is amending its loan guaranty regulations by updating the credit underwriting
standards and procedures for processing VA guaranteed home loans. Updating the standards and procedures to keep
pace with current economic conditions will increase the likelihood that a veteran obtaining a VA guaranteed loan
will be able to repay the loan.

supplementary information:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 29, 1993, VA published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 50875) proposed regulatory amendments to 38 CFR 36.4337. VA proposed to amend the credit underwriting standards
and procedures for processing VA guaranteed home loans (1) by updating the figures in the residual income guidelines;
(2) by requiring that income tax returns be submitted with applications for borrowers who are self-employed, paid
on a commission basis, employed in the building trades, or have seasonal jobs; (3) by providing more specific time
frames for considering whether income from part-time employment, second jobs overtime, self-employment, and commissions
may be considered stable and reliable; (4) by adding guidelines for underwriting cases involving foreclosures and
Federally-related debts; and (5) by deleting the requirement that lenders check with VA regional offices on prior
VA loans. VA also proposed to delete union dues from items considered job-related expenses because these dues are
part of the residual income figure. Please refer to the September 29, 1993 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 for a complete discussion of the proposed amendments. VA is adopting the regulatory amendments as originally proposed
except for the minor editorial and terminology changes discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
VA received three comments on the proposed amendments. One commenter favored all the amendments. The second, a national
association representing certified public accountants, suggested that more accurate accounting terms be used
to describe VA's financial requirements for self-employed borrowers. Specifically, the commenter noted that ``compile''
is the correct term to use to describe the case where an external accountant will ``prepare'' the financial statements,
as required by section 36.4337(f)(7)(i). The commenter also pointed out that independent accountants do not ``certify
the accuracy'' of financial statements, rather, the technically correct usage is to say that the accountant conducts
an ``audit''. VA agrees that the commenter's suggested terminology is more precise. Accordingly, we are revising
paragraph (f)(7)(i) of &sect;36.4337 of the regulations to read that the profit and loss statement and balance sheet
required for self employed applicants be ``compiled'', rather than ``prepared'', by an accountant. The words ``certified
as accurate'' are also being deleted from the sentence which was proposed to read, ``In some cases the nature of the
business or the content of the financial statement may necessitate an independent audit certified as accurate by
the accountant.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third commenter requested clarification of how a loan underwriter determines the stability and reliability
of a self-employed applicant's income.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed new paragraph (f)(7) of &sect;36.4337 states that ``income from self-employment is generally considered
stable when the applicant has been in business for at least 2 years and that income from less than 2 years of self-employment
usually cannot be considered stable unless the applicant has had previous related employment and/or extensive specialized
training.'' It also states that ``When an applicant has been self-employed less than 1 year, it will rarely be possible
to demonstrate that the income is stable for qualifying purposes *&blank;*&blank;* .''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As the regulations provide, VA does not require that in every case the self-employed applicant have a two-year period
of continuous employment with no gaps. If the applicant has been self-employed for less than two years, it is appropriate
in underwriting the loan to also consider the applicant's related employment or specialized training. For example,
sufficient weight might be given to the fact that the applicant has had specialized training in his or her field of endeavor,
and that therefore, the income from self-employment should be viewed as stable, even though it has been for less than
2 years. However, when the self-employment has been for less than one year, it would be very difficult to consider the
income stable and reliable. In other words, in cases where the loan applicant has been self-employed for less than
one year, it would not be possible to view his or her income as stable unless the applicant's training and/or related
experience is such as to clearly show a very strong likelihood of success.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This commenter also asked ``If the two-year history of employment applies, must it be continuous or should factors
such as schooling or training be considered during that time even if no income resulted?''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above, the proposed regulations provide for the consideration of training and schooling when determining
the adequacy of income from self-employment. Thus it is possible to consider income as stable and reliable with less
than 2 years of continuous employment, provided gaps in employment are sufficiently explained by adequate documentation
of schooling or training. It is clear that the language in paragraph (f)(7)(i) is adequate to prescribe the intended
standard and, therefore, the paragraph will be published as originally proposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
VA is making an editorial change to paragraph (g) of the regulations. Language now contained in paragraph (f)(1) of
the regulations explaining the requirements of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, is being repeated in paragraph
(g) for the purposes of clarity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, except for the terminology and editorial changes already discussed, VA is publishing these regulations
as originally proposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information collection requirement contained in paragraphs (f)(6), (f)(7) and (f)(9) of &sect;36.4337 of these
regulations has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under OMB control number 2900&hyph;0521.

The Secretary hereby certifies that the proposed regulatory amendments will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612.
These changes will not result in any major new administrative or procedural burdens on lenders or other program participants.
They simply revise the criteria established by VA in determining whether home loans for veterans will be guaranteed
by VA based on the veteran's income and credit history.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Except for refinancing loans guaranteed pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(8), the standards contained in paragraphs
(c) through (j) of this section will be used to determine that the veteran's present and anticipated income and expenses,
and credit history are satisfactory.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Use of the standards in paragraphs (c) through (j) of this section for underwriting home loans will be waived only in
extraordinary circumstances when the Secretary determines, considering the totality of circumstances, that the
veteran is a satisfactory credit risk.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Methods.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The two primary underwriting tools that will be used in determining the adequacy of the veteran's present and anticipated
income are debt-to-income ratio and residual income analysis. They are described in paragraphs (d) through (f) of
this section. Ordinarily, to qualify for a loan, the veteran must meet both standards. Failure to meet one standard,
however, will not automatically disqualify a veteran. The following shall apply to cases where a veteran does not
meet both standards:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If the debt-to-income ratio is 41 percent or less, and the veteran does not meet the residual income standard, the
loan may be approved with justification, by the underwriter's supervisor, as set out in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the debt-to-income ratio is greater than 41 percent, (unless it is larger due solely to the existence of tax-free
income which should be noted in the loan file) the loan may be approved with justification, by the underwriter's supervisor,
as set out in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If the ratio is greater than 41 percent and the residual income exceeds the guidelines by at least 20 percent the
second level review and statement of justification is not required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) In any case described by paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section, the lender must fully justify the decision
to approve the loan or submit the loan to the Secretary for prior approval in writing. The lender's statement must not
be perfunctory, but should address the specific compensating factors, as set forth in paragraph (c)(5), justifying
the approval or submission of the loan. The statement must be signed by the underwriter's supervisor. It must be stressed
that the statute requires not only consideration of a veteran's present and anticipated income and expenses, but
also that the veteran be a satisfactory credit risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, meeting both the debt-to-income ratio and residual income standards does not mean the loan is automatically
approved. It is the lender's responsibility to base the loan approval or disapproval on all the factors present for
any individual veteran. The veteran's credit must be evaluated based on criteria set forth in paragraph (g) of this
section as well as a variety of compensating factors that should be evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The following are examples of acceptable compensating factors to be considered in the course of underwriting
a loan:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Excellent long-term credit;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Conservative use of consumer credit;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Minimal consumer debt;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Long-term employment;

(6) The list in paragraph (c)(5) is not exhaustive and the items are not in any priority order. Valid compensating factors
should represent unusual strengths rather than mere satisfaction of basic program requirements. Compensating
factors must be relevant to the marginality or weakness.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Debt-to-income-ratio. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A debt-to-income ratio that compares the veteran's anticipated monthly housing expense and total monthly obligations
to his or her stable monthly income will be computed to assist in the assessment of the potential risk of the loan. The
ratio will be determined by taking the sum of the monthly Principal, Interest, Taxes and Insurance (PITI) to the loan
being applied for, homeowners and other assessments such as special assessments, condominium fees, homeowners
association fees, etc., and any long-term obligations divided by the total of gross salary or earnings and other compensation
or income. The ratio should be rounded to the nearest two digits; e.g., 35.6 percent would be rounded to 36 percent.
The standard is 41 percent or less. If the ratio is greater than 41 percent, (unless it is larger due solely to the existence
of tax free income which should be noted in the loan file) the steps cited in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(6) of this
section apply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Residual income guidelines. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The guidelines provided in this paragraph for residual income will be used to determine whether the veteran's monthly
residual income will be adequate to meet living expenses after estimated monthly shelter expenses have been paid
and other monthly obligations have been met. The guidelines for residual income are based on data supplied in the Consumer
Expenditure Survey (CES) published by the Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics. Regional minimum incomes
have been developed for loan amounts up to $69,999 and for loan amounts of $70,000 and above. It is recognized that the
purchase price of the property may affect family expenditure levels in individual cases. This factor may be given
consideration in the final determination in individual loan analyses. For example, a family purchasing in a higher-priced
neighborhood may feel a need to incur higher than average expenses to support a lifestyle comparable to that in their
environment, whereas a substantially lower-priced home purchase may not compel such expenditures. It should also
be clearly understood from this information that no single factor is a final determinant in any applicant's qualification
for a VA guaranteed loan. Once the residual income has been established, other important factors must be examined.
One such consideration is the amount being paid currently for rental or housing expenses. If the proposed shelter
expense is materially in excess of what is currently being paid, the case may require closer scrutiny. In such cases,
consideration should be given to the ability of the borrower and spouse to accumulate liquid assets; such as cash and
bonds, and to the amount of debts incurred while paying a lesser amount for shelter. For example, if an application
indicates little or no capital reserves and excessive obligations, it may not be reasonable to conclude that a substantial
increase in shelter expenses can be absorbed. Another factor of prime importance is the applicant's manner of meeting
obligations. A poor credit history alone is a basis for disapproving a loan, as is an obviously inadequate income.
When one or the other is marginal, however, the remaining aspect must be closely examined to assure that the loan applied
for will not exceed the applicant's ability or capacity to repay. Therefore, it is important to remember that the figures
provided below for residual income are to be used as a guide and should be used in conjunction with the steps outlined
in paragraphs (c) through (j) of this section. The residual income guidelines are as follows:

For loan applications involving an active-duty serviceperson or military retiree, the residual income figures
will be reduced by a minimum of 5 percent if there is a clear indication that the borrower or spouse will continue to receive
the benefits resulting from the use of facilities on a nearby military base. (This reduction applies to tables in paragraph

Stability and reliability of income. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Only stable and reliable income of the veteran and spouse can be considered in determining ability to meet mortgage
payments. Income can be considered stable and reliable if it can be concluded that it will continue during the foreseeable
future.

Verification. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Income of the borrower and spouse which is derived from employment and which is considered in determining the family's
ability to meet the mortgage payments, payments on debts and other obligations, and other expenses, must be verified.
If the spouse is employed and will be contractually obligated on the loan, the combined income of both the veteran and
spouse is considered when the income of the veteran alone is not sufficient to qualify for the amount of the loan sought.
In other than community property States, if the spouse will not be contractually obligated on the loan, Regulation
B, promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board pursuant to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act prohibits any request for,
or consideration of information concerning the spouse (including income, employment, assets, or liabilities),
except that if the applicant is relying on alimony, child support, or maintenance payments from a spouse or former
spouse as a basis for repayment of the loan, information concerning such spouse or former spouse may be requested and
considered (see paragraph (f)(4) of this section). In community property States, information concerning a spouse
may be requested and considered in the same manner as that for the applicant. The standards applied to income of the
veteran are also applicable to that of the spouse. There can be no discounting of income on account of sex, marital status,
or any other basis prohibited by the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. Income claimed by an applicant that is not or cannot
be verified cannot be given considered when analyzing the loan. If the veteran or spouse has been employed by a present
employer for less than 2 years, a 2-year history covering prior employment, schooling or other training must be secured.
Any periods of unemployment must be explained. Employment verifications and pay stubs must be no more than 90 days
old to be considered valid. For loans closed automatically, this requirement will be considered satisfied if the
date of the employment verification is within 90 days of the date of the veteran's application to the lender.

Active duty applicants. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) In the case of an active duty applicant, a military Leave &amp; Earnings Statement is required and will be used instead
of an employment verification. The statement must be no more than 90 days old and must be the original or a lender-certified
copy of the original. For loans closed automatically, this requirement is satisfied if the date of the Leave and Earnings
Statement is within 90 days of the date of the borrower's application to the lender.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) For service members within 12 months of release from active duty one of the following is also required:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Documentation that the service member has in fact already reenlisted or extended his/her period of active duty
to a date beyond the 12 month period following the projected closing of the loan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Verification of a valid offer of local civilian employment following release from active duty. All data pertinent
to sound underwriting procedures (date employment will begin, earnings, etc.) must be included.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) A statement from the service member that he/she intends to reenlist or extend his/her period of active duty to a
date beyond the 12 month period following the projected loan closing date, and a statement from the service member's
commanding officer confirming that the service member is eligible to reenlist or extend his/her active duty as indicated
and that the commanding officer has no reason to believe that such reenlistment or extension of active duty will not
be granted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Other unusually strong positive underwriting factors, such as a downpayment of at least 10 percent, significant
cash reserves, or clear evidence of strong ties to the community coupled with a nonmilitary spouse's income so high
that only minimal income from the active duty service member is needed to qualify.

Income reliability.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Income received by the borrower and spouse is to be used only if it can be concluded that the income will continue during
the foreseeable future and thus be properly considered in determining ability to meet the mortgage payments. There
can be no discounting of income solely because it is derived from an annuity, pension or other retirement benefit,
or from part-time employment. However, unless income from overtime work and part-time or second jobs can be accorded
a reasonable likelihood that it is continuous and will continue in the foreseeable future, such income should not
be used. Generally, the reliability of such income cannot be demonstrated unless the income has continued for 2 years.
The hours of duty and other work conditions of the applicant's primary job, and the period of time in which the applicant
was employed under such arrangement must be such as to permit a clear conclusion as to a good probability that overtime
or part-time or secondary employment can and will continue. Income from overtime work and part-time jobs not eligible
for inclusion as primary income may, if properly verified for at least 12 months, be used to offset the payments due
on debts and obligations of an intermediate term, i.e., 6 to 24 months. Such income must be described in the loan file.
The amount of any pension or compensation and other income such as dividends from stocks, interest from bonds, savings
accounts, or other deposits, rents, royalties, etc., will be used as primary income if it is reasonable to conclude
that such income will continue in the foreseeable future. Otherwise, it may be used only to offset intermediate-term
debts, as above. Also, the likely duration of certain military allowances cannot be determined, and therefore will
be used only to offset intermediate-term obligations. Such allowances are: Pro-pay, flight or hazard pay, and overseas
or combat pay, all of which are subject to periodic review and/or testing of the recipient to ascertain whether eligibility
for such pay will continue. Only if it can be shown that such pay has continued for a prolonged period and can be expected
to continue because of the nature of the recipient's assigned duties, will such income be considered as primary income.
For instance, flight pay verified for a pilot can be regarded as probably continuous and thus should be added to the
base pay. Income derived from service in the reserves or National Guard may be used if the applicant has served in such
capacity for a period of time sufficient to evidence good probability that such income will continue. The total period
of active and reserve service may be helpful in this regard. Otherwise, such income may be used to offset intermediate-term
debts. There are a number of additional income sources whose contingent nature precludes their being considered
as available for repayment of a long-term mortgage obligation. Temporary income items such as VA educational allowances
and unemployment compensation do not represent stable and reliable income and will not be taken into consideration
in determining the ability of the veteran to meet the income requirement of the governing law. As required by the Equal
Opportunity Act Amendments of 1976, Public Law 94&hyph;239, income from public assistance programs is used to qualify
a loan if it can be determined that the income will probably continue for a substantial fraction of the term of the loan;
i.e., one-third or more. For instance, aid to dependent children being received for a 5-year old child that will continue
until the child achieves majority would be used to qualify for a 30-year loan.

Alimony, child support, maintenance payments.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If an applicant chooses to reveal income from alimony, child support, or maintenance payments (after first having
been informed that any such disclosure is voluntary pursuant to the Federal Reserve Board's Regulation B), such payments
are considered as income to the extent that the payments are likely to be consistently made. Factors to be considered
in determining the likelihood of consistent payments include, but are not limited to: Whether the payments are received
pursuant to a written agreement or court decree; the length of time the payments have been received; the regularity
of receipt; the availability of procedures to compel payment; and the creditworthiness of the payor, including the
credit history of the payor when available under the Fair Credit Reporting Act or other applicable laws. However,
the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681(b)) limits the permissible purposes for which credit reports may be
ordered, in the absence of written instructions of the consumer to whom the report relates, to business transactions
involving the subject of the credit report or extensions of credit to the subject of the credit report.

Military quarters allowance.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 With respect to off-base housing (quarters) allowances for service personnel on active duty, it is the policy of the
Department of Defense (DoD) to utilize available on-base housing when possible. In order for a quarters allowance
to be considered as continuing income, it is necessary that the applicant furnish written authorization from his
or her commanding officer for off-base housing. This authorization should verify that quarters will not be made available
and that the individual should make permanent arrangements for nonmilitary housing. DD Form 1747, Status of Housing
Availability, is used by the Family Housing Office to advise personnel regarding family housing. The applicant's
quarters allowance cannot be considered unless item b (Permanent) or d is completed on DD Form 1747, dated October
1990. of course, if the applicant's income less quarters allowance is sufficient, there is no need for assurance that
the applicant has permission to occupy nonmilitary housing provided that a determination can be made that the occupancy
requirements of the law will be met. Also, authorization obtain off-base housing will not be required when certain
duty assignments would clearly qualify service personnel with families for quarters allowance. For instance, off-base
housing authorizations need not be obtained for service personnel stationed overseas who are not accompanied by
their families, recruiters on detached duty, or military personnel stationed in areas where no on-base housing exists.
In any case in which no off-base housing authorization is obtained, an explanation of the circumstances justifying
its omission must be included with the loan application except when it has been established by the VA facility of jurisdiction
that the waiting lists for on-base housing are so long that it is improbable that individuals desiring to purchase
off-base housing would be precluded from doing so in the foreseeable future. If stations make such a determination,
a release shall be issued to inform lenders.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Commissions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 When all or a major portion of the veteran's income is derived from commissions, it will be necessary to establish the
stability of such income if it is to be considered in the loan analysis for the repayment of the mortgage debt and/or
short-term obligations. In order to assess the value of such income, lenders should obtain written verification
of the actual amount of commissions paid to date, the basis for the payment of such commissions and when commissions
are paid; i.e., monthly, quarterly, semiannually, or annually. Lenders should also obtain signed and dated individual
income tax returns, plus applicable schedules, for the previous 2 years, or for whatever additional period is deemed
necessary to properly demonstrate a satisfactory earnings record. The length of the veteran's employment in the
type of occupation for which commissions are paid is also an important factor in the assessment of the stability of
the income. If the veteran has been employed for a relatively short time, the income should not normally be considered
stable unless the product or service was the same or closely related to the product or service sold in an immediate prior
position. Generally, income from commissions is considered stable when the applicant has been receiving such income
for at least 2 years. Less than 2 years of income from commissions cannot usually be considered stable. When an applicant
has received income from commissions for less than 1 year, it will rarely be possible to demonstrate that the income
is stable for qualifying purposes; such cases would require in-depth development.

Self-employment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Generally, income from self-employment is considered stable when the applicant has been in business for at least
2 years. Less than 2 years of income from self-employment cannot usually be considered stable unless the applicant
has had previous related employment and/or extensive specialized training. When an applicant has been self-employed
less than 1 year, it will rarely be possible to demonstrate that the income is stable for qualifying purposes; such
cases would require in-depth development. The following documentation is required for all self-employed borrowers:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Recently discharged veterans.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Loan applications received from recently discharged veterans who have little or no employment experience other
than their military occupation and from veterans seeking VA guaranteed loans who have retired after 20 years of active
military duty require special attention. The retirement income of the latter veterans in may cases may not be sufficient
to meet the statutory income requirements for the loan amount sought. Many have obtained full-time employment and
have been employed in their new jobs for a very short time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) It is essential in determining whether veterans in these categories qualify from the income standpoint for the
amount of the loan sought, that the facts in respect to their present employment and retirement income be fully developed,
and that each case be considered on its individual merits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) In most cases the veteran's current income or current income plus his or her retirement income is sufficient.
The problem lies in determining whether it can be properly concluded that such income level will continue for the foreseeable
future. If the veteran's employment status is that of a trainee or apprentice, this will, of course, be a factor. In
cases of the self-employed, the question to be resolved is whether there are reasonable prospects that the business
enterprise will be successful and produce the required income. Unless a favorable conclusion can be made, the income
from such source should not be considered in the loan analysis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If a recently discharged veteran has no prior employment history and the veteran's verification of employment
shows he or she has not been on the job a sufficient time in which to become established, consideration should be given
to the duties the veteran performed in the military service. When it can be determined that the duties a veteran performed
in the service are similar or are in direct relation to the duties of the applicant's present position, such duties
may be construed as adding weight to his or her present employment experience and the income from the veteran's present
employment thus may be considered available for qualifying the loan, notwithstanding the fact that the applicant
has been on the present job only a short time. This same principle may be applied to veterans recently retired from the
service. In addition, when the veteran's income from retirement, in relation to the total of the estimated shelter
expense, long-term debts and amount available for family support, is such that only minimal income from employment
is necessary to qualify from the income standpoint, it would be proper to resolve the doubt in favor of the veteran.
It would be erroneous, however, to give consideration to a veteran's income from employment for a short duration in
a job requiring skills for which the applicant has had no training or experience.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) To illustrate the provisions of paragraph (f), it would be proper to use short-term employment income in qualifying
a veteran who had experience as an airplane mechanic in the military service and the individual's employment after
discharge or retirement from the service is in the same or allied field; e.g., auto mechanic or machinist. This presumes,
however, that the verification of employment included a statement that the veteran was performing the duties of the
job satisfactorily, the possibility of continued employment was favorable and that the loan application is eligible
in all other respects. An example of nonqualifying experience is that of a veteran who was an Air Force pilot and has
been employed in insurance sales on commission for a short time. Most cases, of course, fall somewhere between those
extremes. It is for this reason that the facts of each case must be fully developed prior to closing the loan automatically
or submitting the case to VA for prior approval.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Employment of short duration.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The provisions of paragraph (f)(7) of this section are similarly applicable to applicants whose employment is of
short duration. Such cases will entail careful consideration of the employer's confirmation of employment, probability
of permanency, past employment record, the applicant's qualifications for the position, and previous training,
including that received in the military service. In the event that such considerations do not enable a determination
that the income from the veteran's current position has a reasonable likelihood of continuance, such income should
not be considered in the analysis. Applications received from persons employed in the building trades, or in other
occupations affected by climatic conditions, should be supported by documentation evidencing the applicant's
total earnings to date and covering a period of not less than 1 year as well as signed and dated copies of complete income
tax returns, including all schedules for the past 2 years or for whatever additional period is deemed necessary to
properly demonstrate a satisfactory earnings record. If the applicant works out of a union, evidence of the previous
year's earnings should be obtained together with a verification of employment from the current employer.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 When the loan pertains to a structure with more than a one-family dwelling unit, the prospective rental income will
not be considered unless the veteran can demonstrate a reasonable likelihood of success as a landlord, and sufficient
cash reserves are verified to enable the veteran to carry the mortgage loan payments (principal, interest, taxes,
and insurance) without assistance from the rental income for a period of at least 6 months. The determination of the
veteran's likelihood of success as a landlord will be based on documentation of any prior experience in managing rental
units, or other collection activities. The amount of rental income to be used in the loan analysis will be based on the
prior rental history of the units as verified by the seller's financial records (e.g., prior years' tax returns) for
existing structures or, for proposed construction, the appraiser's opinion of the property's fair monthly rental.
Adjustments will be applied to reduce estimated gross rental income by proper allowances for operating expenses
and vacancy losses.

 Proposed rental of a veteran's existing property may be used to offset the mortgage payment on that property, provided
there is no indication that the property will be difficult to rent. If available, a copy of the rental agreement should
be obtained. It is the responsibility of the loan underwriter to be aware of the condition of the local rental market.
For instance, in areas where the rental market is very strong the absence of a lease should not automatically prohibit
the offset of the mortgage by the proposed rental income.

 If income from rental property will be used to qualify for the new loan, the documentation required of a self-employed
applicant should be obtained together with evidence of cash reserves equaling 3 months PITI of the rental property.
As for any self-employed earnings (see paragraph (f)(7) of this section), depreciation claimed may be added back
in as income. In the case of a veteran who has no experience as a landlord, it is unlikely that the income from a rental

Taxes and other deductions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Deductions to be applied for Federal income taxes ad Social Security may be obtained from the Employer's Tax Guide
(Circular E) issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). (For veterans receiving a mortgage credit certificate
(MCC), see paragraph (f)(12) of this section.) Any State or local taxes should be estimated or obtained from charts
similar to those provided by IRS which may be available in those States with withholding taxes. A determination of
the amount paid or withheld for retirement purposes should be made and used when calculating deductions from gross
income. In determining whether a veteran-applicant meets the income criteria for a loan, some consideration may
be given to the potential tax benefits the veteran will realize if the loan is approved. This can be done by using the
instructions and worksheet portion of IRS Form W&hyph;4, Employee's Withholding Allowance Certificate, to compute
the total number of permissible withholding allowances. That number can then be used when referring to IRS Circular
E and any appropriate similar State withholding charts to arrive at the amount of Federal and State income tax to be
deducted from gross income.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) The Internal Revenue Code, as amended by the Tax Reform Act of 1984, allows States and other political subdivisions
to trade in all or part of their authority to issue mortgage revenue bonds for authority to issue MCCs. Veterans who
are recipients of MCCs may realize a significant reduction in their income tax liability by receiving a Federal tax
credit for a percentage of their mortgage interest payment on debt incurred on or after January 1, 1985.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Lenders must provide a copy of the MCC to VA with the home loan application. The MCC will specify the rate of credit
allowed and the amount of certified indebtedness; i.e., the indebtedness incurred by the veteran to acquire a principal
residence or as a qualified home improvement or rehabilitation loan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) For credit underwriting purposes, the amount of tax credit allowed to a veteran under an MCC will be treated as
a reduction in the monthly Federal income tax. For example, a veteran having a $600 monthly interest payment and an
MCC providing a 30-percent tax credit would receive a $180 (30%&times;$600) tax credit each month. However, because
the annual tax credit, which amounts to $2,160 (12&times;$180), exceeds $2,000 and is based on a 30-percent credit
rate, the maximum tax credit the veteran can receive is limited to $2,000 per year (Pub. L. 98&hyph;369) or $167 per
month ($2,000
<!-- PJG 0001 unknown -->
12). As a consequence of the tax credit, the interest on which a deduction can be taken will be reduced by the amount of
the tax credit to $433 ($600^$167). This reduction should also be reflected when calculating Federal income tax.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) For underwriting purposes, the amount of the tax credit is limited to the amount of the veteran's maximum tax liability.
If, in the example in paragraph (f)(12)(iii), the veteran's tax liability for the year were only $1,500, the monthly
tax credit would be limited to $125 ($1,500

Credit.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The conclusion reached as to whether or not the borrower and spouse are satisfactory credit risks must also be based
on a careful analysis of the available credit data. Regulation B (Equal Credit Opportunity Act) requires that lenders
include, in evaluating creditworthiness on a veteran's request, the credit history, when available, of any account
reported in the name of the veteran's spouse or former spouse which the veteran can demonstrate reflects accurately
the veteran's willingness or ability to repay. In other that community property States, if the spouse will not be contractually
obligated on the loan, Regulation B, promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board pursuant to the Equal Credit Opportunity
Act prohibits any request for, or consideration of information about the spouse concerning income, employment,
assets or liabilities. In community property States, information concerning a spouse may be requested and considered
in the same manner as that for the applicant.

Adverse data.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If the analysis develops any derogatory credit information and, despite such facts, it is determined that the borrower
and spouse are satisfactory credit risks, the basis for the decision must be explained. If a borrower and spouse have
debts outstanding which have not been paid timely, or which they have refused to pay, the fact that the outstanding
debts are paid after the acceptability of the credit is questioned or in anticipation of applying for new credit does
not, of course, alter the fact that the record for paying debts has been unsatisfactory. With respect to unpaid debts,
lenders may take into consideration a veterans's claim of bona fide or legal defenses. This is not applicable when
the debt has been reduced to judgment.

Bankruptcy.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 When the credit information shows that the borrower or spouse has been discharged in bankruptcy under the ``straight''
liquidation and discharge provisions of the bankruptcy law, this would not in itself disqualify the loan. However,
in such cases it is necessary to develop complete information as to the facts and circumstances concerning the bankruptcy.
Generally speaking, when the borrower or spouse, as the case may be, has been regularly employed (not self-employed)
and has been discharged in bankruptcy within the last 2 or 3 years, it probably would not be possible to determine that
the borrower or spouse is a satisfactory credit risk unless both of the following requirements are satisfied:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The borrower or spouse has obtained credit subsequent to the bankruptcy and has met the credit payments in a satisfactory
manner over a continued period, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The bankruptcy was caused by circumstances beyond control of the borrower or spouse, e.g., unemployment, prolonged
strikes, medical bills not covered by insurance. The circumstances alleged must be verified. If a borrower or spouse
is self-employed, has been adjudicated bankrupt, and subsequently obtains a permanent position, a finding as to
satisfactory credit risk may be made provided there is no derogatory credit information prior to self-employment,
there is no evidence of derogatory credit information subsequent to the bankruptcy, and the failure of the business
was not due to misconduct. A bankruptcy discharged more than 5 years ago may be disregarded. A bankruptcy discharged
between 3 and 5 years ago may be given some consideration, depending upon the circumstances of the bankruptcy and submission
of evidence that the veteran has been paying his or her obligations in a timely manner.

Petition under Chapter 13 of Bankruptcy Law.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A wage earner's petition under chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Law filed by the borrower or spouse is indicative of an effort
to pay their creditors. Some plans may provide for full payment of debts while others arrange for payment of scaled
down debts. Regular payments are made to a court-appointed trustee over a 2- to 3-year period (or up to 5 years in some
cases). When the borrowers have made all payments in a satisfactory manner, they may be considered as having reestablished
satisfactory credit. When they apply for a home loan before completion of the payout period, favorable consideration
may nevertheless be given if at least three-fourths of the payments have been made satisfactorily and the Trustee
or Bankruptcy Judge (Referee) approves of the new credit.

Foreclosures.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) When the credit information shows that the veteran or spouse has had a foreclosure on a prior mortgage, e.g., a VA
guaranteed, or HUD insured mortgage, this will not in itself disqualify the borrower from obtaining the loan. Lenders
and field station personnel should refer to the preceding guidelines on bankruptcies for cases involving foreclosures.
As with a borrower who has been adjudicated bankrupt, it is necessary to develop complete information as to the facts
and circumstances of the foreclosure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) When VA pays a claim on a VA guaranteed loan as a result of a foreclosure, the original veteran may be required to
repay any loss to the Government. In some instances VA may waive the veteran's debt, in part or totally, based on the
facts and circumstances of the case. However, guaranty entitlement cannot be restored unless the Government's loss
has been repaid in full, regardless of whether or not the debt has been waived, compromised, or discharged in bankruptcy.
Therefore, a veteran who is seeking a new VA loan after having experienced a foreclosure on a prior VA loan will in most
cases have only remaining entitlement to apply to the new loan. The lender should assure that the veteran has sufficient
entitlement for its secondary marketing purposes.

Federal debts.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 An applicant for a Federally-assisted loan will not be considered a satisfactory credit risk for such loan if the applicant
is presently delinquent or in default on any debt to the Federal Government, e.g., a Small Business Administration
loan, a U.S. Guaranteed Student loan, a debt to the Public Health Service, or where there is a judgment lien against
the applicant's property for a debt owed to the Government. The applicant may not be approved for the loan until the
delinquent account has been brought current or satisfactory arrangements have been made between the borrower and
the Federal agency owed, or the judgment is paid or otherwise satisfied. Of course, the applicant must also be able
to otherwise qualify for the loan from an income and remaining credit standpoint. Refinancing under VA's interest
rate reduction refinancing provisions, however, is allowed even if the borrower is delinquent on the VA guaranteed
mortgage being refinanced. Prior approval processing is required in such cases.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Absence of credit history.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The fact that recently discharged veterans may have had no opportunity to develop a credit history will not preclude
a determination of satisfactory credit. Similarly, other loan applicants may not have established credit histories
as a result of a preference for purchasing consumer items with cash rather than credit. There are also cases in which
individuals may be genuinely wary of acquiring new obligations following bankruptcy, consumer credit counseling
(debt proration), or other disruptive credit occurrence. The absence of the credit history in these cases will not
generally be viewed as an adverse factor in credit underwriting. However, before a favorable decision is made for
cases involving bankruptcies or other derogatory credit factors, efforts should be made to develop evidence of timely
payment of non-installment debts such as rent and utilities. It is anticipated that this special consideration in
the absence of a credit history following bankruptcy would be the rare case and generally confined to bankruptcies
which occurred over 3 years ago.

Long-term v. Short-term-debts.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 All known debts and obligations including any alimony and/or child support payments of the borrower and spouse must
be documented. Significant liabilities to be deducted from the total income in determining ability to meet the mortgage
payments are accounts that, generally, are of a relatively long-term; i.e., 6 months or over. Other accounts for terms
of less than 6 months must, of course, be considered in determining ability to meet family expenses. Certainly any
account with less than 6 months' duration which requires payments so large as to cause a severe impact on the family's
resources for any period of time must be considered in the loan analysis. For example, monthly payments of $300 on an
auto loan with a remaining balance of $1,500 would be included in those obligations to be deducted from the total income
regardless of the fact that the account can be expected to pay out in 5 months. It is clear that the applicant will, in
this case, continue to carry the burden of those $300 payments for the first, most critical, months of the home loan.
Similarly, when the credit information shows open accounts of several years' duration which are clearly of a revolving
or open-end type, the regular monthly payment for such accounts should be considered as a long-term obligation to
be deducted from income.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Requirements for verification.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If the credit investigation reveals debts or obligations of a material nature which were not divulged by the applicant,
lenders must be certain to obtain clarification as to the status of such debts from the borrower. A proper analysis
is obviously not possible unless there is total correlation between the obligations claimed by the borrower and those
revealed by a credit report or deposit verification. Conversely, significant debts and obligations reported by
the borrower must be dated. If the credit report fails to provide necessary information on such accounts, lenders
will be expected to obtain their own verifications of those debts directly from the creditors. Credit reports and
verifications must be no more than 90 days old to be considered valid. For loans closed automatically, this requirement
will be considered satisfied if the date of the credit report or verification is within 90 days of the date of the veteran's
application to the lender. Of major significance are the applicant's rental history and outstanding, assumed, or
recently retired mortgages, if any, particularly prior VA loans. Lenders should be sure ratings on such accounts
are obtained; a written explanation is reburied when ratings are not available. A determination is necessary as to
whether alimony and/or child support payments are required. Verification of the amount of such obligations should
be obtained, although documentation concerning an applicant's divorce should not be obtained automatically unless
it is necessary to verify the amount of any alimony or child support liability indicated by the applicant. If in the
routine course of processing the loan application, however, direct evidence is received (e.g., from the credit report)
that an obligation to pay alimony or child support exists (as opposed to mere evidence that the veteran was previously
divorced), the discrepancy between the loan application and credit report can and should be fully resolved in the
same manner as any other such discrepancy would be handled.

Job-related expenses.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Known job-related expenses should be documented. This will include costs for any dependent care, significant commuting
costs, etc. When a family's circumstances are such that dependent care arrangements would probably be necessary,
it is important to determine the cost of such services in order to arrive at an accurate total of deductions.

Credit reports. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Credit reports obtained by lenders on VA guaranteed loan applications must be in conformance with the Residential
Mortgage Credit Report Standards formulated jointly by the Department of Veterans Affairs, Federal National Mortgage
Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, Federal Housing Administration, Farmers Home Administration,
credit repositories, repository affiliated consumer reporting agencies and independent consumer reporting agencies.
The Residential Mortgage Credit Report is a detailed account of the credit, employment, and residence history as
well as public records information concerning an individual. All credit reports obtained by the lender must be submitted
to VA.

Borrower's personal and financial status. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The number and ages of dependents have an important bearing on whether income after deduction of fixed charges is sufficient
to support the family. Type and duration of employment of both the borrower and spouse are important as an indication
of stability of their employment. The amount of liquid assets owned by the borrower or spouse, or both, is an important
factor in determining that they have sufficient funds to close the loan, as well as being significant in analyzing
the overall qualifications for the loan. (It is imperative that adequate cash assets from the veteran's own resources
are verified to allow the payment of any difference between the sales price of the property and the loan amount, in addition
to that necessary to cover closing costs, if the sales price exceeds the reasonable value established by VA (38 CFR
36.4336(a)(3)). Verifications must be no more than 90 days old to be considered valid. For loans closed on the automatic
basis, this requirement will be considered satisfied if the date of the deposit verification is within 90 days of the
date of the veteran's application to the lender. Current monthly rental or other housing expense is an important consideration
when compared to that to be undertaken in connection with the contemplated housing purchase.

Estimated monthly shelter expenses. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is important that monthly expenses such as taxes, insurance, assessments and maintenance and utilities be estimated
accurately based on property location and type of house; e.g., old or new, large or small, rather than using or applying
a ``rule of thumb'' to all properties alike. Maintenance and utility amounts for various types of property should
be realistically estimated. Local utility companies should be consulted for current rates. The age and type of construction
of a house may well affect these expenses. In the case of condominiums or houses in a planned unit development (PUD),
the monthly amount of the maintenance assessment payable to a homeowners association should be added. If the amount
currently assessed is less than the maximum provided in the covenants or master deed, and it appears likely that the
amount will be insufficient for operation of the condominium or PUD, the amount used will be the maximum the veteran
could be charged. If it is expected that real estate taxes will be raised, or if any special assessments are expected,
the increased or additional amounts should be used. In special flood hazard areas, include the premium for any required
flood insurance.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Clean Air Act (Act) sets forth a number of requirements that states with areas designated as nonattainment for
ozone had to satisfy by November 15, 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New Jersey must address a number of requirements of the Act including the requirements:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 -->
 To adopt Reasonably Available Control Techniques (RACT) regulations for all source types for which the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) has developed Control Techniques Guidelines (CTGs);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 To adopt RACT regulations for all other major sources of volatile organic compounds (VOCs);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 To adopt RACT regulations for all major sources of oxides of nitrogen (NOx);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 To develop and adopt an enhanced inspection and maintenance program;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 To develop and adopt measures to offset emission increases due to increases in vehicle miles travelled (VMT) or in
the number of vehicle trips;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 To adopt an emission statement program;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 To revise its new source review program to meet the new requirements of the Act; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 To develop and adopt an Employer Trip Reduction program;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 To develop an emission inventory; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 To develop and adopt a small business assistance program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These measures are intended to reduce emissions of VOCs and NOx. VOCs and NOx are precursors of ozone in the lower atmosphere,
which is a primary component of smog. A more detailed summary of these requirements, including the relevant statutory
provisions can be found in the General Preamble to title I of the Act (57 FR 13498, April 16, 1992).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The specific requirements that New Jersey must meet vary by area, depending upon the severity of the ozone problem.
Eighteen of the twenty one counties in New Jersey are designated as severe nonattainment for ozone. Of the remaining
three counties, Atlantic and Cape May Counties are designated as moderate nonattainment for ozone and Warren County
is designated as marginal nonattainment for ozone. In addition, section 184(a) of the Act recognizes that ozone is
a regional problem by designating all of New Jersey as part of an ozone transport region. Since most of New Jersey is
designated as severe nonattainment for ozone, and all of New Jersey is part of an ozone transport region, New Jersey
has chosen to implement statewide all of the control requirements that are addressed in this action.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
State Submittal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 15, 1992, New Jersey submitted to EPA a request to revise its SIP for ozone. This submittal had undergone
public hearings on October 27, October 29 and November 5, 1992. While New Jersey did address additional requirements
in its November 15, 1992 submittal, the only requirement that EPA is addressing in this action is the requirement to
adopt RACT regulations for all source types for which EPA has developed CTGs. EPA will take action on the other submittals
that New Jersey made in other 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 110(k) of the Clean Air Act requires EPA to determine if a state's SIP submittal is complete within sixty days
of submittal but not later than six months later than that date. If EPA does not notify a state of the completeness of
a submittal within six months of receipt it is automatically deemed complete. The criteria that EPA uses to determine
completeness are set forth in 40 CFR part 51, appendix V. On April 20, 1993, EPA sent New Jersey a letter informing it
that its November 15, 1992 submittal was not complete because it did not contain a compilation of the public comments
and the State's responses to those comments. On May 14, 1993, New Jersey submitted a compilation of public comments
and the State's responses to these comments. These public comments did not result in any substantive changes to New
Jersey's submittal. Most of the comments involved portions of the SIP which New Jersey is still developing and will
be better addressed as part of those SIP submittals. On June 10, 1993, EPA wrote to New Jersey and informed them that
EPA had reviewed its May 14, 1993 submittal and was finding New Jersey's submittal complete insofar as it contained
adopted RACT regulations for all source types for which EPA has developed CTGs. The following summarizes EPA's evaluation
of New Jersey's submittal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act sets forth two separate provisions requiring states to promulgate VOC RACT rules in ozone nonattainment areas.
RACT is defined as the lowest emission that a particular source is capable of meeting with the application of control
technology that is reasonably available considering technological and economic feasibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first provision, referred to as RACT fix-up, requires the correction of RACT rules for which EPA identified deficiencies
before the Act was amended in 1990. Under the pre-amended Clean Air Act, ozone nonattainment areas were required to
adopt RACT rules for sources of VOC emissions. EPA issued three sets of CTG documents, establishing a ``presumptive
norm'' for RACT for various categories of VOC sources. The three sets of CTGs were (1) Group I_issued before January
1978 (15 CTGs); (2) Group II_issued in 1978 (9 CTGs); and (3) Group III_issued in the early 1980's (5 CTGs). Those sources
not covered by a CTG were called non-CTG sources. Under section 172(a)(1), ozone nonattainment areas were generally
required to attain the ozone standard by December 31, 1982. Those areas that submitted an attainment demonstration
projecting attainment by that date were required to adopt RACT for sources covered by the Group I and II CTGs. Areas,
such as New Jersey, that sought an extension of the attainment date under section 172(a)(2) to as late as December 31,
1987 were required to adopt RACT for all CTG sources and for all major (i.e., 100 ton per year or more of VOC emissions)
non-CTG sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the mid and late 1980's, EPA issued SIP Calls, notifying numerous states that they contained nonattainment areas
that had failed to attain the ozone standard. In the SIP Calls, EPA required states to correct deficiencies in their
existing RACT rules and to adopt rules that were required but not yet adopted. Under the amended Act, section 182(a)(2)(A)
requires states to correct these RACT rules by May 15, 1991. New Jersey submitted its RACT fix-up rules to EPA on March
13, 1992, which EPA approved on April 15, 1994 (59 FR 17933). Thus New Jersey has met the RACT fix up requirement and no
further action needs to be taken with respect to this requirement in today's action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second provision, set forth in section 182(b)(2) applies to moderate (and above) ozone nonattainment areas.
The goal of this provision is to ensure that areas, that were not required previously to adopt RACT for some or all of
the CTGs or for major stationary sources not covered by a CTG, adopt rules and ``catch-up'' to those areas previously
subject to more stringent RACT requirements. In addition, the RACT catch-up provision requires those areas for which
the major source definition has been lowered to adopt RACT for those sources now covered by the more stringent major
stationary source definition. Section 182(b)(2) sets forth three requirements for the purpose of achieving those
goals. First 182(b)(2) requires states to adopt RACT for sources subject to pre-enactment CTGs. Next, this provision
requires states to adopt RACT for all sources subject to any new CTGs issued after enactment of the Amendments. Finally,
section 182(b)(2) requires RACT for all major stationary sources not subject to a CTG. Section 182(b)(2) requires
these rules to be submitted to EPA by November 15, 1992. Moreover, under section 185, all areas in the Ozone Transport
Region, which includes all of New Jersey are subject to this requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New Jersey has met the RACT requirement as it applies to sources for which there was a pre-enactment CTG. New Jersey
has adopted rules for all but three of the pre-enactment CTGs and incorporated them into Subchapter 16, ``Control
and Prohibition of Air Pollutants by Volatile Organic Compounds.'' The three CTG source categories for which New
Jersey has not incorporated specific control requirements into Subchapter 16 are: rubber tire manufacturing; high
density polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene resin manufacturing and air oxidation processes in synthetic
organic chemical manufacturing industry facilities. In its 1982 SIP for the Attainment and Maintenance of the Ozone
and Carbon Monoxide National Ambient Air Quality Standards, New Jersey declared that it had no rubber tire manufacturing
facilities. EPA approved this declaration on November 9, 1983. New Jersey reaffirmed this declaration in its November
15, 1992 submittal. New Jersey submitted on March 31, 1987, and supplemented on May 4, 1991, an equivalency demonstration
which showed that high density polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene resin processes would be regulated
under general provisions contained in both Subchapter 8 and Subchapter 16. An equivalency demonstration must show
that the state rules applicable to the source category result in emissions within five percent of the emissions that
would result from the control requirements recommended by the CTG. EPA approved this demonstration on October 9,
1991. On November 21, 1989, New Jersey submitted an equivalency demonstration showing that air oxidation processes
at synthetic organic chemical manufacturing industry facilities would be regulated under general provisions contained
in both Subchapter 8 and Subchapter 16. This submittal was supplemented on May 10, 1991. EPA approved this demonstration
on September 24, 1991. EPA is approving New Jersey's reaffirmation that there are no rubber tire manufacturing sources
in New Jersey. As a result of EPA's approval of New Jersey's negative declaration and of New Jersey's equivalency demonstrations,
EPA finds that New Jersey has fully approved rules for all pre-enactment CTGs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As to the requirement for adopting RACT for sources subject to a post-enactment CTG, New Jersey has followed the process
set forth by EPA in its CTG document issued as appendix B to the General Preamble. In appendix B, EPA provided that states
could delay submission of non-CTG rules for those sources the state anticipates will be covered by one of EPA's 11 proposed
post-enactment CTGs. Section 183(a) requires EPA to issue these 11 CTGs by November 15, 1993. Pursuant to the procedure
established in appendix B, New Jersey is required to adopt regulations in accordance with a CTG issued by November
15, 1993, in accordance with the schedule set forth by EPA. In the alternative, for source categories for which a CTG
is not issued by that date, the State will adopt RACT for those source categories by November 15, 1994. Appendix B also
requires states to submit a list of sources that it anticipates will be covered by such a CTG. As part of its November
15, 1992 submittal, New Jersey submitted a list of sources that it anticipates will be covered by such a CTG. New Jersey
also indicated that it intends to adopt RACT regulations for all of those sources by the required date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 15, 1993, EPA published a CTG for reactor processes and distillation operations in the synthetic organic
chemical manufacturing industry. On March 23, 1994, in 56 FR 13717, EPA published an addendum to that CTG. In that addendum
EPA explained that states are required to adopt RACT rules for this CTG category by March 23, 1995 and that sources must
be in compliance with these rules no later than November 15, 1996. EPA did not publish any additional CTGs by the November
15, 1993 deadline. Therefore, in order to meet the appendix B requirement, New Jersey must adopt RACT rules for reactor
processes and distillation operations in the synthetic organic chemical manufacturing industry by March 23, 1995.
In addition, New Jersey must adopt RACT rules for all major sources which would be subject to other post-enactment
CTG categories by November 15, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, New Jersey was required to submit by November 15, 1992, non-CTG RACT rules for all major sources not covered
by a pre-enactment CTG and not anticipated to be covered by a post-enactment CTG. New Jersey failed to submit such regulations
on the required date and on January 15, 1993, EPA notified the Governor of New Jersey that it was starting the 18-month
sanction process required by section 179(a) of the Act. On November 15, 1993, New Jersey made submittals intending
to meet this requirement. EPA determined that this submittal was complete on December 29, 1993. This determination
stopped the sanction process. EPA will be taking action on this state submittal in a separate

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this rulemaking, EPA is approving New Jersey's reaffirmation that there are no major sources of rubber tire manufacturing
in New Jersey. In addition EPA finds that this reaffirmation along with New Jersey's previously approved regulations
and demonstrations fulfills the section 182(b)(2) RACT catch-up requirements to adopt RACT requirements for all
sources for which EPA issued a CTG before the 1990 amendments to the Act.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 publication, the EPA is proposing to approve the SIP revision should adverse or critical comments be filed. Thus,
this direct final action will be effective November 28, 1994 unless, by October 27, 1994, adverse or critical comments
are received.

If the EPA receives such comments, this rule will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing a subsequent
notice that will withdraw the final action. All public comments received will then be addressed in a subsequent final
rule based on this action serving as a proposed rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action.
Any parties interested in commenting on this rule should do so at this time. If no adverse comments are received, the
public is advised that this rule will be effective November 28, 1994. (See 47 FR 27073 and 59 FR 24059).

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities
(5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act do not create any new requirements, but
simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does
not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected.
Moveover, due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the Clean Air Act, preparation of a regulatory
flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Clean
Air Act forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended (RCRA), authorizes the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) to grant approval to states to operate their underground storage tank programs in lieu of the federal
program. 40 CFR part 282 codifies EPA's decision to approve state programs and incorporates by reference those provisions
of the state statutes and regulations that will be subject to EPA's inspection and enforcement authorities under
sections 9005 and 9006 of RCRA subtitle I and other applicable statutory and regulatory provisions. This rule codifies
in part 282 the prior approval of Kansas' underground storage tank program and incorporates by reference appropriate
provisions of state statutes and regulations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 9004 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended, (RCRA), 42 U.S.C. 6991c, allows the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to approve state underground storage tank programs to operate in the state
in lieu of the federal underground storage tank program. EPA published a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 document announcing its decision to grant approval to Kansas. (59 FR 29201 June 6, 1994). Approval was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective on July 6, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA codifies its approval of State programs in 40 CFR part 282 and incorporates by reference therein the state statutes
and regulations that will be subject to EPA's inspection and enforcement authorities under sections 9005 and 9006
of subtitle I of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991d and 6991e, and other applicable statutory and regulatory provisions. Today's
rulemaking codifies EPA's approval of the Kansas underground storage tank program. This codification reflects
the state program in effect at the time EPA granted Kansas approval under section 9004(a), 42 U.S.C. 6991c(a) for its
underground storage tank program. Notice and opportunity for comment were provided earlier on the Agency's decision
to approve the Kansas program, and EPA is not now reopening that decision nor requesting comment on it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This effort provides clear notice to the public of the scope of the approved program in each state. By codifying the
approved Kansas program and by amending the Code of Federal Regulations whenever a new or different set of requirements
is approved in Kansas, the status of federally approved requirements of the Kansas program will be readily discernible.
Only those provisions of the Kansas underground storage tank program for which approval has been granted by EPA will
be incorporated by reference for enforcement purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To codify EPA's approval of Kansas' underground storage tank program, EPA has added &sect;282.66 to title 40 of the
CFR. Section 282.66 incorporates by reference for enforcement purposes the State's statutes and regulations. Section
282.66 also references the Attorney General's Statement, Demonstration of Adequate Enforcement Procedures, the
Program Description, and the Memorandum of Agreement, which are approved as part of the underground storage tank
program under subtitle I of RCRA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency retains the authority under sections 9005 and 9006 of subtitle I of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991d and 6991e, and other
applicable statutory and regulatory provisions to undertake inspections and enforcement actions in approved states.
With respect to such an enforcement action, the Agency will rely on federal sanctions, federal inspection authorities,
and federal procedures rather than the state authorized analogs to these provisions. Therefore, the approved Kansas
enforcement authorities will not be incorporated by reference. Section 282.66 lists those approved Kansas authorities
that would fall into this category. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public also needs to be aware that some provisions of the State's underground storage tank program are not part
of the federally approved state program. These non-approved provisions are not part of the RCRA subtitle I program
because they are ``broader in scope'' than subtitle I of RCRA. See 40 CFR 281.12(a)(3)(ii). As a result, state provisions
which are ``broader in scope'' than the federal program are not incorporated by reference for purposes of enforcement
in part 282. Section 282.66 of the codification simply lists for reference and clarity the Kansas statutory and regulatory
provisions which are ``broader in scope'' than the federal program and which are not, therefore, part of the approved
program being codified today. ``Broader in scope'' provisions cannot be enforced by EPA; the State, however, will
continue to enforce such provisions.

Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule codifies the decision already made (59 FR 29201 June 6, 1994) to approve the Kansas underground storage tank
program and thus has no separate effect. Therefore, this rule does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.
Thus, pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this rule
will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The State of Kansas is approved to administer and enforce an underground storage tank program in lieu of the federal
program under subtitle I of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), as amended, 42 U.S.C. 6991 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The State's program, as administered by the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, was approved by EPA pursuant
to 42 U.S.C. 6991c and part 281 of this Chapter. EPA approved the Kansas program on June 6, 1994 and it was effective on
July 6, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Kansas has primary responsibility for enforcing its underground storage tank program. However, EPA retains
the authority to exercise its inspection and enforcement authorities under sections 9005 and 9006 of subtitle I of
RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991d and 6991e, as well as under other statutory and regulatory provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) To retain program approval, Kansas must revise its approved program to adopt new changes to the federal subtitle
I program which make it more stringent, in accordance with section 9004 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991c, and 40 CFR part 281,
subpart E. If Kansas obtains approval for the revised requirements pursuant to section 9004 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991c,
the newly approved statutory and regulatory provisions will be added to this subpart and notice of any change will
be published in the

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rulemaking establishes Coast Guard regulations which implement the provisions of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990
(OPA 90) that require certificates of registry (CORs) and merchant mariner's documents (MMDs) to be renewed every
5 years. A 5-year renewal period allows the Coast Guard to ensure that vessel personnel continue to be qualified to
safely serve aboard a vessel. This rulemaking includes requirements for renewing CORs and MMDs, a schedule for renewing
existing CORs and MMDs, and the associated user fees.

Regulatory History 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 16, 1993, the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) entitled Five-Year Term of
Validity for Certificates of Registry and Merchant Mariner's Documents in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 48572). The 60-day comment period closed on November 15, 1993. The NPRM discussed the background and statutory
requirements of section 4102 (b) and (c) of OPA 90 which amended 46 U.S.C. 7107 and 7302. It also discussed the requirements
of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 which amended 46 U.S.C. 2110. The Coast Guard received 13 letters
commenting on the proposal from mariners, unions, and marine industry representatives. A public hearing was not
requested, and one was not held. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of these comments and the NPRM, the Coast Guard has finalized the requirements for renewal of
Certificates of Registry and Merchant Mariner's Documents. The Coast Guard finds that the regulations provide the
maximum flexibility practicable in establishing requirements for a 5-year term of validity for CORs and MMDs.

The Coast Guard issues certificates of registry (CORs) under the authority of 46 U.S.C. chapters 71 and 75. CORs are
issued to provide registry of staff officers for service in positions such as purser, medical doctor, and professional
nurse. The Coast Guard issues merchant mariner's documents (MMDs) under the authority of 46 U.S.C. chapters 73 and
75. MMDs authorize individuals to work in different capacities on deck, and in the engine and steward's departments,
on seagoing vessels over 100 gross tons. MMDs, with an appropriate endorsement, also identify qualified tankermen.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4102(b) of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90) (Pub. L. 101&hyph;380) amended 46 U.S.C. 7107 by limiting
the term of a COR to 5 years. Section 4102(c) of OPA 90 amended 46 U.S.C. 7302 by establishing the same limited term for
MMDs. The Conference Report on OPA 90 (H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 101&hyph;653) explains that a 5-year renewal period will
allow the Coast Guard to ensure that vessel personnel continue to be qualified to operate a vessel safely. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4102(d) of OPA 90 limits the term of validity of all existing CORs and MMDs and provides for staggered expirations
over a 5-year span. The statutory language provides that CORs and MMDs issued before August 18, 1990 expire on the day
they would have expired if they had been issued for a term of 5 years and been renewed at the end of each succeeding 5-year
period. This avoids the problems that would have been encountered if all CORs and MMDs expired at the same time. If this
language is interpreted so that the 5-year period began on August 18, 1990, the date OPA 90 was enacted, documents would
have expired at a time when no review and renewal procedures were in place. Mariners with such an expired document could
not continue working, placing a tremendous burden on both individual mariners and the maritime industry. The Coast
Guard interprets the statutory language to include an additional 5-year renewal cycle to avoid such a harsh result.
The Coast Guard has modified the tables in 46 CFR 10.811 and 12.02&hyph;29 to commence the mandatory 5-year renewal
period beginning on January 1, 1995. This will allow merchant mariners sufficient time to comply with the regulation's
requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pending the development of these proposed procedures for renewal of CORs and MMDs, the Coast Guard has been issuing
CORs and MMDs that are valid for a period of 5 years since March 1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 amended 46 U.S.C. 2110 to require the Coast Guard to establish and collect
user fees for services it provides under subtitle II of 46 U.S.C., including the issuance and renewal of CORs and MMDs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 4101 (a) and (b) of OPA 90 amend 46 U.S.C. 7101 and 7302, respectively, to require every person who applies
for the issuance or renewal of a license, COR, or MMD to have a chemical test for dangerous drugs. On March 4, 1994, the
Coast Guard published an NPRM in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 entitled ``Chemical Testing for Dangerous Drugs of Applicants for Issuance or Renewal of Licenses, Certificates
of Registry, or Merchant Mariner's Documents'' (59 FR 10544) (CGD 91&hyph;223). The Coast Guard originally intended
to merge the chemical testing requirements and the regulations for terms of validity into one final rule. However,
the Coast Guard has decided to publish these rules separately in order to facilitate public participation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by OPA 90, the Coast Guard is also developing a rulemaking which addresses how review of information in
the National Driver Register and a criminal record review will become part of the license, COR, and MMD renewal process
(CGD 91&hyph;212). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Discussion of Comments and Changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Thirteen letters were received in response to the NPRM. The Coast Guard has reviewed all of the comments and, in some
instances, revised the proposed regulations as appropriate. The comments have been grouped by issue, and are discussed
as follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. User Fees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several comments objected to the proposed Coast Guard user fees for renewals of MMDs and CORs. As stated in the NPRM,
the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 amended 46 U.S.C. 2110 to require the Coast Guard to establish and collect
user fees for services it provides under 46 U.S.C., subtitle II. The Coast Guard has no discretion in the decision to
establish fees for these services. The fee amounts for issuance of CORs and MMDs and for issuance and renewal of licenses
were set by a final rule entitled ``User Fees for Marine Licensing, Certification of Registry and Merchant Mariner
Documentation'' (58 FR 15228; March 19, 1993) (CGD 91&hyph;002). These rules became effective April 19, 1993. At
that time, CORs and MMDs were not being renewed so that rule did not establish fee amounts for COR and MMD renewals. Therefore,
fee amounts for COR and MMD renewals are set in this final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulatory evaluation in this final rule discusses the fee amounts. For a summary of how the fee amounts were set,
see the ``Regulatory Evaluation'' section of this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Concurrent Renewals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment suggested a reduced fee for mariners who renew more than one merchant mariner credential at the same time.
This approach was outlined in the NPRM and remains unchanged in the final rule. The Coast Guard encourages concurrent
renewal of merchant mariner credentials whenever possible. However, all renewal requirements for each license,
COR, or MMD must be met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Renewal Evaluation Fees. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When CORs or MMDs are renewed in conjunction with the renewal of a license, the Coast Guard will charge only the license
renewal evaluation fee, since the evaluation for a license encompasses all factors considered in evaluating applicants
for MMDs. When CORs or MMDs are renewed in conjunction with one another, but not in conjunction with a license, the Coast
Guard will charge only the MMD renewal evaluation fee, if applicable, since there is no COR renewal evaluation fee.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Renewal Exercise Fees. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When an MMD is renewed concurrently with a license and the applicant must take an open-book exercise for each renewal,
the applicant need only pay the license exercise fee. If a license and MMD are renewed concurrently and the only open-book
exercise is for an MMD, then the applicant will pay the MMD exercise fee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Renewal Issuance Fees. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It should be noted that a separate issuance fee will always be charged for each license, COR or MMD issued, regardless
of whether the credential(s) are issued concurrently or individually. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Physical Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Merchant Marine Personnel Advisory Committee recommended to the Coast Guard that individuals holding MMDs with
qualified ratings be required to undergo physical examinations when renewing MMDs. The Coast Guard has included
such a requirement in this rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments addressed the physical requirements for renewal of MMDs with endorsements. The comments stated that
the physical standards for renewal of MMDs with endorsements should not be the same as the physical standards for the
original issuance of MMDs with endorsements. In response to these comments, the Coast Guard revised the physical
examination section for MMD renewal, making it consistent with the physical examination section for license renewal.
The physical examination for renewal of a license does not require the applicant to be tested for color sensitivity;
however, the physical examination for original issuance of a license does require a color sensitivity test. This
is the only difference in physical requirements between original issuance and renewal of licenses. The Coast Guard
has revised the physical examination section for renewal of MMDs with endorsements to no longer require a color sensitivity
test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should be noted that while the examination requirements are slightly different, the medical standards the Coast
Guard applies to determine if a mariner is qualified for a license or document are the same regardless of whether the
license or document is an original or a renewal. The Coast Guard believes that these standards are the minimum necessary
to ensure safe service under a license or document and are therefore appropriate for both originals and renewals.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Professional Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment suggested that individuals holding MMDs with qualified ratings, who serve as officials for unions in
positions closely related to the training and servicing of active seamen should be required to show only 1 year of employment
to meet the professional requirements for renewing an MMD. The professional requirements are intended to ensure
that mariners maintain their professional knowledge and keep abreast of current technology. The NPRM proposed 3
years of employment in a position closely related to the operation, construction, or repair of vessels (either deck
or engineer, as appropriate) as a substitute for 1 year of sea service. The Coast Guard believes that 1 year in a position
of closely related maritime service, including training and servicing of active seamen, does not provide experience
equivalent to 1 year of actual sea service. Therefore, the final rule retains the 3 year time requirement for all forms
of closely related service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment expressed concern about using an open-book ``examination'' as a substitute for sea service when renewing
an MMD with an endorsement. The open-book renewal exercise will provide a means for those individuals who are not actively
sailing or involved in the industry to maintain a working familiarity with the skills necessary to work in the industry.
The renewal exercise contains general subject matter pertaining to the various endorsement(s) of the MMD and requires
a 90 percent passing grade. The Coast Guard has concluded that this is an acceptable means of ensuring that endorsement
holders continue to maintain their professional knowledge. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Continuity Endorsement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to several comments, the Coast Guard has included in the final rule a provision to renew MMDs ``For Continuity
Purposes Only.'' This provision follows the same procedures as the renewal policy for license holders. Individuals
renewing MMDs with qualified ratings who cannot meet the professional or physical requirements will have the endorsement
``Continuity only; service under document prohibited'' placed on the MMD. Holders with this continuity endorsement
may have the service prohibition rescinded at any time by satisfying the renewal requirements not previously met
and paying the appropriate renewal fees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Other Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another comment addressed the renewal of Continuous Discharge Books (CDB) which the Coast Guard issues to merchant
mariners for a chronological record of seagoing employment. Regulations listed in 46 CFR 12.02 cover issuing additional
CDBs. Because OPA 90 does not address CDBs and because CDBs alone do not allow employment on a merchant ship, no change
to the regulations is required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another comment stated that the NPRM did not address the grace period provision for MMD expiration dates determined
by Table 12.02&hyph;29. The grace period explained under &sect;12.02&hyph;27(e) applies to all MMD expiration
dates including MMD expiration dates specified in Table 12.02&hyph;29. For example, an MMD issued on January 1, 1966,
would expire on January 1, 1996 under Table 12.02&hyph;29. The holder of that MMD will have a 12 month period of grace,
running until January 1, 1997, in which he or she may renew the document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment pointed out that the description of the procedures for renewal of MMDs by mail was not detailed enough.
The Coast Guard has provided additional detail in &sect;12.02&hyph;27(e)(3) of the regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To correct minor errors and to reflect renewal requirements for certificates of registry, the Coast Guard is updating
the table in 46 CFR 10.203. Additionally, numerous non-substantive editorial changes have been made to the final
rule in order to improve its clarity, and to ensure that the public understands the requirements set forth. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulatory Evaluation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has not been reviewed by the Office
of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the
Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A final Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT has been prepared
and is available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Evaluation is summarized as follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Government/Coast Guard cost.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Government and Coast Guard costs attributable to implementing renewal requirements for merchant mariner credentials
will be primarily incurred by the 17 Coast Guard Regional Examination Centers (RECs). Cost incurring activities
will consist of evaluating renewal applications, administering examinations, and issuing renewed CORs and MMDs.
Projections of costs and impacts for renewal of CORs and MMDs are based upon a calculation of the current merchant marine
licensing and documentation program costs. Data used in this calculation included: information from a workload
analysis study; hourly standard rates provided in the Coast Guard Standard Rate Instruction (COMDTINST 7310); and
the Coast Guard Staffing Standards Manual (COMDTINST M5312.11A). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard calculates the projected personnel and associated infrastructure costs for COR and MMD renewal activities
to be approximately $1.23 million annually, which will be offset by approximately $1.16 million annually in user
fees. User fee receipts will be deposited in the general fund of the U.S. Treasury as offsetting receipts of the Department
of Transportation and ascribed to Coast Guard activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Costs to the public. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard estimates a total pool of 1,500 active staff officers and 88,500 active MMD holders who may seek renewal
of CORs or MMDs respectively. One-fifth of the total pool is expected to renew each year, resulting in 300 COR and 17,700
MMD renewals annually. Because the renewal process occurs once every 5 years, total costs can be divided by 5 to determine
an annualized cost. Costs incurred by merchant mariners seeking renewal of CORs or MMDs will consist of user fees,
photographs for MMDs, physical examinations, and time spent in the renewal process itself. This aggregate cost represents
the highest average amount a mariner may expect to pay. However, variations in fees and renewal requirements will
result in significantly lower costs for many mariners. The cost estimates are as follows:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Benefits. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Direct and societal benefits resulting from periodic renewal of CORs and MMDs may be substantial. The renewal process
will eventually include three additional regulatory initiatives to implement OPA 90, and to ensure continuing qualification
of merchant mariners. These initiatives are: (1) criminal record reviews, (2) national driver register checks,
and (3) chemical drug testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Licensed, certificated, or documented merchant mariners play crucial and responsible roles in the safe operation
of vessels, and they have important responsibilities during vessel emergencies. It is imperative that merchant
mariners know that they are going to sea with a competent crew and that other vessels are operated by equally competent
mariners. This rule will protect employees, employers, the marine environment, and the general public. Some of the
direct benefits will include the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Employment protections and preferences, identification, proof of citizenship, proof of physical and other competency
qualifications. Merchant mariners get employment benefits and know that shipmates to whom they entrust their lives
at sea are qualified; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Potentially fewer personal injuries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, society may benefit indirectly through potentially fewer groundings, accidents, losses of property,
and releases of oil and hazardous materials into the marine environment. There is insufficient historical data to
quantify the benefits of the regulations. However, should this program manage to save even two lives per year at $2.6
million per statistical life saved (which recent research shows is a reasonable estimate of people's willingness-to-pay
for safety), its benefits would exceed its cost. If maritime accidents were reduced even by a small percentage, savings
would accrue to the maritime industry through lower repair and medical costs and to the public through environmental
protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Small Entities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal, if adopted, will have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. ``Small entities'' may include (1) small businesses and not-for-profit organizations
that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields and (2) governmental jurisdictions
with populations of less than 50,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Individual applicants are responsible for payment of issuance and renewal fees of CORs and MMDs to the Coast Guard.
However, some firms in the maritime industry now voluntarily pay their employees' fees for obtaining CORs and MMDs.
Some firms may choose to pay part or all of their employees' additional fees which will result from this rulemaking.
However, the regulations do not require firms to pay for document issuance or document renewal fees for any applicant
in whom the final rule vests responsibility. Consequently, small entities_for example, the 355 inland barge operators
with fleets of 10 or fewer barges_are not, and will not be required to incur costs for applicant renewals of CORs and
MMDs. Because it expects the impact of this proposal to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b)
that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Collection of Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule contains collection-of-information requirements. The Coast Guard has submitted the requirements to
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C.
3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), and OMB has approved them. The section numbers are 10.209 and 12.02&hyph;27 and the corresponding OMB Control Number
is 2115&hyph;0514.

Federalism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard has analyzed these regulations under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612
and has determined that the regulations do not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment.

Environment

The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of these regulations and concluded that, under section 2.B.2
of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, the regulations are categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.
Section 2.B.2.1 of that instruction excludes administrative actions and procedural regulations and policies which
clearly do not have any environmental impact. A Categorical Exclusion Determination is available in the docket for

including by mail, this period may be extended. The period of military service following the date of license expiration
which precluded renewal may be added to the 12 month period of grace. The 12 month period of grace, and any extension,
do not affect the expiration date of the license. A license is not valid for use after the expiration date.

this 12-month period of grace may be extended. The period of military service following the date of merchant mariner's
document expiration which precluded renewal may be added to the 12 month period of grace. The 12 month period of grace,
and any extension, do not affect the expiration date of the document. A merchant mariner's document, and any endorsements
that it contains, are not valid for use after the expiration date.

Expiration of existing merchant mariner's documents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The expiration year of a merchant mariner's document issued without an expiration date is calculated by adding 5-year
increments to the issuance date of the document, up to the first applicable year falling between 1995 and 1999, inclusive.
The day and month of expiration are the same as that of issuance. Table 12.02&hyph;29 is provided as an aid for calculating
the expiration date of a document issued without an expiration date. A merchant mariner's document is not valid for
use after the expiration date calculated under this section, but may be renewed in accordance with the requirements
of &sect;12.02&hyph;27.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule prescribes final late-season frameworks from which States may select season dates, limits, and other options
for the 1994&hyph;95 migratory bird hunting season. These late seasons include most waterfowl seasons, the earliest
of which generally commence on or about October 1, 1994. The effects of this final rule are to facilitate the selection
of hunting seasons by the States to further the annual establishment of the late-season migratory bird hunting regulations.
State selections will be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 as amendments to &sect;&sect;20.104 through 20.107 and &sect;20.109 of title 50 CFR part 20.

On April 7, 1994, the Service published for public comment in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 16762) a proposal to amend 50 CFR part 20, with comment periods ending July 21 for early-season proposals and
September 2 for late-season proposals. The deadline for late-season proposals was subsequently extended to September
9 in the September 7 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 46320). These regulations would be proposed for certain designated members of the avian families Anatidae
(ducks, geese, and swans); Columbidae (doves and pigeons), Gruidae (cranes); Rallidae (rails, coots, moorhens,
and gallinules); and Scolopacidae (woodcock and snipe). These species are designated as ``migratory game birds''
in conventions between the United States and several foreign nations for the protection and management of these birds.
All other birds designated as migratory (under 10.13 of Subpart B of 50 CFR Part 10) in the aforementioned conventions
may not be hunted. On June 8, 1994, the Service published for public comment a second document (59 FR 29700) which provided
supplemental proposals for early- and late-season migratory bird hunting regulations frameworks. On June 23, 1994,
a public hearing was held in Washington, DC, as announced in the April 7 and June 8 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, to review the status of migratory shore and upland game birds. Proposed hunting regulations were discussed for these
species and for other early seasons. On July 12, 1993, the Service published in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(59 FR 35566) a third document in the series of proposed, supplemental, and final rulemaking documents which dealt
specifically with proposed early-season frameworks for the 1994&hyph;95 season. On August 4, 1994, a public hearing
was held in Washington, DC, as announced in the April 7, June 8, and July 12 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

, to review the status of waterfowl. Proposed hunting regulations were discussed for these late seasons. On August
17, 1994, the Service published a fourth document (59 FR 42474) containing final frameworks for early migratory bird
hunting seasons from which wildlife conservation agency officials from the States, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands
selected early-season hunting dates, hours, areas, and limits for 1994&hyph;95. The fifth document in the series,
published August 24, 1994 (59 FR 43684), dealt specifically with proposed frameworks for the 1994&hyph;95 late-season

 Dr. Rollin Sparrowe, Mr. Brian Cavey, Mr. Bruce Barbour, Mr. K. L. Cool, and Mr. Scott Sutherland expressed optimism
for the recovery of duck populations this year due to the return of good water and improved upland habitat conditions.
They noted that a variety of circumstances likely contributed to this improvement but praised the Conservation Reserve
Program (CRP) and the cooperative efforts of private landowners, State and Federal wildlife agencies, and conservation
organizations for having played a significant role. However, Mr. Sutherland stated that several species, including
the mallard, black duck, pintail, American wigeon, blue-winged teal, canvasback, and scaup are still below the North
American Waterfowl Management Plan goals. He stressed the need to expand and improve population surveys and banding
program databases which would allow the development of refined regional and flyway management plans.

 The California Waterfowl Association urged the Service to consider the link between hunting opportunities and hunter
support of habitat programs when formulating regulations. They believe that the current sizes of waterfowl populations
justify a relaxation of restrictions.

An individual from California requested that waterfowl harvests be managed on a flyway basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dr. Robert McLandress, Director of the Waterfowl and Wetland Program of the California Waterfowl Association, expressed
his concern for the 65 percent decrease in California waterfowl hunters during the past two decades and the impact
of such losses on wetland habitat preservation and maintenance. He noted that the number of California waterfowl
hunters was more highly correlated with pintail harvests and pintail breeding populations than with harvests and
populations of other ducks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Walter R. Sikes, representing the California Waterfowl Association, noted that 1994 would be the second year
of good production for Pacific Flyway duck populations which should provide relief to the existing regulations restrictions.
He commented that reduced waterfowl populations and hunting opportunities had discouraged support for habitat
restoration efforts in California; but nonetheless, California waterfowlers have spent millions of dollars on
waterfowl habitat improvement programs in that State. He further indicated that historical data supported relaxation
of regulations, noting that during years with similar duck populations, seasons were 31 percent longer, bag limits
were 75 percent higher, and hunter numbers were at least 35 percent greater than in 1993.

The Fund for Animals expressed concern that many States are establishing late-season migratory bird hunting dates
prior to the publication of the final frameworks by the Service. They contend that such premature action by State agencies,
regardless of the time constraint the agencies may face, conflict with the notice and comment requirements of the
Administrative Procedures Act. The purpose of publishing the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 proposed rulemaking document and allowing a subsequent comment period is to provide opportunity for interested
parties to submit data and facts and to present their views. They maintain that this scenario places the Service in
a difficult situation and compromises its ability to make changes. As a result, they believe that the Service does
not seriously consider comments received and thus does not involve the public in the decision-making process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation expressed concern regarding the timing of the process
required to establish final frameworks for setting migratory game bird regulations and asked that the Service modify
the administrative process. They suggested that regulations should be finalized a month earlier in order to establish
season dates and provide information to hunters in an orderly and timely manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Humane Society of the United States (hereinafter the Humane Society) expressed concern that the public was not
well represented in the regulations-establishment process. They requested establishment of a system directly
involving the non-hunting public. They also requested that the Service undertake efforts to obtain population estimates
for all hunted species.

 When the preliminary proposed rulemaking document was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on April 7, 1994, the Service announced the comment periods for the early-season and late-season proposals and gave
notice that the process of promulgating hunting regulations ``must, by its nature, operate under time constraints''.
Ample time must be given to gather and interpret survey data, consider recommendations and develop proposals, and
to receive public comment. Scheduled dates are set to give the greatest possible opportunity for public input. If
States do take action to establish their seasons prior to the final decisions on the frameworks, they risk having to
withdraw and modify those actions. The Service is obligated to, and does, give serious consideration to all information
received as public comment. The Service has long recognized the problems associated with the length of time necessary
to establish the final frameworks, and in conjunction with States, Flyway Councils, and the public, continues to
seek new ways to streamline and improve the regulatory process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding population estimates, the long-term objectives of the Service include providing opportunities to harvest
portions of certain migratory game bird populations and to limit harvests to levels compatible with each population's
ability to maintain healthy, viable numbers. Annually, the status of populations are evaluated and the potential
impacts of hunting are considered. The Service believes that hunting seasons are consistent with the current status
of waterfowl populations and long-term population goals.

Public-Hearing Comments:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Dr. Rollin Sparrowe indicated that while a recovery of duck populations appears to be underway, a single year does
not represent an upward trend. He noted that some liberalization may be warranted this year, but added that the major
question was how much and how fast should these liberalizations be implemented. Mr. Bruce Barbour advised a cautious
restraint and suggested that our goal should be to return as many breeding pairs as possible next spring to take full
advantage of the likely excellent nesting conditions. Mr. Walter Sikes and Mr. Brian Cavey commented that with the
increased breeding populations and improved fall flight of ducks, some liberalization in the hunting regulations
was justified this year. Tim Petrie believed that Wisconsin hunters were deserving of additional hunting opportunities
because of their support and participation in habitat programs. Mr. Walter Sikes accused the Service of imposing
restrictions based on a trend towards continental waterfowl management and a desire to simplify regulations. He
believed such restrictions were unnecessary on healthy populations and inconsistent with the status of populations
and habitat conditions within a flyway.

 The Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries expressed their dissatisfaction with the decision by the Service
to offer an option package on duck seasons this year. They indicated that most optional regulations regarding waterfowl
hunting were abandoned years ago.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission commented that regulations changes should ideally result in measurable
responses to those changes and that ``tinkering'' should be avoided. They maintained that the hybrid option proposed
by the Service this year will further complicate evaluations and impede our capabilities to learn about the effects
of those regulation changes.

The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department was critical of the regulations-development process this year and questioned
the partnership between the Service, States, and Flyway Councils. They indicated that certain perceptions or politics
were driving the decision process rather than constructive compromise based on sound biology. They advocated the
need for greater focus on population biology, current and projected habitat conditions, and concerns of those who
still hunt ducks. They believe this will build the base of knowledge on which sound decisions should be made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Central Flyway Council commented that the Service's proposal of one additional bird or 10 additional days was
overly conservative, penalized hunters, and was inconsistent with our biological knowledge. They stated that it
appeared as if biologically-based action had been overridden by risk-aversive conservatism and clearly amounted
to ``tinkering'', which would impede learning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Delta Waterfowl Foundation expressed concern that the increase in the spring population survey represented
a redistribution of ducks from unsurveyed areas, and raised concerns about the reliability of short-term population
projections in justifying significant changes in harvest strategies. Given the fact that 1994 was only the first
year of good production and considering the uncertain variability in the fall-flight index, they maintained that
a conservative framework was justified. They further recommended allowing populations to rebuild during these
potentially short-lived years of good cover and water conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federation of State Waterfowl Associations expressed concern that the Service was moving towards a continental
waterfowl-management approach and a simplification of regulations rather than using the flyway concept to tailor
regulations to specific populations and to promote habitat management.

Service Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 During most of the past decade, drought conditions on the principal duck breeding grounds have resulted in depressed
duck populations, with numbers of some species reaching all-time lows. This situation necessitated restrictions
in hunting regulations to reduce harvest rates commensurate with the status of ducks. This year, habitat conditions
were much improved and breeding-population indices for many duck species and fall-flight indices for both mallards
and all ducks combined increased substantially. Further, the continuation of good habitat conditions into mid-summer
this year increases the likelihood that breeding habitat conditions may again be favorable for good production in
1995.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of the increases observed in breeding-population and production surveys this year, the Service believed
that some relaxation of the harvest restrictions that have been in place in recent years was warranted. The question
was how much relaxation should occur in this first year of improvement. Several alternatives were available, including:
(1) to continue harvest restraints one more year by making little or no change in regulations in an attempt to provide
maximum population growth and potentially be in a better position to capitalize, in terms of duck production, on the
prospects for good habitat conditions next year, or (2) to increase harvest opportunity to a greater extent this year
and have a lesser chance for continued growth in duck populations. The Service felt that the first alternative offered
the greatest opportunity for long-term benefit for both duck populations and harvest opportunity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Flyway Councils felt that more liberalization in the hunting regulations was justified and recommended increases
in both season length and bag limits for the duck season. In the Service's view, these changes would significantly
increase harvests and were more in line with the second alternative identified above. Consequently, the Service
opted for increases in bag limits similar to those recommended by the Councils, but preferred to retain last year's
season lengths. The Service felt that this approach would provide additional harvest opportunity for hunters but
would have a lesser impact on overall harvest than longer seasons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the public hearing for late-season regulations on August 4, 1994, in Washington, DC, the Service proposed duck-season
frameworks consisting of the same season length as last year and an increase of one bird in the overall daily bag limit.
In response to numerous comments received after the public hearing, the proposed frameworks published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on August 24, 1994, were changed to include an option for States to select either the same season length as last year
with a larger bag limit or a season length 10 days longer than last year with essentially the same bag limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service recognizes the wide divergence of views concerning an appropriate harvest strategy for ducks during
this first year of significant improvement in the status of ducks. However, 1 year of significant growth does not constitute
a full recovery and several years of growth are needed to rebuild the principal stocks in the surveyed area that were
depressed during the 1980s. The Service remains committed to this goal and believes that in order to reach these desired
population levels, we must take full advantage of the much-improved habitat conditions and prudently manage harvest
rates. The Service welcomes this challenge and asks that States, Flyway Councils, hunters and the general public
join in this effort. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In regard to shooting hours, the Service has received considerable support for the proposed shooting hours. The Service
has compiled information which demonstrates that shooting hours beginning at one-half hour before sunrise do not
contribute significantly to the harvest of nontarget species. Consistent with the Service's long-term strategy
for shooting hours, published in the September 21, 1990, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

The Upper-Region and Lower-Region Regulations Committees of the Mississippi Flyway Council recommended framework

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Pacific Flyway Council recommended outside season dates of the Saturday nearest October 1 to the Sunday nearest
January 20. Floating framework dates are recommended because (1) the flyway has traditionally been offered Saturday
openings and Sunday closing for most migratory game birds, (2) fixed calendar dates will further restrict hunting
opportunity in those States that traditionally open hunting on Saturday and close on Sunday, (3) departure from this
traditional format will be confusing and unnecessarily restrictive, (4) there are no biological consequences to
floating frameworks since we are dealing with only plus or minus 3 days in opening and closing dates, (5) a Saturday
opening allows participation by school-age hunters and those that have a traditional work week, (6) there are no biological
or political justifications which warrant a change from previous outside framework dates.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The use of floating framework dates automatically allows earliest opening and latest closing dates to vary by almost
a full week over a period of years. These kinds of annual variations tend to confound assessment of the impact of hunting
regulations on duck populations. As the Service has previously stated in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 50190), a State may choose to delay its opening date to correspond with a particular day of the week or to close
earlier to maximize the number of weekends that hunting is allowed. Regarding the consideration of framework dates
as ``basic'' rather than ``annual'' regulations, the Service has previously stated its policy to retain the use of
framework dates as a harvest-management tool.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 At the public hearing for late-season regulations on August 4, 1994, in Washington, DC, the Service proposed duck-season
frameworks consisting of the same season length as last year and an increase of 1 bird in the daily bag limit. In response
to numerous comments received after the public hearing, the proposed frameworks published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on August 24, 1994, included an option for States to select either the same season length as last year with a larger daily
bag limit or a season length 10 days longer than last year with essentially the same bag limits as last year. Recommendations
from Flyway Councils and numerous comments included increases in both season length and daily bag limits; however,
the Service believes that increasing both season length and daily bag limits for ducks is not appropriate this first
year of substantial improvement in the status of ducks. Therefore, the frameworks herein contain the same options

 The Atlantic Flyway Council recommended a 4-bird daily bag limit for the regular duck season, which would include
no more than 1 canvasback, 1 black duck, 1 pintail; 2 wood ducks, 2 redheads; and 3 mallards (of which only 1 could be a
hen).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Central Flyway Council requested that the Service review its policy for the use of the point-system bag-limit
option that requires that it be no more liberal than the conventional bag limit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Central Flyway Council recommended that with respect to duck, coot and merganser hunting regulations, States
selecting the High Plains Mallard Management Unit season option of additional late hunting opportunity may select
either the point system or the conventional bag limit for establishing daily possession limits in the entire State.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Central Flyway Council recommended that for those States where the daily bag and possession limits are established
by the conventional bag limit, the daily bag would be 4 birds with species and sex restrictions as follows: hen mallard,
pintail, redhead, mottled duck, and canvasback, 1 bird; wood duck, 2 birds; all other species and sexes not mentioned
above, 4 birds. The possession limit would be twice the daily bag limit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Central Flyway Council recommended that for those States where the daily bag and possession limits are established

pintail, hooded merganser and mottled duck, 100 points each; wood duck, 50 points each; mallard drake, gadwall, wigeon,
green-winged teal, blue-winged teal, cinnamon teal, shoveler, whistling duck, common and red-breasted merganser,
20 points each; all other species and sexes of ducks, 35 points each. The possession limit under the point system would
be the maximum number of birds that legally could be taken in 2 days.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Upper-Region and Lower-Region Regulations Committees of the Mississippi Flyway Council requested that the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Upper-Region and Lower-Region Regulations Committees of the Mississippi Flyway Council recommended that the
overall duck bag limit be increased from 3 to 4, that the number of male mallards allowed be increased from 2 to 3, and
that 1 canvasback be allowed daily. The Lower-Region Regulations Committee also recommended a restriction of 3 mottled
ducks in the 4-bird daily limit. Other species/sex restrictions would be the same as last year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The Pacific Flyway Council recommended that the Service: (1) review its current point-system policy, (2) work with
both Pacific and Central Flyway Technical Committees to interpret available data, and (3) consider all available
new information and evaluate the point system against other bag-limit systems. The Council also recommended a daily
bag limit of 5 ducks, including no more than 4 mallards (only 1 of which may be a hen), 2 pintails (only 1 of which may be
a hen), 2 redheads, and 1 canvasback.

Dr. Robert McLandress presented historical information on regulations and harvests of pintails and believed that
an increase in the pintail daily bag limit to at least 3 birds was warranted and would provide much-needed encouragement
for hunters and habitat management in California. He believed bag-limit restrictions for mallards in California
were inappropriate given evidence of a preponderance of California-produced mallards in the harvest, consistently
high nesting success and good brood survival. He believed the breeding population decline in California in 1994 was
caused by the elimination of set-aside rice lands, favored by nesting mallards; however, there were significant
increases elsewhere in the State. In addition to increased limits of mallards and pintails, he recommended an addition
of 1 duck to the daily bag limit and 8 additional days.

Service Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Service, with input from the Flyway Councils, completed a comprehensive review of the point system in 1990, and
established a policy that the point system should be restricted to a maximum daily bag no greater than that allowed
under the conventional daily bag limit. In 1994, the Flyway Councils asked the Service to review this policy. The Service's
review was completed in July 1994 and sent to all Flyway Councils. The 1990 review indicated that (1) there was little
evidence that the point system was more effective than the conventional bag at redirecting harvest (2) major problems
remained with determining appropriate species- and sex-specific point values (3) species closures eliminated
the bird-in-hand identification advantage of the point system (4) reordering of point values in the field was an incentive
under the point system and enforceability remained a major concern and (5) most problems with the point system were
in application and not concept.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the 1994 review, the Service considered additional information that has been gathered since the 1990 review, and
concluded that the point-system alternative to the conventional bag limit should be discontinued. Over the years,
the Flyway Councils and States have had substantial opportunity to provide input into the review of scientific studies
and analysis of this information. The completion of the 1990 and 1994 reviews and the decision to discontinue the point
system have considered input from all entities. The Service has worked with the Flyway Councils on this issue several
times in an effort to resolve differences.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Three of the four Flyway Councils recommended retaining the 1-pintail limit. Pintail breeding populations have
not increased above levels of the mid-1980s, when major restrictions were first implemented, and winter population
indices for the pintail in the Pacific Flyway remain at record low levels. While the production outlook has improved
over the last 2 nesting seasons, the Service believes that, until more evidence of a sustained recovery is available,
additional liberalization of the pintail in the daily bag limit is not warranted.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Pacific Flyway Council recommended continuation of the Southern San Joaquin Valley Waterfowl Zone in California
in 1994 and that this zone be made permanent. About 3,500 acres of Tulare Basin wetlands are managed as duck clubs, compared
to about 5,000 acres of managed wetlands in 1971. About 200 additional acres of wetlands had been flooded for waterfowl
and other wetland-dependent wildlife in response to the creation of the zone. During 1991&hyph;93, this zone has
allowed for a month delay in the opening date from the surrounding Balance-of-the-State and Southern California
zones. This delay allows private wetland owners to take advantage of reduced electric pumping rates which become
effective November 1, as well as reduced evapotranspiration rates which occur as temperatures decline. This results
in an approximate 20 percent reduction in the cost of flooding. Any reductions in water cost provide an incentive for
the continued flooding of private wetlands. The situation is not relieved by improvements in rainfall, because although
surface water availability improves somewhat, ground water pumping costs are still high.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Establishment of the zone has not affected harvest. Estimated harvest of ducks from Kern, Kings and Tulare Counties
constituted between 3.0 and 5.6 percent of the Statewide harvest in the periods 1961&hyph;1990. Since implementation
of the zone in 1991, 2.5 percent of the State duck harvest has occurred in the zone. Pintail harvest in the zone declined
from a high of 4.5 percent of the State harvest to 2.5 percent.

Mr. Boyd Gibbons, Director, California Department of Fish and Game, provided information on wetland habitat and
waterfowl harvests in the Southern San Joaquin Valley Duck Zone and requested that the temporary zone be made permanent.
Twenty percent of the remaining Tulare Basin wetlands are managed as private clubs, with most relying on costly, pumped
groundwater. Allowing this zone to set a late, straight season which typically differs from adjacent zones would
allow clubs to flood later when evaporative rates were lower and pumping costs significantly reduced. Estimated
harvests of pintails and total ducks during 2 years with the zone (1991&hyph;92) were 16 percent less and 5 percent
more, respectively, than during the 2 years prior (1989&hyph;90).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Service acknowledges that the Southern San Joaquin Valley Zone in California appears to provide economic incentives
for maintaining privately-managed wetlands, especially during recent years when season lengths have been relatively
short. The Service will allow this zone to continue on a temporary basis for this year. With longer seasons, such as
currently offered as an option to larger limits, the necessity and advantages for such a zone diminish. Regarding
comments about zoning in Massachusetts and Texas, current zoning arrangements will continue until 1996, at which
time States will have the opportunity to modify zone configurations in accordance with Service guidelines previously
established. In reference to split seasons in Minnesota, the State has the option to change from 3-way splits to continuous
seasons or 2-way splits if it wishes to do so.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Service concurs with recommendations to open the hunting season on canvasbacks during the 1994&hyph;95 season.
Based on current population levels, expected production, and projected harvest estimates, the Service believes
that a season in all Flyways with a 1-bird daily bag limit is warranted. Area closures designed to protect key migrational
and wintering concentrations from heavy harvest pressure and to reduce enforcement problems are not being considered
at this time, but, some States may opt to close local areas that are problematic. The Service is aware of the high harvest
potential for this species and will closely monitor this season's canvasback harvest and the population status next
spring. As an interim strategy, the Service will annually assess several population parameters to manage future
harvests of canvasbacks.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Service concurs with the expanded season frameworks on resident geese in South Carolina, the addition of an experimental
season in New Jersey, and discontinuing the season in Long Island. The Service asks that evaluations of these seasons
continue in accordance with the criteria that have been established. These criteria are subject to periodic review
and may be modified upon agreement and consensus of the Service and Flyway Councils. The Service will request input
from the other Flyways regarding expanding from 1 to 2 years the data&hyph;collection period required prior to proposal
submission for a late special season. The Service requests that Minnesota provide a biological rational for their
contention that migrant geese harvested in metropolitan areas during special goose season not be subject to the special
Canada goose season criteria. The Service also notes that Minnesota has the option of not extending their special
season 2 days and thus avoiding further evaluation if, in their judgement, such an extension does not warrant the additional
evaluation costs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Pacific Flyway Council recommended allowing cackling Canada geese to be taken outside their normal range in California,
Oregon, and Washington as part of the prevailing limit on Canada geese. Within their normal range, the Council recommended
that the bag limit include not more than 1 cackling Canada goose. The 1-cackler limit would apply to the Southwestern
Washington Goose Quota Area, all of Oregon, and a majority of California where the season would be concurrent with
the restricted white-fronted goose season.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Pacific Flyway Council also recommended that for Oregon, the Malheur County Zone be incorporated into a Harney,
Klamath, Lake, and Malheur Counties Zone, thereby allowing the season on dark geese to end on the Saturday nearest
January 20 instead of the first Sunday in January. The dark goose limit would be increased from 3 to 4, including not
more than 2 whitefronts. The adjacent Southwestern Zone in Idaho would be permitted frameworks similar to those recommended

 The Delaware Division of Fish and Wildlife requested that the Service review the Federal frameworks for hunting Canada
geese on the DelMarva Peninsula. They believe that the existing frameworks are more liberal than can be justified
based on the size of the population. They maintained that high harvest rates on adult birds are suppressing the population
and preventing a recovery. During the 1993&hyph;94 hunting season, Delaware voluntarily restricted their seasons,
but because these Canada goose populations move about the Peninsula, they believe that harvest pressure should be
reviewed in parts of Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia and appropriate action taken to reduce harvest and protect
these migrant Canada geese.

 The Service generally concurs with recommendations from the Flyway Councils for the 1994&hyph;95 frameworks. However,
the Service does not endorse 3-way splits for Canada goose seasons at this time. The use of 3-way splits as a harvest-management
tool may have merit, but a more detailed proposal, including plans for a Flyway-wide evaluation and projections of
potential impacts, should be prepared prior to implementing such a change. The Service is willing to work with the
Mississippi Flyway Council to investigate the desirability of this option during the coming year.

In reference to season frameworks for the Delmarva Peninsula, the Service believes that a departure from the Flyway

Council Recommendations:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Central Flyway Council recommended that the experimental tundra swan season in North Dakota be granted an additional
year of experimental status with a final report due on June 1, 1995.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Pacific Flyway Council recommended that the number of permits in Utah authorizing the take of 1 tundra swan per
season be increased from 2,500 to 2,800 to compensate for lost hunting opportunity from a State-imposed early season
closure. As an informational item, the Council recommended that Montana, Nevada, and Utah implement a monitoring
program to assess the number of trumpeter swans, if any, taken accidentally during the tundra swan season. The Council
also recommended that Utah be more restrictive than the Federal frameworks by ending its season on or before December
15 and closing the Green River Area to swan hunting. The 3-year-average midwinter population index of 79,406 tundra
swans is well above the Flyway objective level of 38,000. Proposed frameworks will result in harvest levels within
those prescribed in the 1989 Tundra Swan Hunt Plan endorsed by the Pacific Flyway Council. The changes are premised
on the implementation of the State-Federal cooperative program for hazing trumpeter swans from winter concentration
areas near Harriman State Park in Idaho to more favorable sites.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Dr. Gary Will reemphasized the Council's support for restrictions on tundra swan hunting in portions of the Pacific
Flyway to minimize the accidental take of trumpeter swans and encouraged the Service to continue to cooperate with
the Council and participating States in the management of the Rocky Mountain Population (RMP) of trumpeter swans.
He recommended that a reasonable harvest of tundra swans be continued while also accommodating the range expansion
of trumpeter swans to resolve winter bottleneck problems in southeastern Idaho.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Mr. D. C. Carlton, representing the Biodiversity Legal Foundation (Foundation), commented on the management of
the RMP of trumpeter swans. He detailed the status and perceived threats to these swans, reviewed past and current
management actions, and concluded that leadership, actions, and funding by the Service are inadequate to assure
the population's recovery and believes they warrant listing under the Endangered Species Act. Among many recommendations
directed at improving the effectiveness of range-expansion efforts directed at benefiting these swans, those germane
to hunting regulations included: (1) not allowing either a permitted or incidental take of trumpeter swans during
a tundra swan season, (2) having no open seasons for hunting tundra swans in the most critical trumpeter swan range-expansion
areas, including all of Utah and Nevada, (3) modifying hunting regulations on National Wildlife Refuges in Montana,
Utah, and Nevada to provide sanctuary for resting, reproduction, and rearing of cygnets, and (4) ending waterfowl
hunting after October 20 at two sites on the Snake River in Idaho, at a site on the Green River, including Seedskadee
National Wildlife Refuge in Wyoming, and in unspecified areas within the Tristate Yellowstone region.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ms. Heidi Prescott, on behalf of The Fund for Animals, Inc., highlighted recent survey reports, reviewed portions
of the Pacific Flyway Council's management plan and a report by Ms. Ruth Shea, a Service employee, and presented the
group's views regarding management action pertaining to RMP trumpeter swans. The Fund for Animals, Inc., concurred
with the recommendations of the Foundation pertaining to migratory game bird hunting contained in the aforementioned
letter from Mr. D. C. Carlton of the Foundation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. D. J. Schubert, also on behalf of the Fund for Animals, Inc., reiterated certain concerns and needed actions deemed
necessary for successful range expansion of RMP trumpeter swans. He believed that a mandatory check of swans taken
by hunters in Utah and Nevada is necessary to measure the level of accidental take. While the purposeful hazing of trumpeter
swans to more favorable winter sites has merit, it put more trumpeter swans at risk in tundra swan hunt areas; and he
therefore recommended a new management strategy. The Fund for Animals believes there are two possible management
strategy changes that would minimize excessive killing of trumpeter swans and still be consistent with the Migratory
Bird Treaty Act: (1) prohibit hunting of tundra swans in Utah and Nevada; or, although less preferred, (2) prohibit
hunting in certain critical areas in Utah. Under both options, security areas should be established in Idaho, and
recreational activities such as waterfowl hunting and boating should be evaluated for possible negative impacts
on trumpeter swan behavior and habitat use. Should intensive hazing be pursued to disperse birds to more favorable
wintering sites, and if law enforcement policy is to be changed to facilitate the collection of information on the
accidental take of trumpeter swans during the tundra swan season, the Fund for Animals recommended that: (1) both
Idaho and Wyoming Game and Fish Departments provide sanctuaries in designated areas; (2) the Utah Division of Wildlife
Resources, at the maximum, not allow swan hunting or, at the minimum, not allow swan hunting in Box Elder, Cache, and
Rich Counties; (3) the Nevada Division of Wildlife close Stillwater Wildlife Management Area to swan hunting; (4)
the Service close all National Wildlife Refuges in Utah and Nevada to the hunting of tundra swans; and (5) should the
aforenamed States not exercise the recommended action, the Service should do so. Additionally, all States should
enhance their hunter-education programs to emphasize proper identification of swans and waterfowl to minimize
the accidental take of trumpeter swans as a result of other hunting seasons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. D. J. Schubert, in comments representing both The Fund for Animals, Inc., and the Foundation, reiterated and elaborated
upon previous recommendations from those two organizations for curtailing tundra swan hunting and waterfowl hunting
to enhance RMP trumpeter swan winter-range expansion (see above and 59 FR 43691&hyph;43692) and made specific comments
on the proposed frameworks. At a minimum, Mr. Schubert recommends prohibiting tundra swan hunting and restricting
waterfowl hunting on all Federal lands in south-central Montana, southern Idaho, western Wyoming, Utah, and Nevada.
He believes that the Service is negligent in not using to the fullest extent various management provisions afforded
and mandated by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, the National Wildlife Refuge Administration Act, and the Refuge
Recreation Act to protect RMP trumpeter swans. He described the historic RMP trumpeter swan populations, probable
causes for their current restricted winter distribution, and past and current management efforts aimed at restoring
the population; he offered management solutions to restore the population; and he argued in support of a petition
for listing the RMP trumpeter as a threatened species which had been dismissed by the Service. He insists that the Service
is obligated by law to restore the trumpeter swan to its native range. He contends that the Service is operating under
an unpublished policy of nonenforcement of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act with respect to tundra swan hunters who might
accidentally shoot a trumpeter swan. He recanted his previous recommendation for measuring the level of accidental
take, by saying that there was sufficient information to know that it occurred.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Michael Roy, on behalf of the National Wildlife Federation, expressed concern about the successful continuation
of the RMP trumpeter swan range-expansion program, in part because of a perceived ineffective and confusing management
structure that is not adequately represented by all interested parties, and in part by accidental take of trumpeter
swans during tundra swan seasons in Utah. He believes certain recommendations provided by Ms. Ruth Shea, a Service
employee, were reasoned and practical and, if implemented, would enhance range-expansion efforts. Premised on
Ms. Shea's recommendations, he recommended that tundra swan hunting in Utah be discontinued from the southern boundary
of the Bear River National Wildlife Refuge north and east to the Idaho and Wyoming borders for an initial 5-year period.
This closure would be intended to minimize the accidental take of trumpeter swans during translocation activities
and, hopefully, tundra swan hunting could be reinstated afterwards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ms. Louisa Willcox, representing the Greater Yellowstone Coalition, raised questions regarding the Service's
role in managing RMP trumpeter swans and funding efforts to increase their numbers and expand their distribution.
She asked how the Service will monitor the accidental take of trumpeter swans during tundra swan hunting seasons in
Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Utah and what measures will be taken to minimize the potential losses.
She also asked why the Service has not sought establishment of trumpeter swan wintering sites outside the Montana-Idaho-Wyoming
region. She requested that the Service develop a long-term strategy to prevent wintering waterfowl, including trumpeter
swans, from damaging vegetation and fish habitat at Harriman State Park in Idaho.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Humane Society recommended that all tundra swan seasons be closed.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Service Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Service concurs with the recommendation to extend the experimental tundra swan season in North Dakota one additional
year, with a final report due by June 1, 1995.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In conjunction with a larger Federal-State-Flyway effort to enhance and monitor both winter and summer distribution
of RMP trumpeter swans, the Service believes that modification of tundra swan hunting seasons in the Pacific Flyway
portion of Montana, in Utah, and in Nevada is warranted to minimize the accidental killing of trumpeter swans by tundra
swan hunters. Accordingly, final frameworks require: (1) States to collect and report information on the accidental
take of trumpeter swans in conjunction with tundra swan seasons, and (2) in Utah, the season must end on or before December
15 and four counties would be closed to swan hunting. The Pacific Flyway Council's request for additional permits
to compensate for lost hunting opportunities in Utah is not without merit from the standpoint of tundra swan management;
however, the Service denied the Council's request and believes a conservative approach is warranted because of the
possibility of trumpeter swans moving into the general hunting area. Further, there has been no change in either policy
or law regarding enforcement of migratory game bird hunting regulations as they apply to the illegal take of trumpeter
swans. Monitoring of the winter distribution of trumpeter swans will provide the Service with additional opportunities
to further modify hunt programs if warranted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Trumpeter swans are expected to number about 17,000&hyph;20,000 individuals during the next range-wide survey
scheduled for 1995 and have been increasing at about 6 percent per year during 1968&hyph;90 (1990 was the last year
in which a range-wide survey was conducted). Populations such as the RMP warrant additional attention, which the
Service continues to give with considerable assistance from State and other Federal agencies and moral, if not financial,
support from several non-governmental organizations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding closure of all tundra swan seasons, the Service believes that the status of tundra swan populations does
not warrant such closures.

 The Service is not aware of any biological basis for prohibiting hunting on Sundays and therefore neither promotes
nor condones prohibition of Sunday hunting. Sunday-hunting closures are established by State or local law. The Service

In August 1994, the Division of Endangered Species concluded that the proposed action is not likely to jeopardize
the continued existence of listed species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of their critical
habitats. Hunting regulations are designed, among other things, to remove or alleviate chances of conflict between
seasons for migratory game birds and the protection and conservation of endangered and threatened species and their
habitats. The Service's biological opinions resulting from its consultation under Section 7 are considered public
documents and are available for inspection in the Division of Endangered Species and the Office of Migratory Bird
Management.

Regulations Promulgation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The rulemaking process for migratory game bird hunting must, by its nature, operate under severe time constraints.
However, the Service intends that the public be given the greatest possible opportunity to comment on the regulations.
Thus, when the preliminary proposed rulemaking was published, the Service established what it believed were the
longest periods possible for public comment. In doing this, the Service recognized that when the comment period closed,
time would be of the essence. That is, if there were a delay in the effective date of these regulations after this final
rulemaking, the States would have insufficient time to select season dates and limits; to communicate those selections
to the Service; and to establish and publicize the necessary regulations and procedures to implement their decisions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Service, under authority of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (July 3, 1918), as amended, (16 U.S.C. 703&hyph;711),
prescribes final frameworks setting forth the species to be hunted, the daily bag and possession limits, the shooting
hours, the season lengths, the earliest opening and latest closing season dates, and hunting areas, from which State
conservation agency officials may select hunting season dates and other options. Upon receipt of season and option
selections from these officials, the Service will publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a final rulemaking amending 50 CFR part 20 to reflect seasons, limits, and shooting hours for the conterminous United
States for the 1994&hyph;95 season.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service therefore finds that ``good cause'' exists, within the terms of 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3) of the Administrative
Procedure Act, and these frameworks will, therefore, take effect immediately upon publication.
