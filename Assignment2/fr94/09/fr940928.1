SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes to adopt a new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airworthiness directive (AD) that would apply to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
American General Aircraft Corporation (American 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
General) Models AA&hyph;5, AA&hyph;5A, AA&hyph;5B, and AG&hyph;5B 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplanes. The proposed action would require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspecting (one-time) the wing attach shoulder bolts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for fretting, scoring, wear, excessive clearance, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enlarged or elongated mounting holes (known as damage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from hereon), replacing any damaged parts and repairing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any damaged areas, and reporting to the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aviation Administration (FAA) the results of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection. Four reports of wing attach shoulder bolt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failure prompted the proposed action. The actions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wing attach shoulder bolt failure, which could lead to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
structural damage of the wing/fuselage to the point of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failure.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA has received four reports (three in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
England and one in the United States) of wing attach 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shoulder bolt failure on American General Models AA&hyph;5, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AA&hyph;5A, AA&hyph;5B, and AG&hyph;5B airplanes. Investigation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reveals that excessive wing to center spar clearance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could have contributed to the bolt failures; however, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in each of the four instances, the bolts failed prior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to reaching the service life of 7,250 hours time-in- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service (TIS). The FAA has determined that, in order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to assure the safety of these airplanes, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established service life of these bolts needs review.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
American General has issued Critical Service Bulletin SB&hyph;185, dated July 6, 1994, which specifies procedures
for inspecting the wing attach shoulder bolts and the mounting holes in the wing spar and the center section spar on
American General Models AA&hyph;5, AA&hyph;5A, AA&hyph;5B, and AG&hyph;5B airplanes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After examining the circumstances and reviewing all available information related to the incidents described above,
the FAA has determined that, in order to determine whether the established service life of the wing attach shoulder
bolts is adequate, (1) a one-time inspection should be accomplished to reveal the condition of these bolts on the American
General Models AA&hyph;5, AA&hyph;5A, AA&hyph;5B, and AG&hyph;5B airplane fleet; and (2) AD action should be taken
to prevent wing attach shoulder bolt failure, which could lead to structural damage of the wing/fuselage to the point
of failure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop in other American General Models AA&hyph;5,
AA&hyph;5A, AA&hyph;5B, and AG&hyph;5B airplanes of the same type design, the proposed AD would require inspecting
(one-time) the wing attach shoulder bolts for fretting, scoring, wear, excessive clearance, or enlarged or elongated
mounting holes (known as damage from hereon), replacing any damaged parts and repairing any damaged areas, and reporting
to the FAA the results of the inspection. The proposed inspections would be accomplished in accordance with American
General Critical Service Bulletin SB&hyph;185, dated July 6, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA will examine the inspection results and determine whether further rulemaking action is needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 3,700 airplanes in the U.S. registry would be affected by the proposed AD, that it would take
approximately 10 workhours per airplane to accomplish the proposed inspection, and that the average labor rate is
approximately $55 an hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated
to be $2,035,000 ($550 per airplane X 3,700 airplanes). This figure is based upon the assumption that no affected airplane
operator has accomplished the proposed inspection, and does not take into account the cost for replacement if damaged
bolts are found. The FAA has no way of determining the number of bolts that may need to be replaced based upon the results
of the inspections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial
number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation
prepared for this action has been placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket

On August 25, 1994, the FAA published Notice No. 94&hyph;28, ``Suspension of Certain Aircraft Operations From the
Transponder With Automatic Pressure Altitude Reporting Capability Requirement.'' This notice invites comments
on issues related to the reinstatement and modification of the expired Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR)
No. 62, which suspended certain provisions of the regulations that require the installation of use of automatic altitude
reporting (Mode C) transponders.

Because the comment period originally established in Notice 94&hyph;28 would not provide sufficient time for AOPA
to notify its members before the close of the comment period, AOPA forwarded a written request to the FAA for a 45-day
extension of the comment period. This extension would provide the required 45-day lead time for AOPA to publish this
information in its magazine and provide sufficient time for the submission of meaningful comments from its members.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to give all interested persons additional time to be notified of the issues, and submit their specific comments,
the FAA finds that it is in the public interest to extend the comment period. Accordingly, the comment period for Notice
No. 94&hyph;28 is extended to November 25, 1994.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On November 12, 1993 the California Air Resources Board (CARB) submitted a maintenance plan and a request to redesignate
the San Francisco Bay Area ozone nonattainment area from nonattainment to attainment. The ozone nonattainment area
includes the following counties: Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano
(part), and Sonoma (part). Under the Clean Air Act, nonattainment areas may be redesignated to attainment if sufficient
data are available to warrant the redesignation and the area meets the other Clean Air Act redesignation requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In today's action, EPA is proposing to approve the State of California's submittal because it meets the maintenance
plan and redesignation requirements. In addition, EPA is proposing to approve the nitrogen oxides (NO

) Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) exemption petition submitted by the Bay Area Air Quality Management
District (BAAQMD) on April 15, 1994 under section 182(f). Finally, EPA is proposing to expedite the approval of the
annual and peak season 1990 inventory of actual ozone precursor emissions required by section 182(a)(1) by parallel
processing the emissions inventory.

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Clean Air Act, as amended in 1977 (1977 Act) required areas that were designated nonattainment based on a failure
to meet the ozone national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) to develop SIPs with sufficient control measures
to expeditiously attain and maintain the standard. The San Francisco Bay Area was designated under section 107 of
the 1977 Act as nonattainment with respect to the ozone NAAQS on March 3, 1978 (40 CFR 81.305). In accordance with section
110 of the 1977 Act, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) submitted an ozone SIP as required by part D of the 1977
Act on July 25, 1979, which EPA took final action to approve in part, disapprove in part (lack of legal authority and
legislation to implement an inspection and maintenance (I/M) program) and conditionally approve in part (resource
and extension requirements for transportation control measures with respect to part D) on March 19, 1982 (47 FR 11866)
with respect to the requirements of section 110 and part D of the 1977 Act. On July 26, 1983, CARB submitted the legislation
and implementation schedule for an I/M program which EPA fully approved on November 25, 1983 (48 FR 53114). This approval
rescinded EPA's earlier disapproval of the San Francisco Bay Area's SIP. On February 4, 1983, CARB submitted a SIP
revision for the San Francisco Bay Area which projected attainment of the ozone and carbon monoxide NAAQS by 1987.
EPA published final approval of this SIP revision and removed the earlier conditional approval for the San Francisco
Bay Area on December 28, 1983 (48 FR 57130). In its SIP, CARB projected that the San Francisco Bay Area nonattainment
area would attain the ozone standard by 1987. The area failed to attain the standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a May 26, 1988 letter, EPA issued a finding under section 110(a)(2)(H) of the Clean Air Act (the 1988 SIP-Call) that
California's SIP for the San Francisco Bay Area was substantially inadequate to attain and maintain the NAAQS for
ozone and carbon monoxide. This finding called on California to begin a two phase process which would lead to the revision
of the plans. The first phase consisted of updating the emissions inventory, making certain corrections to the area's
existing stationary source rules, and beginning to gather other pertinent data by August 1988. The second phase consisted
of submitting a revised SIP containing changes necessary to attain the NAAQS. On June 13, 1989, EPA notified California
that the deadline for the second phase of this SIP-Call was September 30, 1991.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 15, 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 were enacted. Public Law 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399, codified
at 42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q. The ozone nonattainment designation for the San Francisco Bay Area continued by operation
of law according to section 107(d)(1)(C)(i) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990; furthermore, the area was classified
by operation of law as moderate for ozone under section 181(a)(1). See 56 FR 56694 (Nov. 6, 1991), codified at 40 CFR
81.305. In a September 5, 1991 letter, EPA notified California that earlier deadlines for the SIP-Call were revised
to conform with the requirements of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The BAAQMD more recently has collected ambient monitoring data that show no violations of the ozone NAAQS (See discussion
in Section III.1 below). Accordingly, on November 12, 1993 California requested redesignation of the area to attainment
with respect to the ozone NAAQS and submitted an ozone maintenance SIP for the San Francisco Bay Area. The three co-lead
agencies in the San Francisco Bay Area under section 174 of the Act, the BAAQMD, the Metropolitan Transportation Commission
(MTC), and the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG), delegated authority to the Joint Air Quality Policy Committee
(JAQPC), which is composed of representative board members from the three co-lead agencies, to hold a joint agency
public hearing on the redesignation request and maintenance plan. On August 18, 1993, JAQPC held a public hearing
on the redesignation request and maintenance plan. The plan and redesignation request were subsequently adopted
by the BAAQMD, MTC and ABAG on September 1, 1993, September 22, 1993 and September 16, 1993, respectively, at regularly
scheduled agency board meetings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All SIP submittals to EPA must meet certain minimum administrative and technical criteria as set forth in 40 CFR part
51, appendix V (the ``completeness'' criteria) in order for the Administrator to review and take action on the submittal.
Section 110(k)(1) of the Act describes the mandatory timeframe for EPA's determination of completeness and rulemaking
action on plan submissions. In accordance with section 110(k)(1)(B) of the Act, the San Francisco Bay Area's ozone
redesignation request and maintenance plan was deemed complete by operation of law on May 12, 1994. Thus, the submittal
is considered complete as of November 12, 1993, the date it was submitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 21, 1994, CARB sent a letter to EPA requesting ``parallel processing'' of certain revisions to the San Francisco
Bay Area's ozone maintenance plan and SIP, including new contingency measures in the maintenance plan, a 1990 emissions
inventory, emission statement rule, new source review rule, and amendments to various VOC RACT regulations. The
parallel processing request contained draft copies of the SIP revisions that the BAAQMD will adopt this year. The
parallel processing provision of 40 CFR part 51, appendix V allows EPA to propose action on the draft revisions prior
to submission of the locally adopted SIP revision by the State. At the time of final EPA action, the complete revisions
must be submitted to EPA by the State.

II. Evaluation Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 1990 Amendments revised section 107(d)(1)(E) to provide five specific requirements that an area must meet in
order to be redesignated from nonattainment to attainment: (1) The area must have attained the applicable NAAQS;
(2) the area has met all relevant requirements under section 110 and part D of the Act; (3) the area has a fully approved
SIP under section 110(k) of the Act; (4) the air quality improvement must be permanent and enforceable; and, (5) the
area must have a fully approved maintenance plan pursuant to section 175A of the Act. Section 107(d)(3)(D) allows
a Governor to initiate the redesignation process for an area to apply for attainment status.

III. Review of State Submittal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The California redesignation request for the San Francisco Bay Area meets the five requirements of section 107(d)(3)(E),
noted above. Following is a brief description of how the State has fulfilled each of these requirements. EPA's technical
support document (TSD) contains a more detailed analysis of the submittal with respect to certain of these evaluation
criteria.

A. The Ozone Standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Attainment of the ozone NAAQS is determined based on the expected number of exceedances in a calendar year. The method
for determining attainment of the ozone NAAQS is contained in 40 CFR 50.9 and appendix H to that section. The simplest
method by which expected exceedances are calculated is by averaging actual exceedances at each monitoring site over
a three year period. An area is in attainment of the standard if this average results in expected exceedances for each
monitoring site of 1.0 or less per calendar year. When a valid daily maximum hourly average value is not available for
each required monitoring day during the year, these missing days must be accounted for when estimating exceedances
for the year. Appendix H provides the formula used to estimate the expected number of exceedances for each year.

B. The BAAQMD Monitoring Data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State of California's request is based on an analysis of quality-assured ozone air quality data which is relevant
to both the maintenance plan and to the redesignation request. This data comes from the BAAQMD State and Local Air Monitoring
Station (SLAMS) network which is comprised of 23 monitoring stations. The request is based on ambient air ozone monitoring
data for calendar years 1990 through 1992. This data clearly shows an expected exceedance rate for the ozone standard
of less than 1.0 per year for 22 of the 23 monitors, including each of the monitors on which the nonattainment designation
was based. The exception is the Alum Rock monitor, discussed below, which is a monitoring site that was established
during the 1992 ozone season. As described below, the Alum Rock monitoring site recorded one exceedance of the ozone
NAAQS in 1992, but EPA believes that due to the circumstances of the timing of the establishment of the site, the best
estimate of the expected exceedance rate for this monitoring site leads to the conclusion that the San Francisco Bay
Area achieved the ozone NAAQS during the 1990&hyph;1992 period.

C. The Alum Rock Monitor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The original Alum Rock monitoring site was located at a fire station in the northeast portion of San Jose. The BAAQMD
lost its lease to this monitoring site in October 1990. Prior to its forced closure, the site had not recorded any exceedances
of the standard since 1987. A new Alum Rock monitoring location was established in August 1992. This monitor recorded
an exceedance of the ozone NAAQS on September 26, 1992. The actual monitored value was 0.125 ppm, the lowest possible
measured value which would be considered an exceedance of the ozone NAAQS.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the site was operated for only five months during 1992, there is a large gap in data for the new site for 1992.
Appendix H contains a formula for estimating the number of exceedances for a year when there is missing data. Normally,
for an established site with two previous years of monitoring data, this number would be added to the number of exceedances
for the two previous years and averaged to yield an expected exceedance per year. However, because the new site was
established at a nearby but different location, it must be considered to be a different site. For this reason, the estimated
exceedances for 1992 cannot be averaged over the three year period from 1990 through 1992. Therefore, while an expected
annual exceedance rate can be calculated for the Alum Rock site, the lack of three complete years of data introduces
uncertainties into the calculation using the formula contained in appendix H. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix H does not explicitly address the situation where a new site starts up and collects data for only a portion
of the calendar year. However, this situation has been addressed in an EPA memorandum, ``Ozone and Carbon Monoxide
Design Value Calculations,'' William Laxton, Director, Technical Support Division, OAQPS, June 18, 1990 (Laxton
memo). The memo recognizes the disincentive created by applying the estimated exceedance calculation for missing
data to new sites. The missing data penalty created by the calculation is designed to encourage prompt repair or replacement
of monitors, rather than to discourage air pollution control agencies from installing new monitoring sites in excess
of the number required by 40 CFR part 58. For this reason, the Laxton memo essentially allows an agency which installs
a new monitoring site to base the estimated exceedance calculation for the initial year on the portion of the year following
start-up of the monitor. Based on the underlying reasoning of the Laxton memo and the fact that there were no exceedances
at any of the 22 established monitoring sites during June, July and August of 1992, EPA calculated expected exceedances
for the new Alum Rock site using data from August 24, 1992, the date on which the new Alum Rock monitoring site was established,
through the end of December 1992. That calculation results in an estimated expected exceedance calculation of 1.0
exceedances for 1992. EPA believes that, in light of the uncertainties attendant to the lack of three full years of
data from the Alum Rock monitor, this calculation represents the ``best estimate'' of the expected exceedance rate
for the Alum Rock monitor in 1992 and leads to the conclusion that, in all likelihood, the San Francisco Bay Area achieved
attainment during the 1990&hyph;1992 period. The lack of any monitored exceedances at any of the other monitors in
the San Francisco Bay Area's extensive SLAMs network during the June-August 1992 period provides additional support
for EPA's belief that this calculation represents the best estimate of expected exceedances at the Alum Rock site.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA notes that monitoring at Alum Rock following the end of 1992 continues to show attainment. This provides further
support for the conclusion that the best estimate of expected exceedances at the Alum Rock site for 1992 is 1.0.

D. Demonstration of Attainment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In sum, while some uncertainty attaches to the monitoring data from the Alum Rock site established in August 1992,
EPA believes that the data submitted by the BAAQMD provides an adequate demonstration that the San Francisco Bay Area
attained the ozone NAAQS during the 1990&hyph;1992 period. Moreover, monitoring data from all sites in the Bay Area
SLAMs network continues to show attainment in 1993 and so far in 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order for EPA to take final action approving the San Francisco Bay Area redesignation request, monitoring data
from all 23 sites in the BAAQMD's SLAMs network must continue to demonstrate attainment up to the time of final action.
Thus, EPA proposes to approve the San Francisco Bay Area redesignation only if the monitoring data from the entire
SLAMs network continues to demonstrate attainment. If the monitoring data records a violation of the NAAQS before
final action is taken on this proposal, the proposed approval of the redesignation will be withdrawn and a proposed
disapproval substituted for the proposed approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the demonstration discussed above, EPA required completion of air network monitoring requirements
set forth in 40 CFR part 58. This included a quality assurance plan revision and a monitoring network review to determine
the adequacy of the ozone monitoring network. The BAAQMD fulfilled these requirements to complete documentation
for the air quality demonstration. The BAAQMD has also committed to continue monitoring in this area in accordance
with 40 CFR part 58. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA agreed with the BAAQMD recommendation in its network review concerning the need for one additional ozone monitor
in the area south of San Jose. As a result, the BAAQMD established an additional State and Local Air Monitoring Site
(SLAMS) at the San Martin site in Santa Clara County in April 1994. EPA will review data from this new monitoring station
as part of its review of the 1994 ozone season.

2. Meeting Applicable Requirements of Section 110 and Part D 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 28, 1983 (48 FR 57130), EPA fully approved California's SIP for the San Francisco Bay Area as meeting the
requirements of section 110(a)(2) and part D of the 1977 Act, with the exception of the I/M program which was approved
on November 25, 1983 (48 FR 53114) and committed to specific implementation schedules for the San Francisco Bay Area.
The amended Act, however, modified section 110(a)(2) and, under part D, revised section 172 and added new requirements
for all nonattainment areas. Therefore, for purposes of redesignation, to meet the requirement that the SIP contain
all applicable requirements under the Act, EPA has reviewed the SIP to ensure that it contains all measures that were
due under the amended Act prior to or at the time the State submitted its redesignation request, as set forth in EPA policy.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 EPA interprets section 107(d)(3)(E)(v) of the Act to mean that, for a redesignation request to be approved, the State
must have met all requirements that applied to the subject area prior to or at the same time as the submission of a complete
redesignation request. Requirements of the Act that come due subsequently continue to be applicable to the area at
later dates (see section 175A(c)) and, if redesignation of any of the areas is disapproved, the State remains obligated
to fulfill those requirements. These requirements are discussed below.

As discussed earlier in this document, all of the SIP requirements must be met by the BAAQMD and approved by EPA into
the SIP prior to final action on the redesignation request. In the event that these requirements are not met, EPA proposes
in the alternative to disapprove the redesignation request. Based on CARB's July 21, 1994 letter to EPA, EPA is ``parallel
processing'' certain SIP revisions in this document (contingency measures and 1990 emission inventory) and will
address the other requirements (VOC RACT regulations, emission statement rule, new source review) in a separate

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 document prior to final action on this revision. EPA's decision to parallel process the locally adopted contingency
measures and 1990 emissions inventory reflect EPA's positive technical and administrative review. An EPA letter
dated August 25, 1994 (Howekamp, EPA, to Boyd, CARB) finds the revised baseyear inventory complete (for parallel
processing purposes) and rescinds the April 13, 1993 finding of incompleteness for the emission inventory. An approvability
review was performed separately by EPA.

A. Section 110 Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although section 110 was amended in 1990, the San Francisco Bay Area SIP meets the requirements of amended section
110(a)(2). A number of the requirements did not change in substance and, therefore, EPA believes that the pre-amendment
SIP met these requirements. As to those requirements that were amended, see 57 FR 27936 and 23939 (June 23, 1993), many
are duplicative of other requirements of the Act. EPA has analyzed the SIP and determined that it is consistent with
the requirements of amended section 110(a)(2). The SIP contains enforceable emission limitations, requires monitoring,
compiling, and analyzing ambient air quality data, requires preconstruction review of new major stationary sources
and major modifications to existing ones, provides for adequate funding, staff, and associated resources necessary
to implement its requirements, and requires stationary source emissions monitoring and reporting.

B. Part D Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before the San Francisco Bay Area may be redesignated to attainment, it also must have fulfilled the applicable requirements
of part D of the Act. Under part D, an area's classification indicates the requirements to which it will be subject.
Subpart 1 of part D sets forth the basic nonattainment requirements applicable to all nonattainment areas, classified
as well as nonclassifiable. Subpart 2 of part D establishes additional requirements for nonattainment areas classified
under table 1 of section 181(a)(1) or table 3 of section 186(a). The San Francisco Bay Area was classified under table
1 of section 181(a)(1) as a moderate ozone nonattainment area (See 56 FR 56694, codified at 40 CFR 81.305). Therefore,
in order to be redesignated to attainment, the State must meet the applicable requirements of subpart 1 of part D_specifically
sections 172(c) and 176, as well as the applicable requirements of subpart 2 of part D. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
B.1. Subpart 1 of part D_Section 172(c) Plan Provisions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 172(b), the Administrator established that States containing nonattainment areas shall submit a
plan or plan revision meeting the applicable requirements of section 172(c) no later than three years after an area
is designated as nonattainment, i.e., unless EPA establishes an earlier date. EPA has determined that the section
172(c)(2) reasonable further progress (RFP) (with parallel requirements for a moderate ozone nonattainment area
under subpart 2 of part D, due November 15, 1993) was not applicable at the time the State of California submitted the
San Francisco Bay Area redesignation request on November 12, 1993. Also, the 172(c)(9) contingency measures and
additional 172(c)(1) non-RACT reasonable available control measures (RACM) beyond what may already be required
in the SIP are no longer necessary, since no earlier date was set for these measures and as RFP was not due until November
15, 1993. As discussed below in section B3., subpart 2 of part D, the BAAQMD is in the process of revising certain VOC
RACT rules to meet the Clean Air Act requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 172(c)(3) emissions inventory requirement has been met by the submission and proposed approval of the 1990 base
year inventory required under subpart 2 of part D, section 182(a)(1).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As for the 172(c)(5) NSR requirement, once an area is redesignated to attainment, this requirement is no longer applicable.
The area then becomes subject to prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) requirements in lieu of the NSR program
(57 FR 13564). Currently, the San Francisco Bay Area is amending its NSR rule to comply with the provisions of the 1990
Clean Air Act amendments. Prior to final action on the redesignation request and maintenance plan, EPA will take final
rulemaking action on the BAAQMD's NSR program with respect to the ozone requirements of sections 182(a)(2)(C) and
182(b)(5) in a separate 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 document. Upon redesignation to attainment, BAAQMD will continue with NSR permitting until such time as BAAQMD requests
delegation of the PSD program for VOC. At that time, the nonattainment area requirements of the BAAQMD's NSR program
will be placed in the contingency plan. See the TSD accompanying this notice for a detailed discussion of the NSR requirements
and deficiencies in the current regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, for purposes of redesignation, the San Francisco Bay Area SIP was reviewed to ensure that all requirements
of section 110(a)(2), containing general SIP elements, under the Act were satisfied. Title 40 CFR 52.220 evidences
that the San Francisco Bay Area SIP was approved under section 110 of the Act, and further that it satisfies all applicable
part D, title I requirements with the exception of the outstanding part D requirements for the ozone SIP, mentioned
above.

B.2. Subpart 1 of Part D_ Section 176 Conformity Plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Provisions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 176(c) of the Act requires States to revise their SIPs to establish criteria and procedures to ensure that
Federal actions, before they are taken, conform to the air quality planning goals in the applicable State SIP. The
requirement to determine conformity applies to transportation plans, programs and projects developed, funded,
or approved under title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Act (``transportation conformity''), as well as to all other
Federal actions (``general conformity''). Section 176 further provides that the conformity revisions to be submitted
by the States must be consistent with Federal conformity regulations that the Act required EPA to promulgate. Congress
provided for the State revisions to be submitted one year after the date for promulgation of final EPA conformity regulations.
When that date passed without such promulgation, EPA's General Preamble for the Implementation of title I informed
the State that its conformity regulations would establish a submittal date (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 57 FR 13498, 13557, (April 16, 1992)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA promulgated final transportation conformity regulations on November 24, 1993 (58 FR 62118) and general conformity
regulations on November 30, 1993 (58 FR 63214). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These conformity rules require that States adopt both transportation and general conformity provisions in the SIP
for areas designated nonattainment or subject to a maintenance plan approved under CAA section 175A. Pursuant to
40 CFR 51.396 of the transportation conformity rule and 40 CFR 51.851 of the general conformity rule, the State of California
is required to submit a SIP revision containing transportation conformity criteria and procedures consistent with
those established in the Federal rule by November 25, 1994. Similarly, California is required to submit a SIP revision
containing general conformity criteria and procedures consistent with those established in the Federal rule by
December 1, 1994. Because the deadlines for these submittals have not yet come due, they are not applicable requirements
under section 107(d)(3)(E)(v) and, thus, do not affect approval of this redesignation request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, the BAAQMD has committed to revise its SIP to be consistent with the final Federal regulations on conformity
by the applicable November 1994 deadlines (see 40 CFR 51.396(a) and 51.851(a), November 24, 1993 (58 FR 62218) and
November 30, 1993 (58 FR 63247), respectively).

B.3. Subpart 2 of Part D_Section 182(a) and 182(b) Requirements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The San Francisco Bay Area is a moderate ozone nonattainment area. Under subpart 2 of part D, such areas must meet the
requirements for marginal areas under section 182(a)(1) as well as the requirements for moderate areas contained
in section 182(b). As discussed in section 2.B.2. above, for purposes of section 107(d)(3)(E)(v), the San Francisco
Bay Area must meet only those requirements of sections 182 (a) and (b) which were due prior to or at the time of the submittal
of a complete redesignation request. The BAAQMD has met the requirements of section 182 with the exception of VOC RACT
rule corrections, the emissions statement rule, and the NSR rule corrections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The CARB submitted a 1990 emissions inventory of ozone precursors as required by section 182(a)(1) on November 12,
1992. On November 18, 1993 the CARB submitted a revised 1990 emissions inventory of ozone precursors which EPA found
incomplete on April 13, 1994 because the emissions inventory had not gone through an adequate public notice and hearing
process. To correct the deficiency, the BAAQMD held a public hearing on July 29, 1994 (which was the maintenance plan
1990 attainment inventory submitted on November 12, 1993) and will submit the appropriate documentation to EPA.
Through this document, EPA also proposes to approve the 1990 emissions inventory as required by section 182(a)(1).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, the BAAQMD is in the process of amending certain VOC RACT regulations required by sections 182(a)(2)(A)
and 182(b)(2) which EPA must fully approve into the SIP prior to final action on the redesignation request and maintenance
plan.

EPA has received all of the VOC RACT rules required by section 182(a), but the rules do not meet all of EPA requirements
for full approval. EPA has met extensively with the BAAQMD to discuss specific revisions to correct RACT deficiencies.
EPA is unable to make a definitive determination on the approvability of these rules until EPA receives and reviews
the formal SIP revision from the CARB.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reductions would not contribute to attainment of the NAAQS, for areas outside the ozone transport region (OTR). Any
person (including a state) may petition EPA to make such a finding. EPA guidance interpreting the section 182(f) exemption
provisions provides that a state may submit an exemption petition based on three consecutive years of air quality
monitoring data showing attainment of the ozone NAAQS.

3. Fully Approved SIP Under Section 110(k) of the Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order for EPA to take final action approving the redesignation request and maintenance plan, the San Francisco
Bay Area must have a fully approved SIP under section 110(k), which also meets the applicable requirements of section
110 and Part D. As discussed in Section 2.A. above, EPA approved numerous provisions of the San Francisco Bay Area SIP
under the pre-amended Act and finds that these provisions meet the requirements of section 110(a)(2). In addition,
EPA will take action on the following SIP revisions prior to taking final action on the redesignation request and maintenance
plan: VOC RACT rules, NSR rule, and the emission statement rule. Also, EPA is proposing to approve the emissions inventory
as required by section 182(a)(1) through this document. Assuming that these SIP revisions meet all requirements
for approval, EPA will undertake rulemaking to approve them. Once EPA approves these revisions, the San Francisco
Bay Area will have fulfilled the requirement to have a fully approved SIP under section 110(k). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed approval of the redesignation request is contingent upon the BAAQMD fulfilling the requirements of
sections 173 and 182 discussed above prior to final rulemaking. In the alternative, if the requirements are not fulfilled,
EPA must disapprove the redesignation request for the San Francisco Bay Area.

4. Improvement in Air Quality Due to Permanent and Enforceable Measures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the pre-amended Act, EPA approved California's SIP control strategy for the San Francisco Bay Area nonattainment
area, satisfied that the rules and the emission reductions achieved as a result of those rules were enforceable. Since
enactment of the amended Act, the State has made additional submittals as identified in section 182(b) above. In addition,
EPA finds that the measures listed below contribute to the permanence and enforceability of reductions in ambient
ozone levels in the San Francisco Bay Area.

The actual reduction in VOC emissions from 1987 to 1990 was 61 TPD which reflects growth in emissions from some sources
and reductions in emissions due to all control measures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In association with its emission inventory discussed in Section 5.A. below, the State demonstrated that point source
VOC emissions were not artificially low due to local economic downturn. The BAAQMD included trend data for vehicle
miles traveled (VMT) and employment in the maintenance plan to demonstrate that attainment was not due to economic
downturn. These trend data indicate that neither VMT growth nor daily VMT actually decreased during the attainment
period. In addition, using employment data as an indicator for stationary source emissions, the BAAQMD demonstrated
a modest decrease during the calendar years 1991 and 1992. The overall effect on the stationary source inventory should
have been less than a 2% reduction, not enough to significantly affect the San Francisco Bay Area's attainment of the
ozone NAAQS. EPA finds that the combination of existing EPA-approved SIP and Federal measures contribute to the permanence
and enforceability of reductions in ambient ozone levels that have allowed the area to attain the NAAQS.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In today's document, EPA is proposing approval of the State's maintenance plan for the San Francisco Bay Area because
EPA finds that the BAAQMD's submittal meets the requirements of section 175A. If EPA determines after public notice
and comment that it should give final approval to the maintenance plan, the San Francisco Bay Area nonattainment area
will have a fully approved maintenance plan in accordance with section 175A. Section 175A of the Act sets forth the
elements of a maintenance plan for areas seeking redesignation from nonattainment to attainment. The plan must demonstrate
continued attainment of the applicable NAAQS for at least ten years after the Administrator approves a redesignation
to attainment. Eight years after the redesignation, the State must submit a revised maintenance plan which demonstrates
attainment for the ten years following the initial ten-year period. To provide for the possibility of future NAAQS
violations, the maintenance plan must contain contingency measures, with a schedule for implementation, adequate
to assure prompt correction of any air quality problems. Each of the section 175A plan requirements is discussed below.

emissions because EPA policy allows States to select any one of the three years in the attainment period as the attainment
year inventory.

CARB originally submitted the annual and peak ozone season 1990 comprehensive inventories of actual emissions as
a SIP revision on November 12, 1992, and revised them in a submission dated November 18, 1993. CARB also submitted the
San Francisco Bay Area's ozone maintenance plan on November 12, 1993 which contained a comprehensive 1990 emission
inventory. EPA policy (September 29, 1992, Calcagni and Laxton) allows the public hearing and adoption of the 1990
base year inventories to occur with the first related regulatory submittal. CARB developed the inventories to meet
the requirements of sections 172(c)(3) and 182(a)(1), in accordance with EPA guidance.

The State submittal contains the detailed inventory data and summaries by county and source category. The BAAQMD
provided the stationary source estimates, based on source test and mass balance computations, as required for annual
permit renewal. The CARB and BAAQMD generated area source emissions for each source category based on emission and
activity factors for each county in the nonattainment area. These factors are cited or their sources referenced in
Methods for Assessing Area Source Emissions in California, California Air Resources Board, September 1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

CARB based on-road mobile source emission and activity estimates on CARB's EMFAC7F and BURDEN7C models, respectively.
Different emission factors and activity rates apply to each type of vehicle, roadway, and road condition. Vehicle
mix and age data from vehicle registration vary within each county. Off-road engine estimates were derived from both
State and local sources, as cited in the area source document, referenced above. The CARB derived VMT estimates from
a mix of the California ``Highway Performance Monitoring System'' (HPMS) and local surveys. Actual, as opposed to
allowable, emission estimates were used for all source categories.

The comprehensive base year emissions inventory discussed above has been entered into the Aerometric Information
Retrieval System (AIRS). AIRS is EPA's computerized data storage system for air quality and emission source data.
EPA, under contract with Radian Corporation, has entered the base year emissions inventory of stationary sources
into AIRS and has also prepared computer software to convert the California Emission Data System stationary source
data to AIRS/AFS format for entry into AIRS. California is responsible for entering 1990 area and mobile source (AMS)
data into AIRS by October 1994, according to a fiscal year 1994 Clean Air Act section 105 air program grant agreement.
EPA's TSD contains a more detailed analysis of the base year inventory for the San Francisco Bay Area.

On April 13, 1994, EPA found the 1990 base year inventory submission incomplete for lack of adequate public notice
and adoption. Instead of adopting the November 12, 1992 and November 18, 1993 base year inventories as submitted by
CARB, the BAAQMD held a public hearing on a revised 1990 base year inventory on July 29, 1994 which was the attainment
inventory submitted as part of the maintenance plan. The State requested parallel processing of this revised emissions
inventory to fulfill section 182(a)(1). Based on the State's parallel processing request and submission of associated
documentation, EPA rescinded the finding of incompleteness in an EPA letter dated August 25, 1994 to CARB (Howekamp,
EPA to Boyd, CARB).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The projected inventories show that the ozone standard will be maintained and that emissions are not expected to exceed
the level of the 1990 inventory during the maintenance period. EPA's TSD contains a detailed analysis of the projected
emission inventories for the San Francisco Bay Area.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Continued attainment of the ozone NAAQS in the San Francisco Bay Area depends, in part, on the State's efforts to track
indicators of continued attainment during the maintenance period. The BAAQMD will analyze annually the three most
recent consecutive years of air quality monitoring data to verify continued attainment of the national ozone standard,
in accordance with 40 CFR part 50, appendix H. The BAAQMD will submit to EPA an annual report by July 1 of each year for
data collected from the previous calendar year. This information in conjunction with the reports from the previous
two years will provide adequate information for determining continued compliance with the ozone NAAQS. The BAAQMD
has chosen a violation of the NAAQS as the trigger for the contingency plan.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions in the San Francisco Bay Area will largely determine its ability to stay in compliance with the ozone NAAQS
in the future. Despite best efforts to demonstrate continued compliance with the NAAQS, the ambient air pollutant
concentrations may exceed or violate the NAAQS. Therefore, as required pursuant to section 175A, the BAAQMD has provided
contingency measures with a schedule for implementation in the event of a future ozone air quality problem. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the time of local adoption of the redesignation request and maintenance plan, the BAAQMD identified the enhanced
vehicle inspection and maintenance program (I/M), required for serious and above ozone nonattainment areas, as
the contingency measure which would be triggered in the event of a violation during the maintenance period. Since
that time, the State of California has passed legislation for an enhanced I/M program which restricts the implementation
of the test-only program to nonattainment areas which are required to implement the program under the Clean Air Act.
Thus, BAAQMD is prohibited from opting into the test-only portion of the enhanced I/M program. However, the BAAQMD
has selected new measures to fulfill the contingency plan requirements of section 175A(d) which are discussed below.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 15, 1994, the BAAQMD, MTC, and ABAG sent a letter to the CARB Executive Officer, James Boyd, which committed
to adopt basic improvements to the I/M program and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 control measures as the new contingency provisions for the maintenance plan. In this letter, the BAAQMD, MTC and ABAG,
have proposed to implement the basic improvements to the I/M program beginning in January 1995 in order to ensure continued
maintenance of the NAAQS. The emission reductions associated with this program go beyond the necessary emission
reductions required for maintenance and the reductions are not included in the BAAQMD's projected inventories in
the maintenance plan. These improvements yield approximate emission reductions in the amount of 8 tons per day (TPD)
VOC and 7 TPD NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The early implementation of this contingency provision provides an additional margin of safety for the area in maintaining
the NAAQS. In addition, in the event of a violation during the maintenance period, the BAAQMD will meet with EPA within
30 days following the violation to determine which additional measures would be appropriate to implement. The additional
measures contained in the proposal include numerous NO

At the request of CARB, the changes to the contingency plan are being parallel processed in accordance with 40 CFR part
51, appendix V in order to expedite the approval of the redesignation request and maintenance plan. The BAAQMD, MTC
and ABAG held a public hearing on the new contingency plan on July 29, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The contingency measures proposed by the BAAQMD meet the requirements of section 175A(d) of the Act.

In accordance with section 175A(b) of the Act, the State has agreed to submit a revised maintenance SIP eight years
after the area is redesignated to attainment. Such revised SIP will provide for maintenance for an additional ten
years (See letter dated April 15, 1994 from Milton Feldstein, BAAQMD to James Boyd, CARB attached to the TSD).

IV. Potential Impact of California Federal Implementation Plans and State Implementation Plans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is under court order to promulgate final federal implementation plans (FIPs) for ozone for Los Angeles-South
Coast Air Basin Area, the Sacramento Metro Area, and the Ventura County Area and for carbon monoxide for Los Angeles-South
Coast Air Basin Area by February 15, 1995. EPA discusses the phenomenon of pollutant transport within air basins in
the proposed FIPs (59 FR 23393, May 5, 1994). EPA acknowledges that future modeling analyses could eventually result
in revisions to the FIP, which may impose additional FIP controls for areas not covered by the proposed FIPs, such as
the San Francisco Bay Area, which is upwind of Sacramento. EPA's proposed action to redesignate the San Francisco
Bay Area to an attainment area does not exclude the possibility of future FIP controls in the area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, States are responsible for developing and submitting demonstrations which show that the standard will
be attained by the applicable date for areas where the demonstration of attainment is complicated by transport between
two areas of different classifications (See General Preamble to title I of the Clean Air Act (57 FR 13528, April 16,
1992)). Thus, EPA expects the ozone modeling demonstrations due by November 15, 1994 required by section 182(c)(2)
to address transport and to demonstrate attainment for all areas within California. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A recent report released by CARB, ``Preliminary Assessment of Transport on San Joaquin Valley Ozone,'' discusses
recent simulations to assess the impact of transported emissions in the San Joaquin Valley. It should be noted that
the results discussed in the report are based on an extreme scenario in which anthropogenic emissions for the San Francisco
Bay Area and the Sacramento area are set to zero. In this scenario, the report indicates that there would be a decrease
in ozone measurements of 27% in the Northern San Joaquin Valley, ten percent in the Central San Joaquin Valley and seven
percent in Southern San Joaquin Valley. The results discussed in this report are preliminary. EPA will review the
final report when it is available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is soliciting comment on whether transport has any impact on EPA's proposed redesignation of the San Francisco
Bay Area to attainment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is soliciting public comments on this document and on issues relevant to EPA's proposed action. Comments will
be considered before taking final action. Interested parties may participate in the Federal rulemaking procedure
by submitting written comments to the person and address listed in the ADDRESSES section at the beginning of this notice.

Proposed Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In today's document, EPA proposes to approve the San Francisco Bay Area's ozone maintenance plan because it meets
the requirements of section 175A. In addition, the Agency is proposing approval of the redesignation request for
the ozone nonattainment area, subject to final approval of the maintenance plan and provided the hearing notice and
adoption documentation are submitted for the amendments to the contingency plan, because the State has demonstrated
compliance with the requirements of section 107(d)(3)(E) for redesignation. Finally, EPA proposes to approve the
emissions inventory as meeting the requirements of section 182(a)(1), provided the hearing notice and adoption
documentation are submitted, and the NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 exemption petition which fulfills the requirements of section 182(f). Nothing in this action should be construed
as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. Each request
for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental
factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ozone State implementation plans (SIP's) are designed to satisfy the requirements of part D of the Clean Air Act and
to provide for attainment and maintenance of the ozone NAAQS. This proposed redesignation should not be interpreted
as authorizing the State to delete, alter, or rescind any of the VOC or NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emission limitations and restrictions contained in the approved ozone SIP. Changes to ozone SIP VOC regulations
rendering them less stringent than those contained in the EPA approved plan cannot be made unless a revised plan for
attainment and maintenance is submitted to and approved by EPA. Unauthorized relaxations, deletions, and changes
could result in both a finding of nonimplementation (section 173(b) of the Clean Air Act) and in a SIP deficiency call
made pursuant to section 110(a)(2)(H) of the Clean Air Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any
new requirements, it does not have any economic impact on any small entities. Redesignation of an area to attainment
under section 107(d)(3)(E) of the CAA does not impose any new requirements on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Redesignation is an action that affects the status of a geographical area and does not impose any regulatory requirements
on sources. Accordingly, I certify that the approval of the redesignation request will not have an impact on any small
entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order 12866.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 31, 1990, Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme, Division of Merck &amp; Co. requested that the pesticide petitions be
amended by increasing the proposed tolerances for the RACs tomatoes (PP 9F3703) and celery (PP 8F3649) to 0.01 and
0.05 ppm, respectively, and by deleting the proposed tolerance on wet tomato pomace (9H5570) since there is no distinction
between wet and dry pomace, and the higher proposed feed additive tolerance of 0.07 ppm for tomato pomace is adequate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequent to the initial notices of filing, EPA established import tolerances for residues of abamectin B
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and its delta-8,9 isomer on the RAC fresh tomatoes at 0.01 ppm and established a feed additive regulation for tomato
pomace at 0.07 ppm for tomatoes imported from Mexico. (See the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of December 13, 1991 (56 FR 6503)). Although the tolerance level proposed for tomatoes is the same as that established
in December 13, 1991, that tolerance was limited to fresh tomatoes only. The current proposed tolerance is for all
tomatoes. Since the tolerance level proposed for tomato pomace is the same as that established in December 13, 1991,
FAP 9H5570 is being administratively withdrawn.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data submitted in support of these tolerances and other relevant material have been reviewed. The toxicological
and metabolism data and analytical methods for enforcement purposes considered in support of these tolerances are
discussed in detail in related documents published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of May 31, 1989 (54 FR 23209, cottonseed) and August 2, 1989 (54 FR 31836, citrus).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency used a two-generation rat reproduction study with an uncertainty factor of 300 to establish a Reference
Dose (RfD). The 300-fold uncertainty factor was utilized for (1) inter- and intra-species differences, (2) the extremely
serious nature (pup death) observed in the reproduction study, (3) maternal toxicity (lethality) no-observable-effect
level (NOEL) (0.05 mg/kg/day), and (4) cleft palate in the mouse developmental toxicity study with isomer (NOEL =
0.06 mg/kg/day). Thus, based on a NOEL of 0.12 mg/kg/day from the two-generation rat reproduction and an uncertainty
factor of 300, the RfD is 0.0004 mg/kg/body weight (bwt)/day.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A chronic dietary exposure/risk assessment has been performed for abamectin using the above RfD. Available information
on anticipated residues and 100% crop treated was incorporated into the analysis to estimate the Anticipated Residue
Contribution (ARC). The ARC is generally considered a more realistic estimate than an estimate based on tolerance-level
residues. The ARC from established tolerances and the current action is estimated at 0.000106 mg/kg bwt/day and utilizes
26.5 percent of the RfD for the U.S. population. The ARC for children, aged 1 to 6 years old, and nonnursing infants (subgroups
most highly exposed) utilizes 64.2 and 95.1 percent of the RfD, respectively. Generally speaking, the Agency has
no cause for concern if anticipated residues contribution for all published and proposed tolerances is less than
the RfD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the developmental effects seen in animal studies, the Agency used the mouse teratology study (with a NOEL
of 0.06 mg/kg/day for developmental toxicity for the delta-8,9 isomer) to assess acute dietary exposure and determine
a margin of exposure (MOE) for the overall U.S. population and certain subgroups. Since the toxicological end point
pertains to developmental toxicity, the population group of interest for this analysis is women aged 13 and above,
the subgroup which most closely approximates women of child-bearing age. The MOE is calculated as the ratio of the
NOEL to the exposure. For this analysis, the Agency calculated the MOE for high-end exposures for women ages 13 and
above. The MOE for the high-end exposure is 167. Generally speaking, MOEs greater than 100 for developmental toxicity
are acceptable to the Agency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The metabolism of the chemical in plants and livestock for this use is adequately understood. Any secondary residues
occurring in meat, meat byproducts, or milk will be covered by existing tolerances for those commodities. There is
no reasonable expectation of finite residues in poultry and swine commodities; therefore, no tolerances are necessary
at this time. Adequate analytical methodology (HPLC-Fluorescence Methods) is available for enforcement purposes.
Prior to publication in the Pesticide Analytical Manual, Vol. II, the enforcement methodology is being made available
in the interim to anyone who is interested in pesticide enforcement when requested from: Calvin Furlow, Public Reponse
and Program Resource Branch, Field Operations Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: Rm. 1132, CM #2, 1921

The tolerances established by amending 40 CFR part 180 will be adequate to cover residues in or on celery, strawberries,
and tomatoes. There are presently no actions pending against the continued registration of this chemical. Based
on the information and data considered, the Agency has determined that the tolerances established by amending 40
CFR part 180 will protect the public health. Therefore, tolerances are established as set forth below.

on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector (40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will
be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted shows the following: There is genuine and
substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified by the requestor
would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor, taking into account uncontested
claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner sought by the requestor would
be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).

Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e., Regulatory Impact
Analysis, review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant''
as those actions likely to lead to a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely
and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health
or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant''); (2)
creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or
policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive
Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Dow Chemical Co., 1320 Waldo Ave., Suite 300, Midland, MI 48674, submitted pesticide petition (PP) 4E04371 to EPA
requesting that the Administrator, pursuant to section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA)
(21 U.S.C. 346a(e)), propose to amend 40 CFR part 180 by establishing an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance
for residues of polystyrene (CAS Reg. No. 9003-53-6) when used as an inert ingredient (suspending agent, thickener)
in pesticide formulations applied to growing crops, to raw agricultural commodities after harvest, or to animals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Inert ingredients are all ingredients that are not active ingredients as defined in 40 CFR 153.125, and include, but
are not limited to, the following types of ingredients (except when they have a pesticidal efficacy of their own):
solvents such as alcohols and hydrocarbons; surfactants such as polyoxyethylene polymers and fatty acids; carriers
such as clay and diatomaceous earth; thickeners such as carrageenan and modified cellulose; wetting, spreading,
and dispersing agents; propellents in aerosol dispensers; microencapsulating agents; and emulsifiers. The term
``inert'' is not intended to imply nontoxicity; the ingredient may or may not be chemically active.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have been evaluated. As part of the EPA policy statement
on inert ingredients, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of April 22, 1987 (52 FR 13305), the Agency set forth a list of studies which would generally be used to evaluate the risks
posed by the presence of an inert ingredient in a pesticide formulation. However, where it can be determined without
that data that the inert ingredient will present minimal or no risk, the Agency generally does not require some or all
of the listed studies to rule on the proposed tolerance or exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for an inert
ingredient. The Agency has decided that no data, in addition to that described below, for polystyrene will need to
be submitted. The rationale for this decision is described below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of certain chemical substances that are defined as ``polymers,'' the Agency has established a set of criteria
which identify categories of polymers that present low risk. These criteria (described in 40 CFR 723.250) identify
polymers that are relatively unreactive and stable compared to other chemical substances as well as polymers that
typically are not readily absorbed. These properties generally limit a polymer's ability to cause adverse effects.
In addition, these criteria exclude polymers about which little is known. The Agency believes that polymers meeting
the criteria noted above will present minimal or no risk. Polystyrene conforms to the definition of a polymer given
in 40 CFR 723.250 (b)(11) and meets the following criteria that are used to identify low risk polymers:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The minimum number-average molecular weight of polystyrene is 50,000. Substances with molecular weights greater
than 400 generally are not absorbed through the intact skin, and substances with molecular weights greater than 1,000
generally are not absorbed through the intact gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Chemicals not absorbed through skin
or GI tract generally are incapable of eliciting a toxic response.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Polystyrene is not a cationic polymer, nor is it reasonably anticipated to become a cationic polymer in a natural
aquatic environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Polystyrene does not contain less than 32.0 percent by weight of the atomic element carbon.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Polystyrene contains as an integral part of its composition the atomic elements carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and
oxygen.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Polystyrene does not contain as an integral part of its composition, except as impurities, any elements other than
those listed in 40 CFR 723.250 (d)(3)(ii).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Polystyrene is not a biopolymer, a synthetic equivalent of a biopolymer, or a derivative or a modification of a biopolymer
that is substantially intact.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Polystyrene is not manufactured from reactants containing, other than impurities, halogen atoms or cyano groups.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Polystyrene does not contain a reactive functional group that is intended or reasonably anticipated to undergo
further reaction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Polystyrene is not designed or reasonably anticipated to substantially degrade, decompose, or depolymerize.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the information above and review of its use, EPA has found that, when used in accordance with good agricultural
practice, this ingredient is useful and a tolerance is not necessary to protect the public health. Therefore, EPA
proposes that the exemption from the requirement of a tolerance be established as set forth below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide, under the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) as amended, that contains any of the ingredients listed herein, may request
within 30 days after the publication of this document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 that this rulemaking proposal be referred to an Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e) of the FFDCA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulation. Comments must bear a notation
indicating the document control number [OPP-300359]. All written comments filed in response to this petition will
be available in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch, at the address given above, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday, except legal holidays.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 2 of Executive Order 12866.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have an economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
A certification statement to this effect was published in the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
: In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of March 9, 1994 (59 FR 11122), EPA issued a proposed rule under section 6(a) of the Toxic Substances Control Act to prohibit
the manufacture, processing, and distribution in commerce of certain lead- and zinc-containing fishing sinkers.
Written comments on the proposed rule were to be received on or before May 9, 1994. EPA received requests seeking a 60&hyph;day
extension of the public comment period because of additional time needed to provide EPA with information it requested
in the proposed rule. EPA believed that providing an additional 60&hyph;day comment period to prepare written comments
was reasonable, and extended the comment period until July 8, 1994. The Agency has continued to receive numerous comments
from the public although the public comment period has closed. Therefore, in order to give all interested persons
the opportunity to comment fully, EPA has decided to reopen the public comment period. Written comments must now be
received by EPA on or before November 9, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A person may assert a claim of business confidentiality for any comments submitted to EPA in connection with the proposed
rule. Any person who submits a comment that contains information claimed as confidential, must also submit a nonconfidential
version. Any claim of confidentiality must accompany the information when it is submitted to EPA. Persons may claim
information confidential by circling, bracketing, or underlining it, and marking it with ``CONFIDENTIAL'' or some
other appropriate designation. EPA will disclose information subject to a claim of business confidentiality only
to the extent permitted by section 14 of TSCA and 40 CFR part 2, subpart B. If a person does not assert a claim of confidentiality
for information in comments at the time it is submitted to EPA, the Agency will put the comments in the public docket
without further notice to that person.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, as amended (29 U.S.C. 794), and the Department's implementing regulations
(49 CFR part 28), the Department of Transportation must ensure that individuals with disabilities are not excluded
from or discriminated against under programs or activities that the Department conducts. To comply with the law,
the Department must review its facilities to determine if they meet the program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accessibility standards of Section 504, make modifications, and develop a transition plan for structural changes.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the implementing regulations (49 CFR part 28), the Department is required to provide an opportunity to interested
persons, including individuals with disabilities, DOT employees with disabilities, and organizations representing
individuals with disabilities to participate in the self-evaluation process and development of transition plans
by submitting comments (either oral or written) to the Department of Transportation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To comply with this requirement, the Department is posting two public notices at each facility being evaluated to
request comments from interested persons. A ``Facility Review'' notice requesting comments from interested persons
is posted in the facility fifteen days prior to the scheduled review. A ``Transition Plan'' notice requesting comments
from interested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
persons is posted in the facility for thirty days after the development of a transition plan.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA is extending the comment period on its notice of proposed rulemaking to amend the Freight Car Safety Standards.
The NPRM proposed changing the provisions in 49 CFR Part 215, by making all maintenance-of-way vehicles subject to
the Standards with the exception of stenciled cars not used in revenue service and restricted to a speed of less than
20 miles per hour. The extension is necessary to clarify initial comments received from interested parties.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) on March 10, 1994 (59 FR 11238) to amend its Freight Car Safety
Standards. The Freight Car Safety Standards, at 49 CFR 215.3(c)(3), exclude maintenance-of-way equipment from
the requirements of Part 215, ``if that equipment is not used in revenue service and is stenciled in accordance with
&sect;215.305.'' The proposed amendment would add to the present regulation an additional condition which must
be met before a freight car in maintenance-of-way service can be operated without complying with the Freight Car Safety
Standards: the equipment must be operated at a speed of less than 20 mph. FRA has received comments from the Brotherhood
of Maintenance of Way Employees; The American Short Line Railroad Association; the Brotherhood Railway Carmen Division,
Transportation Communication International Union; the Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range Railway Company; and the
Association of American Railroads (AAR). In light of comments received, particularly from the AAR, FRA is preparing
a request for clarification on some issues presented in the AAR's comments. FRA's written request as well as any written
response will be included in the docket and made available for review. Based on the comments received, FRA believes
it would be beneficial to extend the comment period, so that all interested parties will have ample opportunity to
comment. For these reasons, FRA has determined that an extension to November 28, 1994, is appropriate. In addition,
FRA has not received any requests, formal or informal, for a hearing on this matter; therefore a hearing will not be
scheduled.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 2, 1993, NHTSA published a final rule (58 FR 46551) requiring that manufacturers install air bags to satisfy
automatic crash protection requirements for the front outboard seating positions in certain motor vehicles, beginning
on September 1, 1996. The final rule also requires that three labels bearing specified information related to air
bags be placed in air bag-equipped vehicles. S4.5.1(b)(1) of the rule requires one label to be permanently affixed
to the sun visor of each front seating position with an air bag. This label would have read:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 -->

On October 29, 1993, American Suzuki Motor Corporation (Suzuki) submitted a ``request for interpretation'' regarding
the wording of the sun visor label. Suzuki requested that manufacturers be permitted to use the signal word ``WARNING''
as an alternative to the signal word ``CAUTION'' in the heading. Suzuki pointed out that the American National Standards
Institute (ANSI) had issued a standard (Z535.4&hyph;1991) for signal words on product safety signs and labels. The
standard contains a hierarchy of signal words signifying different degrees of potential personal injury. In this
hierarchy, ``caution'' signifies a potential for ``minor or moderate injury,'' and ``warning'' indicates the possibility
of ``death or serious injury.'' Since accommodating Suzuki's request would require a change in the wording permitted
by the regulation, instead of an interpretation of the existing wording, it was treated by NHTSA as a petition for rulemaking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 10, 1994, NHTSA published a notice (59 FR 11200) responding to two petitions for reconsideration of the September
2 rule and three requests for interpretation of that rule (including Suzuki's). In response to Suzuki's request,
the agency stated:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA added the phrase ``CAUTION, TO AVOID SERIOUS INJURY'' in the final rule to ``attract occupants' attention to
the label and provide a brief statement of the risks of improper use and consequences.'' NHTSA concluded that substitution
of the word ``WARNING'' would also achieve these goals, and is therefore permitting its use.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA therefore amended S4.5.1(b)(1) of Standard 208 to permit manufacturers to use either word in the required air
bag label.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In a petition dated May 12, 1994, Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety (Advocates) requested that NHTSA reverse its
decision to permit the word ``WARNING'' as a substitute for the word ``CAUTION.'' Advocates styled its petition as
a ``petition for reconsideration of an interpretation.'' However, the challenged action was a regulatory amendment,
rather than an interpretation. Advocates' petition was received too late to be treated as a petition for reconsideration
of a regulation under 49 CFR &sect;553.35. Therefore, NHTSA is treating the letter as a petition for rulemaking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petition sets forth substantial and procedural objections to the March 10 amendment. As to substance, Advocates
believes that the word ``WARNING'' will cause vehicle occupants to be unnecessarily concerned. It disagrees with
NHTSA's conclusion that ``CAUTION'' and ``WARNING'' are equivalent, citing the stronger nature of the word ``WARNING''
in the ANSI hierarchy of signal words. Advocates added that it thought the entire label concept was unnecessary, but
that it reluctantly accepted the September 2 final rule's use of the word ``CAUTION'' because it was less aggressive
than the word `'WARNING.'' It believes that ``[t]he message now conveyed is clearly one of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
danger
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of likely serious injury'' (emphasis added).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency did not rely on the ANSI standards when deciding to permit the use of the word ``WARNING.'' In fact, Suzuki's
petition was granted based on the conclusion that the words ``WARNING'' and ``CAUTION'' would achieve the same results
since they have similar meanings. This similarity is evident in the following dictionary definitions:

Moreover, the latter dictionary lists the two words as synonyms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency believes that it is more appropriate to base its decision about these two words on the similarity of their
dictionary definitions than on the ANSI standard. The public is presumptively familiar with the common usage and
meaning of these words, as reflected in their dictionary definitions. Conversely, all but an extremely small portion
of the public is likely unaware of the ANSI standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the similarity of the dictionary definitions, the agency believes that the public will not have any greater
reaction to the use of ``WARNING'' than to ``CAUTION.'' Either word choice provides an appropriate attention-getting
visual cue. However, it is worth noting that, if the ANSI distinctions were to be applied in determining the appropriate
word, the stronger work, ``WARNING,'' would be preferable to ``CAUTION'' because it more accurately describes the
potential degree of injury.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA also notes that S5.5.2 of Standard 213, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Child Restraint Systems, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
requires that each rear-facing child seat bear a label that contains the signal work ``WARNING,'' advising that the
seat should not be used in air bag-equipped seating positions. NHTSA has difficulty understanding Advocates' strong
reaction to the word ``WARNING'' on the sun visor label given that it did not object to requiring that the same signal
word be placed on the child safety seat itself.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Advocates also is particularly concerned about the possibility that the word ``WARNING'' will cause some people
to want to deactivate the air bag. NHTSA is considering a request from the American Association of Automobile Manufacturers
for a rulemaking that would permit a manual cutoff switch for the passenger side air bag in vehicles with no rear seat.
The purpose of the cutoff switch would be to allow drivers to deactivate the air bag in that passenger seating position
when a rear-facing infant safety seat is placed there. Advocates speculates that the two rules would have a detrimental
synergistic effect. It believes that some passengers in these vehicles would use the cutoff switch to disable their
air bags, not for the intended purpose of protecting an infant in a safety seat, but because they are frightened by the
word ``WARNING.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Advocates' concern is premature, speculative, and addressed to the wrong forum. NHTSA has not made any judgment about
what, if any, kind of cutoff switch it might eventually permit. When NHTSA issues an NPRM, it will provide Advocates
and other members of the public with an opportunity to submit comments to the rulemaking docket for that rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Advocates also posed a procedural objection to the agency's permitting the use of ``WARNING.'' It believes that it
had the right to submit its views on the use of the word ``WARNING.'' Advocates states that it relied to its detriment
on what it said was NHTSA's representation in the final rule that only the term ``CAUTION'' would be used. It stated
that the choice of terminology should be determined through rulemaking instead of interpretation. Advocates believes
that, as part of that rulemaking, the ANSI scheme should have been presented to the public for comment. Advocates apparently
did not realize that the Suzuki request was treated as a petition for rulemaking, even though the March 10 rule stated
that the September 2 rule was being amended, something that cannot be done through an interpretation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the Administrative Procedure Act requires notice and comment procedures for most substantive rules, such
procedures are not needed for minor technical amendments, such as permitting the use of a synonym on an information
label. Since ``CAUTION'' and ``WARNING'' are synonyms in common usage, the addition of ``WARNING'' will have no practical
impact on the public's understanding of and reaction to the label. Thus, the amendment allowing the word ``WARNING''
was essentially technical in nature. Further, the agency had already obtained public comment on essentially the
same issue as a result of the December 14, 1992 notice of proposed rulemaking regarding the wording of the label. Accordingly,
an additional opportunity for comment was not required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the foregoing, there is no reasonable possibility that the order requested in the petition will be issued
at the conclusion of a rulemaking proceeding. Therefore, this petition is denied.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS issues this proposed rule to implement Amendment 2 to the Fishery Management Plan for Coral and Coral Reefs of
the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic (FMP). Amendment 2 would prohibit the taking of wild live rock in the exclusive
economic zone (EEZ) off the southern Atlantic states (South Atlantic) from the North Carolina/Virginia boundary
to the Dade/Broward County line in Florida and in the EEZ of the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf), except off Florida north of Monroe
County; phase out wild live rock harvests in the South Atlantic EEZ south of the Dade/Broward County line by 1996; phase
out wild live rock harvests in the Gulf EEZ off Florida north of Monroe County by 1997; establish restrictions on live
rock harvesting and possession and require permits and reporting during the phase-out periods; and allow and facilitate
live rock aquaculture. In addition, NMFS proposes changes to the regulations to correct and conform them to current
standards.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The FMP was prepared by the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council (Gulf Council) and the South Atlantic Fishery
Management Council (South Atlantic Council) and is implemented through regulations at 50 CFR part 638 under the authority
of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Live rock consists of living marine organisms, or an assemblage thereof, attached to a hard substrate, including
dead coral or rock (excluding individual mollusk shells). Live rock is collected by scuba divers and sold to the marine
aquarium industry, which markets it as the basis for minireef aquaria. Live rock is a nonrenewable resource providing
essential fishery habitat in the South Atlantic and Gulf. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the recent public review process during the development of Amendment 2, the Gulf and South Atlantic Councils received
testimony concerning serious damage to reefs, ledges, and other hard bottom habitats from live rock harvesting activities.
At the request of the Gulf Council, NMFS published an emergency interim rule on May 16, 1994 (59 FR 25344), effective
May 16 through August 14, 1994, and extended the rule, with modifications, through November 12, 1994 (59 FR 42533,
August 18, 1994). At the request of the South Atlantic Council, NMFS published an emergency interim rule on June 27,
1994 (59 FR 32938), effective through September 26, 1994, and extended the rule through December 25, 1994 (59 FR 47563,
September 16, 1994). These rules were intended to slow the rate of harvest, prevent serious damage to habitat, and
prevent geographical extension of harvest until permanent measures could be implemented through Amendment 2.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the South Atlantic EEZ, Amendment 2 would: (1) Prohibit the harvest and possession of wild live rock north of the
Dade/Broward County line in Florida; (2) south of the Dade/Broward County line, phase out harvesting of wild live
rock by January 1, 1996, establish an annual quota on harvests of wild live rock of 485,000 lb (219,992 kg) for calendar
years 1994 and 1995, and prohibit the taking of wild live rock by chipping during those years; and (3) provide for a permit
system for the harvest and possession of live rock from aquaculture operations that will be implemented when appropriate
criteria are developed through a subsequent amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the Gulf EEZ, Amendment 2 would: (1) Prohibit the harvest and possession of wild live rock off Texas, Louisiana,
Mississippi, Alabama, and south of the Monroe/Collier County line in Florida; (2) from the Monroe/Collier County
line to the Florida/Alabama boundary, phase out harvesting of wild live rock by January 1, 1997, contingent upon development
of a Federal aquaculture permitting system; (3) from the Pasco/Hernando County line in Florida to the Florida/Alabama
boundary, prohibit the taking of wild live rock by chipping during the phase-out period; (4) from the Pasco/Hernando
County line to the Monroe/Collier County line, limit the taking of wild live rock by chipping to nonpower-assisted,
hand-held hammers and chisels during the phase-out period; (5) from the Monroe/Collier County line to the Florida/Alabama
boundary, establish a daily vessel possession limit for wild live rock during the phase-out period; (6) require a
permit to harvest or possess live rock from aquaculture operations; and (7) provide an exception to the taking of prohibited
corals as part of the aquaculture permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For both the South Atlantic and Gulf, Amendment 2 would: (1) Define live rock and add it to the fishery management unit;
(2) redefine allowable octocorals to ensure that individual colonies and not whole rocks are taken under the octocoral
quota; (3) establish a Federal permit and reporting system for wild live rock harvesting during harvest phase-out
periods; (4) allow and facilitate live rock aquaculture; (5) require a permit to harvest and possess live rock in the
EEZ for scientific, educational, or restoration purposes; and (6) provide for separate management of coral and coral
reef resources by each Council in its geographical area of authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A description of the fishery and the rationale and effects of live rock harvesting restrictions during the phase-out
periods in the Gulf EEZ off Florida and prohibitions on harvesting in the EEZ off Alabama and in the South Atlantic north
of the Dade/Broward County line in Florida were contained in the emergency interim rules and are not repeated here.
Rationales for prohibitions on harvest and possession in other areas, the phaseout of harvesting in remaining areas
off Florida, permits and reporting, the redefinition of allowable octocorals, and separation of management between
the Councils are discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To prevent effort shifting from the current areas of harvest, Amendment 2 would prohibit wild live rock harvesting
and possession in the EEZ off Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi, in addition to areas closed under the emergency interim
rules. No landings of live rock have been reported from these areas. Coral habitats are at such a premium in the northern
Gulf that local governments and private organizations are considering construction of artificial reefs to supplement
scarce natural hard bottom habitats. Amendment 2 would close the Gulf EEZ off Monroe County to all harvest and possession
in order to prevent effort shifting from the South Atlantic EEZ following closures in that adjoining jurisdiction.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
About 99 percent of reported live rock landings are from the Gulf EEZ off Florida north of Monroe County and from the
South Atlantic EEZ south of the Dade/Broward County line. All landings of live rock to date have been of ``wild'' live
rock, that is, non- aquacultured live rock. The Councils propose to phase out these landings and replace them with
aquacultured products from either state or EEZ waters. The delay in implementation of a harvest and possession prohibition
in these areas is designed to allow live rock harvesters additional time and resources to make the transition to aquaculture.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Councils propose to redefine allowable octocorals to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
close a potential loophole that could allow harvest of live rock 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as part of the 50,000 colony annual quota for allowable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
octocorals. The revised definition would include as allowable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
octocoral only a limited amount of the attached substrate_one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inch (2.54 cm) in the South Atlantic EEZ and 3 inches (7.62 cm) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the Gulf EEZ. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, a Federal permit for prohibited coral is issued 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only when the prohibited coral is for a scientific or educational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose. The Councils propose to add restoration to the purposes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for which these permits are available. This addition recognizes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the benefits of habitat restoration following ship groundings and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other environmental perturbations. The Councils also propose to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allow the harvest of live rock under a Federal permit issued for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a scientific, educational, or restoration purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Councils propose to require permits for and reporting of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wild live rock harvest during the phase-out periods in the Gulf 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EEZ off Florida north of Monroe County and in the South Atlantic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EEZ south of the Dade/Broward County line. Permits would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited to persons who legally participated in the fishery on or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior to February 3, 1994, and to the number of vessels that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operated in the commercial fishery for live rock on or prior to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
February 3, 1994, as documented on trip tickets received by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Florida Department of Environmental Protection prior to March 15, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1994. The date of February 3, 1994, was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 5179, February 3, 1994) as the control date for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entry into the commercial fishery for live rock. All commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
landings of live rock have been permitted and reported under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Florida's permitting and reporting requirements. Those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements include a Saltwater Products License with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Restricted Species Endorsement and a Marine Life Endorsement, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the submission of trip tickets. These limitations on permits are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended to stabilize harvest during the phase-out period to near 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 1992 level and to limit participants to those already in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fishery. To accomplish these intended effects, NMFS finds it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to identify owners with the requisite permit history 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the number of vessels, by owner, that operated in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial fishery on or prior to the control date. Vessel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permits would be issued to such owners in corresponding numbers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Councils intend to allow and facilitate live rock 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aquaculture to replace the wild harvest. Amendment 2 proposes to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require an aquacultured live rock permit for the harvest and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possession of live rock from aquaculture operations in the Gulf 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EEZ, under specific criteria designed to protect natural hard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bottom areas as specified in this rule. The aquaculture permit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would also authorize an exception to the prohibition on taking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and possession of otherwise prohibited corals. Otherwise, an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aquaculturist could be prevented from harvesting the aquaculture 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product if small polyps of such species are detected on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rocks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendment 2 would establish a permit requirement for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harvest and possession of live rock from aquaculture operations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the South Atlantic EEZ, but aquaculture permits for this area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be issued only after appropriate criteria are developed and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implemented through a subsequent rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both Councils have agreed that management of coral, coral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reefs, live rock, and any other part of the management unit in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the FMP will be the responsibility of the Council in whose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jurisdiction it occurs. Under this arrangement, Amendment 2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposes to eliminate the current requirement that both Councils 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approve all measures in any FMP amendment submitted for agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review. This requirement exists because the FMP was designated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by NMFS as a joint management plan prepared by the two Councils. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the South Atlantic Council has requested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designation of a separate FMP for the South Atlantic because it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes (1) the habitats in the Gulf and South Atlantic are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different, (2) the resource does not move between the South 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Atlantic and the Gulf, (3) it should have authority to coordinate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all habitat concerns and policies in the South Atlantic, (4) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there are additional management needs in the South Atlantic, (5) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Councils have different management philosophies, and (6) a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate FMP will improve timeliness of management adjustments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and reduce constituent costs. The Gulf Council concurs in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
South Atlantic's request. NMFS requests comments on the proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to separate the FMP into an FMP for the South Atlantic and an FMP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the Gulf of Mexico.

Additional background and rationale for the measures

discussed above are contained in Amendment 2, the availability of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which was announced in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

(59 FR 44398). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Additional Measures Proposed by NMFS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule would eliminate unnecessary language; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change the scientific names of corals to conform to current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards of the American Fisheries Society; add definitions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional terms; correct the address and telephone number of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regional Director, Southeast Region, NMFS; clarify that all coral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a habitat area of particular concern (HAPC), including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowable octocoral, is prohibited coral; require identification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
markings on vessels in the live rock fishery; prohibit the use or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possession of a toxic chemical in the EEZ; prohibit the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possession of coral in the Flower Garden Banks HAPC; prohibit the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of dredges in the Flower Garden Banks HAPC; prohibit making a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
false statement to an authorized officer concerning the taking of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coral, coral reefs, or live rock; and prohibit interference with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an investigation, search, seizure, or disposition of seized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
property in connection with enforcement of the Magnuson Act. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement for identification markings and the added 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prohibitions are necessary for effective enforcement of existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and added management measures and would conform the regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to current standards applicable to other federally-managed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico and off the southern Atlantic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
states. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS proposes to simplify the existing permitting and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting requirements. Specifically, this rule proposes to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remove the requirement for Federal permits for and reports on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taking allowable octocoral that are landed in Florida and for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taking fish with an allowable chemical that are landed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Florida. Florida requires permits and reports for these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities, whether or not the allowable octocoral or fish are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harvested in the EEZ or State waters. Currently, all but one of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Federal permits for these activities involve landings in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Florida. Duplicate Federal/State permitting and reporting serve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no useful purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS proposes to broaden the ban on the use of power- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assisted tools. Amendment 2 proposes to ban the use of power- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assisted tools for the taking of aquacultured live rock, wild 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
live rock in the Gulf EEZ during the phase-out period, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowable octocoral. Since chipping of wild live rock would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
banned in the South Atlantic EEZ during the phase-out period, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
power-assisted tools implicitly would be banned in the EEZ in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that area. Amendment 2 does not explicitly address prohibited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coral in either area or allowable octocoral in the South Atlantic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EEZ. NMFS believes the rationale for the ban on power-assisted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tools is equally applicable to prohibited coral and allowable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
octocoral throughout the EEZ_extension of the ban to those

Section 304(a)(1)(D) of the Magnuson Act requires the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) to publish regulations proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by a council within 15 days of receipt of an amendment and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. At this time the Secretary has not determined that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendment 2 is consistent with the national standards, other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions of the Magnuson Act, and other applicable laws. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary, in making that determination, will take into account 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the data, views, and comments received during the comment period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule has been determined to be not significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for purposes of E.O. 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Councils prepared an FSEIS for Amendment 2 that will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
filed with the Environmental Protection Agency for public review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and comment; a notice of its availability for public comment for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30 days will be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. According to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the FSEIS, the proposed actions would benefit the natural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment by phasing out activities that result in damage to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
live bottom habitat areas. Potential adverse economic impacts on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fishermen would be mitigated by the harvest of aquacultured live 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rock.

The Councils prepared an IRFA as part of the RIR which describes the impact this proposed rule would have on small entities,
if adopted. The IRFA concludes that this proposed rule, if adopted, may have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Specifically, the required change from harvest of wild live rock to aquaculture may result
in significant increases in the operating and capital costs to fishermen. An unknown number of current participants
may be forced to cease business as live rock harvesters. All current participants are small entities. A copy of this
analysis is available (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule contains five new collection-of-information requirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act_namely,
applications for permits to take wild live rock, applications for permits to take aquacultured live rock, site evaluation
reports for aquacultured live rock, reports of live rock harvests, and notification of intent to harvest aquacultured
live rock. These requirements have been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for approval. The public
reporting burdens for these collections of information are estimated to average 15, 15, 45, 15, and 2 minutes per response,
respectively, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining
the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. This rule also revises a collection-of-information
requirement subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act_namely, applications for prohibited coral, allowable chemical,
and allowable octocoral permits. This collection of information is estimated to average 15 minutes per response
and was previously approved by OMB under OMB control number 0648&hyph;0205. Send comments regarding these reporting
burden estimates or any other aspect of the collections of information, including suggestions for reducing the burdens,

Wild live rock.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (A) A Federal permit is required for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessel to take or possess wild live rock. A wild live rock 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessel permit will not be issued unless the current owner of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessel for which the permit is requested had the required Florida 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permit and endorsements for live rock on or before February 3, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1994, and a record of landings of live rock on or before February 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3, 1994, as documented on trip tickets received by the Florida 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department of Environmental Protection before March 15, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For landings other than in Florida, equivalent state 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permits/endorsements, if required, and landing records may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substituted for the Florida permits/endorsements and trip 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tickets. An owner will not be issued permits in numbers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceeding the number of vessels for which the owning entity had 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the requisite reported landings. An owner of a permitted vessel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may transfer the vessel permit to another vessel owned by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same person by returning the existing permit with an application 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for a vessel permit for the replacement vessel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) A Federal permit is required for an individual to take 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or possess wild live rock for a scientific, educational, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restoration purpose and an individual permit will be issued only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for such purpose. Such individual wild live rock permit may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorize the taking and possession of wild live rock in or from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas not otherwise allowed by the regulations in this part.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By this notice, the Department is proposing definitions for colored fluorescent and incandescent lamps. The Department
is also proposing to clarify the exemption for rough or vibration service incandescent reflector lamps by requiring
a C&hyph;17 or C&hyph;22 filament or by requiring a vibration test. The proposed definitions will apply to those products
covered by sections 322(a)(14) and 325(i)(1) of the Act.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By this notice, the Department is defining colored fluorescent and colored incandescent lamps because section 321(a)(30)(B)(iii)
and section 321(a)(30)(C)(ii) of the Act contain exemptions for these lamps without defining them. After a meeting
with lamp manufacturers and the National Electrical Manufacturers Association, the Department believes that a
colored lamp can be defined by using a suitable minimum value of the Color Rendering Index (CRI) or a correlated color
temperature. The National Institute of Standards and Technology personnel have researched CRI values and correlated
color temperatures for many different colored fluorescent and incandescent lamps. The National Institute of Standards
and Technology recommends and the Department agrees that either CRI or color temperature will sufficiently define
colored lamps. The Department is proposing that a CRI value less than 30 and a lamp color correlated temperature either
below 2,500
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;K for red and yellow colors or above 7,000
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;K for blue and green colors will allow an exemption for bona-fide colored fluorescent lamps while requiring
all of the ``white'' lamps to meet the standards. Likewise, colored incandescent lamps must have CRI values below
50 and a lamp color correlated temperature either below 2,500
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;K for red and yellow colors or above 7,000
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;K for blue and green colors to be exempt from standards. The Department further proposes that these lamps be designed,
designated and marketed specifically as colored lamps. DOE requests comments on the two proposals for definitions
of colored fluorescent and incandescent lamps. The Department also invites manufacturer's to send data on CRI measurements
and color correlated temperatures for colored fluorescent and incandescent lamps. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes that the measurements required to determine if a lamp is colored by the above definition are
minimal. The CRI is a required measurement for fluorescent lamps and manufacturers would only have to make a CRI measurement
for lightly tinted incandescent lamps such as ``jeweler's blue.'' The color temperature is derived from spectroradiometric
measurements correlated to a blackbody and the spectroradiometric data for most lamps already exists so manufacturers
use a chart to determine the correlated color temperature. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Note that the ``jeweler's blue'' lamp may require a heavier tint to pass the proposed incandescent CRI cutoff so the
Department is advising the manufacturers to evaluate the CRI of any lightly tinted incandescent lamps. However,
the Department believes that if the CRI for incandescent lamps is raised, that could allow a manufacturer to circumvent
the standards with lightly tinted lamps. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's proposed rule also contains a definition of an exempt rough or vibration service incandescent reflector
lamp. Section 321(a)(30)(C)(ii) of the Act contains an exemption for ``rough or vibration service applications''
of incandescent reflector lamps without defining this term. After several meetings with lamp manufacturers and
the National Electrical Manufacturers Association, the Department has determined that there is no industry-wide
accepted agreement on a definition for a rough or vibration service incandescent reflector lamp. Also, it appears
that there are very few incandescent reflector lamps which are marketed solely for rough or vibration service applications.
From a study, ``Findings on Incandescent Reflector Lamps,'' conducted by Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories, DOE has
determined that sales data for long-life or vibration service applications are not collected separately and that
approximately 20 percent of the present incandescent reflector lamp market is comprised of lamps marketed for those
purposes. The Department was unable to separate the long-life reflector lamp market and the vibration service reflector
lamp market. However, most lamps designated as ``Long-life'' rather than ``Vibration Service'' have a C&hyph;9
filament with 4-supports. Additionally, three large lamp manufacturers use a C&hyph;17 filament with 12 supports
to characterize their rough service incandescent reflector lamp. The Department believes that lamps labeled and
marketed for rough or vibration service should either meet a design standard (a C&hyph;17 or C&hyph;22 filament)
or a performance standard (pass a vibration test). Only such lamps would qualify for a rough or vibration service exemption
from the standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since reflector lamps with C&hyph;9 filaments are marketed for long life and since there is no industry consensus
for the C&hyph;9 filament as a vibration design, the Department is proposing to define a rough or vibration service
application lamp as an incandescent lamp designated and marketed specifically for rough or vibration service. Additionally,
this lamp must have either 6 support wires with a C&hyph;17 or C&hyph;22 filament configuration or the lamp must meet
a vibration test. The 6 support wires were proposed by one of the manufacturers and the Department believes that they
will provide enough additional vibration resistance while maintaining better lamp efficacy than the 12 support
wires normally used in a rough or vibration service lamp. The proposed vibration test is a modified Naval test specification

 for ruggedness of large tungsten filament lamps and consists of a vibration frequency test going from 5 to 33 Hz in 1
Hz increments and a 2 hour vibration endurance test at 33 Hz. The Department requests comments on this proposal.

III. Environmental Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 7(c)(2) of the Federal Energy Administration Act a copy of this notice has been submitted to the
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency for comment concerning the impact of this proposal on the quality
of the environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since test procedures are used to standardize the measurement of energy usage, and will not affect the quality or distribution
of energy usage, prescribing test procedures will not result in any environmental impacts. The Department of Energy,
therefore, has determined that prescribing test procedures under the Program is not a major Federal action significantly
affecting the quality of the human environment within the meaning of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This Rulemaking, which amends existing part 430 of Title 10, will not change the environmental effect of such regulation,
and is an item which is ``categorically excluded (A6)'' by the Department of Energy's regulations on National Environmental
Policy Act Implementing Procedures (10 CFR part 1021) (57 FR 15122, April 24, 1992) (appendix A to subpart D, Categorical
Exclusion A6.). Consequently, neither an Environmental Impact Statement nor an Environmental Assessment is required
for this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Regulatory Planning and Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Today's regulatory action has been determined not to be a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order
12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review,'' (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993). Accordingly, today's action was not subject
to review under the Executive Order by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
V. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;345) (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612) requires that an agency prepare an
initial regulatory flexibility analysis and that it be published at the time the proposed rule is published. This
requirement (which appears in section 603) does not apply if the agency ``certifies that the rule will not, if promulgated,
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' This rule affects manufacturers
of general service fluorescent and incandescent lamps. As previously discussed, the rule would not have significant
economic impact, but rather, would provide common definitions and test methods. Therefore, the Department of Energy
certifies that this rule, if promulgated, would not have a ``significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VI. Federalism Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12612 (52 FR 41685, Oct. 30, 1987) requires that regulations or rules be reviewed for any substantial
direct effects on States, on the relationship between the Federal Government and the States, or on the distribution
of power and responsibilities among various levels of government. If there are sufficient substantial direct effects,
then Executive Order 12612 requires preparation of a federalism assessment to be used in all decisions involved in
promulgating and implementing a regulation or a rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of Energy has identified a substantial direct effect that today's proposed rule would have on State
governments. It would initially preempt inconsistent State regulations. However, the Department of Energy has
concluded that such effect is not sufficient to warrant preparation of a federalism assessment for the following
reason: the Act provides for subsequent State petitions for exemption. Thus, a determination as to whether a State
law prevails must be made on a case-by-case basis using criteria set forth in the Act. When the Department of Energy
receives such a petition, it will then be appropriate to consider preparing a federalism assessment consistent with
the criteria in the Act.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is exploring the possibility of issuing significant new use rules (SNURs) for certain uses of elemental lead (Pb)
and lead compounds under section 5(a)(2) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). The SNURs would require persons
to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing the manufacture, import, or processing of lead and lead compounds
for uses identified by the Agency as significant new uses. The significant new use notice (SNUN) would provide EPA
with the opportunity to evaluate the intended use and associated activities and to prevent potentially unreasonable
risk of injury to human health and the environment from occurring. EPA is issuing this ANPR to: (1) Communicate its
intention to regulate significant new uses of elemental lead and lead compounds; (2) identify components of its proposed
regulatory approach; (3) request comment on issues related to this approach; and (4) request comment and information
on existing uses of lead that would help support EPA's selection of proposed criteria for defining significant new
uses of lead. The Agency is particularly concerned with products the use of which may pose unreasonable risks to children.
The information submitted in response to this ANPR will help EPA design an effective and efficient strategy for regulating
significant new uses of lead.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Reducing human exposure to lead and lead contamination of the environment continue to be priority issues for EPA.
Exposure to lead can result in a variety of adverse human health effects in both children and adults. Recent research
and scientific evidence indicate that human health effects (e.g., impaired neurological development) occur at
low exposure levels. Lead contamination of the environment is causing degradation of habitat and lead products have
been implicated in the death of individual animals from several species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to these problems, EPA has undertaken a variety of regulatory, programmatic, and research efforts to
evaluate and address the environmental impacts of lead. Since 1991, Agency activities have been coordinated through
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Strategy for Reducing Lead Exposures
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This strategy includes regulatory and pollution prevention activities, a lead abatement program for ``in-place''
lead, and a research program. The promulgation of SNURs for elemental lead and lead compounds is part of EPA's multi-faceted
strategy for reducing unacceptable lead exposures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's efforts are designed to reduce exposure to lead by: (1) Preventing new uses and phasing out current uses of lead
that pose unreasonable risks; (2) controlling lead emissions; (3) managing the disposal of lead-containing wastes;
(4) addressing in-place lead; and (5) supporting research to improve EPA's ability to assess and reduce lead-related
risks.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 5(a)(2) of TSCA (15 U.S.C. 2604(a)(2)) authorizes EPA to determine that a use of a chemical substance is a ``significant
new use.'' The Agency must make this determination by rule after considering all relevant factors, including those
listed in section 5(a)(2). Section 5(a)(2) factors generally relate to the extent to which a use changes the volume
of a chemical's production or the type, form, magnitude, or duration of exposure to it. Once EPA determines that a use
of a chemical substance is a significant new use, section 5(a)(1)(B) of TSCA requires persons to submit a notice to
EPA at least 90 days before they manufacture, import, or process the chemical substance for that use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Persons subject to a SNUR would comply with the same notice requirements and EPA regulatory procedures as submitters
of premanufacture notices (PMNs) under section 5(a)(1)(A) of TSCA. In particular, these requirements include the
information submission provisions of section 5(b) and (d)(1), the exemptions authorized by section 5(h)(1), (2),
(3), and (5), and the regulations at 40 CFR part 720. The premanufacture notification process provides EPA the opportunity
to review the particular use of the chemical substance and make a reasonable risk determination prior to the use's
commercial introduction. Following its review, EPA may take regulatory action under section 5(e), 5(f), 6, or 7 to
control the activities for which it has received a SNUN. If EPA does not take action, section (5)(g) of TSCA requires
EPA to explain in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 its reasons for not taking action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Persons who intend to export a substance identified in a final SNUR are subject to the export notification provisions
of TSCA section 12(b). The regulations that interpret section 12(b) appear at 40 CFR part 707. Persons who import a
substance identified in a final SNUR must certify that they are in compliance with TSCA, which includes the SNUR requirements.
The EPA import certification requirements appear at 40 CFR part 707.

II. Uses of Lead 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Lead is a soft, gray metallic element mined from rock and found in its natural state all over the world. It is virtually
indestructible and non-biodegradable. Its malleability, low melting point, ease of processing, abundance, low
cost, density, lubricant properties, and durability give it good functional value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1992, the U.S. Bureau of Mines reported that U.S. industries consumed over 1.24 million tons of lead. Of this quantity,
nearly 81 percent was used to manufacture storage batteries and 5 percent was used in the ammunition industry. Other
uses include: Glass and ceramics; lead chemical products; cable coverings; lead sheet; lead solder; casting lead;
pigments; pipes, traps, and other extruded products; brass and bronze; other metal products; heat stabilizers;
and bearing metals. Manufacturers use lead in its elemental form, in compounds including lead oxides and lead chromate,
and in alloys (e.g., brass and solder).

III. Human Health Effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Exposure to lead can produce a spectrum of human health effects across a wide range of exposure levels. Recent studies
indicate that these toxic effects may occur at exposure levels considerably lower than previously recognized. Accordingly,
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has established the threshold of concern for blood lead (PbB),
the most common index of lead exposure, at 10 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/dL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Young children and fetuses are especially vulnerable to lead: the nervous systems are developing and lead is absorbed
into the blood stream more easily than in adults. High PbB levels (>40&hyph;60 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/dL) in children are associated with anemia, mental retardation, and encephalopathy. At extremely high levels
(>100 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/dL), death may occur. There is also a concern that high lead exposure might play a role in spontaneous abortions.
At lower exposure levels, lead has been linked to impaired cognitive performance, delayed neurological and physical
development, decreased birth weight, and interference with heme synthesis and Vitamin D metabolism. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recent research indicates that deficits in IQ and other measures of cognitive functions have been associated with
PbB levels of 10

Air Quality Criteria for Lead, Supplement to 1986 Addendum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (USEPA, 1990), has identified the following relationships between lead exposure and human health: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Deficits in mental indices have been found in infants with maternal or umbilical cord PbB levels as low as 6&hyph;7

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Low birth weights and decreased gestation age, factors that may influence early neurological development have
been associated with infants born to women with PbB levels above 12&hyph;14

m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/dL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Early childhood growth reductions have been associated with PbB levels from 5&hyph;35 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/dL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its study 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Measuring Lead Exposure in Infants, Children, and Other Sensitive Populations
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the National Academy of Sciences documented a similar range of effects (NAS, 1993). The Academy noted that PbB concentrations
around 10 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/dL are associated with disturbances in early physical and mental growth and in later intellectual functioning
and academic achievement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although Federal government interest in lead poisoning has primarily focused on children, there is substantial
evidence that lead exposures can produce adverse health effects in adults. Of great concern is evidence that elevated
PbB levels have been associated with slight increases in blood pressure. Because lead is stored in bone, it may be mobilized
during periods of stress or greater metabolic demands for calcium (e.g., pregnancy).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Environmental Effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Lead is one of the most common toxic substances found in large and small animals. Lead poisoning is the most frequently
diagnosed toxicological problem in veterinary medicine; its occurrence has been reported in all domestic species
and in several species of zoo animals. Lead poisoning has also affected many major species of waterfowl in North America
and has been reported in many birds elsewhere in the world. Sources of these exposures have typically included lead
wastes, lead paint, spent lead shot, fishing sinkers, and contaminated forage near smelters and roadways. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Laboratory and field data show that at high concentrations, lead can affect certain plants and inhibit photosynthesis,
reduce growth, and alter species composition. Other studies indicate that high lead concentrations alter the composition
of soil microbial communities and inhibit invertebrate activity resulting in delayed decomposition of organic
matter, reduced nutrient supply, and altered soil properties, such as lower organic content. Lead is toxic to many
phyla of aquatic biota. Water lead concentrations as low as 19 to 30 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/L have been associated with increased mortality and impaired reproduction in aquatic invertebrates. Aquatic
vertebrates (e.g., fish) appear to be even more sensitive. Studies have shown that freshwater aquatic organisms
are more sensitive to lead in soft than hard water. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
V. Controlling Lead Exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Over the last two decades EPA has taken a number of actions to control exposure to lead. Most notable of these actions
has been the virtual removal of lead from gasoline. As a result of this action and the phase-out of lead solder in food
cans by domestic manufacturers, it is estimated that the average PbB level in children has declined by 75 percent (from
about 17 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/dL to 4 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/dL) over the past 15 years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Despite this progress, several factors have prompted EPA to identify other sources of on-going lead exposure, especially
exposure among children, and initiate additional actions. First, the level of concern at which lead may adversely
affect human health continues to decrease. CDC revised its level of concern from 25 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/dL to 10 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/dL in 1990. Second, nearly nine percent of children continue to have PbB levels in excess of CDC's level of concern,
with a higher incidence of elevated PbB reported for minorities living in urban areas (CDC, 1994). Third, other sources
of lead (e.g., lead-based paint and drinking water) are the primary sources of exposure for segments of the population.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To coordinate EPA's lead activities, the Agency published the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Strategy for Reducing Lead Exposures
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in February 1991, the goal of which is to reduce lead exposures to the fullest extent practicable. Two objectives have
been used to set program priorities and gauge program success: (1) Reduce significantly the incidence of PbB levels
above 10 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/dL in children while taking into account the associated costs and benefits; and (2) reduce significantly, through
voluntary and mandatory actions, unacceptable lead exposures that are anticipated to pose risks to children, the
general public, or the environment. EPA plans to achieve the strategy's goal and objectives through implementation
of research, abatement, and regulatory and pollution prevention programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Research Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purposes of the research program are to: (1) Locate and assess, in terms of geography and media, the most serious
lead risks; and (2) develop methods and tools to reduce these risks cost-effectively. Examples of accomplishments
and on-going efforts include evaluation of low-cost lead-based paint (LBP) abatement techniques, development
of LBP abatement sampling techniques and protocols, studies to analyze the effectiveness of corrosion control technologies
in small public water supply systems to reduce lead levels, and continued development and review of the Integrated
Environmental Uptake/Biokinetic (UBK) Model to assess the relationship between environmental lead exposure and
PbB levels.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lead-based paint
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. EPA's abatement program for ``in-place'' lead focuses on two major sources of exposure: LBP and lead-contaminated
soil. LBP is the most serious source of children's lead exposure. The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry
(ATSDR) estimates that 12 million children are exposed to LBP at home and that nearly 6 million are exposed in homes
with the highest concentrations of lead (houses built prior to 1940). Under a Memorandum of Understanding, EPA works
closely with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to address the LBP problem. EPA's efforts
in this area have intensified with the enactment of Title X, ``The Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction
Act of 1992'' (the Act). Subtitle B of the Act, which amended TSCA by creating Title IV, provides for a comprehensive
national approach to dealing with LBP in the nation's housing stock. One of the purposes of the Act is to reorient the
Federal program from abatement of all residential LBP to abatement and in-place management of priority LBP hazards.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To date, EPA's LBP program has successfully implemented several initiatives. The Agency has established regional
training and information centers and implemented a nationwide public outreach and education campaign. The outreach
and education campaign consists of the National Lead Information Center, which operates the Lead Hotline and the
Lead Clearinghouse. In addition, the National Lead Poisoning Prevention Education Campaign disseminates important
information on residential LBP hazards through radio and television public service announcements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act also directs EPA to develop several regulations designed to address residential LBP exposures. Under TSCA
section 402(a)(1), EPA is developing training and certification requirements for individuals and contractors
engaged in LBP activities (e.g., risk assessment, inspection, and abatement). These regulations will establish
standards for performing LBP activities. This rulemaking also includes procedures for State and Indian Tribe program
authorization under TSCA section 404(a) and a Model State Program under TSCA section 404(d). EPA issued proposed
regulations under TSCA sections 402(a)(1), 404(a), and 404(d) in the

 of September 2, 1994 (59 FR 45872). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under TSCA section 403, EPA is developing health-based standards for identifying lead-based paint hazards, lead-contaminated
dust, and lead-contaminated soil, and on July 14, 1994, issued guidance on this subject. EPA is developing regulations
under TSCA section 406 and section 1018 of the Act requiring the disclosure of potential LBP hazards prior to renovation
of target housing and the disclosure of known LBP and LBP hazards prior to the sale or lease of target housing.

 The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for TSCA section 406 was published on March 9, 1994 (59 FR 11108). In conjunction
with this rulemaking, the Agency made a pamphlet on LBP hazards available to the public for review and comment (March
9, 1994; 59 FR 11119). EPA expects to issue a proposed rule under section 1018 of the Act later in 1994.

Target housing is defined by section 1004 of Title X to be ``any housing constructed prior to 1978, except housing for
the elderly or persons with disabilities (unless any child who is less than 6 years of age resides or is expected to reside
in such housing for the elderly or persons with disabilities) or any 0&hyph;bedroom dwelling. In the case of jurisdictions
which banned the sale or use of lead-based paint prior to 1978, the Secretary [of Housing and Urban Development], at
the Secretary's discretion, may designate an earlier date.''

Under TSCA section 405(b), EPA has established the National Lead Laboratory Accreditation Program (NLLAP) and developed
protocols, criteria, and minimum performance standards for laboratories that analyze paint chip, dust, and soil
samples for lead. The purpose of this program is to ensure that reliable laboratory services are available to support
lead hazard detection and abatement activities. The Agency, in the first phase of the NLLAP program, is publishing
proficiency test results for laboratories on a state-by-state basis. To implement the second phase of the program,
EPA has executed Memoranda of Understanding with the American Industrial Hygiene Association (memorandum from
Scott McMoran, USEPA to Gordon Banks, AIHA, December 10, 1993) and the American Association for Laboratory Accreditation
(memorandum from Scott McMoran, USEPA to John Locke, AALA, December 1, 1993) establishing these institutions as
laboratory accrediting organizations. The NLLAP program will recognize laboratories accredited by these organizations
as capable of analyzing paint chip, dust, and soil samples for lead.

Lead-contaminated soil
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The other major area of focus for EPA's abatement program for ``in-place'' lead is lead-contaminated soil. The Agency
has completed a review draft of the Urban Soil Lead Abatement Demonstration Project (Three City Study) (USEPA, 1993).
In addition, the Agency issued revised guidance on soil lead screening levels for Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) sites on July 14, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Three City Study, authorized by section 111(a)(6) of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA),
evaluated the effectiveness of soil lead abatement for reducing PbB levels in inner city children. The project, which
analyzed data from Baltimore, Boston, and Cincinnati, demonstrated a clear relationship between environmental
lead and PbB. Analysis of the data (peer review to be completed in 1994) indicates that lead in dust and paint were major
contributors to elevated PbB levels in children and that PbB levels responded to remedial activity. Furthermore,
analytical results from the three cities suggest that strategies to reduce overall lead exposure at a site and protect
human health need to consider an array of sources including lead in soil, dust, and paint.

C. Regulatory and Pollution Prevention Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The third component of EPA's lead strategy is the regulatory and pollution prevention program. This program, which
primarily focuses on existing and new uses and releases of lead, addresses lead exposures that are amenable to regulatory
control or, in some cases, voluntary measures. These controls include waste management requirements, emissions
restrictions, and limits on lead in products. Under its lead regulatory and pollution prevention program, EPA has
completed a major rulemaking and initiated several other important actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency published final regulations, promulgating maximum contaminant level goals and national primary drinking
water regulations for controlling lead and copper in drinking water (40 CFR parts 141 and 142) on June 7, 1991 (56 FR
26460). These regulations established a maximum contaminant level goal at 0

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

g/l for lead and an action level of 15 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/l for lead. Public water supply systems failing to meet the action level based on sampling methods prescribed in
the rule must initiate treatment actions that may include corrosion control, source water treatment, lead service
line replacement, and public education. To date, EPA has received sampling data reports from three rounds of sampling:
Round one covered large public water supply systems; round two covered large and medium-sized systems; and round
three covered medium and small systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In an action to protect wildlife, EPA proposed regulations under section 6(a) of TSCA, limiting the manufacture,
processing, and distribution in commerce in the United States, of certain size lead fishing sinkers on March 9, 1994
(59 FR 11122). Granting a section 21 petition by the Environmental Defense Fund, EPA proposed this regulatory action
in response to information submitted in the petition which indicated that common loons, trumpeter swans, and birds
from other avian species had died of lead poisoning after ingesting lead fishing sinkers. This proposed rulemaking
also includes sinkers containing zinc because studies and other information obtained by EPA suggests that zinc adversely
affects waterbirds and can cause mortality in avian species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency's regulatory efforts are complemented by initiatives to achieve voluntary compliance with lead exposure
reduction goals. For example, EPA is currently participating in efforts by National Sanitation Foundation International
to develop a voluntary lead leaching standard for kitchen, bar, and lavatory faucets. The objective of this standard
is to reduce the quantity of lead that leaches from brass faucets. Products that meet the standard based on test samples
and analysis would be certified and appropriately labeled, indicating to consumers that the product contributes
less lead to drinking and cooking water than faucets that fail to meet the certification requirements.

VI. Review and Control of New Uses of Lead 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Rationale 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To date, EPA's programmatic efforts have focused on existing uses of lead, because there is substantial evidence
that exposure to lead has adverse human health and environmental impacts. The Agency, however, is also concerned
about new uses of lead, because they may result in new or increased exposures which may present an unreasonable risk
of injury to human health and the environment. New or increased exposure to lead may arise from: (1) Increases in the
volume of lead consumed; (2) increases in the concentration of lead in products; (3) new products containing lead;
and (4) changes in product design that increase the amount of lead released from a product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that its concern about new uses is justified in light of lead's physical properties and low cost, attributes
which make it an attractive raw material for a broad variety of commercial and consumer products. Consequently, the
Agency believes that the regulation of existing uses alone may not be sufficient to reduce lead exposures to the greatest
extent practicable. EPA should also evaluate and, if necessary, regulate new uses of lead before opportunities for
exposure occur. The Agency further believes that addressing risks prior to commercial use is more effective than
responding to exposures and risks after the use is introduced commercially. Because children are especially vulnerable
to the impacts of lead, EPA is particularly concerned about new uses that could present risks to children. Consistent
with the Agency's overall lead risk reduction program, EPA is also seeking to address risks to adults and the environment
from new uses of lead. The Agency, therefore, is exploring the possibility of issuing significant new use rules for
certain uses of elemental lead and lead compounds under section 5(a) of TSCA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. The SNUR Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 5(a) of TSCA provides EPA with the authority to screen new uses of a chemical substance to determine whether
these uses should be regulated. This screening function is accomplished through the SNUR process. EPA may issue a
SNUR for a chemical substance after considering relevant factors, including: (1) The projected volume of manufacturing
and processing of a chemical substance; (2) the extent to which a use changes the type or form of human or environmental
exposure to a chemical substance; (3) the extent to which a use increases the magnitude and duration of human or environmental
exposure to a chemical substance; and (4) the reasonably anticipated manner and methods of manufacturing, processing,
distribution in commerce, and disposal of a chemical substance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Having considered all the relevant factors, EPA can then issue a SNUR that identifies the chemical substance and specifies
one or more uses as significant new uses. EPA also has the option to publish a SNUR that defines any use meeting specified
criteria as a significant new use. Under a third option, EPA may list all past and existing uses of the substance and
define any use not on that list as a significant new use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After EPA promulgates a SNUR for a chemical substance, TSCA requires that a SNUN be submitted to the Administrator
at least 90 days before the start of manufacturing or processing of the significant new use(s). Based on the information
provided in the SNUN and other relevant data submitted, the Agency will evaluate the risk that the use presents to human
health and the environment. EPA can, for good cause, extend the review period for a maximum of 90 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If, based on its review, the Agency determines that the significant new use may present an unreasonable risk of injury
to human health or the environment but lacks the information necessary to make a definitive finding, it can issue an
order to prohibit or limit the manufacturing, processing, or distribution in commerce of the use while it continues
its risk evaluation. Once EPA has made its risk finding, it can either: (1) Take long-term action to prohibit or limit
the manufacturing, processing, or distribution in commerce of the use if the use presents or will present unreasonable
risk of injury to human health and the environmentm, or (2) take no action if it finds that there is no unreasonable risk.
When making a determination of unreasonable risk, EPA considers the risks of the use to human health and the environment,
the benefits of the use, the availability of substitutes, and the economic consequences of any limits on the use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In short, section 5 of TSCA gives EPA the authority to promulgate a SNUR based on factors related to exposure and volume.
A SNUR requires notification of the significant new use(s). Following notification, the Agency evaluates the risk
of the use(s) to determine whether it should limit or prohibit the use(s). EPA solicits comment on the effectiveness
of using this approach for lead, as well as alternative approaches to protect human health and the environment from
lead exposures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Formulating an Approach for Lead 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To date, EPA has promulgated SNURs for substances where existing use is limited to a few applications and products.
These SNURs typically identify all existing uses of the substance that is the subject of the SNUR. Lead, however, is
used in hundreds of products and processes across many industries, due to its physical properties and low cost. The
widespread use of lead makes the complete identification of all existing uses of lead extremely difficult. The traditional
approach of first identifying all existing uses of a chemical substance, therefore, may not be appropriate for development
of a lead SNUR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To regulate new uses of lead in a sensible and protective manner, EPA intends to establish an alternative approach
that can be used to identify significant new uses. This approach consists of two components: a targeting strategy
and criteria for defining significant new uses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Targeting strategy
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The widespread use of lead in commerce has prompted EPA to develop a strategy that targets new lead uses where exposure
to lead could reasonably be expected to occur as a result of the designed or anticipated use of the product. For example,
the Agency would be concerned about a new use of lead in a product where lead could be inadvertently ingested by children
(e.g., use of lead-based artists paints in home studios contributing lead to household dust). The strategy also targets
new uses of lead that could result in adult and environmental exposure (e.g., heated lead solder for household electrical
repairs that could produce inhalable vapors, spent lead shot that could contaminate habitat adjacent to shooting
ranges). In contrast, EPA does not currently plan to focus on uses where human and/or environmental exposure would
be less likely to occur (e.g., new circuit boards used in computers and other electronics products, solder designed
for industrial use in the electronics industry, batteries). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency believes that using exposure to target new uses of lead is an appropriate tool and consistent with the SNUR
authority under section 5 of TSCA. If, in response to a SNUR that EPA promulgates for specific lead uses, the Agency
receives a SNUN, section 5 requires EPA to determine if further regulatory action is warranted by assessing whether
the use presents or will present an unreasonable risk of injury to human health or the environment. By using exposure
as the criterion for identifying new uses that would be subject to a SNUR, EPA intends to limit the SNUR and its notification
requirements to those new uses where exposure is likely and thus have the potential to present unreasonable risk.
Furthermore, this targeting strategy would eliminate from the requirements new uses where exposure is less likely
and the potential for unreasonable risk may not exist. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, EPA also does not plan to focus on classes of uses where other types of regulatory controls may be more appropriate
than the SNUR approach or where existing controls are sufficient. In many industries, for example, lead compounds
may be used during new or modified manufacturing processes (changes in manufacturing processes can be a factor in
defining a significant new use), possibly resulting in occupational exposures. Similarly, improperly managed
disposal of lead-containing products could result in exposure through releases to groundwater (landfilling) or
the air (incineration). Although EPA is concerned about such exposures, the Agency believes that other regulatory
mechanisms (e.g., Occupational Safety and Health Act, Clean Air Act, and RCRA authorities) are available, and in
some cases in place, to address these problems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other uses of lead are exempt from regulation as ``chemical substances'' by EPA under section 3(2)(B) of TSCA. For
example, exposure to lead through contamination of food and water from crystalware, ceramicware, and other housewares
is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under authorities granted by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act and other statutes. The FDA, using its authorities, has established action levels for lead in ceramic foodware,
including flatware, holloware, cups, mugs, and pitchers. The FDA has also issued a public advisory on the storage
of alcoholic beverages in crystalware, provided enforcement guidance for lead in wine, and has proposed a total ban
on the use of tin-coated lead capsules on wine bottles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is currently examining five priority classes of use for identification of possible candidates for lead SNURs.
Each class is defined in terms of a distinct exposure and/or environmental release scenario. These classes reflect
the Agency's focus on health risks to children that may result from lead exposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The five use classes are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Products used in water conveyance systems that come in contact with drinking water. The Agency has substantial
evidence that lead leaches from components of water distribution systems and household plumbing (e.g., fixtures,
fittings, solder, valves, pumps, meters, and tanks). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Products commonly used in and/or around the home where ordinary use (e.g., manipulation, grinding, sanding, heating)
could result in release of lead to the residential environment. For example, the use of products such as home hobbyist
supplies may contribute lead to household dust; lead vapors from products that are designed to be heated could be inhaled.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Products that could be mouthed by children where the lead-containing component in the product is reasonably accessible
to children. Children could ingest lead by mouthing the lead-containing component (e.g., plastic toys where lead
is used as a pigment or stabilizer and textiles with lead-based dyes). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Products that can release lead to the environment through exposure to weathering elements during use. Lead could
be released through leaching or through deterioration of the product, contaminating dust and soil (e.g., sheet lead
for roofing, lead caulk, traffic paint). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Products intended for non-residential (e.g. recreational, transportation, commercial, and industrial) use,
where use necessarily results in uncontrolled release of lead to the environment. Examples include lead-containing
products where use involves: (1) Combustion such as motor fuel additives, resulting in deposition of lead in the environment
and (2) dispersal of the product in the environment such as fishing sinkers and ammunition containing lead shot. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For each of these five use classes, the following Table 1 provides examples of both the uses and the lead compounds or
elemental forms of lead.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of Table 1 is to provide further clarification and understanding of these five use classes. Specific uses
included in Table 1 are presented as illustrative examples and are not intended to represent an exhaustive list. Furthermore,
these uses may be existing uses that would not be subject to the SNUR, depending on the final definition of ``significant
new uses.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the importance of this targeting scheme in regulating new uses of lead, the Agency is seeking comment on this
approach. Specifically, EPA would like commenters to address the following issues: (1) The appropriateness of using
the targeting approach described above to design lead SNURs, (2) whether the definition of any of the five use classes
is particularly unclear with respect to the types of uses or products that might be covered, (3) whether any use classes
listed in Table 1 should not be included in the targeting strategy and why, and (4) whether any use classes not listed
in Table 1 should be included in the targeting strategy and why. EPA is particularly interested in relevant data that
commenters may possess which suggest that SNURs are or are not appropriate for specific use classes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Criteria for identifying significant new uses
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The second element of EPA's approach for regulating new uses of lead is criteria for defining significant new uses
of lead. These criteria may include the development of a new product/use (i.e., product model or line), change in concentration
of lead in a product/use, change in surface area and other factors that affect the amount of lead released from a product,
and/or change in total volume of lead for a product/use. Because lead is used in a broad range of products involving
numerous industries, it is likely that the Agency will develop criteria that are specific to particular products/uses
rather than one set of criteria that would be applied uniformly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When selecting criteria, EPA will endeavor not to define, as significant new uses, products or processes that have
been developed specifically to reduce lead exposures. EPA does not wish and does not intend that any SNUR for lead impede
innovations that would reduce risks to human health and the environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To aid in developing these criteria, EPA plans to establish a baseline inventory of existing uses in the five use classes
identified in Table 1. The baseline inventory will include at least the following data elements for each identified
product/use: Product/use identification, product/use description; lead compound (and CAS number) or form of elemental
lead; median lead concentration; range of lead concentration; other design factors associated with the level of
lead released from the product; the frequency with which the design of the use/product changes; and total volume of
lead consumed annually for the product/use. These data will serve several purposes. First, they will enable EPA to
identify existing uses of lead. Only significant new uses will be subject to regulation under section 5 of TSCA. Second,
these data will improve the Agency's understanding of existing uses and help EPA select appropriate criteria for
effectively identifying and controlling significant new uses of lead. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency invites commenters to submit information of the type described in the preceding paragraph for any lead-containing
product/use belonging to one of the five priority use classes identified in Table 1. For purposes of this Notice, EPA
defines a lead-containing use/product as a use/product where lead is intentionally introduced at any stage of manufacturing
or processing. EPA is not currently examining uses/products that contain lead merely as an inadvertent contaminant.
EPA is also interested in data that commenters may possess on human and environmental exposure, bioavailability,
and risks associated with any such products or uses. Although the Agency does not normally consider the costs and/or
availability of substitutes when defining new uses for a SNUR, commenters with this kind of information are welcome
to submit the information if they feel that this information might be useful to the Agency. Data provided by commenters
will help the Agency to compile a baseline inventory of existing lead-containing products and uses and will help in
the selection of criteria for defining significant new uses of lead. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, EPA is not interested in receiving information for uses/products that are not described by any of the five
priority class definitions unless the use/product relates to an additional use class that the commenter believes
EPA should consider when developing a SNUR. Commenters who are uncertain (1) if a specific use/product fits into any
of the five classes and/or (2) about the type of use/product data that EPA would like commenters to submit should address
their questions to the technical contact listed under ``FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT'' in this document.

VII. Rulemaking Record and Electronic Filing of Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A record has been established for this ANPR under docket number ``OPPTS&hyph;50618'' (including comments and data
submitted electronically as described below). A public version of this record, including printed, paper versions
of electronic comments, which does not include any information claimed as CBI (see Unit VIII. of this document), is
available for inspection from noon to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding legal holidays. The public record
is located in the TSCA Nonconfidential Information Center (NCIC) (also known as the TSCA Public Docket Office), Rm.
NE&hyph;B607, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of an interagency ``streamlining'' initiative, EPA is experimenting with submission of public comments
on selected rulemaking actions electronically through the Internet in addition to accepting comments in traditional
written form. This ANPR is one of the first rulemaking actions selected by EPA for this experiment. From the experiment,
EPA will learn how electronic commenting works, and any problems that arise can be addressed before EPA adopts electronic
commenting more broadly in its rulemaking activities. Electronic commenting through posting to the EPA Bulletin
Board or through the Internet using the ListServe function raise some novel issues that are discussed below in this
Unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To submit electronic comments, persons can either ``subscribe'' to the Internet ListServe application or ``post''
comments to the EPA Bulletin Board. To ``Subscribe'' to the Internet ListServe application for this ANPR, send an
e-mail message to: listserver@unixmail.rtpnc.epa.gov that says ``Subscribe RIN&hyph;2070&hyph;AC37 &lt;first
name> &lt;last name>.'' Once you are subscribed to the ListServe, comments should be sent to: RIN&hyph;2070&hyph;AC37@unixmail.rtpnc.epa.gov.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For online viewing of submissions and posting of comments, the public access EPA Bulletin Board is also available
by dialing 202&hyph;488&hyph;3671, enter selection ``DMAIL,'' user name ``BB_USER'' or 919&hyph;541&hyph;4642,
enter selection ``MAIL,'' user name ``BB_USER.'' When dialing the EPA Bulletin Board type &lt;Return> at the opening
message. When the ``Notes>'' prompt appears, type ``open RIN&hyph;2070&hyph;AC37'' to access the posted messages
for this document. To get a listing of all files, type ``dir/all'' at the prompt line. Electronic comments can also
be sent directly to EPA at: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Docket&hyph;OPPTS@epamail.epa.gov.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To obtain further information on the electronic comment process, or on submitting comments on this ANPR electronically
through the EPA Bulletin Board or the Internet ListServe, please contact John A. Richards (Telephone: 202&hyph;260&hyph;2253;
FAX: 202&hyph;260&hyph;3884; Internet: richards.john@epamail.epa.gov).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Persons who comment on this ANPR, and those who view comments electronically, should be aware that this experimental
electronic commenting is administered on a completely public system. Therefore, any personal information included
in comments and the electronic mail addresses of those who make comments electronically are automatically available
to anyone else who views the comments. Similarly, since all electronic comments are available to all users, commenters
should not submit electronically any information which they believe to be CBI. Such information should be submitted
only directly to EPA in writing as described in Unit VIII. of this document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters and others outside EPA may chose to comment on the comments submitted by others using the RIN&hyph;2070&hyph;AC37
ListServe or the EPA Bulletin Board. If they do so, those comments as well will become part of EPA's record for this rulemaking.
Persons outside EPA wishing to discuss comments with commenters or otherwise communicate with commenters but not
have those discussions or communications sent to EPA and included in the EPA rulemaking record should conduct those
discussions and communications outside the RIN&hyph;2070&hyph;AC37 ListServe or the EPA Bulletin Board.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The official record for this rulemaking, as well as the public version, as described above will be kept in paper form.
Accordingly, EPA will transfer all comments received electronically in the RIN&hyph;2070&hyph;AC37 ListServe
or the EPA Bulletin Board, in accordance with the instructions for electronic submission, into printed, paper form
as they are received and will place the paper copies in the official rulemaking record which will also include all comments
submitted directly in writing. All the electronic comments will be available to everyone who obtains access to the
RIN&hyph;2070&hyph;AC37 ListServe or the EPA Bulletin Board; however, the official rulemaking record is the paper
record maintained at the address in ``ADDRESSES'' at the beginning of this document. (Comments submitted only in
written form will not be transferred into electronic form and thus may be accessed only by reviewing them in the TSCA
Nonconfidential Information Center as described above.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the electronic comment process is still experimental, EPA cannot guarantee that all electronic comments
will be accurately converted to printed, paper form. If EPA becomes aware, in transferring an electronic comment
to printed, paper form, of a problem or error that results in an obviously garbled comment, EPA will attempt to contact
the comment submitter and advise the submitter to resubmit the comment either in electronic or written form. Some
commenters may choose to submit identical comments in both electronic and written form to ensure accuracy. In that
case, EPA requests that commenters clearly note in both the electronic and written submissions that the comments
are duplicated in the other medium. This will assist EPA in processing and filing the comments in the rulemaking record.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As with ordinary written comments, EPA will not attempt to verify the identities of electronic commenters nor to review
the accuracy of electronic comments. EPA will take such commenters and comments at face value. Electronic and written
comments will be placed in the rulemaking record without any editing or change by EPA except to the extent changes occur
in the process of converting electronic comments to printed, paper form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If it chooses to respond officially to electronic comments on this ANPR, EPA will do so either in a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 or in a response to comments document placed in the rulemaking record for this ANPR. EPA will 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 respond to commenters electronically other than to seek clarification of electronic comments that may be garbled
in transmission or conversion to printed, paper form as discussed above. Any communications from EPA employees to
electronic commenters, other than those described in this paragraph, either through Internet or otherwise are not
official responses from EPA.

VIII. Confidential Business Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A person may assert a claim of confidentiality for any information, including all or portions of written comments
or data, submitted to EPA in connection with this advanced notice of proposed rulemaking. Information claimed as
confidential should not be submitted electronically as described in Unit VII. of this document. Any person who submits
a comment or data subject to a claim of confidentiality must also submit a nonconfidential version. Any claim of confidentiality
must accompany the information when it is submitted to EPA. Persons must mark information claimed as confidential
by circling, bracketing, or underlining it, and marking it with ``CONFIDENTIAL'' or some other appropriate designation.
EPA will disclose information subject to a claim of confidentiality only to the extent permitted by section 14 of TSCA
and 40 CFR part 2, subpart B. If a person does not assert a claim of confidentiality for information at the time it is submitted
to EPA, EPA may make the information public without further notice to that person. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any information submitted electronically as described in Unit VII. will be available to the public immediately without
restriction.

IX. Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule: (1) Having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, OMB has determined that this ANPR is a ``significant regulatory action''
because a lead SNUR may raise novel legal or policy issues. As such, this action was submitted to OMB for a 10&hyph;day
review, and any comments or changes made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations have been documented in
the public record.
