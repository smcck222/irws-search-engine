SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Fokker Model
F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes. This proposal would require modification of the fixed engine cowling at the forward
and aft crane beam attachment; and an inspection of the forward and aft crane beam to detect surface damage, and repair,
if necessary. This proposal is prompted by several reports of rear cabin noise (engine rumble) during flight and while
taxiing, which may have been caused by the interference between the forward and aft crane beams and the fasteners in
the fixed engine cowling. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent chafing due to normal engine
vibration, which could result in structural damage to the engine mount and possible separation of the engine from
the airplane.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Rijksluchtvaartdienst (RLD), which is the airworthiness authority for the Netherlands, recently notified
the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes. The RLD advises that
it has received several reports of rear cabin noise (engine rumble) experienced on these airplanes during flight
and while taxiing. Investigation revealed that one possible cause was interference between the forward and aft crane
beams and the fasteners in the fixed engine cowling. Such interference could result in chafing due to normal engine
vibration. This condition, if not corrected, could result in structural damage to the engine mount and possible separation
of the engine from the airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fokker has issued Service Bulletin SBF100&hyph;71&hyph;016, dated February 18, 1994, which describes procedures
for modification of the fixed engine cowling at the forward and aft crane-beam attachment; and a visual inspection
of the forward and aft crane beam to detect surface damage, and repair, if necessary. This modification entails replacing
fasteners of the fixed engine cowling with fasteners of a different type. This modification will ensure the structural
integrity of the engine mount. The RLD classified this service bulletin as mandatory and issued Netherlands Airworthiness
Directive BLA 94&hyph;038 (A), dated February 21, 1994, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes
in the Netherlands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in the Netherlands and is type certificated for operation in the United States
under the provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral
airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the RLD has kept the FAA informed
of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the RLD, reviewed all available information,
and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in
the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require modification of the fixed cowl at the forward
and aft crane-beam attachment; and performing a visual inspection of the forward and aft crane beam to detect surface
damage, and repair, if necessary. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service
bulletin described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 83 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
90 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed inspection and modification, and that the average labor rate
is $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately $75 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost
impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $417,075, or $5,025 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department is proposing to amend its rule governing the amount by which certain U.S. air carriers may limit their
liability to passengers for lost, damaged, and delayed baggage. This action is in response to a petition by Public
Citizen and Aviation Consumer Action Project to increase the minimum liability limit from $1,250 to $1,850 per passenger.
The Department is also requesting comment on two alternate proposals: (1) to raise the minimum limit to $1,850 with
a mechanism that automatically provides for periodic future increases, or (2) to raise the minimum liability limit
to $2,000.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consumer baggage problems in air travel remain a common occurrence. Reports submitted to the Department by the major
airlines indicate that over 2.2 million mishandled baggage reports were filed by passengers in 1993, although it
is unknown how many of those reports resulted in claims for compensation. When baggage is lost, damaged, or delayed,
the airlines are prohibited by federal regulation (14 CFR Part 254) from limiting their liability to less than $1,250
per passenger for provable damages.

The rule applies to flights on large aircraft (aircraft designed to carry more than 60 passengers), and to any flight
segment included on the same ticket as a flight segment using large aircraft.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amount of the minimum liability limit was last amended by a final rule effective April 10, 1984, issued by the Civil
Aeronautics Board (CAB) before its ``sunset'' (ER&hyph;1374, 49 FR 5065, February 10, 1984). The $1,250 figure was
calculated based upon the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers (CPIU) between
the date of the previous amendment and September 1983. When setting the limit, the CAB attempted to balance the amount
necessary to cover the value of most passengers' baggage while still allowing the airlines to protect themselves
from extraordinary claims. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 22, 1993, the Department received a petition for rulemaking from Public Citizen and Aviation Consumer
Action Project to increase the minimum liability limit in order to account for inflation since the 1984 amendment.
The petitioners suggest that the limit should be raised to $1,850, calculated by increasing the current $1,250 limit
proportionate with the increase in the CPIU from 1983 until the approximate time a new final rule would take effect
(estimated to be one year from the date of the petition). A letter in support of the petition was filed by Mr. Michael
Kees, a consumer who recently suffered a loss in excess of the liability limit, who asserts that a more realistic limit
today would be $2,500. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that in September 1983, the CPIU was 100.7 (using a 1982&hyph;84 = 100 reference
base). As of April 1994, the CPIU had increased by 46.4 percent to 147.4. Stated differently, the purchasing power
of a $1,250 maximum baggage claim award in 1983 had eroded to $854 in April 1994 dollars. To keep up with the 46.4 percent
increase in the CPIU as of April 1994, the minimum liability limit would have to increase to $1,830. The Department
believes that in addition to the direct monetary effect on consumers, an unrealistically low minimum liability limit
invites the airlines simply to pay the claims rather than to address the causes of lost, damaged, and delayed baggage.
The Department therefore proposes to raise the minimum liability limit to $1,850 as suggested in the petition, and
seeks comment on this proposal. Carriers are requested to submit the following data on domestic baggage claims for
calender year 1993 as well: (1) the total number of domestic
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 baggage claims for reimbursement and the total amount claimed (i.e., the amount that the claimants requested); (2)
the total amount paid by the carrier in settling those claims; and (3) the number and total dollar amount of such claims
that exceeded $1,250, and the number and total dollar amount that exceeded $1,850. This information will help the
Department to assess the economic burden of the proposal on the affected airlines.

A ``domestic'' claim for this purpose is one that is subject to Part 254. For example, a claim concerning a problem that
occurred on a domestic segment of an international trip would not be included since such transportation is governed
by the Warsaw Convention rather than by Part 254.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the proposal to increase the minimum baggage liability limit to $1,850, the Department requests comment
on two alternate proposals: (1) to raise the minimum limit to $1,850 with a mechanism that automatically provides
for periodic future increases, or (2) to raise the minimum liability limit to $2,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first alternate proposal is an automatic adjustment of the minimum liability limit every other year, calculated
in proportion to any change in the CPIU. When the minimum liability limit was last amended in 1984, the CAB considered
and rejected a rule that would automatically adjust the liability limit based on some specified economic measure.
The CAB believed that such an approach might be unduly confusing for consumers and that it would be administratively
burdensome on carriers to constantly revise tickets and internal guidance. The Department requests comment on whether,
with the increasing sophistication of and reliance on computers, periodic adjustment of the minimum liability limit
would pose less of a burden on the industry today. A more frequent adjustment would make the limit more responsive to
changes in the economy. Comment is also requested on whether there would be a need to provide for additional public
comment before each adjustment rather than simply announcing each new rate by publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and whether there is some other method that would be preferable to changes in the CPIU for calculating appropriate
future changes in the minimum liability limit. As indicated above, the CPIU was the basis used by the CAB to calculate
the 1984 increase to $1,250. Prior to 1984, the CPIU was considered, along with actual baggage claim data, to set the
minimum liability limit. That data has not been collected since the deregulation of the airline industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department also requests comment on its second alternate proposal, to increase the minimum baggage liability
limit to $2,000. Under the current system, which includes notice requirements, passengers are expected to be aware
of the minimum limit and not pack any items of greater value in their luggage unless they desire to purchase excess valuation
or are personally willing to incur the risk. This is not to say that carriers would automatically pay $2,000 to passengers
claiming lost, damaged, or delayed baggage. We wish to make clear that, as is the case today, our proposal would set
the amount below which carriers could not limit their potential liability for provable damages. Thus, carriers could
still decline to pay unjustified claims or pay only for damages actually shown. A $2,000 limitation would have the
advantages of covering most items passengers are likely to pack in baggage, and being easy for passengers to remember
because it is a round number. A collateral benefit of a $2,000 minimum limit would be that, in the event of future inflation,
the limit would not become obsolete soon after issuance. It would also allow longer-term planning than an $1,850 limit,
which might reduce administrative costs to the airlines for training, ticket stock, and computer programming. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department recognizes that carriers will require some period of time to use up existing ticket stock, print new
tickets, and implement other necessary changes under any of the alternatives. The Department seeks comment on whether
60 days from issuance of a final rule is a sufficient time for implementation. In the case that excess ticket stock poses
a particular problem for the airlines, the Department requests comment on whether the use of a sticker or an addendum
stuffed in the ticket envelope would provide adequate notice of the new limit. The Department also seeks comment on
whether a bifurcated implementation would be feasible (e.g., new minimum dollar limit effective in 30 days; implementation
of revised notice requirement effective in 60 days, or upon exhaustion of existing ticket stock). In the case that
the automatically adjusting limit is selected, the Department requests comment on whether a 30-day implementation
period would be sufficient for future adjustments under that proposal. In any event, in view of the publication of
the instant proposal, the Department encourages carriers to exercise prudence in placing large orders for ticket
stock or ticket jackets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The notice requirement has been clarified to better explain that written notice of the liability limit must be provided
whenever air transportation is sold, whether or not the airline actually issues a ticket to the passenger. This is
in response to the recent switch to a ticketless system by a few carriers. Written notice must still be provided to the
passenger in conjunction with the sale of the travel, even though there is no traditional ``ticket'' that the notice
can be printed on.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department has determined that this action is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866
or under the Department's Regulatory Policies and Procedures. A regulatory evaluation that examines the projected
costs and impacts of the proposal has been placed in the docket. The Department certifies that this rule, if adopted,
would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Few airlines are classified
as small entities. However, since the rule could apply to small carriers to the extent that they interline with large
carriers, the Department seeks comment on whether there are unidentified small entity impacts that should be considered.
If comments provide information that there are significant small entity impacts, the Department will prepare a regulatory
flexibility analysis at the final rule stage. The Department does not believe that there would be sufficient federalism
implications to warrant the preparation of a federalism assessment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department is granting a request by the American Society of Travel Agents (ASTA) that ASTA be allowed to withdraw
its petition for a rulemaking to amend the Department's rules on computer reservations systems (CRSs). ASTA had asked
the Department to amend its CRS rules (14 CFR Part 255) to include a prohibition against the inclusion of lost booking
fees in the damages recoverable by a CRS vendor when a travel agency breaches its contract for CRS services before the
end of the contract's term. ASTA is now asking the Department for leave to withdraw its petition on the ground that the
largest CRS vendor has agreed to change its CRS contract practices in a way which will eliminate ASTA's need for a rulemaking.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the United States travel agencies sell the great majority of all airline tickets. In selling air transportation
(and other travel services) travel agencies primarily rely on computer reservations systems to find out what airline
services and fares are available for their customers, to make bookings, and to issue tickets. Each of the CRSs operating
in the United States is owned by one or more airlines or airline holding companies. The nature of the CRS and the airline
businesses gives each operator of a CRS (``the vendor'') a significant ability to prejudice the competitive position
of other airlines and to limit the information on airline services given travel agencies and their customers. The
Civil Aeronautics Board, the agency which had been responsible for airline economic regulation through 1984, therefore
adopted rules regulating CRS operations under section 411 of the Federal Aviation Act (``the Act''), 49 U.S.C. 1381.
Two years ago we revised those rules to further protect airline competition. 14 CFR Part 255, adopted by 57 FR 43780
(September 22, 1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One of the major issues in our rulemaking concerned the contract terms sought by CRS vendors from travel agencies using
a CRS (``subscribers''), since several commonly-used contract terms restricted the subscribers' ability to add
or switch systems. We revised our CRS rules to prohibit certain subscriber contract clauses that appeared to unreasonably
interfere with a travel agency's ability to use more than one system, but we did not adopt other proposals for regulating
subscriber contracts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of parties in the rulemaking had complained that vendors made it difficult for subscribers to switch systems
before the end of the term of their CRS contract by making a subscriber liable for substantial liquidated damages if
it breached the contract. The liquidated damages formulas used by the vendors typically included an element for ``lost
booking fees.'' Booking fees_the fees paid by airlines and other travel suppliers whenever an agency uses a system
to book a travel service_provide most of each vendor's CRS revenues. Lost booking fees are the amount of booking fees
the vendor would have received if the subscriber had continued to use its system during the remaining term of the contract.
In calculating lost booking fees the vendor typically assumed that the subscriber would have used its system for most
of its bookings. The inclusion of lost booking fees in the damages due a vendor on a subscriber's breach of contract
greatly increases the damages obtainable by the vendor from the subscriber and thereby makes it much more costly for
an agency to breach its CRS contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While we decided not to adopt a prohibition against the inclusion of lost booking fees in liquidated damages, we stated
that our rules were intended to give travel agencies the ability to use more than one system and that therefore no vendor
should expect a subscriber to use its system for most of the agency's bookings during the term of the contract. No vendor
could therefore reasonably expect that a subscriber contract would produce a substantial flow of booking fees. As
a result, we concluded that the contract law principles governing liquidated damages would make unenforceable any
contract that required a subscriber to pay damages based on lost booking fees. 57 FR 43827&hyph;43828.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ASTA, the nation's largest travel agency trade association, filed a petition for rulemaking. ASTA urged us to adopt
an express prohibition against the inclusion of lost booking fees in liquidated damages clauses. ASTA alleged that
American Airlines' Sabre system was continuing to use such contract clauses since American argued that its contract
terms were consistent with our rules. ASTA proposed that we amend &sect;255.8 of our rules by adding a subsection that
would prohibit a vendor from requiring a subscriber to pay liquidated damages to the extent that the damages enable
the vendor to recover from the subscriber the booking fees that the vendor would have obtained from participating
airlines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two vendors, Worldspan and System One Direct Access, filed answers supporting ASTA's petition, while American opposed
it. American asserted that its contract provision was merely a means of enforcing its productivity pricing formula,
that the Department determined in the rulemaking that productivity pricing (a form of pricing that reduces a subscriber's
CRS fees when it increases its use of the CRS) was permissible, and that the American contract provision as a practical
matter could not keep an agency from using another system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department invited other persons to file comments on ASTA's petition. 58 FR 41068 (August 2, 1993). In response,
System One, Worldspan, Delta Air Lines (a Worldspan partner), Air France, and three travel agencies (Hewins Travel
Consultants, Travelbound, Inc., and WTT, Inc., d/b/a Woodside Travel Trust) filed comments supporting ASTA's proposal
or similar restrictions on vendor subscriber contracts. American again opposed such proposals. Apollo Travel Services,
the marketing arm of the second largest U.S. CRS, Galileo, stated it was taking no position on ASTA's proposal but took
issue with WTT's alleged misdescription of Apollo's subscriber contracts. In its comments the Orient Airlines Association
asked us to begin a rulemaking on other CRS issues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, ASTA has moved to withdraw its rulemaking petition on the ground that American had agreed with ASTA that in
future subscriber contracts American would substitute an actual damages clause for a liquidated damages clause
and that American would give its subscribers the option of replacing the liquidated damages clause in their existing
contracts with an actual damages clause. American would take these steps within thirty days of our dismissal of ASTA's
rulemaking petition. Since American's agreement had eliminated the cause of ASTA's request for a rulemaking, ASTA
wishes to withdraw its petition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Despite ASTA's request for withdrawal, System One and Worldspan contend that ASTA's agreement with American should
not keep us from proposing new rules on subscriber contracts. They contend that American could demand lost booking
fees as part of its actual damages and that American's productivity pricing formula requires subscribers to guarantee
that American will receive booking fees during the term of their contracts. WTT, a consortium of very large travel
agencies, initially filed a pleading opposing ASTA's motion to withdraw its petition. However, WTT later stated
that it wished to withdraw that opposition. WTT, which prefers market solutions to business problems, has learned
that American is willing to negotiate changes in its subscriber contracts with some agencies. In WTT's opinion, this
means that regulatory action is no longer necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We will grant ASTA's motion to withdraw its petition for rulemaking, and we will terminate this proceeding. We do not
believe that we should begin a rulemaking of the kind sought by Worldspan, System One, Delta, and the two smaller agencies
at this time, even though their comments have cited practices by American and Apollo that may be troublesome. However,
we do not now have detailed knowledge on the effects of our revised CRS rules, which became effective less than two years
ago, nor on other changes that may have affected the operation of the CRS and airline businesses. Rather than begin
a rulemaking, we prefer to begin an informal investigation into these issues. In that investigation we are seeking
information from vendors, airlines, travel agency groups and individual agencies, and other persons with knowledge
of CRSs and related airline marketing issues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
That investigation should give us sufficient knowledge to determine whether we should propose changes to the rules
and, if so, what kind of changes, just as our last rulemaking relied heavily on the examination of the CRS business undertaken
by the Secretary's Task Force on Competition in the Domestic Airline Industry.

vendors to provide us with certain information and inviting vendors, airlines, travel agencies, and other interested
persons to meet with our staff to discuss the issues. Our dismissal of ASTA's petition, of course, will not prevent
us from instituting a new rulemaking on CRS issues if we find one warranted.

Several members of the wine industry have recently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petitioned ATF for approval of the use of 3 wine treating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processes and 1 wine treating material in the production, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cellar treatment, and/or finishing of wine. Only one of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processes, the spinning cone column, is new and would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used to reduce the ethyl alcohol content of wine or to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remove off flavors in wine. The other two processes are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new but either would be used in combination or would be used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for a different purpose or at a different limitation than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously authorized. The processes to be used in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combination are reverse osmosis and ion exchange and would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be used to remove excess volatile acidity from wine. The process which would be used at a different limitation is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ultrafiltration. And finally, the new wine treating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
material, urease enzyme, would be used to reduce urea in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wine, thereby reducing the possibility of ethyl carbamate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formation during wine storage.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and then flows down the upper surface of the stationary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cones under the influence of gravity and moves across the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upper surface of the rotating cones in a thin film due to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the applied centrifugal force. The stripping gas enters the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bottom of the column and flows counter current to the liquid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
phase in the spaces between the fixed and rotating cones. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioners who have requested ATF to approve the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of the SCC wish to use it in the production of low 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alcohol wine, as well as to remove off flavors in wine (e.g. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
volatile acidity, ethyl acetate, hydrogen sulfide, etc.). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the production of low alcohol wine, the feed wine is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initially run through the SCC to recover the volatile wine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flavor essence. In the second stage of processing, the flavor essence reduced wine is run through the SCC to reduce

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the alcohol in the wine to the desired level. The essence, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which has previously been removed, is then added back to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alcohol reduced wine to make a low alcohol wine which, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
according to the petitioners, retains much of its original 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flavor. The alcohol which has been removed from the wine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can then either be used in accordance with law and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations or be destroyed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Treatment of wine utilizing the SCC to remove off 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flavors, or to reduce the alcohol content of the wine, may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not alter the vinous character of the wine. Otherwise, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wine would no longer be considered standard wine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the separation of alcohol from a fermented 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substance is considered to be a distilling process, SCC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations cannot be conducted at winery premises but must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instead take place at distilled spirits plant premises. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In 1991, approval was given for several industry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
members to experiment with the SCC. Since then, a few 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry members have been given permission, pending the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final outcome of the rulemaking process, to commercially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produce reduced alcohol wine and dealcoholized wine using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the SCC process under the following conditions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The SCC removal of any alcohol from the wine will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be done on DSP premises. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Records will be maintained for each lot of wine put 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through the SCC and the fractions derived from such wine showing the date, quantity, and disposition of each fraction.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. In the production of reduced alcohol standard wines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using the SCC, the same amount of essence will be added back 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to any lot of wine as was originally removed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Proprietors must contact their ATF Area Supervisor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior to the destruction of any alcohol or other fractions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
derived from the SCC process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other persons wishing to use the SCC technology to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produce low alcohol and/or dealcoholized wines, or to remove 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
off flavors from wine, should submit letter applications to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATF requesting permission to do so. If it is determined, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through this rulemaking process, that the use of the SCC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technology is in accordance with ``good commercial practice,'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the SCC process will be added to 27 CFR 24.248 at which time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no further letter applications will be required for its use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Reverse Osmosis and Ion Exchange 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
One industry member requested ATF to approve the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reverse osmosis and ion exchange in combination to remove 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
volatile acidity (VA) from bulk wine. The process combines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two technologies already widely in use in the wine industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The process involves utilizing reverse osmosis to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate wine into various components and then using ion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exchange to remove VA. The wine components, minus the VA, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would then be recombined in-line to form the original wine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minus the VA. The whole process takes place in a closed system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulations at 27 CFR 24.248 are currently broad enough 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to allow ion exchange to be used to remove volatile acidity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from wine or from various components of wine. However, this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section of regulations does not currently authorize reverse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
osmosis to be used for anything other than to reduce the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ethyl alcohol content of wine. The regulation change that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is being proposed in this document will allow reverse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
osmosis to also be used to remove off flavors in wine, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would enable it to be used as part of an overall process in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a closed system to remove VA from wine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Normally, reverse osmosis must be done on distilled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spirits plant premises because it is considered a distilling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process resulting in a distilled spirits by-product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, in this case, the various components of wine will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only be created temporarily in a closed system and will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediately recombined in-line to reconstitute the original 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wine minus VA. ATF has concluded that this type of reverse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
osmosis may be conducted on bonded winery premises since no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate distilled spirits product is created as a final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product or by-product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Absolutely no accumulation of ethyl alcohol outside the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
closed system will be allowed. Such accumulation of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ethanol solution on winery premises would subject the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proprietor to the distilled spirits tax of $13.50 per proof 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gallon imposed by Section 5001 of the Internal Revenue Code.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ATF has approved the application from the industry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
member, pending the final outcome of the rulemaking process, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to use these two processes in a closed system to remove VA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from wine. Other persons wishing to use these two processes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a similar fashion should submit letter applications to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATF requesting permission to do so. If it is determined, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through this rulemaking process, that the use of reverse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
osmosis and ion exchange in combination in a closed system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to remove VA from wine is in accordance with ``good 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial practice,'' this procedure will be authorized in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
27 CFR 24.248 by amending the use column of reverse osmosis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to state that it can be used to remove off flavors in wine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Once this change to the regulations is made, no further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
letter applications will be required to use these two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processes in combination in a closed system to remove VA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from wine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The footnote concerning processes which must be done on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distilled spirits plant premises, located at the end of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
27 CFR 24.248, has been revised to state that under certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited conditions, reverse osmosis may be used on bonded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
winery premises if ethyl alcohol is only temporarily created 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within a closed system.

Ultrafiltration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
An industry member has requested that the limitation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposed on the use of ultrafiltration by 27 CFR 24.248 be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changed to allow transmembrane pressures greater than 100 pounds per square inch (psi). The industry member states

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that they need to employ transmembrane pressures of up to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately 200 psi rather than the current maximum of 100 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
psi which is provided for in &sect;24.248. The industry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
member indicates that their laboratory tests have shown an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase in throughput of 4 to 5-fold when the pressure is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increased from 100 to 150 psi with no change in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
character of the finished wine. Without this increase in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
throughput, the industry member states that the process is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not economically viable since they can achieve the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result with other methods at a much lower cost. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The industry member states that they chose the less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 200 psi limitation as the upper limit in order to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintain a clear distinction between ultrafiltration and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reverse osmosis in terms of pressure. The industry member 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
points out that the two processes are also differentiated by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fact that the membranes specified for reverse osmosis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have a much smaller pore size than those used in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ultrafiltration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The industry member submitted two samples of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ultrafiltered apple wine to the ATF laboratory for analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first sample was processed at 95 psi and the second 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sample was processed at 195 psi. The ATF laboratory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis, based on the analytical data and on an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organoleptic evaluation, showed there is no significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difference between the samples at these different pressure ratings. As a result of this analysis, the ATF laboratory

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stated that the basic character of the wine was not altered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by increasing the authorized pressure rating from 100 psi to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
195 psi. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, ATF approved the industry member's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request to be allowed to use pressures of less than 200 psi 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when conducting operations using ultrafiltration. Other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry members wishing to use ultrafiltration at higher 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pressures may submit letter applications to ATF requesting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permission to do so. ATF may require samples prior to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
giving such approval. If it is determined through the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking process that ultrafiltration using pressures of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less than 200 psi is considered ``good commercial practice,'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
then the regulations will be changed to incorporate this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more liberal pressure limitation.

An industry member has requested to be allowed to use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
urease enzyme derived from 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lactobacillus fermentum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to reduce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels of naturally occurring urea in wine to prevent the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formation of ethyl carbamate during storage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The enzyme is derived from the nonpathogenic,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lactobacillus fermentum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. It 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contains the enzyme urease (CAS Reg. No. 9002&hyph;13&hyph;5) which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilitates the hydrolysis of urea to ammonia and carbon dioxide. It is produced by a pure culture fermentation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process and by using materials that are generally recognized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as safe (GRAS) or are food additives that have been approved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for this use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lactobacillus fermentum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 was approved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for use in wine by FDA on December 21, 1992, effective

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The manufacturer of the urease enzyme, Takeda Chemical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Industries, Ltd., has also submitted several letters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confirming that the urease enzyme preparation is derived 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lactobacillus fermentum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The company states that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enzyme is standardized with glucose syrup solids and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
urease activity is adjusted to 3.5 units/mg. The company 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicates that the urease enzyme meets the general and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional requirements for enzyme preparations in the ``Food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chemicals Codex,'' 3rd edition (1981). In addition, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
urease enzyme is used in food at levels not to exceed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current good manufacturing practice as defined in 21 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
184.1924. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Takeda Chemical Industries, Ltd., states that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
composition of the urease enzyme preparation is as follows: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Glucose Syrup Solids 65&hyph;80% 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Takeda also states that they have confirmed that due to the low usage level (10&hyph;200 ppm) and objective of usage,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition of glucose syrup solids in this case is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered ``sweetening'' of the beverage, which is prohibited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the State of California for table wine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The industry member states that urease enzyme derived 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lactobacillus fermentum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is economically self-limiting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
due to the high cost of the material. In addition, FDA, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their approval, did not set a specific numerical limit but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rather limited its use to ``good commercial practice.'' The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry member states that if a numerical limit needs to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
set, it should be set no lower than 200 mg/L. The industry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
member also indicated that no water is required to use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
urease enzyme. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The industry member also submitted to the ATF 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laboratory two 750-milliliter samples of wine, one before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and one after treatment, as well as a sample of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
material. Based on an analysis of the samples and an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organoleptic evaluation, the ATF laboratory concluded there 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were no significant differences between the control and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experimental wine samples. The ATF laboratory stated that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they have no objections to this enzyme preparation being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used as a wine treating material at a maximum usage rate of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
200 mg/L provided that the enzyme is filtered prior to final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is hereby certified that this regulation will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of small entities. This regulation is liberalizing in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nature and will allow winemakers more flexibility when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
producing their wines with no negative impact on small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities. Accordingly, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required because the proposal, if promulgated
as a final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule, is not expected (1) to have secondary, or incidental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects on a substantial number of small entities; or (2) to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impose, or otherwise cause a significant increase in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting, recordkeeping, or other compliance burdens on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this proposed regulation is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not a significant regulatory action as defined by Executive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Order 12866. Accordingly this proposal is not subject to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the analysis required by this Executive Order.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On April 5, 1994, OSHA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking addressing indoor air quality issues, including environmental
tobacco smoke in the workplace. 59 FR 15968. On June 14, 1994 OSHA issued a supplemental notice giving parties until
August 13, 1994 to submit comments; until August 5, 1994 to file notices of intention to appear; and until August 13,
1994 to submit testimony and evidence. The hearing was scheduled to start September 20, 1994. 59 FR 30560. These dates
were 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 16, OSHA announced in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, (59 FR 47570) that the hearing in addition to running from September 20 through October 14, 1994, would also continue
October 24 through November 22, 1994 and from November 29 into the week of December 5, 1994 because of the large number
of participants who wished to testify. These dates are being modified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 22, 1994 the Administrative Law Judge ordered the postponement of the hearings for the weeks of October
3&hyph;7, 1994 and November 7&hyph;10, 1994 to permit time to develop a better record. Those weeks are being rescheduled
for December 5 through December 16, 1994. Witnesses scheduled for the two postponed weeks of October 3&hyph;7 and
November 7&hyph;10 will generally be rescheduled for December 5&hyph;16, 1994. An updated schedule will be mailed
to participants and will be available by calling the OSHA Office of Consumer Affairs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The persons who had requests to testify filed by marketing firms had been scheduled to testify December 5, 1994. Their
testimony will be rescheduled at a date to be announced later. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this notice, OSHA is also announcing the location the hearing, for the third and subsequent weeks, the Auditorium

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
At the request of the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development, the Coast Guard is considering a change
to the regulation governing the operation of the swing span bridge on Route LA 12 over the Sabine River, mile 40.8 near
Starks, between Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana and Newton County, Texas, by permitting the draw to remain closed to
navigation at all times. The draw presently opens on call with 24 hours advance notice, however, there is no significant
navigation on the waterway and there have been no requests to open the bridge for passage of marine traffic for 20 years.

The Coast Guard encourages interested persons to participate in this rulemaking by submitting written data, views,
or arguments. Persons submitting comments should include their names and addresses, identify this rulemaking (CGD08&hyph;94&hyph;025)
and the specific section of this proposal to which each comment applies, and give the reason for each comment. The Coast
Guard requests that all comments and attachments be submitted in an unbound format suitable for copying and electronic
filing. If not practical, a second copy of any bound materials is requested. Persons wanting acknowledgment of receipt
of comments should enclose a stamped, self-addressed postcard or envelope.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Background and Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Upon request by the bridge owner, the Coast Guard is considering permitting the draw to remain permanently closed.
Navigation requiring openings is non-existent and the bridge has not been opened for twenty years. There is no commercial
navigation on the waterway in the vicinity of the bridge crossing. Vertical clearance of the bridge in the closed position
is 6 feet above mean high water and 20 feet above low water. The occasional small recreational boat which uses the waterway
can transit the bridge without requiring an opening. Permitting the permanent closure of the draw would result in
a significant savings in maintenance costs with no effect on navigational traffic.

Regulatory Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is not a significant regulatory action under Section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an
assessment of potential cost and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by
the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040); February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic
impact of this rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies
and procedures of DOT is unnecessary.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.), The Coast Guard must consider whether this rule will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant
in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act
(15 U.S.C. 632). Because it expects the impact of this proposal to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C.
605(b) that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Patent and Trademark Office (Office) proposes to amend the rules of practice relating to submission of affidavits
or declarations under 37 CFR 1.131(a) to implement the relevant provisions of Public Law No. 103&hyph;182 and the
GATT (General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs), and to provide relief in certain circumstances where a common assignee
holds both an application and a patent claiming patentably indistinct, but not identical, inventions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Public Law No. 103&hyph;182 (November 4, 1993) implementing the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), amended
35 U.S.C. 104 to provide that for the purpose of obtaining a patent, an applicant can show a date of invention in the United
States, or in a NAFTA country which occurred after the date of implementation (i.e., December 8, 1993). Although GATT
enabling legislation has not been passed, these proposed rule changes assume that it will be passed, and therefore
changes to 37 CFR 1.131(a) similar to NAFTA would be required. See Article 27, paragraph 1, of the Agreement on Trade-related
Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, Including Trade in Counterfeit Goods, of the GATT. In the event that the
GATT enabling legislation is not enacted when the final rules are published, the proposed rule changes relative to
the GATT will be withdrawn.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office proposes to amend 37 CFR 1.131(a), which is currently limited to facts showing a completion of the invention
in the United States, to allow for a submission of facts in an affidavit or declaration that show completion of the invention
in a NAFTA or a World Trade Organization (WTO) Member country. The WTO is established under the GATT agreement to resolve
disputes between signatories to the agreement. The facts presented must demonstrate completion of the invention
prior to the effective date of a reference thought to bar the grant of a patent or the patentability of a claim in a patent
under reexamination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the Office recognizes that there is a potential conflict between existing 37 CFR 1.131(a) and 37 CFR
1.602(a). Section 1.131(a) prohibits affidavits or declarations thereunder when the same patentable invention
as defined in 37 CFR 1.601(n) (i.e., patentably indistinct inventions) is claimed. An interference under 35 U.S.C.
135, rather than antedating under &sect;1.131(a), is generally the available remedy. However, 37 CFR 1.602(a) provides
that when the applications or the application and patent are owned by a single party, interferences are not declared
or continued unless good cause is shown. This can result in a hardship where there is an issued patent that can no longer
be amended as by filing a continuation-in-part application. Where there are two or more pending applications, the
conflict can be avoided by filing a continuation-in-part application incorporating the conflicting inventions
in a single application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Office proposes to amend 37 CFR 1.131 to broaden its application to a single party where inventions of a pending
application and a patent held by the party are patentably indistinct but not identical. Under the proposed additions
to &sect;1.131, an affidavit or declaration could be filed by a party to avoid a 35 U.S.C. 103 rejection based on a 35
U.S.C. 102(a) or (e) patent owned by that party, where the patent claimed an invention that was patentably indistinct,
but not identical to an invention claimed in an application or patent undergoing reexamination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed addition to &sect;1.131 would not affect the use of the issued patent in a rejection based on double patenting.
However, where patentably indistinct but not identical inventions are claimed, a double patenting rejection can
be avoided by filing an appropriate terminal disclaimer. In addition, petitions under &sect;1.183 will be entertained
for waiver of &sect;1.131 requirements in appropriate instances where two pending applications claiming patentably
indistinct but not identical inventions are held by a single party.

Discussion of Specific Rules
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1.131(a), if amended to (a)(1) as proposed, would allow a &sect;1.131 affiant or declarant to rely upon facts
occurring in a NAFTA or a WTO Member country to show completion of the invention. The term ``domestic'' would be changed
to ``U.S.'' The section is proposed to be amended from a single sentence to three sentences.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1.131(a)(2), if added as proposed, would limit the availability of acts showing completion of the invention
in a NAFTA or WTO Member country to those acts occurring subsequent to the effective date of the agreements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1.131(a)(3), if added as proposed, would allow a showing of prior invention to be made in a pending application
or a patent that is undergoing reexamination where a single party holds both the application or patent undergoing
reexamination and another patent where the claimed inventions were, at the time the later invention was made, both
owned by the single party or subject to an obligation of assignment to that party. Further, in order to rely on proposed
&sect;1.131(a)(3), the inventions claimed in the application or in the patent undergoing reexamination and in the
other patent must not be identical as set forth in 35 U.S.C. 102.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Other Considerations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule changes are in conformity with the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601
et seq., Executive Order 12612, and the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. The Office of Management
and Budget has determined that the proposed rule changes are not significant for the purposes of E.O. 12866.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Assistant General Counsel for Legislation and Regulation of the Department of Commerce has certified to the Chief
Counsel for Advocacy, Small Business Administration, that the proposed rule changes will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities (Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b)), because
the proposed rules would affect only a small number of applications and would provide a streamlined and simplified
procedure, eliminating the need for requesting waiver of the rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Patent and Trademark Office has also determined that this notice has no Federalism implications affecting the
relationship between the National Government and the States as outlined in Executive Order 12612.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These rule changes will not impose any additional burden under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501
et seq.

 The EPA is proposing to revise its definition of volatile organic compounds (VOC) for purposes of preparing State
implementation plans (SIP's) to attain the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for ozone under title
I of the Clean Air Act (Act) and for the Federal implementation plan for the Chicago ozone nonattainment area. The proposed
revision would add acetone to the list of compounds excluded from the definition of VOC on the basis that these compounds
have negligible contribution to tropospheric ozone formation.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Three petitions have been received by the EPA asking that acetone be added to the list of negligibly-reactive compounds
in the definition of VOC at 40 CFR 51.100(s). These petitions were submitted by Eastman Chemical Company and Hoechst
Celanese Corporation on April 26, 1993, Hickory Springs Manufacturing Company on May 6, 1993, and the Chemical Manufacturers
Association on May 14, 1993. Along with their petitions and in supplemental submissions, these organizations submitted
a variety of scientific materials which support the assertion that acetone is of negligible photochemical reactivity.
These materials have been added to the docket for this rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioners based their request for the exclusion of acetone on a demonstration that the photochemical reactivity
of acetone is not appreciably different from that of ethane, which is the most reactive compound on the current list
of compounds which are named in the definition of VOC as being of negligible reactivity. Acetone's photochemical
reactivity arises through two chemical pathways: through reaction with hydroxyl (OH) radicals (k
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
OH
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reactivity) and through photolysis. Data on the reaction of OH radicals with various organic compounds are reported
in a review article (Atkinson, R. (1990), ``Gas_Phase Tropospheric Chemistry of Organic Compounds: A Review.''

photodecomposition, or photolysis, in the atmosphere to form radicals, which tend to cause increased rates of ozone
formation. Total reactivity of acetone, considering both k

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reactivity and photolysis, was the subject of a special study reported recently (Carter, W. P. L. et al., ``An Experimental
and Modeling Study of the Photochemical Ozone Reactivity of Acetone,'' University of California/Riverside, December
10, 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Carter report describes a series of environmental chamber experiments and computer model simulations carried
out to assess the tendency of acetone to promote ozone formation under atmospheric conditions, relative to that of
ethane. This was done by calculating and comparing the ``incremental reactivities'' of acetone and ethane for a variety
of atmospheric conditions representing ozone episodes in 39 urban areas throughout the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Incremental reactivity'' is the most recently proposed quantitative measure of the degree to which a VOC contributes
to ozone formation in a photochemical air pollution episode. It is defined as the amount of additional ozone formation
resulting from the addition of a small amount of VOC to the urban emissions, divided by the amount of compound added.
This measure of reactivity takes into account all of the factors by which a VOC affects ozone formation, including
the effect of the environment where the VOC reacts. The latter is important because the amount of ozone formation caused
by the reactions of a VOC depends significantly on the conditions within the polluted atmosphere, such as VOC to nitrogen
oxide (NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) ratio, VOC composition, and sunlight intensity. Figure 1 shows distribution plots of the reactivity of acetone
relative to that of ethane for the 39 urban scenarios used, where reactivity is defined in terms of grams of ozone formed
per gram of VOC emitted. (Use of the unit grams of ozone formed per gram of VOC emitted is significant. Another way of
defining reactivity is in terms of grams of ozone formed per mole of VOC emitted, which would give different results.
For practicality, the EPA has elected to adopt the grams ozone per gram VOC basis, since grams (or tons), rather than
moles, is the mass unit used in regulations dealing with VOC emissions.) In Figure 1, acetone/ethane reactivity ratios
less than 1.0 indicate scenarios where acetone is less reactive than ethane. The acetone/ethane reactivity ratio,
as reported by Carter, appears to have widely varying values among the 39 urban scenarios and to reflect, with a few
exceptions, slightly lower reactivity for acetone. For one scenario, which represents unusually high NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 conditions, acetone was calculated to be over two times more reactive than ethane. This is due to the unusually low
reactivity of ethane for that particular scenario, rather than to higher acetone reactivity. Figure 2 shows the variability
of ethane reactivity relative to that of a ``typical'' urban VOC mix. Figure 2 also shows that the reactivity range
of acetone falls entirely within the range for ethane.

Although there are uncertainties in acetone's atmospheric photo-oxidation mechanism and in the other aspects of
ozone-related atmospheric photochemistry, one can reasonably deduce, based on the Carter report, that acetone
and ethane probably have nearly the same reactivity for most sets of environmental conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional studies have been conducted on the relative reactivity of acetone in Europe. For example, R. G. Derwent
and M. E. Jenkins (Hydrocarbons and the Long-range Transport of Ozone and PAN Across Europe, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Atmospheric Environment
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, vol 24A, pp 1661&hyph;1678, 1991) used a chemical mechanism to calculate ozone impacts of acetone, ethane, and other
VOC for three trajectories across Europe. The photochemical trajectory model the authors employed was developed
at Harwell Laboratory (United Kingdom) and was used to calculate the photochemical ozone creation potential (POCP)
values for 69 organic compounds, including acetone. The POCP values were assigned to VOC species according to a relative
scale, with ethylene having a value of 100. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dr. Derwent reported in a letter (January 27, 1994) to EPA that: ``A comparison of POCP's for ethane and acetone in the
work of my colleagues at Harwell Laboratory, which incidentally updates the acetone entries in the VOC Protocol Annex,
gives 8.2 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->

 2.0, respectively.'' The difference between these numbers is not considered to be statistically significant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If acetone is accepted as having negligible photochemical reactivity, exempting acetone from regulation as an ozone
precursor could contribute to the achievement of several important environmental goals. For example, acetone can
be used as a substitute for several compounds that are listed as hazardous air pollutants (HAP) under section 112 of
the Act. Methylene chloride and methyl chloroform are HAP that are used for metal cleaning and for flexible polyurethane
foam blowing. Other HAP, such as toluene, are often used as solvents in paints and coatings. Acetone can substitute
for these substances in some circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Acetone can also be used as a substitute for ozone depleting substances (ODS) which are active in depleting the stratospheric
ozone layer. Under the London Amendments to the Montreal Protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer (``Montreal
Protocol''), the United States agreed to phase out production and consumption of certain chlorofluorocarbons (CFC)
by the year 2000 and methyl chloroform by 2005 (see 58 FR 15016 (March 18, 1993)). In 1990, Congress added title VI to
the Act in part to provide for the implementation of this phaseout (see 42 U.S.C. 7671 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The 1990 Amendments specified an initial list of Class I and Class II ODS, authorizing EPA to add compounds to both
lists depending on a given compound's potential to contribute to stratospheric ozone depletion, (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Id
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. &sect;7671a.) The 1990 Amendments further required phaseout of the production and consumption of Class I ODS by
2000, methyl chloroform by 2002, and Class II ODS by 2030 (see 42 U.S.C. 7671c, 7671d). At the fourth meeting, in 1992,
of the parties to the Montreal Protocol in Copenhagen, Denmark, the parties adjusted the phaseout schedules for Class
I substances under the Montreal Protocol to phase out Class I CFC and methyl chloroform by 1996. In 1993, EPA proposed
to accelerate the phaseout of Class I CFC and methyl chloroform in order to discontinue use of these compounds after

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
January 1, 1996 (see 58 FR 15022). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of these phaseout deadlines, there is a need to develop substitutes for ODS. Allowing wider use of acetone
will facilitate the transition away from ODS without adversely affecting efforts to control ground level ozone concentrations.
For example, chlorofluorocarbon-11 and methyl chloroform have been used as foam-blowing agents in the manufacture
of polyurethane foam. These compounds are also used in metal cleaning in the aircraft manufacturing industry. Both
CFC&hyph;11 and methyl chloroform are listed as Class I substances under title VI of the Act, i.e., as substances that
have the highest stratospheric ozone- depleting potential. Acetone may be able to be used as a foam-blowing agent
and cleaning agent in place of these chemicals.

The EPA has already listed acetone as an acceptable ozone-depleting substance substitute under the program known
as the ``Significant New Alternatives Policy'' (SNAP) program, (59 FR 13044, March 18, 1994). Within the context
of the SNAP rule, substitutes are ``acceptable'' if they are technically feasible to be used as an alternative to an
ODS for particular uses and give reduced overall risk to human health and the the environment compared to the ODS they
replace. In the SNAP rule, EPA listed acetone as an acceptable substitute for flexible polyurethane foam blowing
(59 FR 13132). The SNAP rule lists ketones (which include acetone) as an acceptable substitute for solvent cleaning
in metal cleaning, electronics cleaning, and precision cleaning (59 FR 13134). Ketones are also listed in the SNAP
rule as an acceptable substitute solvent for aerosols and for adhesives, coatings, and inks (59 FR 13145).

In each of these areas of concern, toxic air emissions and depletion of stratospheric ozone, adding acetone to the
list of negligibly-reactive VOC will support the EPA's pollution prevention efforts. By enacting the Pollution
Prevention Act of 1990, Congress established as a national policy that ``pollution should be prevented or reduced
at the source whenever feasible'' (42 U.S.C. 13). An important part of EPA's pollution prevention strategy is encouraging
companies to use substitutes in their production processes that are more environmentally benign than the substances
they currently use. For example, in its blueprint for a comprehensive national pollution prevention strategy, (56
FR 7849 (February 26, 1991)), the EPA recognized that the definition of pollution prevention includes a ``switch
to non-toxic or less toxic substitutes'' (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

. at 7854). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National air emissions of acetone from industrial sources were estimated to be 80,000 tons per year in 1991. It should
be noted that due to the high volatility of acetone, increased use of acetone for metal cleaning will most likely increase
emissions of the compound to the air.

II. The EPA Response to the Petition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the scientific data presented in the material submitted by the petitioners, EPA accepts the conclusion that
acetone is not appreciably different from ethane in terms of photochemical reactivity. The EPA is responding to the
petitions by proposing in this notice to add acetone to the list of compounds appearing in 40 CFR 51.100(s) that are
considered to be negligibly reactive and are thus excluded from the definition of VOC for ozone SIP and ozone control
purposes. The revised definition will apply in the Chicago ozone nonattainment area pursuant to the 40 CFR 52.741(a)(3)
definition of volatile organic material or volatile organic compound. States are not obligated to exclude from control
as a VOC those compounds that EPA has found to be negligibly reactive. However, if this proposal is made final, EPA will
not enforce measures controlling acetone as part of a federally-approved ozone SIP. In addition, once this proposal
is made final, States should not include acetone in their VOC emissions inventories for determining reasonable further
progress under the Act (e.g., section 182(b)(1)) and may not take credit for controlling acetone in their ozone control
strategy. Further, after this proposal is made final, acetone may not be used for emissions netting (e.g., 40 CFR 51.166(b)(2)(c)),
offsetting (40 CFR appendix S), or trading with reactive VOC (Emissions Trading Policy Statement, 51 FR 43814, December
4, 1986 and Economic Incentive Program Rules, 59 FR 16690, April 7, 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since acetone will no longer be treated as a VOC, a State should revise its base year inventory and plans that rely on
that inventory (e.g., the 15 percent plan) to remove acetone and the VOC emissions reduction credit taken from controlling
acetone. To avoid unnecessary work, however, States may account for the fraction of the VOC inventory that acetone
comprises or the amount of reduction claimed for controlling acetone. If the acetone fraction in the inventory or
the amount of control claimed is not significant for a particular area, EPA would not expect a State to revise its emissions
inventory or a plan based on that inventory to account for the revised VOC definition.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, corrections are made to the names of three compounds which have previously been exempted from the definition
of VOC; 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane (CFC&hyph;113) is changed to 1,1,2-trichloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethane
(CFC&hyph;113); chlorodifluoromethane (CFC&hyph;22) is changed to chlorodifluoromethane (HCFC&hyph;22);
and trifluoromethane (FC&hyph;23) is changed to trifluoromethane (HFC&hyph;23). These changes are corrections
to nomenclature only and are not substantive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities because it relaxes current regulatory requirements rather than imposing new ones. The EPA
has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' under the terms of Executive Order 12866 and is, therefore, not
subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review. This action does not contain any information collection
requirements subject to OMB review under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501

.). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assuming this rulemaking is subject to section 317 of the Act, the Administrator concludes, weighing the Agency's
limited resources and other duties, that it is not practicable to conduct an extensive economic impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment of today's action since this rule will relax current regulatory requirements. Accordingly, the Administrator
simply notes that any costs of complying with today's action, any inflationary or recessionary effects of the regulation,
and any impact on the competitive standing of small businesses, on consumer costs, or on energy use, will be less than
or at least not more than the impact that existed before today's action.

I. Background and Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required under title V of the Clean Air Act (``the Act'') as amended (1990), EPA has promulgated rules which define
the minimum elements of an approvable State operating permits program and the corresponding standards and procedures
by which the EPA will approve, oversee, and withdraw approval of State operating permits programs (see 57 FR 32250
(July 21, 1992). These rules are codified at 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 70. Title V requires States to
develop, and submit to EPA, programs for issuing these operating permits to all major stationary sources and to certain
other sources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act requires that States develop and submit these programs to EPA by November 15, 1993, and that EPA act to approve
or disapprove each program within 1 year after receiving the submittal. 40 CFR 70.4(e)(2), however, allows the Administrator
to extend the review period of a State's submittal if the State's submission is materially altered during the one-year
review period. This additional review period may not extend beyond one year following receipt of the revised submission.
EPA received material changes to Illinois' submission on April 18, 1994, and July 18, 1994. In addition, the State
requested on May 16, 1994, that EPA include the State's insignificant activities regulations, currently undergoing
rulemaking at the state level, in EPA's final rulemaking on the State's submittal. 35 Illinois Administrative Code
201 (35 IAC 201). Because these material changes stopped EPA's final review clock, a final EPA action on the State's
submittal may not occur by November 15, 1994. EPA will act expeditiously to promulgate a final notice on the State's
revised submission after the publication of this proposal and formal adoption of all State rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA's program review occurs pursuant to section 502 of the Act and the part 70 regulations, which together outline
criteria for approval or disapproval. Where a program substantially, but not fully, meets the requirements of part
70, EPA may grant the program interim approval for a period of up to 2 years. If EPA has not fully approved a program by
2 years after the November 15, 1993, date, or by the end of an interim program, it must establish and implement a Federal
program.

A. Analysis of State Submission
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA is proposing to grant interim approval to the operating permits program submitted by Illinois on November
15, 1993. While Illinois' program substantially meets the requirements of 40 CFR part 70, certain deficiencies must
be corrected in the State's submittal before EPA can fully approve the State's submittal. This document will outline
the corrections necessary for full approval.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For more detailed information on the analysis of the State's submission, please refer to the part 70 Operating Permits
Program Review Checklist and technical support document accompanying this approval.

1. Support Materials
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A letter from Jim Edgar, Governor of the State of Illinois, to Administrator Carol Browner, accompanying the State's
submittal, names the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) as the state agency responsible for the administration
of Illinois' title V operating permit program throughout the entire state. Since the State entitles its title V operating
permit program the ``Clean Air Act Permit Program (CAAPP)'', CAAPP will be used throughout this document when referencing
the State's program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also included in the State's submittal is a narrative description of the CAAPP summarizing how the State will meet
the requirements of 40 CFR part 70 and a legal opinion from
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Roland W. Burris, Attorney General of the State of Illinois, certifying that the legal authority exists for the State
to administer and enforce the title V program. According to the narrative and a specific request from the State referenced
above, the State intends to develop future regulations governing insignificant activities. The State anticipates
that these regulations will be finalized by the time of EPA's final action on this submittal. The narrative also describes
the existing federally enforceable state operating permit program (FESOP), previously approved by EPA, that the
State will utilize to allow sources to limit their potential to emit through federally enforceable operating restrictions
to avoid title V requirements. The Illinois CAAPP submittal contains all the elements required by 40 CFR 70.4(b).
Although the State's submittal does not include an Implementation Agreement, the State and EPA will soon develop
an implementation agreement that accounts for the implementation issues unique to Illinois' CAAPP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The majority of the State's program is found in section 39.5 of the Illinois Environmental Protection Act. 415 ILCS
5/39.5. Additional regulations are found in 35 IAC 270, 105, 106, 252, 253, and draft versions of both 201 and 211.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a. Applicability
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Illinois program meets the requirements of 40 CFR 70.2 and 70.3 for applicability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b. Permit Applications
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Illinois program substantially meets the requirements of 40 CFR 70.5 for permit applications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One permit application issue will require a legislative amendment before EPA can fully approve the State's program.
The current State legislative provision concerning source certification of applications, 415 ILCS 5/39.5(5)(e),
does not require the responsible official certifying a document to make a ``reasonable inquiry'' or that the statement
be based upon ``information and belief'' according to 40 CFR 70.5(d) and 70.6(c)(1). The State must amend this provision
in its legislation to ensure that certifications by responsible officials comply with all Federal requirements,
namely that the official has made a reasonable inquiry and that the certification is based upon information and belief.
EPA is, therefore, proposing interim approval until this deficiency is corrected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another potential deficiency in the State's program concerns insignificant activities. Illinois is currently
developing regulations for insignificant activities in 35 IAC 201 and 211. The regulations propose insignificant
emission limits for hazardous air pollutants (HAP), specific categories of insignificant activities or emission
levels of all regulated pollutants, and provisions to allow sources to propose their own insignificant activities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Insignificant activity thresholds which are considered to be acceptable by EPA for Illinois' program would fall
in the range of 1&hyph;2 tons per year for criteria pollutants and the de minimis levels established under 112(g) or
lower for HAPs. These insignificance levels are appropriate for the State's program because of the 25 ton per year
major source threshold level established in the State's severe ozone nonattainment areas, and because of the overall
major source threshold level for HAPs established at 10 tons per year of one HAP and 25 tons per year of any combination
of HAPs. Illinois' insignificant activity regulations establish insignificance levels of no more than 1 lb/hr of
any non-HAP (approximately 4 tons per year) and no more than .1 lb/hr of any HAP (approximately .4 tons per year) per
emission unit. Because Illinois' insignificant activity regulations fail to comply with EPA's notion of acceptable
thresholds, EPA could only propose interim approval for the State's 201 and 211 regulations. If EPA's concerns are
addressed in the State's final regulations before final action on this notice, then EPA can fully approve the State's
insignificant activities. Alternatively, if the State does not address EPA's concerns before final action on this
notice, then EPA's final action will include an interim approval on this issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
c. Permit Issuance, Renewal, Reopenings and Revisions
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Illinois program meets the requirements of 40 CFR 70.7(h) for public participation and 40 CFR 70.7(e)(2) minor
modifications. Two interim approval issues exist, however, with respect to the State's definition of administrative
permit amendment. 415 ILCS 5/39.5(13)(c)(vi) allows incorporation of revised limitations or other requirements
resulting from the application of an approved economic incentives rule, a marketable permits rule or generic emissions
trading rule into a CAAPP permit through the administrative amendment procedure. Since 40 CFR 70.7(d) does not allow
the use of an administrative permit amendment to accomplish incorporation of emissions trades into a part 70 permit,
the State's definition of administrative amendment is one basis for the EPA's proposal to grant interim approval
of the State's program. The State must amend its legislation to require the use of the significant modification procedure
to incorporate emission trades into a CAAPP permit before the EPA can fully approve the State's definition of administrative
amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second interim approval issue is found in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
415 ILCS 5/39.5(13)(c)(v). The State's program allows incorporation of requirements from preconstruction review
permits authorized under an EPA-approved preconstruction permit program into a CAAPP permit through the administrative
amendment procedure, provided that the permit meets procedural and compliance requirements substantially equivalent
to those in the State's CAAPP permit issuance process (emphasis added). The EPA encourages the use of the administrative
amendment procedure to incorporate preconstruction review permits into part 70 permits. Nevertheless, 40 CFR 70.7(d)(1)(v)
allows such incorporation only when the State's preconstruction review program meets procedural and compliance
requirements substantially equivalent to the requirements of 40 CFR 70.7 and 70.8 that would be applicable to the
change if it were subject to review as a permit modification, and compliance requirements substantially equivalent
to those contained in 40 CFR 70.6. The EPA interprets 40 CFR part 70 to require that the State's part 70 regulations or
preconstruction permit program detail the actual procedural and compliance requirements necessary to incorporate
preconstruction permits into part 70 permits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For full approval of the State's program, the State would need to develop regulations detailing the actual procedural
and compliance requirements necessary for incorporation of preconstruction permits into part 70 permits. These
regulations would need to supplement the State's title V submittal or be submitted as a revision to the State's preconstruction
permit program state implementation plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
d. Permit Content
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another major component of the State's program concerns the contents of a CAAPP permit. The State's CAAPP substantially
meets the requirements of 40 CFR 70.6, including the requirements for operational flexibility. A CAAPP permit will
incorporate applicable requirements of existing State Implementation Plans (SIP), as well as any future applicable
requirements promulgated by EPA. Legislative authority exists in 415 ILCS 5/39.5(11) to develop general permits
covering numerous similar sources, except for sources subject to the Acid Rain Program. These general permits are
targeted for future development.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One issue of EPA concern with State programs is the ability of a part 70 source to obtain a waiver from any applicable
requirement. The Illinois Pollution Control Board (IPCB) has the authority to issue a variance from requirements
imposed by State law. 415 ILCS 5/35&hyph;38, previously approved into the State's SIP for non-part 70 sources, allows
the IPCB discretion to grant relief from compliance with State rules and regulations. The EPA regards this provision
as wholly external to the program submitted for approval under part 70, and consequently is proposing to take no action
on this provision of State law. The EPA has no authority to approve provisions of State law, such as the variance provisions
referred to, which are inconsistent with the CAA. The EPA does not recognize the ability of a permitting authority
or other state entity to grant relief from the duty to comply with the terms of a federally enforceable part 70 permit,
except where such relief is granted through procedures allowed by part 70. For example, 40 CFR 70.6(g) defines the
circumstances under which an affirmative defense can be raised when an action is brought against a source for noncompliance
with a permit condition. The EPA reserves the right to enforce the terms of the part 70 permit where the permitting authority
or other state entity purports to grant relief from the duty to comply with a part 70 permit in a manner inconsistent
with part 70 procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
415 ILCS 5/39.5(5)(s) and 35 IAC 270.408 of the State's submittal incorporate previously approved SIP provisions
into the CAAPP program (35 IAC 201.261 through 201.265) which allow an owner or operator of a CAAPP source to include
within its CAAPP application a request for permission to operate during a startup, malfunction, or breakdown. These
provisions appear to allow sources to exceed emission limits and standards of the State's SIP, but are not applicable
to any other requirements of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
title V permit. Since sources that request these exceedances must request them in their CAAPP applications, EPA will
have the opportunity to review and comment on these different emission limits just as it would comment on any other
permit provision. Since these provisions were previously approved into Illinois' SIP, the incorporation of these
provisions into Illinois' part 70 regulations is not problematic for the approval of the State's program as long as
these provisions never apply to other Federal requirements in a title V permit and do not diminish the State's authority
to assure the source's compliance with all applicable requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another component of permit content is the length of time in which a source must notify the permitting authority to
report a deviation from a permit condition. Part 70 of the operating permits regulations requires prompt reporting
of deviations from the permit requirements. 40 CFR 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(B) requires the permitting authority to define
prompt in relation to the degree and type of deviation likely to occur and the applicable requirements. Although the
permit program regulations should define prompt for purposes of administrative efficiency and clarity, an acceptable
alternative is to define prompt in each individual permit. The EPA believes that prompt should generally be defined
as requiring reporting within two to ten days of the deviation. Two to ten days is sufficient time in most cases to protect
public health and safety as well as to provide a forewarning of potential problems. For sources with a low level of excess
emissions, a longer time period may be acceptable. Prompt reporting, however, must be more frequent than the semiannual
reporting requirement, given this is a distinct reporting obligation under 40 CFR 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(A). Illinois
addresses the issue of prompt reporting in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
415 ILCS 5/39.5(7)(f)(ii) of its CAAPP legislation. Because Illinois did not actually define ``prompt,'' EPA may
veto permits that do not contain sufficiently prompt reporting requirements for deviations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e. Enforcement
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Illinois program substantially meets the requirements of 40 CFR 70.11 with regard to enforcement authority.
One issue, however, requires a change in existing State legislation to bring the State's enforcement authority completely
in accord with the requirements of part 70. 415 ILCS 5/44(j)(4)(D) of the Illinois Environmental Protection Act prohibits
the knowing tampering of any monitoring device or record. 40 CFR 70.11(a)(3)(iii), however, prohibits the knowing
tampering of any monitoring device or method. The State must amend its legislative provision to include a prohibition
against knowing tampering of a monitoring method. The EPA, therefore, proposes interim approval of the State's program.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another issue concerning title V enforcement authority is the ability of a source to request an alternative emission
limit equivalent to that stated in a SIP. 415 ILCS 5/39.5(7)(q) allows a source to demonstrate in its CAAPP application
that an alternative emission limit would be equivalent to that contained in the applicable IPCB regulations. The
State submitted revised regulations that restricted the use of alternative emission limits in 35 IAC 270.401(e)
to the situation where the applicable EPA-approved SIP allows for such determination. Since this revision to the
State regulations adequately addresses EPA's concerns regarding the use of alternative equivalent emission limits,
the State may utilize equivalent alternative emission limits in its CAAPP when the underlying SIP provision allows
for such determination.

3. Permit Fee Demonstration
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
415 ILCS 5/39.5(18) of the State's legislation provides for the collection of fees in the amount of $13.50 per ton of
allowable emissions. Sources allowed to emit less than 100 tons per year in the aggregate of all regulated air pollutants
shall pay a flat fee of $1000 and no source shall be required to pay a fee in excess of $100,000. Since the State is not charging
the presumptive minimum, 40 CFR 70.9 requires that the State collect fees sufficient to cover the permit program costs.
Based upon the State's fee demonstration, EPA believes that the amount of fee revenue collected by the State is sufficient
to run the State's program. Collection of fees based upon allowable emissions results in the collection of fees from
tons of pollution not actually emitted. Monies collected from the program will be deposited in a special fund in the
State Treasury known as the CAA Permit Fund and a board appointed by the State legislature will evaluate the State's
fee structure to ensure that future collection of funds will be sufficient to run the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 18, 1994, the State submitted additional information clarifying its detailed fee demonstration. As a result
of this additional information, the EPA believes the State's detailed fee demonstration meets the requirements
of 40 CFR part 70. Please refer to the technical support document and letter dated June 21, 1994, from IEPA, included
with the docket on this approval, for more information regarding the State's fee demonstration.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a. Authority and/or Commitments for Section 112 Implementation
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Illinois has demonstrated in its title V program submittal adequate legal authority to implement and enforce all
section 112 requirements through the title V permit. This legal authority is contained in Illinois' enabling legislation
and in regulatory provisions defining ``applicable requirements'' and stating that the permit must incorporate
all applicable requirements. EPA has determined that this legal authority is sufficient to allow Illinois to issue
permits that assure compliance with all section 112 requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA is interpreting the above legal authority to mean that Illinois is able to carry out all section 112 activities.
For further rationale on this interpretation, please refer to the Technical Support Document accompanying this
rulemaking and the April 13, 1993, guidance memorandum titled ``Title V Program Approval Criteria for section 112
activities,'' signed by John Seitz.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b. Implementation of 112(g) Upon Program Approval
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a condition of approval of the part 70 program, Illinois is required to implement section 112(g) of the Act from the
date of approval of the part 70 program. Imposition of case-by-case determinations of MACT or offsets under section
112(g) will require the use of a mechanism for establishing federally enforceable restrictions on a source-specific
basis. The EPA is proposing to approve Illinois' preconstruction permitting program, found in 35 IAC 201&hyph;203,
under the authority of title V and part 70 solely for the purpose of implementing section 112(g) during the transition
period between title V approval and adoption of a State rule implementing EPA's section 112(g) regulations. EPA believes
this approval is necessary so that Illinois has a mechanism in place to establish federally enforceable restrictions
for section 112(g) purposes from the date of part 70 approval. Although section 112(l) generally provides authority
for approval of State air toxics programs, title V and section 112(g) provide authority for this limited approval
because of the direct linkage between implementation of section 112(g) and title V. The scope of this approval is narrowly
limited to section 112(g) and does not confer or imply approval for purposes of section 110 or any other provision under
the Act. If Illinois does not wish to implement section 112(g) through its preconstruction permit program and can
demonstrate that an alternative means of implementing section 112(g) exists, the EPA may, in the final action approving
Illinois' part 70 program, approve the alternative instead.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed approval is for an interim period only, until such time as the State receives delegation of the section
112(g) rules. Accordingly, EPA is proposing to limit the duration of this approval to a reasonable time following
promulgation of section 112(g) regulations so that Illinois, acting expeditiously, will be able to adopt rules consistent
with the section 112(g) regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Once EPA promulgates the section 112(g) rules, implementation of title V requires that Illinois adopt these rules
within a reasonable period of time. EPA considers final adoption by the State 12 months after EPA promulgation a reasonable
period of time. Once the State adopts the section 112(g) rules, the State will issue permits in accordance with the
section 112(g) rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
c. Program for Delegation of Section 112 Standards as Promulgated
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requirements for approval, specified in 40 CFR 70.4(b), encompass section 112(l)(5) approval requirements for
approval of a program for delegation of section 112 standards as promulgated by EPA as they apply to part 70 sources.
Section 112(l)(5) requires that the State's program contain adequate authorities, adequate resources for implementation,
and an expeditious compliance schedule, which are also requirements under part 70.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the EPA is also proposing to grant approval under section 112(l)(5) and 40 CFR 63.91 of Illinois' program
for receiving delegation of section 112 standards that are unchanged from the Federal standards as promulgated.
Because the State of Illinois has historically accepted automatic delegation of section 112 standards and requirements,
EPA proposes to approve the delegation of section 112 standards and requirements through automatic delegation.
Therefore, once EPA promulgates a section 112 standard, the State of Illinois will automatically assume responsibility
for collection and receipt of any information required by the standard, as well as any further activities agreed to
by IEPA and EPA. The details of this delegation mechanism will be set forth in a Memorandum of Agreement between Illinois
and EPA expected to be completed prior to approval of Illinois' section 112(l) program for straight delegations.
This program applies to both existing and future standards, but is limited to sources covered by the part 70 program.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA is proposing approval under section 112(l) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) of Illinois' state operating permits
program for the purposes of creating federally enforceable limitations on the potential to emit of Hazardous Air
Pollutants (HAPs) regulated under section 112 of the CAA. The EPA is approving this program as meeting the criteria
articulated in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
June 28, 1989, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice for State operating permit programs to establish limits federally enforceable on potential to emit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The June 28, 1989, notice provided that EPA would approve a state operating permit program into a SIP for the purpose
of establishing federally enforceable limits on a source's potential to emit if the program met five specific requirements.
This notice, because it was written prior to the 1990 amendments to section 112, addressed only SIP programs to control
criteria pollutants. Federally enforceable limits on criteria pollutants (i.e., VOC's or PM&hyph;10) may have
the incidental effect of limiting certain HAPs listed pursuant to section 112(b). This situation would occur when
a pollutant classified as a HAP is also classified as a criteria pollutant.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As a legal matter, no additional program approval by EPA is required in order for these criteria pollutant limits to

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has determined that the five approval criteria for approving FESOP programs into the SIP, as specified in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
June 28, 1989, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice, are also appropriate for evaluating and approving the programs under section 112(l). The June 28, 1989, notice
does not address HAP because it was written prior to the 1990 amendments to section 112 and not because it establishes
requirements unique to criteria pollutants. Hence, the following five criteria are applicable to state operating
permit program approvals under section 112(l): (1) The program must be submitted to and approved by EPA; (2) The program
must impose a legal obligation on the operating permit holders to comply with the terms and conditions of the permit
and that permits which do not conform to either the operating permit program requirements, the requirements of EPA's
underlying regulations or the June 28, 1989, criteria may be deemed ``not federally enforceable'' by EPA; (3) The
program must contain terms and conditions that are at least as stringent as any requirements contained in the SIP or
enforceable under the SIP or any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 112 or other Clean Air Act standard or requirement; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Permits issued under the program must contain conditions that are permanent, quantifiable, and enforceable
as a practical matter; and (5) Permits issued under the program must be subject to participation, including at a minimum
advance notice of the permit in the form of a 30-day public comment period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to meeting the criteria in the June 28, 1989, notice, a state operating permit program must meet the statutory
criteria for approval under section 112(l)(5). Section 112(l) allows EPA to approve a program only if it: (1) Contains
adequate authority to assure compliance with any section 112 standards or requirements; (2) provides for adequate
resources; (3) provides for an expeditious schedule for assuring compliance with section 112 requirements; and
(4) is otherwise likely to satisfy the objectives of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA plans to codify the approval criteria for programs limiting potential to emit of HAP in Subpart E of part 63,
the regulations promulgated to implement section 112(l) of the Act. The EPA currently anticipates that these criteria,
as they apply to state operating permit programs, will mirror those set forth in the June 28, 1989, notice, with the
addition that the State's authority must extend to HAP instead of or in addition to VOC's and PM&hyph;10. The EPA currently
anticipates that state operating permit programs that are approved pursuant to section 112(l) prior to the subpart
E revisions will have had to meet these criteria, and hence, will not be subject to any further approval action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA believes it has authority under section 112(l) to approve programs to limit potential to emit of HAPs directly
under section 112(l) prior to this revision to subpart E. Section 112(l)(5) requires EPA to disapprove program that
are inconsistent with guidance required to be issued under section 112(l)(2). This might be read to suggest that the
``guidance'' referred to in section 112(l)(2) was intended to be a binding rule. Even under this interpretation,
the EPA does not believe that section 112(l) requires this rulemaking to be comprehensive. That is, it need not address
all instances of approval under section 112(l). The EPA has already issued regulations under section 112(l) that
would satisfy this requirement. Given the severe timing problems posed by impending deadlines set forth in MACT standards
and for submittal of title V applications, EPA believes it is reasonable to read section 112(l) to allow for approval
of programs to limit potential to emit prior to issuance of a rule specifically addressing this issue. Accordingly,
EPA is proposing approval of Illinois' program now so as to enable Illinois to begin issuing federally enforceable
permits as soon as possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA proposes the approval of Illinois' federally enforceable state operating permit program (FESOP) program for
the purpose of limiting potential to emit of HAP. The Illinois FESOP program was previously approved for the purpose
of limiting potential to emit of criteria pollutants on December 17, 1992. 57 FR 59928. In that notice, EPA stated that
the Illinois state operating permit program met the five criteria required for Federal approvability under the June,

57 FR 59930&hyph;59931. Illinois' FESOP program: (1) Was submitted to and approved by EPA into the SIP; (2) provides
that all sources are under a legal obligation to adhere to the terms and limitations of such permits and that permits
which do not conform to the operating permit program requirements and the requirements of EPA's underlying regulations
may be deemed ``not federally enforceable'' by EPA; (3) provides that the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency
(IEPA) and Illinois Pollution Control Board must act in a manner consistent with all pertinent Federal statutes and
regulations including the SIP; (4) ensures that all permit conditions are permanent, quantifiable and enforceable
as a practical matter; and (5) ensures that all FESOP permits are issued subject to public participation, including
advance notification in the form of at least a 30-day public comment period. By approving the Illinois FESOP program,
EPA recognized the Illinois FESOP program as a federally enforceable method of limiting potential to emit of criteria
pollutants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
415 ILCS 5/9.1(d)(2) provides the statutory authority for the State to include the requirements of section 111 and
112 of the Act, including any regulations promulgated thereunder, into state permits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the statutory criteria under section 112(l), the EPA believes that Illinois' FESOP program contains authority
to assure compliance with section 112 requirements since the third criteria of the June 28, 1989 notice is met, that
is, since the program does not provide for waiving any section 112 requirement. Sources would still be required to
meet section 112 requirements applicable to non-major sources. Regarding adequate resources, Illinois has included
in its request for approval under section 112(l) a commitment to provide adequate resources to implement and enforce
the program. This request is contained in a September 14, 1994, letter from Bharat Mathur, Chief of the Bureau of Air,
IEPA, to Stephen Rothblatt, Chief, Regulation Development Branch, EPA Region 5. Fees will be collected from FESOP
sources through both the title V and FESOP process. Sources that apply for FESOPs through the title V process will pay
a fee of $1000. Sources applying through the FESOP program will be charged a fee based upon actual emissions. Since
the processing of a FESOP permit consumes considerably less resources than the processing of a title V permit, the
State believes that sufficient resources will be available to administer FESOP permits for those who request and
qualify. The EPA believes this mechanism will be sufficient to provide for adequate resources to implement this program,
and will monitor the State's implementation of the program to assure that adequate resources continue to be available.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Illinois' FESOP program also meets the requirement for an expeditious schedule for assuring compliance. A source
seeking a voluntary limit on potential to emit is probably doing so to avoid a Federal requirement applicable on a particular
date. Nothing in this program would allow a source to avoid or delay compliance with the Federal requirement if it fails
to obtain the appropriate federally enforceable limit by the relevant deadline. Finally, Illinois' FESOP program
is consistent with the objectives of the section 112 program since its purpose is to enable sources to obtain federally
enforceable limits on potential to emit to avoid major source classification under section 112. The EPA believes
this purpose is consistent with the overall intent of section 112. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA recognizes that state operating permits may already exist that contain restrictions on the potential to emit
of HAPs. As long as the State issued these permits in accordance with all State regulations and the criteria discussed
above, EPA will consider these permits to be federally enforceable upon promulgation of this action.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
d. Title IV
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Illinois' program contains adequate authority to issue permits which reflect the requirements of title IV and its
implementing regulations. Illinois' submittal letter contains a commitment to revise its regulations as necessary
to accommodate Federal revisions and additions to title IV and the Acid Rain regulations once they are promulgated.

B. Options for Approval/Disapproval and Implications
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA is proposing to grant interim approval to the operating permits program submitted by Illinois on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
November 15, 1993. If this approval is promulgated, the State must make the following changes to receive full approval:
(1) The State must amend 415 ILCS 5/39.5(5)(e) to ensure that certifications by responsible officials comply with
all Federal requirements, namely that the official has made a reasonable inquiry and that the certification is based
upon information and belief; (2) the State must amend 415 ILCS 5/39.5(13)(c)(vi) to require the use of the significant
modification procedure to incorporate emission trades into a CAAPP permit; (3) for full approval of the State's program,
the State must develop regulations detailing the actual procedural and compliance requirements necessary for incorporation
of preconstruction permits into part 70 permits as a supplement to the State's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
title V submittal or submitted as a revision to the State's preconstruction permit program state implementation
plan; (4) the State must amend 415 ILCS 5/44(j)(4)(D) to include a prohibition against knowing tampering of a monitoring
method; and (5) the State must correct all deficiencies in its insignificant activities regulations currently under
development. If finalized insignificant activities rules address EPA's concerns and these rules are submitted
prior to final action on this notice, then EPA can grant full approval of these rules. If EPA's concerns are not addressed
prior to final action, then the State's insignificant activities rules will receive interim approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Illinois' program is not fully approvable because of the deficiencies mentioned above. The program, however, substantially
meets the requirements of part 70 because Illinois' CAAPP complies with all other part 70 requirements. This interim
approval, which may not be renewed, extends for a period of up to 2 years. Because the interim approval automatically
expires two years after promulgation of a final interim approval, the State may submit its interim corrections at
any time, however, the State may not submit its corrections any later than 18 months after promulgation of final interim
approval. The EPA will then have six months to promulgate a final action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the interim approval period, the State is protected from sanctions for failure to have a program, and EPA is
not obligated to promulgate a Federal permits program in the State. Permits issued under a program with interim approval
have full standing with respect to part 70, and the 1-year time period for submittal of permit applications by subject
sources begins upon interim approval, as does the 3-year time period for processing the initial permit applications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requirements for approval, specified in 40 CFR 70.4(b), encompass section 112(l)(5) requirements for approval
of a program for delegation of section 112 standards as promulgated by EPA as they apply to part 70 sources. Section
112(l)(5) requires that the State's program contain adequate authorities, adequate resources for implementation,
and an expeditious compliance schedule, which are also requirements under part 70. Therefore, the EPA is also proposing
to grant approval under section 112(l)(5) and 40 CFR 63.91 of the State's program for receiving delegation of section
112 standards that are unchanged from Federal standards as promulgated. This program for delegations only applies
to sources covered by the part 70 program.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify
that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include
small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations
of less than 50,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operating permit program approvals under section 502 of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal operating permit program approval
does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected.
Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility
analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The Act forbids EPA
to base its actions concerning operating permit programs on such grounds.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing to delete acetone from the list of toxic chemicals subject to section 313 of the Emergency Planning
and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 (EPCRA) in response to a petition filed by Eastman Chemical Company and Hoechst
Celanese. Specifically, EPA is granting this petition by proposing to delist because the Agency believes that acetone
does not meet any of the EPCRA section 313(d)(2) criteria for remaining on the list. Moreover, as published elsewhere
in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA is proposing to add acetone to the list of compounds excluded from the definition of A Volatile Organic Compound
(VOC) under the Clean Air Act. VOCs contribute to the formation of ozone in the lower atmosphere (troposphere), and
ozone is known to cause significant adverse effects on human health and environment. EPA has previously determined
that VOCs meet the criteria for listing under EPCRA section 313. Therefore, finalization of this proposed rule is
contingent upon the finalization of the proposed rule to exclude acetone from EPA's definition of a VOC.

This proposed rule is issued under sections 313(d) and (e)(1) of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know
Act of 1986 (EPCRA), 42 U.S.C. 11023. EPCRA is also referred to as Title III of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 313 of EPCRA requires certain facilities manufacturing, processing, or otherwise using listed toxic chemicals
to report their environmental releases of such chemicals annually. Beginning with the 1991 reporting year, such
facilities also must report pollution prevention and recycling data for such chemicals, pursuant to section 6607
of the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. 13106. Section 313 established an initial list of toxic chemicals
that was comprised of more than 300 chemicals and 20 chemical categories. Section 313(d) authorizes EPA to add or delete
chemicals from the list, and sets forth criteria for these actions. EPA has added and deleted chemical from the original
statutory list. Under section 313(e), any person may petition EPA to add chemicals to or delete chemicals from the
list. EPA must respond to petitions within 180 days either by initiating a rulemaking or by publishing an explanation
of why the petition is denied.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 of February 4, 1987 (52 FR 3479), to provide guidance regarding the recommended content and format for submitting
petitions. On May 23, 1991 (56 FR 23703), EPA published guidance regarding the recommended content of petitions to
delete individuals members of the section 313 and metal compound categories.

II. Description of Petition
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 24, 1991, EPA received a petition from Eastman Chemical Company and Hoechst Celanese to delete acetone
from the EPCRA section 313 list of toxic chemicals. The petitioners contend that acetone should be deleted from the
EPCRA section 313 list because it does not meet any of the EPCRA section 313(d)(2) criteria and because acetone's low
photochemical reactivity does not present substantial concerns for formation of tropospheric ozone or other air
pollutants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Acetone is high volume chemical that is widely used as an industrial solvent and chemical intermediate, and which
is regulated under several environmental statutes other than EPCRA. Acetone is on the list of hazardous substances
(40 CFR 302.4) under section 102(a) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act
of 1980 (CERCLA), 42 U.S.C. 9602, with a reportable quantity of 5,000 pounds. Due to its ignitability acetone is regulated
under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), 42 U.S.C. 6901

A. Status of Acetone Under the CAA
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, acetone is considered a Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) and emissions of VOCs are managed under regulations
(40 CFR parts 51 and 52) that implement Title I of the Clean Air Act, as amended (CAA), 42 U.S.C. 7401 et. seq. The CAA requires
States to submit to EPA for approval State Implementation Plans (SIPs) that establish a strategy to reduce the emissions
of a regulated pollutant to attain and maintain the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Under the SIP
program, the attainment of the NAAQS for ozone are dependent in part on the control of releases of VOCs. Section 182(a)(3)(B)
of the CAA requires States to adopt regulations requiring sources of VOC (or oxides of nitrogen (NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
)) emissions to provide the State reports showing the actual emissions of VOC and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This annual reporting of VOC emissions by the sources to their State air agencies has been required as of November
1993. Only facilities located in areas that are designated non-attainment for ozone or in attainment areas within
ozone transport regions are required to report. EPA's definition of VOCs excludes certain listed chemicals that
have been determined to be negligibly photochemically reactive (57 FR 3941, February 3, 1992). Elsewhere in this
issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA is proposing to add acetone to the list of compounds excluded from the definition of a VOC, since it has been preliminarily
determined that acetone has a negligible contribution to tropospheric ozone formation.

B. VOC Petitions Under EPCRA Section 313
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This is the third petition that EPA has received to delist a VOC from the EPCRA section 313 list. EPA received on July
13, 1988, a petition to delist ethylene and propylene from the EPCRA section 313 list and on September 9, 1988, a petition
to delist cyclohexane. Both petitions were denied due to concerns about chemical reactions in the troposphere that
lead to the formation of ozone and other air pollutants such as formaladehyde (i.e., these chemicals clearly fit the
definition of VOCs). Ozone is known to cause significant adverse affects on human health and the environment.

 of acetone in rats is about 6.7 grams/kilogram (g/kg). Lethal concentrations by inhalation are on the order of 40,000
to 46,000 parts per million (ppm) for 1 hour for rats, mice, and guinea pigs, and 21,000 ppm for 2 hours for rats. Acetone
produced moderate corneal injury to the eye in rabbits and mild skin irritation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In humans, eye, nose, and throat irritations have been observed at 500 and 1,000 ppm. Symptoms of accidental exposure
may include slight intoxication, headache, lassitude, drowsiness, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, respiratory
depression, and coma. Central nervous system depression and narcotic effects are likely to occur at concentrations
in excess of 10,000 ppm. Liver and kidney damage have also been observed in humans exposed accidentally.

Chronic toxicity.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Workers exposed chronically to 750 ppm acetone experienced irritation of mucous tissues of the eye, upper respiratory
system, and gastrointestinal system. In another survey, workers also experienced respiratory tract irritation,
dizziness, and loss of strength at concentrations of 1,000 ppm, 3 hours per day, over a period of 7 to 15 years.

 A 90-day subchronic toxicity study in rats produced a no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) of 100 milligrams/kilogram/day
(mg/kg/day) and a lowest-observed-adverse-effect level (LOAEL) of 500 mg/kg/day based on increased liver and kidney
weights and nephrotoxicity. Based on these studies, EPA has developed a Reference Dose (RfD) of 0.1 mg/kg/day.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Acetone is readily biodegradable in aquatic systems. Its octanol/water partition coefficient (^0.24) indicates
a low potential for bioaccumulation, and its high water solubility indicates that acetone is not likely to biomagnify.
The most sensitive aquatic species are probably the water flea (LC

B. Production, Use and Release of Acetone
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For 1992, the United States (U.S.) production of acetone was 2.4 billion pounds. In addition, 96 million pounds of
acetone were imported. Domestic consumption was 2.2 billion pounds. The majority of the domestic use of acetone was
as an intermediate. Acetone is also used in the production of drugs, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and specialty chemicals.
Acetone also has numerous uses as a process solvent and in direct applications (Ref. 5).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) reports that during 1992 a total of 138,728,984 pounds of acetone were released
into the environment, the 7th highest amount of releases for EPCRA section 313 chemicals. Of that total, 133,989,435
pounds were released to air (4th highest on TRI); 999,584 pounds were released to surface waters (11th highest on TRI);
559,265 pounds were released to land; and 3,180,700 pounds were injected underground (15th highest on TRI). In addition,
88,666,077 pounds of acetone were transferred to Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTWs) and other off-site locations.

C. Technical Summary
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA's toxicological evaluation of acetone indicates that it exhibits acute toxicity only at levels that greatly
exceed releases and resultant exposures. Based on EPA's hazard assessment, the Agency has determined that acetone:
(1) Cannot reasonably be anticipated to cause cancer or neurotoxicity and is not mutagenic, and (2) cannot reasonably
be anticipated to cause adverse developmental effects or other chronic effects except at relatively high dose levels.
Acetone causes adverse environmental effects only at relatively high dose levels.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Rationale for Granting
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is granting the petition by proposing to delete acetone from the EPCRA section 313 list. EPA believes that acetone
does not meet the toxicity criteria of EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(A) because acetone exhibits acute toxicity only at
levels that greatly exceed releases and resultant exposures. Specifically acetone cannot reasonably be anticipated
to cause ``*&blank;*&blank;* significant adverse acute human health effects at concentration levels that are reasonably
likely to exist beyond facility site boundaries as a result of continuous, or frequently recurring releases.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on EPA's hazard assessment of acetone, the Agency has determined that acetone exhibits low toxicity in chronic
studies. Therefore, EPA believes that acetone does not meet the toxicity criteria of EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that acetone does not meet the toxicity criteria of EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) because acetone causes
adverse environmental effects only at relatively high dose levels.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Elsewhere in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA is proposing to add acetone to the list of compounds excluded from the definition of a VOC since it has been preliminarily
determined to have negligible contribution to tropospheric ozone formation. In addition to the findings discussed
above, based on this proposal, EPA believes that acetone does not meet the toxicity criteria of EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B)
and (C) because acetone's contribution to the formation of tropospheric ozone and other air pollutants is negligible.
VOCs contribute to the formation of ozone in the lower atmosphere (troposphere) and ozone is known to cause significant
adverse effects on human health and the environment. EPA has previously determined that VOCs meet the criteria for
listing under EPCRA section 313. Therefore, finalization of this proposed rule is contingent upon the issuance of
a final rule to add acetone to the list of compounds excluded from the definition of a VOC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's action is not intended, and should not be inferred to affect the status of acetone under any statute or program
other than the Toxic Release Inventory reporting under EPCRA section 313 and the PPA section 6607. Specifically,
the removal of acetone from the EPCRA section 313 list will not in any way alter its continued status under the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act or section 102(a) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
Liability Act. The petitioners, Eastman Chemical Company and Hoechst Celanese, do not request the removal of acetone
from any other statute; moreover, the Agency feels such action at this time would be inappropriate. In support, the
Agency notes that the three lists, and the three statutes under which they are maintained, serve relevantly different
purposes. Furthermore, each statute prescribes different standards for adding or deleting chemicals or pollutants
from its respective list.

VIII. Regulatory Assessment Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements of the
Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action likely to
lead to a rule (1) Having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting
a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local,
or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious
inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering
the budgetary impacts of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues
arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. Pursuant
to the terms of this Executive Order, it has been determined that this proposed rule is not ``significant'' and therefore
not subject to OMB review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, the Agency must conduct a small business analysis to determine whether
a substantial number of small entities will be significantly affected by a proposed rule. Because this proposed rule
eliminates an existing requirement, it would result in cost savings to facilities, including small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On September 2, 1994, EPA published a proposed rule governing lead-based paint activities to ensure that individuals
engaged in such activities are properly trained; that training programs are accredited; and that contractors engaged
in such activities are certified. The proposed rule would also establish standards for performing lead-based paint
activities and require that all lead-based paint activities be performed by certified individuals. When promulgated,
the rule would fulfill the mandate of section 402(a)(1) of Title IV of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). Additionally,
as part of the proposed rule, EPA has, in accordance with section 404(d) of TSCA, developed a proposed Model State Program.
When promulgated, this program may be adopted by any State that seeks to administer and enforce a State program under
Title IV of TSCA. In that notice, the Agency stated that it would hold an informal hearing. EPA will hold a 1&hyph;day
public hearing.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed regulation would revise the Legal Services Corporation's (``Corporation'' or ``LSC'') regulation
relating to prohibited political activities. The proposed revisions both clarify existing law and substantively
expand the scope of certain prohibitions. The proposal also includes a number of technical and structural revisions
to make the rule easier to apply and use.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On June 19 and July 15, 1994, the Operations and Regulations Committee (``Committee'') of the LSC Board of Directors
held public hearings on proposed revisions to 45 CFR Part 1608, LSC's regulation on electoral political activities.
At the July 15 meeting in Washington, DC, the Committee approved a draft to be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 as a proposed rule for public comment and agreed to extend the customary 30-day comment period to 60 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Committee recognizes that Congress is currently considering reauthorization legislation for the Corporation.
Whenever Congress does pass a new LSC Act, the Corporation's regulations will be revisited and revised accordingly.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A technical correction has been made to the authority section. The reference to &sect;2996f(b)(2) is incorrect and
has been replaced by reference to &sect;2996f(b)(4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1608.1&blank;Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No change is proposed for this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1608.2&blank;Definitions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The definition of ``attorney'' is based on the one found in Part 1600. It would apply to attorneys employed by a recipient
as well as to PAI attorneys who are providing services to eligible clients referred by a recipient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of ``political'' in Part 1608 is intended to supersede the definition of ``political'' in 45 CFR Part
1600. The term applies only to restrictions in this part and needs revision to better reflect the scope of the statutory
provisions implemented by this regulation. The definition is also revised from the definition in Part 1600 to delete
references to ``ballot measures'' and ``publicity and propaganda.'' Part 1608 implements several statutory restrictions
on a variety of electoral political activities, so it is difficult to have a definition of political activities that
is true to the meaning of the specific political activities regulated in each statutory restriction. Therefore,
instead of a definition that refers to specific activities such as ballot measures, a more general definition is retained
and ``ballot measures'' are dealt with in the section that sets out the restrictions on those activities. In addition,
the term ``publicity and propaganda'' generally refers to grassroots lobbying activities which are not directly
implicated by any of this part's restrictions and are better dealt with in the Corporation's regulations on lobbying,
45 CFR Part 1612. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of ``legal assistance activities'' is proposed to be deleted. It has been difficult to interpret and
is not based on any statutory language. The language is instead incorporated into the only provision (the proposed
&sect;1608.7) that uses the phrase. Nothing in this part is intended to suggest that an employee may not use his or her
own salary to make personal contributions to political organizations or campaigns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A definition of ``staff attorney'' is added and is intended to supersede the definition of ``staff attorney'' currently
found in 45 CFR Part 1600. The definition is modified to clarify that a ``staff attorney'' means an attorney who is a
salaried employee of a recipient and not a private attorney who has contracts with a recipient to provide part-time
legal services to program clients. Section 1608.3 Attorney-client relationship. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This section has been moved from &sect;1608.7 in the current regulation to make it clear that all of the restrictions
and prohibitions contained in Part 1608 are subject to the exception for legal representation. This section would
apply to PAI attorneys when they are engaged in legal assistance activities supported by a recipient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1608.4&blank;Prohibitions Applicable to the Corporation and to Recipients
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The only change to this section is the addition of language intended to better reflect the statutory prohibition.
The revision clarifies that no resources of the Corporation or of a recipient may be used for political activities
or purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1608.5 Prohibitions applicable to all employees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current &sect;1608.4, which applies to all Corporation and recipient employees, and most of the current &sect;1608.5,
which applies to Corporation employees and staff attorneys, have been merged into &sect;1608.5 in the proposed rule.
The Committee believes that the rule's prohibitions concerning the misuse of official authority and coercion should
apply to all Corporation and recipient employees. Section 1608.6 Prohibition applicable to Corporation employees
and to staff attorneys.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There is no substantive change in this section other than to accommodate the merger reflected in the proposed &sect;1608.5.
The prohibition on candidacy for partisan elective public office is still applicable only to Corporation employees
and staff attorneys. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1608.7&blank;Prohibitions Applicable to All Attorneys 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal incorporates the relevant language from the current definition of ``legal assistance activities''
deleted from &sect;1608.2 into paragraph (a). Further, paragraph (a), together with paragraph (b), makes explicit
what is not restricted by the Act, both with respect to individual attorneys and recipients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, consistent with the provision of the LSC Act that restricts these activities, the proposal makes it clear that
recipients' non-LSC resources are not restricted, so long as they are used by attorneys who receive no LSC funding.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, this section would apply to all attorneys employed by a recipient as well as PAI attorneys who are providing
recipient supported legal assistance to the recipient's clients. However, an attorney may do the activities regulated
by this section on ``his or her own time.'' For an attorney employed by a recipient, that means any time outside of normal
working hours (e.g., evenings, weekends, and leave time) so long as the attorney is not representing or providing
legal assistance to the recipient's clients. Thus, an attorney employed by a recipient should not transport a recipient's
clients to the polls on a workday, even if it is in the evening outside of normal working hours, if he or she could be presumed
to be working for the recipient. But that same attorney could take leave to do so, or could do so if clearly identifying
him or herself as a private citizen rather than as a legal services attorney, because the attorney would clearly be
doing it on his or her own time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For a PAI attorney, it means any time that the attorney is not actually working on PAI activities. Thus, a PAI attorney
could participate in political activities as a regular part of his or her private practice, so long as the activity
is not done while providing PAI services supported by the recipient. The restriction would not affect any other paid
or pro bono work that the PAI attorney does. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, paragraph (b) makes it clear that an attorney is free to contribute his or her own funds, including those derived
from a salary from the recipient, to political activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c) is added to clarify the scope of the statutory restriction regarding voter registration activity.
Clearly, Congress intended to prohibit legal services attorneys, while working on program time or using LSC resources,
from participating directly in voter registration drives that could easily be tailored to achieve some partisan
political purpose. However, the restriction applies only to attorneys and not to recipients specifically. Legal
services programs are often requested by public officials to place nonpartisan information regarding voter registration
procedures and qualifications in their waiting rooms to encourage voter registration among the clients. While many
programs permit the materials in their offices, many others are hesitant to do so. In light of the developments such
as the new ``Motor Voter Registration'' law and the fact that the LSC Act does not restrict voter registration activity
by recipients, the regulation should state clearly that engaging in nonpartisan activities, such as making available
nonpartisan voter registration information, is permissible.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section is proposed to be deleted. The current language refers to the enforcement provisions in &sect;1612.5.
However, the enforcement provisions of Part 1612 were removed from &sect;1612.5 and are currently found in &sect;1612.12.
Regardless, the Committee believes that the enforcement procedures dealing with other matters are not appropriate
for this part and has decided to deal with compliance issues outside the context of this rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed regulation would revise the Legal Services Corporation's (``Corporation'' or ``LSC'') regulation
relating to client grievance procedures. The proposed rule revises the procedural requirements for client grievances
and conforms the rule to applicable rules of professional responsibility and the attorney-client privilege. The
proposal also includes a number of technical and structural revisions to make the rule easier to apply.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On June 19 and July 15, 1994, in Washington, DC., the Operations and Regulations Committee (``Committee'') of the
LSC Board of Directors held hearings on proposed revisions to 45 CFR part 1621, LSC's regulation on client grievance
procedures. At the July 15 meeting, the Committee approved a draft to be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 as a proposed rule for public comment and agreed to extend the customary 30-day comment period to 60 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Committee recognizes that Congress is currently considering reauthorization legislation for the Corporation.
Whenever Congress does pass a new LSC Act, the Corporation's regulations will be revisited and revised accordingly.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1621.1&blank;Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The revisions to this section are intended to clarify that there is no statutory entitlement to legal services or to
a particular type of legal assistance. The intent of this rule is to provide for a mechanism whereby applicants for
service or clients may complain about the denial of service or the quality of services provided. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed revisions to this section also make it clear that the rules regarding complaints about the quality and
manner of service apply only to recipients that actually provide services to clients and not to those support centers
and other recipients that do not offer direct intake. They also clarify that the ``applicants for service'' and the
``clients'' are not, for the purposes of these rules, local legal services programs, but rather, that they are the
financially eligible clients represented by LSC-funded programs. Finally, the revisions are intended to clarify
that a recipient is not accountable to the entire client community with regard to client grievances, but only to its
actual clients and, to a limited extent, to those members of the community who actually apply for services.

Section 1621.2&blank;Grievance Committee
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed revision to this section would allow a recipient to include more than a proportionate number of clients
on a grievance committee. The current rule requires that the committee be composed of lawyer and client members in
approximately the same proportion in which they serve on the governing body. However, there is no statutory requirement
governing the composition of board committees and, for client grievance issues, it may be preferable in some situations
to have more than one-third of the committee membership be clients. In any event, at least one lawyer must be on the committee.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1621.3&blank;Complaints About the Quality or Manner of Providing Services
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (a) is revised to clarify that the grievance procedure is available only to actual clients or their representatives,
and not to opposing counsel or some other person who is disgruntled by the recipient's operations. It is also designed
to address complaints not only about the quality of legal assistance, but also about a client's general treatment
by the recipient's staff, including the receptionist, intake workers, or any other staff member who interacts with
clients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a) is also revised to require a program to establish procedures for complaints about PAI attorneys. These
procedures need not be the same as they are for program staff. The Corporation has a strong interest in encouraging
involvement of the private bar in its recipients' PAI projects and does not want the grievance procedures to act as
a deterrent to such involvement. However, the Corporation also sees the value in providing some complaint mechanism
for dissatisfied clients. Therefore, the Corporation is especially interested in receiving comments from the private
bar on this issue. Such comments should address issues such as local ethical requirements to report malpractice on
the part of attorneys, complaint procedures, and appropriate actions that should be taken when a complaint is found
to have merit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b) sets out the minimum requirements for a program's grievance procedures. It adds a requirement that
complaints be in writing and retains the provision for transcription of oral complaints into writing, so that grievance
committees would not have to respond to every oral statement made about a recipient. If a grievance committee does
not satisfactorily resolve the matter based on the written complaint, the provision provides that the complainant
then has an opportunity to address the committee in person or by teleconference. Although not required by the proposed
rule, procedures may include a provision allowing a complainant to appeal the grievance committee's decision to
the program's whole board of directors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This provision also clarifies that there is no attorney-client relationship between the complainant and the board's
grievance committee. Thus, in order for the grievance committee to investigate a complaint, the client would have
to consent to disclose any necessary confidential information. It is important to require that the consent be explicit,
rather than simply treating the filing of a complaint as an implied consent. The consent called for is limited to those
disclosures to the committee or the board necessary to consider the grievance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c) adds a provision setting out what a grievance committee may do in response to a complaint made pursuant
to this Part. This is an effort to make it clear that the committee could recommend any action that is consistent with
the applicable rules of professional responsibility, but it would be up to the executive director to determine what
action is appropriate and to implement such action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d) requires a recipient to maintain a file, separate from the client's case file, containing a copy or summary
of every written complaint and a statement of its disposition. In view of the second sentence of this paragraph, the
requirement in the current rule that the file be preserved for review by the Corporation has been deleted. The second
sentence adds a provision that prohibits the recipient from disclosing any information in the file that would violate
the attorney-client privilege or the applicable rules of professional responsibility. Keeping the information
the Corporation may need to see in a file separate from the client's case file would make it easier for the Corporation
to have access to complaint information in a manner that would be less likely to jeopardize the confidentiality of
client information. The Committee believes that the provisions on access to client information should be consistent
with the applicable rules of professional responsibility and with section 1006(b)(3) of the LSC Act, which prohibits
LSC from abrogating the authority of states and local jurisdictions to enforce those rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ABA's Standing Committee on Legal Aid and Indigent Defendants (``SCLAID'') has expressed great concern about
the protection of client confidences, secrets, and other information gained in the course of representation, and
has urged the Committee to adopt rules that would permit LSC to have access to information only in a manner consistent
with the applicable rules of professional responsibility. The Committee proposal makes it clear that complaint
information disclosed by a client should not be disclosed to LSC or to any third party, except as permitted by applicable
rules. Generally, that would mean that when the identity of a client is not known, information may be made available
so long as it does not identify a client, either directly or indirectly. Thus, a client's name and any other information
that could associate the document with a particular client, such as an address or the name of an employer, should be
redacted.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Once a document has been purged of any information that could be used to identify a particular individual or that could
be associated with a particular person, that document could be shared with LSC, consistent with the rules of professional
responsibility. However, the Committee solicits comments as to whether other information than that which would
identify a client may have to be withheld pursuant to local rules of professional responsibility. The comments should
include specific examples of types of information that would have to be withheld. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the event that LSC is investigating a specific complaint involving a previously identified client, unless the
specific client has consented to the disclosure, the recipient may be under an obligation to withhold from LSC substantially
more of the information provided by the client in order to ensure that secrets, confidences, and information gained
in the course of the representation are not inappropriately revealed. Should the information thus provided prove
insufficient to permit LSC to fulfill its obligation to ensure that recipients meet the requirements of this part,
it is anticipated that the recipient and LSC will work together to devise an acceptable manner in which to proceed.
Of course, if LSC is investigating a complaint at the request of a client, the client may consent to the disclosure of
the information.

Section 1621.4&blank;Complaints About Denial of Assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (a) is revised to require recipients to establish simple procedures for the timely review of a complaint
by an applicant for service regarding a decision to deny service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b) sets out the requirements for such procedures, which should include instructions on how an applicant
may obtain information on the reasons for a denial of service, including information on the recipient's priorities,
eligibility guidelines, statutory restrictions on representation, and a recipient's case acceptance criteria.
Case acceptance criteria would include, but would not be limited to, consideration of the merits of the applicant's
case and any conflicts of interest that may exist. The Committee would like to hear comments on other items that should
be included as case acceptance criteria. The procedures should also contain information on how a complainant can
make a complaint and confer with a recipient's director or a member of the grievance committee regarding the denial
of service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (c) requires recipients to make reasonable and appropriate efforts to inform applicants about
the complaint procedures. What is reasonable and appropriate would vary depending on the resources of a recipient
and the volume of its applicants. There are a variety of ways, depending on the circumstances, in which the standard
could be met. They include, but are not limited to: (1) Providing written information about the complaint procedure
to all rejected applicants whose eligibility is determined in person; (2) providing written notification to rejected
applicants whose determinations are routinely acknowledged in writing; (3) using voice mail or other available
technology, if appropriate and economically feasible; or (4) providing oral descriptions of the complaint procedures
for rejected applicants who express dissatisfaction with the determination. The standard would not include a practice
that would overwhelm a program's telephone system or exact too high an administrative cost. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d) prohibits the recipient from disclosing any information maintained by the recipient regarding a complaint
of denial of assistance to the Corporation or any third party in a manner that would violate the attorney-client privilege
or the applicable rules of professional responsibility. This paragraph does not require the recipient to maintain
a file on complaints of denial of assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although recipients are not required to do so by the rule, they should make reasonable and appropriate efforts to ensure
that non-English speaking individuals and those with communicative disorders understand the complaint procedures,
have the tools to adequately express their complaints, and receive appropriate explanations of why their applications
for service were denied or what actions are being taken in response to their complaints.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On April 12, 1994, RSPA published a final rule requiring that new and replaced pipeline facilities be constructed
to accommodate inspection by instrumented internal inspection devices commonly known as ``smart pigs.'' RSPA has
received two petitions for reconsideration of that rule as it applies to gas pipelines. In response to those petitions,
this notice proposes to modify the rule with respect to: Replacements in gas transmission lines located in less populated
areas; and replacements in gas transmission lines located offshore. In addition, in order to allow completion of
rulemaking on these proposals, this notice proposes limited extension of the compliance dates for certain current
requirements. Finally, this document announces RSPA's decision with respect to other matters raised in the petitions.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
RSPA published a final rule under Docket No. PS&hyph;126 (Amendments 190&hyph;5, 192&hyph;72, 193&hyph;9, and
195&hyph;50) requiring operators of gas, hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide pipelines to design and construct
new pipelines and portions of pipelines on which replacements are made to accommodate the passage of smart pigs (59
FR 17275; April 12, 1994). Among the provisions for gas transmission lines, 49 CFR 192.150(a) requires that: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
*&blank;*&blank;* each new transmission line and each line section of a transmission line where the line pipe, valve,
fitting or other line component is replaced must be designed and constructed to accommodate the passage of instrumented
internal inspection devices. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The term ``line section'' was defined (in &sect;192.3) as a continuous run of transmission line between adjacent
compressor stations, between a compressor station and storage facilities, between a compressor station and a block
valve, or between adjacent block valves. It was derived from a definition already in use for hazardous liquid and carbon
dioxide pipelines (&sect;195.2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several specific exceptions to the requirements in &sect;192.150(a) are provided, including one for offshore gas
transmission lines less than 10 inches in nominal diameter that transport gas to onshore facilities. In addition,
under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;192.150(b)(8) an operator may seek a specific exception to be based upon a RSPA finding that it would be impracticable
to design and construct a transmission line for the passage of smart pigs.

Requests for Stay and Petitions for Reconsideration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Interstate Natural Gas Association of America (INGAA) filed a ``Request for a Stay of the Effective Date [May 12,
1994] of the Final Rule; Passage of Instrumented Internal Inspection Devices'' dated May 4, 1994. INGAA requests
that RSPA stay until at least January 1, 1995, that provision of the final rule requiring a line section, as defined
in 49 CFR &sect;192.3, to be modified to accommodate smart pigs whenever a line pipe, valve, fitting, or other line
component is replaced in a line section. To support their request for a stay, INGAA notes that the 1994 summer replacement/rehabilitation
work is in progress and that funds for modification of line sections have not been allocated by operators. INGAA also
argues that there was procedural error in the rulemaking process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
INGAA also filed a ``Petition for Reconsideration of the Final Rule; Passage of Instrumented Internal Inspection
Devices'' dated May 10, 1994. INGAA asks that the definition of ``line section'' be deleted from 49 CFR &sect;192.3
and that all offshore gas transmission lines be exempt from the final rule. Issues raised by INGAA to support its request
for deletion of ``line section'' are lack of authority to promulgate such a rule and procedural error. INGAA points
to technical infeasibility and impracticability to support its request for exemption of offshore gas transmission
lines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The American Gas Association (AGA) filed a ``Request for Administrative Stay of the May 12, 1994 effective date and
Petition for Reconsideration of RSPA's Final Rule on Passage of Instrumented Internal Inspection Devices.'' Arguing
that immediate implementation would harm public safety by diverting funds from other safety projects, AGA requests
that RSPA immediately stay the effective date with respect to replacement of line sections. In addition, AGA requests
that RSPA grant reconsideration of the final rule in order to address the costs, benefits, and practicability of the
replacement requirement to modify the complete line section to accommodate smart pigs. To support this, AGA argues
that RSPA failed to consider the standards for pipeline safety rules set out in 49 U.S.C. &sect;60102(b) (formerly
section 3(a) of the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act); there was no opportunity for public comment on the definition
of line section; the Technical Pipeline Safety Standards Committee (TPSSC) was not given opportunity to review relevant
provisions; and the final rule was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The three documents submitted by INGAA and AGA are in the docket.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Stay of Compliance With Line Section Replacement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its request to stay application of the line section replacement provision of the final rule, INGAA explained that
``almost all decisions, to include funding, for pipeline replacement and rehabilitation are made at least a year
preceding the summer work season *&blank;*&blank;*'' INGAA states that the one year lag time includes time required
for ``design work, obtaining bids for work, selecting contractors, ordering material, obtaining approval from
FERC (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission), performing environmental analyses and obtaining Federal and State
environmental and archaeological permits when necessary, and obtaining landowner approval for right-of-way work
on their property.'' As a result, INGAA believes that it is ``far too late to comply with a May 12, 1994, effective date
to make `line sections' piggable''. AGA echoes this sentiment by stating that if the May 12, 1994, effective date of
the final rule remains in place, ``pipeline replacement projects currently in progress for 1994 would have to be canceled,
since the administrative permits and plans for such projects were in place during the winter of 1993&hyph;94.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The concerns expressed by INGAA and AGA led RSPA to advise INGAA, AGA, and the American Petroleum Institute on May 12,
1994, that it was suspending enforcement, until further notice, of the final rule insofar as it requires making the
entire line section accommodate smart pigs if the line pipe, valve, fitting or other component is replaced. The suspension
did not effect the requirements that pipeline operators design and construct new onshore and offshore pipelines
or the actual line pipe, valve, fitting or other line component being replaced to accommodate smart pigs. Furthermore,
operators were encouraged to voluntarily modify any obstructions in the line section to accommodate smart pigs whenever
any replacement is made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice addresses INGAA's and AGA's request for a stay in a more formal manner. First, this notice proposes to extend
the compliance date for replacements made in gas transmission pipelines to allow operators to continue replacing
any line pipe, valve, fitting or other line component (with a replacement that accommodates smart pigs) without requiring
that any other obstructions in the line section be designed and constructed to accommodate smart pigs. As discussed
below, RSPA is proposing to partially grant reconsideration of the final rule as it applies to replacements in gas
transmission pipelines. At the same time, we are proposing to extend compliance dates to allow for completion of rulemaking
on the reconsideration. Second, the suspension of enforcement with respect to gas transmission pipelines will remain
in effect until February 2, 1995, or until RSPA finalizes action with respect to compliance dates, whichever is earlier.

Effect on Hazardous Liquid and Carbon Dioxide Pipelines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The petitions for reconsideration and requests for administrative stay received addressed only gas transmission
pipelines. However, because of the possibility that the issues raised could be equally applicable to hazardous liquid
and carbon dioxide pipelines, the suspension of enforcement applied equally to hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide
pipelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RSPA has considered whether the reconsideration granted in this notice with respect to aspects of the final rule as
they apply to gas transmission lines should be expanded to hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide pipelines. RSPA has
decided not to expand the reconsideration to include hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide pipelines. First, there
has been no request to do so. Second, hazardous liquid pipelines pose environmental risks generally unrelated to
the population surrounding the pipelines. The relief proposed below with respect to gas transmission lines arise
from the nature of those pipelines and their location with respect to population. Finally, based on data collected
by RSPA (below) in 1989, approximately 41.7% of (136,359 miles) of natural gas transmission lines were not able to
accommodate a smart pig for reasons other than lack of launchers or receivers, while only 10.5% (16,275 miles) of hazardous
liquid pipelines were similarly not piggable.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because RSPA is not proposing any changes in the final rule with respect to hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide pipelines,
the suspension of enforcement with respect to those lines is immediately (insert date of publication of this NPRM)
lifted and compliance will be enforced.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Authority for Requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
INGAA argues that RSPA lacks the authority to promulgate a rule requiring operators to modify line sections to accommodate
smart pigs when portions of the sections are replaced. INGAA bases its argument on the assumption that the statutory
authority for the rule is the change to the basic authorities for requiring modification of existing pipelines to
accommodate smart pigs that was made by sections 103 and 203 of the Pipeline Safety Act of 1992 (P.L. 102&hyph;508,
Oct. 24, 1992). That change authorizes RSPA to require changes to existing lines whose basic construction would accommodate
a smart pig. The 1992 authority would allow RSPA to require the installation of launchers and receivers in lines that
already can be smart ``pigged'' should the decision be made in a future rulemaking that the line must be so inspected.
INGAA's assumption that RSPA was relying on this 1992 amendment in this rulemaking is incorrect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirement in the final rule for replacement of the line section is based upon authority enacted in 1988 that now
reads: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary shall prescribe minimum safety standards requiring that the design and construction of a new gas pipeline
transmission facility or hazardous liquid pipeline facility, and the required replacement of an existing gas pipeline
transmission facility, hazardous liquid pipeline facility, or equipment, be carried out, to the extent practicable,
in a way that accommodates the passage through the facility of an instrumented internal inspection device (commonly
referred to as a ``smart pig'').

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
49 U.S.C. 60102 (f). This section supports the final rule that requires any needed changes to the line section to accommodate
smart pigs whenever one or more components must be replaced. A more narrow reading, one in which only the individual
components must be made smart ``piggable'', would render the provision virtually meaningless. This is so because
the factors that restrict ``piggability'' are often related to the geometry of the line (such as bends) rather than
to an individual component (such as a valve). The use of valves that cannot accommodate smart pigs is largely in pipelines
in which the geometry does not allow inspection by smart pigs. Thus a more narrow reading, in which only the single component
being replaced must accommodate the internal inspection by smart pigs, would result in virtually no change in the
``piggability'' of existing pipelines. Congress clearly intended that change in the ``piggability'' occur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Accordingly, RSPA has the authority to issue the final rule. However, as discussed below, RSPA agrees that there may
be instances in which the final rule requires that modifications be made to the entire line section which may not be
feasible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Scope of the Notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
AGA and INGAA argue that both the definition of ``line section'' and the mandatory modification of line sections were
not included in the proposed rule, effectively precluding meaningful comment. AGA and INGAA claim that the notice
of proposed rulemaking was so inadequate as to violate the requirement of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)
for notice and comment in the informal rulemaking process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The notice proposed that each ``replacement transmission line'' (or, for hazardous liquid pipelines, each ``replacement
pipeline'') be made to accommodate smart pigs. Much of the comment on the issue of replacement questioned the scope
of the terms ``replacement transmission lines'' and ``replacement lines.'' Commenters speculated about the end
points of the segments of lines that had to be made to accommodate smart pigs when a replacement was required. Under
the proposed language, any replacement in a transmission line could require modification of the entire line to accommodate
smart pigs. AGA itself expressed concern that the proposed rule would be read to require altering an entire transmission
line.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Recommendations to narrow the terms for replacement used in the proposed rule by substituting the term ``line section''
came from comments to the proposed rule filed by a pipeline trade association and a pipeline operator. These two commenters
favored the term because it was already defined in 49 CFR 195.2 and it clearly set out the length to be made to accommodate
smart pigs. Other commenters suggested similar terms such as ``replacement transmission section'' (recommended
by AGA), ``segment'', and ``line segment''. However, none of these terms was as clearly defined as ``line section'',
and RSPA, on the basis of the comments, chose to adopt the more recognized term to clarify the intent of the rule. This
solution to the concerns raised by the commenters is clearly within the scope of the broadly worded proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, RSPA provided an opportunity for meaningful comment, consistent with the APA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Advisory Committee Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Both petitioners complain that there was no opportunity for consideration by the Technical Pipeline Safety Standards
Committee (TPSSC) of the requirement to modify replacement line sections to accommodate smart pigs because line
section was not mentioned in the notice or in the summary of comments that was prepared by RSPA for the August 3, 1993
TPSSC meeting. Consistent with 49 U.S.C. 60115, RSPA presented the published Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to the
TPSSC. In addition, RSPA passed out a draft summary of the comments. The TPSSC accepted the proposed rule as reasonable,
feasible and practicable provided several changes were incorporated. Since the TPSSC reviews and advises on the
proposed rule, it is understandable that the final rule may differ from the proposal considered or accepted by that
committee. In this case, the final rule was drafted and published some eight months later. Although RSPA is required
to consider the TPSSC's advice (but is not obligated to adopt any of the TPSSC's recommendations), several issues
raised by the TPSSC were incorporated in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, RSPA considered the TPSSC recommendations in an appropriate manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Economic Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Both INGAA and AGA claim that RSPA failed to consider adequately the economic impact of the replacement aspect of the
final rule. However, many of the changes RSPA incorporated into the final rule were done at least in part because of
economic arguments advanced by commenters. For example, based on INGAA's and AGA's comments to the NPRM, RSPA incorporated
the procedure to address unforeseen contingencies in replacements (&sect;192.150(c)); a clear exception for gas
gathering lines (&sect;192.9); an exception for pipelines located in storage fields because of the small diameter
piping configured in a grid-like pattern (&sect;192.150(b)(3)); and an exception for transmission pipelines within
a distribution system (&sect;192.150(b)(6)). In addition, the definition of ``line section'' was developed in
part to address AGA concerns that ``pigging'' a short segment is not economically feasible and that the proposed rule
could be read to require modification of the entire transmission line. Each of these incorporated changes reduced
the economic impact of the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
INGAA points to the costs of obtaining needed approvals for replacement projects from the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC), Federal and state environmental and archaeological agencies, and property owners. INGAA claims
that some of these may take a year or more to obtain. To the extent that approvals are needed before work on the line can
be done, the final rule provides for delays. In response to INGAA and AGA comments, &sect;192.150(c) sets out a procedure
to allow an operator to delay required modifications to the line section for up to one year should situations such as
delays in needed approvals occur. However, many replacements will not require approvals. For example, FERC regulation
18 CFR &sect;2.55 does not require prior approval whenever the replacement is less than $6.6 million (1994 limit)
and does not reduce service or change the capacity of the line. Certainly the replacement of certain obstructions
such as reduced port valves and short radius bends will fall into this category and not require any approval from FERC.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Both INGAA and AGA argue that the requirement to modify other obstructions in the line section whenever a replacement
is made will potentially increase the cost of compliance with the final rule to over $100 million per year. However,
very little cost data was provided to support the argument. Moreover, based on information now available about numbers
of gas transmission lines that will not accommodate smart pigs and the estimated frequency with which operators must
install replacements in lines, RSPA believes the costs to be substantially less. The economic evaluation prepared
for the final rule was based on available data relating to costs and frequency of replacements made in gas transmission
lines. That evaluation estimated costs at $1.05 million per year. Now under the heading_Requests for Information
from Commenters_this notice requests the operators to provide up-to-date information on the gas transmission lines
that are the subject of this notice. Thus, gas operators and petitioners will have an opportunity to provide specific
information on the length of affected lines that are currently unable to accommodate smart pigs (for reasons other
than lack of launchers and receivers) and the extent of replacements made in recent years for reasons other than to
accommodate smart pigs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, RSPA finds that the cost of compliance with the final rule would not exceed $100 million annually. In
addition, the relief proposed in this notice will further reduce the cost of compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
AGA argues additionally that RSPA violated Executive Order (E.O.) 12866, titled ``Regulatory Planning and Review,''
since ``the costs of compliance with this rule could potentially reach over $100 million annually'' and the Office
of Management and Budget (OMB) did not review the final rule. RSPA disagrees. In the first place, as already noted,
RSPA believes the costs of the final rule to be well below $100 million annually. Second, E.O. 12866 provides for OMB
review of only ``significant regulatory actions'' unless OMB declines to review such a significant action. The procedure
for determining that a regulatory action is not ``significant'' and for obtaining the concurrence of OMB with that
determination is laid out in Section 6(a)(3)(A) of E.O. 12866 and ``Guidance for Implementing E.O. 12866.'' The latter
is a memorandum from Sally Katzen, Administrator for the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, to the
heads of executive departments and agencies dated October 12, 1993. RSPA routinely follows this procedure by submitting
lists of planned regulatory actions to OMB and obtaining its concurrence in designations of ``significant'' and
``nonsignificant.'' OMB concurred in the designation of this final rule as ``nonsignificant'' on February 23, 1994.
Finally, RSPA notes that E.O. 12866 is an internal management tool of Executive branch of the Federal Government and
does not create any right to OMB review enforceable by any person against RSPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the final rule complies with the requirements of E.O. 12866 and OMB, as explained above.

F. Reasonableness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioners argue that the final rule is unreasonable in requiring modification of line sections when single components
are replaced. Petitioners assert that such modifications result in minimal benefits and excessive costs. RSPA believes
that significant benefits can accrue from inspections with smart pigs. Both the Colonial Pipeline Company's and
the Texas Eastern Pipeline Company's experiences with pipeline failures caused by outside force damage demonstrate
the benefits of internally inspecting pipelines using smart pigs. The Colonial failure on March 28, 1993 resulted
in the release of an estimated 408,000 gallons of petroleum into Sugarland Run Creek, a tributary of the Potomac River.
The Texas Eastern failure occurred on March 23, 1994 when a 36-inch gas transmission line exploded. The resulting
fire leveled 128 condominium units in Edison, New Jersey and caused death, injury, and substantial property damage.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The failure in each case resulted from mechanical damage to the pipeline caused by external damage that occurred at
an indeterminate time before the failure. Recent technological developments in smart pigs allow for internal inspections
that identify dents, gouges, and other anomalies that could lead to failure on buried pipelines. Smart pig inspections
done on each pipeline following these failures have resulted in the detection and removal of anomalies that could,
over time, have led to additional failures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, smart pig inspections have long been used by pipeline operators concerned about corrosion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In each of these cases, serious pipeline failures occurred in high density populated areas placing a significant
portion of the population at risk. In each case, the ``piggability'' of the pipelines provided a more certain means
to assure that similar incidents would not recur on those pipelines. Such ``piggability'' is the goal of the final
rule. Requiring a pipeline operator to make necessary modifications in a line section whenever a replacement is made
is not only reasonable, but also necessary for safety in high-density populated areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, RSPA finds no reason to reconsider the final rule as it applies to replacements in line sections in Class
3 and 4 locations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to gas transmission pipelines in less populated areas, AGA argues that a requirement to modify the complete
line section to accommodate smart pigs ``will result in a risk to public safety by diverting limited funds for capital
improvement projects_many of them safety related_to making pipelines accommodate smart pigs in rural areas where
there would be little, if any, benefit to the public.'' After citing two examples of replacement projects that would
have had large enormous increases under the line section modification requirement, AGA goes on to state that ``this
enormous increase in costs will result in the final rule having an economic impact of well over $100 million annually
for the industry.'' While RSPA does not accept these costs as typical for modifying the obstructions to smart pigs
in most line sections, we see the need to reconsider the resulting benefits in less populated areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, as discussed below, we are proposing to modify the final rule as it applies to replacements in Class 1
and 2 locations.

Offshore Pipelines

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
INGAA requests that RSPA reconsider the final rule and except all new and replaced offshore transmission lines from
compliance. INGAA argues that requiring offshore transmission lines to accommodate smart pigs is technically infeasible
and impracticable and does not meet the special statutory criteria for pipeline safety standards. Those criteria,
found in 49 U.S.C. 60102(b), require consideration of relevant available pipeline safety data, appropriateness
of the standards for the particular type of pipeline transportation or facility, the reasonableness of the proposed
standards, and the extent to which the standards will contribute to public safety and the protection of the environment.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To support its position, INGAA states generally that RSPA ignored technical material presented to show that offshore
pipelines cannot be ``smart pigged'', including an assertion that most offshore gas pipelines are not constructed
to accommodate smart pigs. RSPA disagrees strongly with this argument. The issue is not whether existing offshore
lines can be ``smart pigged'' but whether new offshore transmission lines can be constructed or existing offshore
gas transmission lines can be modified to accommodate smart pigs. RSPA considered technical material relating to
problems such as tight bends, restrictive subsea connections, and limited space on platforms in deciding that they
can be. No technical information has been submitted to RSPA that concludes that offshore gas transmission lines would
be incapable of accommodating smart pigs if they are so designed and constructed. Their construction is not dissimilar
from that of offshore hazardous liquid pipelines, many of which are already constructed in a manner that would accommodate
smart pigs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
INGAA is incorrect in citing 1992 changes to the statutory authority as the basis for the final rule. As discussed above,
that statutory change was not used to support the final rule. In addition, INGAA is incorrect that RSPA ignored recommendations
of the TPSSC. As discussed above, RSPA is not obligated to adopt the recommendations of the advisory committee, only
to consider them. Discussion of RSPA's consideration of those recommendations is included in the preamble to the
final rule, but is commingled with the discussion of RSPA's response to commenters to the proposed rule. Furthermore,
RSPA's consideration of the criteria contained in 49 U.S.C. 60102(b), the technical data, and recommendations of
the TPSSC resulted in the exception provided in the final rule for offshore gas transmission lines less than 10 inches
in nominal diameter that transport gas to onshore facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
INGAA also points to the lack of population around offshore lines and the periodic cleaning of the gas transmission
lines that removes condensates as justification for exception from the rules for these pipelines. The rationale
is that offshore gas transmission lines do not pose either serious safety or environmental concerns justifying the
cost of assuring that the lines can accommodate smart pigs. RSPA agrees that we may not have fully considered these
factors in applying the rules to offshore gas transmission pipelines and accordingly propose a change to the final
rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
INGAA asserts that most offshore gas pipeline operators use cleaning pigs to periodically sweep condensate to onshore
separation facilities. This keeps the offshore pipelines free from condensate and greatly reduces the environmental
impact of an offshore leak by eliminating the risk of a condensate sheen. RSPA agrees that a leak in an offshore gas transmission
line, that is free of significant accumulations of condensate, poses minimal risk to the natural environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted, RSPA agrees that the offshore gas pipelines do not pose the same safety risk as onshore pipelines. The offshore
safety risk is to workers on platforms and to vessels. The latter risk is extremely remote absent the possibility of
a collision between a vessel and an underwater pipeline. This possibility has been minimized by the issuance of &sect;192.612,
which required operators to conduct underwater inspections in shallow waters in the Gulf of Mexico to determine whether
they pose a risk to navigation and to re-bury those pipelines. RSPA is working on a proposal addressing the need for
similar periodic underwater inspections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The accident reports for offshore incidents received by RSPA indicate that risk to workers on platforms comes from
gas leaks in the risers. The leaks are the result of condensate with corrosive agents that is likely to collect in the
riser's elbows and cause internal corrosion. Also, external corrosion at the riser's ``splash zone'' is caused by
the degradation of protective coatings from wave action. Both types of corrosion are detectible by smart pigs. However,
as INGAA points out, modification of riser bends in order to accommodate smart pigs is costly. RSPA notes that there
are alternative techniques of inspecting these risers for corrosion that are generally more effective (and less
costly) than use of smart pigs that survey the entire pipeline. These include divers, remotely operated vehicles
carrying ultrasonic thickness devices, or specially equipped tethered smart pigs.

Furthermore, it is important to note the recommendation contained in a 1994 study of marine pipeline safety by the
National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences titled_Improving The Safety Of Marine Pipelines.
The study, co-sponsored by the Minerals Management Services and RSPA, had input from persons in industry, academia,
and state and federal government who are experts in their fields and knowledgeable about the marine pipeline environment,
suggested that:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
*&blank;*&blank;* marine pipelines already constructed be exempted from federal or state requirements for the
use of currently available smart pigs for external or internal corrosion detection. New medium- to large-diameter
pipelines running from platform to platform or platform to shore should be designed to accommodate smart pigs whenever
reasonably practical.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Accordingly, RSPA denies INGAA's petition to except new offshore gas transmission lines. However, as discussed
below, RSPA has reconsidered benefits associated with the offshore gas transmission lines and proposes to modify
the requirement under &sect;192.150(b)(7) of the final rule with respect to replacements in these lines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed Rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
First, as discussed above in the section titled ``Stay of compliance with line section replacement,'' RSPA proposes
to extend to February 1, 1995, the compliance date with respect to replacements in gas transmission lines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, RSPA proposes to modify &sect;192.150(b) to add a new exception for replacements in the line sections of existing
gas transmission lines in Class 1 and 2 locations. This exception would be limited to those situations in which an operator,
who wishes to avail itself of the exception, can demonstrate that modifying the line section to accommodate smart
pigs is not feasible, and not needed for future safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The safety prong of this test requires consideration of the operating and maintenance history of the line section.
RSPA expects that the operator will take into account such factors as the reason for the replacement, corrosion history,
leak history, and the risk of outside force damage. For example, if the replacement that triggers the application
of &sect;192.150(a) is required because of corrosion and the line section has a history of corrosion problems, or
if external damage from earth movement is a concern, future safety considerations may require the line section to
accommodate smart pigs.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A decision that modifying a line section is not feasible might be based on the nature and costs of the modification.
For example, if (other than the replacement) the only modification on the line section needed to accommodate smart
pigs is to replace a reduced port valve, and that modification will allow internal inspection of the entire line section,
then the operator might reasonably conclude that the modification is feasible. However, if modification of the line
section would require the acquisition of costly new right-of-way to straighten bends, the operator might reasonably
conclude that modification is not feasible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In reconsidering the benefits and costs of modifying line sections in these less populated areas, we have considered
that we expect to promulgate, in the near future, a final rule in Docket No. PS&hyph;101, Excavation Damage Prevention
Programs for Gas and Hazardous Liquid and Carbon Dioxide Pipelines. The notice for this rulemaking (53 FR 24747; June
30, 1988) proposed to require gas pipeline operators to expand their damage prevention programs to cover rural areas.
Any such requirement that is in the resulting final rule would increase the safety of gas pipelines in Class 1 and 2 locations
from failures caused by dig-ins. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, with respect to existing offshore gas transmission lines, RSPA proposes to allow operators who (1) use cleaning
pigs to remove condensate in offshore transmission lines and (2) inspect platform risers for corrosion to avoid modification
of the complete line section when a replacement is made. The regular removal of condensates reduces the likelihood
of internal corrosion and of the negative environmental impact of a large sheen in the event of a significant leak.
The regular inspection of risers for corrosion by any of the effective methods available provides the necessary assurance
of safety for personnel working on the platform.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the questions posed below is to gather new or updated information relating to the issues in this rulemaking.
Much of the data which RSPA has available were gathered in order to meet the requirement for a congressionally-mandated
study on the feasibility of requiring the use of smart pigs. To obtain information for this study, RSPA solicited information
from interested parties through a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice titled ``Instrumented Internal Inspection Devices'' (54 FR 20948; May 15, 1989). The data were summarized
in Table 1 of the study titled ``Instrumented Internal Inspection Devices (A Study Mandated By P.L. 100&hyph;561),''
published November 1992. Table 1 indicated that 136,359 miles of gas transmission lines and 16,275 miles of hazardous
liquid pipelines would not accommodate instrumented pigs for reasons not relating to the absence of launchers or
receivers. Since this rulemaking only responds to petitions for reconsideration received from the two gas pipeline
trade associations, updating of the mileage figures for hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide pipelines is not relevant.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RSPA invites interested persons to forward comments to the docket as directed under 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

This proposed rule is not considered a significant regulatory action under 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and, therefore,
is not subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget. The notice is not considered significant under the
regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); because
it does not impose additional requirements and has the effect of extending a compliance date. The original regulatory
evaluation of the final rule has been modified because this proposed rule would reduce costs and is available for review

I. Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A sizeable increase in the number of alternatively fueled motor vehicles, including electric vehicles (EVs), in
the United States is expected. This expectation stems from initiatives by the President, Congress, State and local
governments, and private interests, since these vehicles could help reduce air pollution and conserve petroleum
fuel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 include provisions that promote the use of alternative fuels in motor vehicles.
Under these Amendments, fleet vehicles sold in geographic areas with the most serious air pollution problems will
be subject to emission standards that will require the use of clean fuels, including methanol and ethanol, reformulated
gasoline, natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, and electric power.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT) requires Federal, State, and alternative fuel provider fleets
to acquire increasing percentages of alternatively fueled vehicles. The Department of Energy is in the process of
initiating a rulemaking, as required by EPACT, to determine if private fleets should also be required to purchase
certain percentages of alternatively fueled vehicles as part of their new fleet acquisitions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Executive branch initiatives will also encourage the increased use of alternatively fueled vehicles. Executive
Order 12844, dated April 21, 1993, directs that purchases of alternatively fueled vehicles by the Federal government
by substantially increased beyond the levels required by current law. It also established the Federal Fleet Conversion
Task Force to accelerate the commercialization and market acceptance of alternatively fueled vehicles throughout
the country.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A primary impetus for introduction of large numbers of EVs in the U.S. market is a regulation of the California Air Resources
Board. Similar regulations are under consideration by other States. The California regulation requires that not
less than two percent of a manufacturer's sales in the State (roughly 40,000 vehicles total) must be zero emission
vehicles (ZEVs), beginning in model year 1998. This requirement will increase to 10 percent or roughly 200,000 vehicles
beginning in model year 2003. The definition of a ZEV is a vehicle that emits no exhaust or evaporative emission of any
kind. Currently, the EV is the only vehicle which meets these requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is authorized by law (49 U.S.C. 30101&hyph;30169) to
regulate the safety performance of motor vehicles and motor vehicle equipment through the issuance of Federal motor
vehicle safety standards (FMVSSs). In addition, NHTSA has the authority to issue guidelines for States to use in state
motor vehicle inspection programs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Supplementing this authority in the area of alternatively fueled vehicle safety, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 requires
that NHTSA must ``within three years after enactment promulgate rules setting forth safety standards in accordance
with [the agency's statutory authority] applicable to all conversions.'' In addition, the Clean Air Act Amendments
of 1990 include a provision that NHTSA promulgate necessary rules regarding the safety of vehicles converted to run
on clean fuels.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA wishes to assure the safe introduction of EVs and other alternatively fueled vehicles to the market without
impeding technology development.

II. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 27, 1991, the agency published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) on EV safety (56 FR 67038). The purpose of the notice was to help NHTSA
determine what existing FMVSSs may need modification to better accommodate the unique technology of EVs, and what
new safety standards may need to be written to assure their safe introduction. The ANPRM requested comments on a broad
range of potential EV safety issues including battery electrolyte spillage and electric shock hazard, and elicited
widespread public interest. A total of 46 comments were received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After reviewing all of the comments and information received in response to the ANPRM, NHTSA concluded in a November
18, 1992 notice (57 FR 54354) that it was premature to initiate rulemaking for new EV safety standards at that time.
In the areas of battery electrolyte spillage and electric shock hazard in a crash, the agency concluded that further
research was needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1993 NHTSA conducted research and testing on two converted EVs. The vehicles were tested relative to several FMVSSs,
including a crash test in accordance with FMVSS No. 208, Occupant Crash Protection. The two vehicles were equipped
with lead-acid batteries located in the front and rear (engine and luggage compartments). One vehicle was equipped
with twelve 12-volt batteries (five in the front and seven in the rear). The second vehicle was equipped with ten 12-volt
batteries (four in the front and six in the rear). The tests involved frontal crashes into a fixed barrier at 48 kilometers
per hour (kph). In both crashes the front batteries sustained significant damage, spilling large quantities of electrolyte.
On one vehicle 10.4 liters of electrolyte spilled from the front batteries as a result of the crash. On the other vehicle
17.7 liters of electrolyte spilled from the front batteries. In addition, several electrical arcs were observed
under the hood of one vehicle during the crash.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the results of this research and the increasing interest in using EVs to meet clean air requirements, the agency
has decided to reexamine through this notice the safety issues involving EV battery electrolyte spillage and electric
shock hazard. NHTSA notes that the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) through its various committees is also exploring
possible voluntary industry standards and guidelines in these two areas. The agency wishes to identify the magnitude
of the potential safety hazards involved, as well as possible solutions for both original equipment EVs and EV conversions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to conversions, NHTSA's statutory authority distinguishes between two populations of vehicle conversions.
The distinction is based on whether the vehicle is converted before or after the first sale to the ultimate consumer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When a vehicle is converted to an alternative fuel before the first sale to the ultimate consumer, the converter is
in the same position as an original vehicle manufacturer. The converter must certify that the vehicle still complies
with all applicable FMVSSs, including any fuel system integrity standards applicable to the alternative fuel. For
example, if a converter before the first sale converted a gasoline powered vehicle to an EV, and if NHTSA has promulgated
an electrolyte spillage standard applicable to that model year EV, the converter would need to certify that, among
other requirements, the vehicle complied with the electrolyte spillage requirements. In the case of a noncompliance,
the manufacturer or converter must recall and remedy the noncompliant vehicles by repair or replacement; in addition,
NHTSA has the authority to impose a civil penalty of $1000 per violation up to a maximum of $800,000.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By contrast, if a vehicle is converted after the first sale to a consumer, different requirements apply. 49 U.S.C.
30122(b) provides that:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A manufacturer, distributor, dealer, or motor vehicle repair business may not knowingly make inoperative any part
of a device or element of design installed on or in a motor vehicle *&blank;*&blank;* in compliance with an applicable
Federal motor vehicle safety standard.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This includes a vehicle's fuel system. (The prohibition only applies to a converter which is functioning as a ``manufacturer,
distributor, dealer, or motor vehicle repair business,'' not to an individual or to a commercial entity which converts
a vehicle for its own purposes.) This provision differs from requirements before first sale in that the converter
does not ``certify'' compliance with the standard, but instead must not ``knowingly make inoperative.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Using the above example of conversion from gasoline to EV, if a converter after first sale to the consumer converted
a gasoline-powered vehicle to an EV, and if NHTSA regulated electrolyte spillage for that model year vehicle, the
converter need not certify compliance to the electrolyte spillage standard. However, the converter could not knowingly
perform the conversion in such a way that the vehicle would fail to meet the requirements of the electrolyte spillage
standard. If this standard was tested for compliance by means of crash tests, this might be impractical for converters.
Therefore, for aftermarket conversions, NHTSA is exploring the promulgation of regulations which would define
``make inoperative'' in terms of design requirements as a surrogate for the FMVSS requirements. The penalty for noncompliance
with Section 30122(b)'s make inoperative provision is $1000 per violation, up to a maximum of $800,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to Federal motor vehicle safety standards, NHTSA has the statutory authority to issue vehicle safety
inspection standards which can serve as guidelines for those States which conduct safety inspection programs. The
agency could issue such inspection standards for EVs, which a State could voluntarily use if it opts to conduct vehicle
inspections for converted EVs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, in this notice NHTSA seeks comments on a variety of possible approaches to address the potential safety hazards
of EV battery electrolyte spillage and electric shock hazard. Among the possible options are:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Federal safety regulation for EVs and EVs converted before the first sale to a consumer. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These would most likely be primarily performance oriented requirements, such as in FMVSS No. 301, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fuel System Integrity, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
which limits the amount of allowable fuel leakage for liquid fuels after a barrier crash and rollover test. Although
the agency's goal in establishing safety standards is to have performance oriented requirements, the agency does
have some latitude to establish design oriented requirements when necessary or more appropriate.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Regulations to define the term ``make inoperative'' in Section 30122(b) as it applies to EVs converted after the first
sale to a consumer. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These regulations would most likely be design oriented, since it may not be practical for a converter to crash test,
and thereby destroy, the converted vehicle. Such regulations would help vehicle converters understand what constitutes
``make inoperative'' in converting a vehicle to electric power. An example of such regulations could be where to locate
or how to protect the EV batteries so as to minimize battery damage and therefore minimize electrolyte spillage in
a crash.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Vehicle safety inspection standards to serve as guidelines for those States which conduct motor vehicle safety inspection
programs. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency could issue such inspection standards for EVs, which a State could voluntarily use if it chooses to conduct
vehicle inspections of EVs, both original equipment and conversions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Potential Problem Areas and Possible Solutions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this section of the notice NHTSA requests comments on the potential safety hazards due to EV battery electrolyte
spillage in a crash or rollover, and due to electric shock in a crash or rollover and during repair and maintenance.
Information is also sought on possible means to address such hazards through performance and design requirements
for original equipment EVs and EV conversions. Information is requested separately for (1) EVs with a GVWR of 4536
kg or less and all school buses, which is the population of vehicles NHTSA traditionally has regulated for fuel system
integrity, and for (2) EVs with a GVWR greater than 4536 kg, excluding EV school buses, since there may be potential
safety hazards and possible approaches which are unique to vehicles of this size and type. Finally, other information
on EVs is requested, including current and projected EV populations and production, industry and State or local guidelines
on EV safety, hybrid EVs, charging, batteries, and starter interlock performance.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently-produced EVs carry onboard the vehicle a relatively large number of batteries, and therefore a substantial
amount of electrolyte solution. Because of the hazards of electrolyte, there is the potential in a crash or rollover
for injury to vehicle occupants, bystanders, and emergency rescue and clean-up personnel. The agency requests comments
on the potential safety hazards for EVs with a GVWR of 4536 kg or less, and all EV school buses regardless of weight.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Describe the different types of propulsion batteries which are expected to be used in EVs over the next five and ten
years, including the form (liquid or gel), chemical properties, and temperatures of the various electrolyte solutions.
Which of the electrolyte solutions are acidic, basic, or water reactive, and to what extent? How many batteries and
what quantity of electrolyte are expected to be onboard EVs over the next five and ten years? Where will the batteries
be located on EVs?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Is there a potential safety problem with electrolyte contacting occupants, bystanders, rescue teams, or clean-up
personnel as a result of an EV crash or rollover? If so, what are the potential safety consequences? Can chemical or
thermal burns result? Is there the potential for toxic or asphyxiant vapors? If so, from which electrolytes and due
to what quantities of spillage?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. What is the potential fire hazard of spilled or sprayed electrolyte in a crash or rollover? Could battery electrolyte
ignite in the same way as a fuel? If so, which electrolytes and in what quantities, concentrations, or mixtures, and
at what temperatures? What is the likelihood that leaking electrolyte at a crash scene could serve as an electrical
conductor or short circuit, thereby creating a fire hazard?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The agency understands that sodium-sulphur batteries operate with liquid coolant at approximately 316 degrees
C., which circulates around the batteries and through a heat exchanger onboard the EV. The temperature of liquid coolants
for internal combustion engines on conventional vehicles is much lower, approximately 91 degrees C. Further, sodium-sulphur
batteries require an extremely strong vacuum insulated container to retain the heat and prevent spillage in an accident.
Sodium can explode if it comes into contact with water. Is there a potential safety problem with high temperature battery
coolants contacting occupants, bystanders, rescue teams, or clean-up personnel as a result of an EV crash or rollover?
If so, what are the safety concerns? Can burn injuries result? What types of coolants are used with EV batteries, and
what are their corresponding temperature ranges during driving and charging operations?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Describe the likelihood and potential safety consequences of having spilled electrolyte from an EV crash mix with
a different electrolyte or with other vehicle fluids, such as gasoline, diesel fuel, engine coolant, or oil. Could
a chemical fire or explosion occur, and if so, with which electrolytes and fluids? Is there the potential for toxic
or asphyxiant vapors? Please discuss.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Describe all EV crashes or rollovers or noncrash events involving spilled electrolyte, including the sequence
of events, a description of the EV, and the type of electrolyte which spilled. Were there injuries or fatalities as
a result of the spilled electrolyte? If so, please describe.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Discuss the need for federal regulation to address the potential safety hazards of battery electrolyte spillage
in a crash or rollover, or noncrash event.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Possible FMVSS Performance Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One approach which the agency could use to address electrolyte spillage in a crash or rollover is to limit the amount
of allowable spillage through a performance test. This could be similar to the requirements in FMVSS No. 301, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fuel System Integrity, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
which limits the amount of allowable liquid fuel spillage after barrier crash and static rollover tests. FMVSS No.
303, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fuel System Integrity of Compressed Natural Gas Vehicles, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
contains similar crash test limitation requirements. FMVSS No. 301, for example, after barrier crash tests requires
that there be no more than (1) One ounce (28 grams) by weight of liquid fuel loss from the time of barrier impact until
vehicle motion has ceased, (2) five ounces (142 grams) during the next five minutes, and (3) one ounce (28 grams) per
minute during the next 25 minutes. These requirements apply to vehicles of 10,000 pounds (4536 kg) GVWR or less when
subjected to a 30 mph (48 kph) frontal fixed barrier crash test, or 20 mph (32 kph) lateral or 30 mph (48 kph) rear moving
barrier crash test. For school buses with a GVWR greater than 10,000 pounds (4536 kg), FMVSS No. 301 requires a 30 mph
(48 kph) moving barrier impact at any point from any angle on the bus with the same allowable fuel loss. FMVSS No. 301
has similar fuel spillage limitations during a static rollover test, following a crash test, for vehicles of 10,000
pounds (4536 kg) GVWR or less.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are requested on possible approaches for addressing the safety hazards of electrolyte spillage in a crash
or rollover for EVs with a GVWR of 4536 kg or less, and for all EV school buses regardless of weight.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Discuss the appropriateness of using an approach similar to that of FMVSS No. 301 to regulate the safe performance
of EV electrolyte spillage in a crash or rollover.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. What would be an appropriate amount of electrolyte spillage to allow after a crash or rollover test? Please discuss.
Should it be based on the number or type of batteries onboard the EV, or whether spillage occurs inside or outside the
passenger compartment or cargo areas? If so, how much should be allowed? For example, should a ``level of hazard''
be defined by battery type, which would allow spillage of larger quantities of less harmful electrolytes and smaller
quantities of the more harmful electrolytes? Would it be appropriate to require no spillage? Is there an amount that
would approximate the no-spillage condition?

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the case of EVs converted after first sale to a consumer, where the ``make inoperative'' requirements apply, it
may not be practical to test for the safe performance of electrolyte spillage through a crash test since this would
destroy the converted vehicle. Design oriented requirements may be more appropriate, such as defining where to locate
or how to protect the EV batteries in a crash or rollover. Comments are requested on possible approaches for EVs with
a GVWR of 4536 kg or less, and all EV school buses regardless of weight.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. For EVs converted after first sale to a consumer, would it be appropriate to define the term ``make inoperative''
as being not able to comply with the performance requirements of a crash standard? For example, would it be appropriate
to require such EV conversions to be tested in accordance with any crash test requirements the agency may establish
relative to battery electrolyte spillage? please discuss.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. Alternatively, would it be appropriate to establish separate design requirements as a surrogate for performance
requirements, to address electrolyte spillage in a crash or rollover for EV after-first-sale conversions? Please
discuss. Would such requirements provide a level of performance comparable to that of a vehicle crash test? If so,
please describe them.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. Discuss the appropriateness of requiring that batteries be placed onboard the EV at locations which minimize
their damage in a crash or rollover, or in a protective box. What locations would minimize battery damage? What requirements
should be placed on battery box design, construction, or testing? Should the boxes be constructed with dual walls
to allow some crush of the outer wall in a crash or rollover?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. Would it be appropriate to require that all batteries be equipped with threaded vent/filler caps, rather than

without vent/filler caps?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. Discuss the need for EV labeling with respect to electrolyte spillage. Should EVs be labeled with the type of battery
electrolyte onboard the vehicle to assist emergency rescue teams at a crash scene?

Potential Safety Problem

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The electric propulsion systems for current technology EVs operate at a relatively high level of electric power.
In the case of the two EV conversions which the agency crash tested in 1993, the nominal voltage levels for the electric
propulsion systems were 120 and 144 volts with a maximum battery system current limit (controlled by fuse) of 400 and
350 amps for the Sebring and Solectria vehicles, respectively. Current technology EVs have battery voltage levels
up to 400 volts or more, and maximum current ratings up to 400 amps. Because of these high levels of electric power, there
is the potential for electric shock to occupants and rescue teams as a result of an EV crash or rollover. There is also
the potential for electric shock to persons performing EV repair and maintenance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency requests information on the potential safety hazards of electric shock for EVs with a GVWR of 4536 kg or less,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20. What levels of voltage (volts) and current (amps) are expected to be used in EV propulsion systems over the next
five and ten years? Do these levels depend on vehicle size or the type of electric drive system onboard the EV (AC or DC)?

27. Would it be appropriate to require EV circuit interrupter performance in a crash or rollover, which would automatically
disconnect the propulsion batteries from all other electrical circuits and thereby prevent high voltage and current
flow to other parts of the vehicle? Such response would be similar in timing and deceleration level to that of an occupant

propulsion batteries in a crash or rollover? Please discuss.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
28. What time period, deceleration level, and vehicle attitude should be required for circuit interrupter performance
of EV propulsion batteries in a crash or rollover? Should these be related to the minimum injury levels for electric

be required? Please discuss.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
29. What is an appropriate method of compliance testing circuit interrupter performance of EV propulsion batteries
in a crash or rollover? Would an EV crash test (front, side, or rear) and static rollover test, as in FMVSS No. 301, be
appropriate, where performance of the circuit interrupter could be measured over time at a certain deceleration
or vehicle attitude? Alternatively, could a component test of the circuit interrupter be conducted, which would
eliminate the need for a vehicle crash test? Please discuss.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30. Would it be appropriate to require that EV batteries, connectors, cables, and wiring be located, routed, and insulated
so as to minimize or eliminate electric shock hazard due to a crash or rollover, or during repair and maintenance? Similarly,
should there be a requirement for minimum wire size in EV circuits? For example, what should be the minimum wire sizes
for AC and DC propulsion drive circuits ranging from 120 to 600 volts? Should there be a requirement that EV propulsion
circuits not be grounded to the vehicle chassis (electrically isolated)? What standards and guidelines are being
used by current EV manufacturers and converters? Please discuss.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
31. Would it be appropriate to require EVs to have a means of manually disconnecting the propulsion batteries from

be required of EV circuits through means such as fuses, circuit breakers, or ground fault interrupters? What types
should be required? Are EV controllers typically equipped with capacitors which can remain energized even after
the main power circuit has been disconnected? What technologies are available? Please discuss.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The bald eagle (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Haliaeetus leucocephalus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) is listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act (Act) of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
), in the lower 48 states, except Washington, Oregon, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan, where it is listed as threatened.
The bald eagle also occurs in Alaska and Canada, where it is not at risk and is not protected under the Act; and in small
numbers in northern Mexico. The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) proposed to reclassify the bald eagle from endangered
to threatened in the lower 48 states except in certain portions of the American Southwest and to classify those eagles
in adjacent Mexico as endangered. The bald eagle would remain threatened in the five states where it is currently listed
as threatened. The special rule for threatened bald eagles would be revised. This action would not alter those conservation
measures already in force to protect the species and its habitats.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act) requires that a fishery management plan or amendment
prepared by fishery management council be submitted to the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) for review and approval,
disapproval, or partial disapproval. The Magnuson Act also requires that the Secretary, upon receiving an amendment,
immediately publish notification stating that the amendment is available for public review and comment. The Secretary
will consider public comment in determining approvability of the amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Amendment 5 proposes to: (1) Place a 4-year moratorium, beginning July 1, 1994, on the issuance by the Director, Southeast
Region, NMFS (Regional Director), of Federal numbers and color codes for use on stone crab vessels and gear; (2) establish
a procedure whereby the Florida Marine Fisheries Commission (FMFC) may request the Regional Director to implement
in the exclusive economic zone by regulatory amendment, with the Council's oversight, modification to certain gear
and harvest limitations applicable to State waters that were proposed by the FMFC and approved by the Florida Governor
and Cabinet; (3) add to the objectives of the FMP the following: ``Provide for a more flexible management system that
minimizes regulatory delay to assure more effective, cooperative state and Federal management of the fishery.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS published notification of the proposed moratorium on July 1, 1994 (59 FR 33947), which advised fishermen that,
if Amendment 5 is approved and implemented, any Federal numbers/color codes issued between July 1, 1994, and the effective
date of the implementing regulations would no longer be valid.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed regulations to implement Amendment 5 are scheduled for publication within 15 days.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes to revise regulations which define the responsibilities and liabilities of the Federal Government
(Government), Federal Reserve Banks, financial institutions, Receivers and Originators doing business with the
Government through the Automated Clearing House (ACH) system. This revision proposes substantive changes to the
existing regulations and supersedes the savings allotment provisions of Part 209 because savings allotment and
recurring benefit payments formerly under the terms of Part 209 are made by the ACH method under the terms of Part 210.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These revisions are intended to provide a regulatory basis for broader use of the ACH system to meet the future payment,
collection, and information flow needs of the Government. These revisions also are intended to bring Government
regulations more in line with financial industry rules so as to eliminate, as much as possible, the need for the financial
industry to operate under two sets of rules for processing ACH transactions. In general, these revisions accept the
private industry 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ACH Rules 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
as promulgated by the National Automated Clearing House Association (NACHA), unless it is determined that, in its
role of protecting the public trust, it is not in the best interests of the Government to do so. The exceptions to the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ACH Rules 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
are cited in these regulations. The Government already uses

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to Government entries. These regulations will continue to provide provisions which protect the substantive rights
of participants and enumerate their liabilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The major reasons for the proposed changes are to provide a clearer and broader framework, and greater leeway for the
Department of the Treasury, Financial Management Service (the Service), to make ongoing modifications to policies,
Government operating instructions, and interpretations of this regulation. This will permit the Service to manage
effectively the transition to fully electronic processing, respond more rapidly to changes in commercial rules
and operating procedures, and utilize commercial ACH processes or rules, unless it is determined not to be in the best
interest of the Government. It also will provide the Service a regulatory basis for working with the financial community
to develop or enhance ACH products and services as they become available in the banking industry, if they are consistent
with the terms of the regulation described in this part. This requires a complete rewording of Subpart A and Subpart
B.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Part 210 of Title 31 of the Code of Federal Regulations sets forth the rights and liabilities of the Government, Federal
Reserve Banks, financial institutions and recipients where recipients of Government payments authorize the payments
to be made by the ACH method. The regulations in this part were promulgated in 1975 and revised in 1976, 1984, 1987, 1989,
and 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service is revising these regulations to provide the framework necessary to achieve its ACH development strategy
which involves the following three objectives: (1) Broaden the use of the ACH network for payments and collections;
(2) move closer to industry standards to easily expand Government services within existing networks; and, (3) pursue
a paperless environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service proposes to increase the use of the ACH network by adapting the regulatory framework of Part 210 to the emerging
body of ACH products and services. This requires an expansion of the regulation to cover activities that are, or in
the future may be, handled over the ACH network, including collections and the movement of information related to
monetary transactions. In this way, the Service and Federal program agencies will be in a position to take full advantage
of the ACH network to move as many of the Government's transactions as possible to ACH.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moving closer to industry standards, as set forth by NACHA through the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ACH Rules, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
also will enable the Government to expand its use of the ACH network. This will give the Service the flexibility to adopt,
when in the best interest of the Government and consistent with legal requirements, those ACH practices and procedures
that are proven viable in the commercial sector, and to work within industry rulemaking practices to introduce new
practices and procedures. This requires a complete reworking of Subpart A and Subpart B.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service, in its pursuit toward a paperless environment, will be able to streamline and automate such diverse payment-related
information processes as change requests, authorization activities, and reclamations. In the past, these have
been expensive paper-based ancillary ACH activities. Advances in the ACH network have shown the efficiency of automating
these processes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following methods were used by the Service to determine which revisions to the rules were necessary to achieve
its ACH development strategy. First, an ACH work group was established to identify the major differences between
the Government and private industry. The work group wrote issue papers discussing the differences along with options
for resolving them. Second, a rules impact assessment was developed to determine how the differences in rules affected
financial institutions. The assessment involved asking representatives from financial institutions about the
impact of the current Government ACH rules and procedures, and an analysis of their responses. Third, the Service
conducted a series of Federal agency forums to discuss options to resolve the differences. These efforts provided
the basis for making the proposed revisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service is proposing:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Clarification of the authorization and revocation processes to offer additional consumer protection and to
facilitate automated or streamlined authorization procedures, including procedures to authorize debits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Clarification of the liability of participants with regard to authorizations, revocations, prenotification
entries, notification of change entries, and commercial-to-Government entries.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) That liabilities be associated with failure to examine and act upon prenotifications that may be originated by
the Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A regulatory framework for equitable adjustments when a financial institution either has been enriched, or harmed,
as a result of erroneous ACH entries. The provision will allow Federal agencies to abide by industry rules if they have
independent authority and choose to do so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) That after due consideration of commercial practices, the Service may publish procedures under which it may authorize
reversing entries to correct duplications or errors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Improvements to the reclamation of post-death benefits portion of the regulation, and a framework for paperless
processing of the information and money associated with these transactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) To substitute certain terms used in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ACH Rules 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
for terms which the Government uses in the same way as those defined in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ACH Rules
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and to include those terms the Government uses differently from the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ACH Rules 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
or which are not contained in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ACH Rules
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. For example, current Part 210 uses the term ``payment date,'' while the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ACH Rules
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 use the term ``settlement date.'' Since both of these terms are used in the same way, the Service will use the term ``settlement
date.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service will accept or reject amendments to the NACHA Operating Rules and NACHA Operating Guidelines which may
affect Government ACH transactions. Therefore, Section 210.2(a)(4) proposes that ``The Service will indicate
its acceptance or rejection of amendments to NACHA Operating Rules and NACHA Operating Guidelines in effect on September
27, 1994, by publishing a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 prior to the effective date of the amendments.''

Rulemaking Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Treasury has determined that this regulation is not a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive Order
12866. Accordingly, a regulatory assessment is not required. It is hereby certified that this revision will not have
a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, a regulatory flexibility
analysis is not required. The included changes are expected to result in improvements to the ACH process with advantages
to institutions and recipients.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This part governs the way the Federal Government (Government) uses the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network to
effect electronic credits and debits, and non-value transactions. This part supersedes the savings allotment provisions
of Part 209 of this title by including provisions for savings allotments (available hereunder only to Federal civilian
employees). These transactions are made by the ACH payment method under the terms of this part. Regulations requiring
the collection and disbursement of all ACH Federal funds via Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT), when cost effective,
practicable, and consistent with existing statutes, can be found at Part 206 of this title. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulations promulgated by the Bureau of the Public Debt governing payments made by the ACH method for principal and
interest on Government securities can be found at Part 370 of this title.

Requirements for authorization. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The requirements for authorization to originate and receive credit and debit transactions are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Every Government Originator shall obtain prior authorization from the Receiver for ACH transactions originated
by the Government. The Government Originator shall exercise due diligence in verifying the identity of any Receiver
who presents an authorization to the Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) All Originators sending ACH credits with a value greater than zero to the Government shall enter into an agreement
with the Government entity to which the credit is directed prior to transmitting the first credit. Specifications
for the agreement can be found in the TFM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A Receiving Depository Financial Institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(RDFI) shall verify the identity of any Receiver who initiates or executes an authorization through the RDFI to receive
credits or debits originated by the Government. The RDFI shall exercise due diligence in such identification, at
a minimum applying the standards used for negotiation of financial instruments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The title of the account designated to receive a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment shall include the name of the Receiver, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
except as provided as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) In the case of discretionary allotments, the allotter may authorize a credit to any other Receiver. The Receiver's
agreement is not required for the authorization or revocation; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) In the case of a master account/sub-account structure, the accounts need not include the name of the Receiver.
However, a clearly traceable audit trail to the payment shall exist in the sub-account, and the Receiver must retain
control over the funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Government benefit payments shall be deposited only into a consumer account except under conditions stated in
&sect;210.3(a)(4)(ii). The definition of consumer account includes non-participating depository financial
institutions that receive Government payments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This part does not authorize or direct an RDFI to debit the account of a Receiver or any other customer, living or deceased,
for the RDFI's liability to the Government under &sect;&sect;210.8 through 210.12. The amount in the Receiver's
account is only a measure of the RDFI's liability. Nothing in this part shall be construed to affect any right an RDFI
may have under State law or the RDFI's contract with a customer to recover amounts equal to those returned to the Government
in compliance with this part. A withdrawer may deposit funds to an account and authorize the RDFI to return such monies
to the Government.

An RDFI return of credits to the Government by ACH because of the death of the Receiver or beneficiary will constitute
effective notice of death to the Government Originator. The RDFI shall not be liable for any future ACH transaction
for that individual from the same Government Originator if the settlement date is more than 10 business days after
the settlement date of the return entry.

The payments subject to reclamation are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If the RDFI had knowledge on the settlement date of the death or legal incapacity of the Receiver or the death of the
beneficiary and did not timely and properly return the payment(s) by ACH return entry to the Government, the RDFI shall
be liable for that entry(ies) and shall return an equal amount to the Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the RDFI had no knowledge on the settlement date of the death or legal incapacity of the Receiver or the death of
beneficiary, the RDFI shall be liable for the lesser of: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) An amount equal to the amount of the payment(s); or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) An amount equal to the amount in the deceased or legally incapacitated Receiver's account, or the deceased beneficiary's
account, up to the amount of the payment. The amount in the account is defined as the account balance when the RDFI received
notice of the death or legal incapacity and had reasonable time to take action on it, plus any other additions to the
account balance made before the RDFI returns the payment(s). For purposes of this paragraph, action is taken within
a reasonable time if it is taken not later than the close of the business day following the receipt of the reclamation
entry(ies). When determining the amount in the account, the RDFI's liability shall not be reduced for debit card withdrawals,
automated withdrawals, pre-authorized debits, non-Government reclamations, and forged checks or other comparable
instruments, made after the RDFI had knowledge of the death or legal incapacity.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The Government employee provides the Government participant with an authorization; and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The authorization has not been canceled by the employee, in writing, or otherwise terminated or revoked; and,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Not more than two such allotments for any employee are in effect at any time; and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The amount of salary or wages becoming due an employee for any pay period thereafter is sufficient to cover the allotment(s).
In making any determination under this paragraph, all payroll deductions otherwise required shall have precedence
over those authorized by this section; and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The purpose of the allotment is not to circumvent statutes, Executive Orders, and other executive branch regulations,
regardless of the manner in which the allotment for savings will be disposed of by the employee (which is at the employee's
discretion).
