relating to the excess medical expense deduction. The changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will simplify the means by which households with elderly and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disabled members claim deductions from income for verified, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prospective, non-reimbursed medical expenses.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Justice Reform. This rule is intended to have preemptive effect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with respect to any State or local laws, regulations or policies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which conflict with its provisions or which would otherwise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impede its full implementation. This rule is not intended to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have retroactive effect unless so specified in the

challenge to the provisions of this rule or the application of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its provisions, all applicable administrative procedures must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exhausted. In the Food Stamp Program the administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures are as follows: (1) for Program benefit recipients_State administrative procedures issued pursuant
to 7 U.S.C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendment to section 5(e) of the Food Stamp Act of 1977 (7 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S.C. 2014(e)) which is reflected in this rule was enacted in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1990 as section 1717 of the Mickey Leland Memorial Domestic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Relief Act (1990 Leland Act), Title XVII, Pub. L. 101&hyph;624 (104 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Stat. 3783, Nov. 28, 1990). This amendment was effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
February 1, 1992. The provisions of this rule are required to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implemented not later than October 1, 1994, in order to assure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that all State agencies are in full compliance with the amendment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as soon as possible. For this reason, Ellen Haas, Assistant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary for Food and Consumer Services, has determined pursuant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to 5 U.S.C. 553 that public comment on this rule prior to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation is impracticable and that good cause exists for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
making this rule effective less than 30 days after its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
publication. However, because we believe the administration of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the rule may be improved by public comment, comments are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solicited on this rule for 60 days after publication. All 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments received within the comment period will be analyzed, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any appropriate changes will be incorporated in the subsequent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
publication of a final rule.

Section 351 of the Hunger Prevention Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100&hyph;435 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(102 Stat. 1645, September 19, 1988) (HPA) amended Section 5(e) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Food Stamp Act of 1977, as amended, 7 U.S.C. 2014(e), to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require State agencies to offer eligible households with an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elderly or disabled member a method for claiming a deduction for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recurring medical expenses in place of provisions that had 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required households to report and verify expenses monthly. On 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
June 7, 1989, the Department published an interim rulemaking at

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 1989 interim rule amended several provisions of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations pertaining to the medical deduction, particularly in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the area of reporting and verification requirements for allowable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
medical expenses. Under the 1989 interim rule, households 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to monthly reporting are given the option of either 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting and verifying all medical expenses monthly, or of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting and verifying changes in medical expenses in excess of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$25 occurring during the certification period, but they cannot be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to report under both procedures. The 1989 interim rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended 7 CFR 273.21(h)(3) (i) and (ii), (i)(1), and (j)(3)(iii) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to specify the household's options with regard to reporting and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
verifying medical expenses in a monthly reporting and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retrospective budgeting (MRRB) system. In addition, 7 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
273.12(a)(1)(vi) and 7 CFR 273.21(h)(3)(iii) were amended by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1989 interim rule to simplify reporting changes in medical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenses. The 1989 interim rule required that changes in total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
medical expenses greater than $25 must be reported, as opposed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a $25 change in each individual allowable medical expense. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following publication of the 1989 interim rule, the 1990 Leland 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act was enacted. Regulations published to implement provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of that Act superseded some of the changes made in the 1989 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interim rule. Section 1724 of the 1990 Leland Act delegated to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each State agency the responsibility for design of the monthly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report form, including the determination of what information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relevant to eligibility and benefits was to be included on that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
form. These provisions of section 1724 were implemented by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Monthly Reporting and Retrospective Budgeting Amendments and Mass 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Changes final rule, published on December 4, 1991 at 56 FR 63597. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Conforming amendments to verification requirements associated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the monthly report were also made at that time. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory amendments in the December 4, 1991 final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
superseded the changes made to 7 CFR 273.21(h)(3) (i), (ii), and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii), and (i)(1) by the 1989 interim rule, because the interim 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions concerned the information that the Department mandated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be contained on the monthly report form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendments made to the regulations at 7 CFR 273.12(a)(vi) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
273.21(j)(iii) (C) and (D) by the 1989 interim rule were neither 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finalized nor superseded by subsequent regulations. As explained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
below, however, the Department is now making new amendments to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these sections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1717 of the 1990 Leland Act amended section 5(e) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Food Stamp Act to provide for a simplified means for eligible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
households to claim the excess medical expense deduction for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recurring medical costs. Section 1717 requires State agencies to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimate at certification a recipient's recurring medical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenses for the certification period based upon the recipient's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current verified medical expenses, as well as available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information about the recipient's medical condition, and public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or private medical insurance coverage. The household's medical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deduction would be based on these estimates, and further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
verification would not be required. In a proposed rule entitled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Miscellaneous Provisions of the Mickey Leland Memorial Domestic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hunger Relief Act and Food Stamp Certification Policy,'' published 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on June 28, 1991 (56 FR 29594), the Department stated that food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stamp regulations at 7 CFR 273.2(f)(8) and 273.12(a)(6) already 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflected the intent of the statute and that, therefore, no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change to the regulations was required. No comments disputing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this position were received, and the position was reiterated in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rule published on December 4, 1991 (56 FR 63594). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has come to the attention of the Department that some State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies may not be properly applying section 1717. This may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
due to confusion on the part of State agencies with regard to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department's decision not to issue regulations in connection with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 1717. To ensure that State agencies are in compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with section 1717, the Department issued three memoranda to FNS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regional offices, dated February 3, 1994, April 1, 1994, and May 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12, 1994. In the memoranda, the Department instructed the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regional offices to remind State agencies that they must be in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with the provisions of section 1717. The Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also offered direction as to how the State agencies can implement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the provisions of section 1717. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a further effort to insure that State agencies are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementing the provisions of section 1717, the Department is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amending food stamp regulations that concern the medical expense 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deduction. These changes will clarify current regulations to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
better express the intent of section 1717. Accordingly, this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule amends 7 CFR 273.10(d)(1)(i), 273.10(d)(4), 273.12(a)(vi), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
273.21 (h), (i), and (j)(iii) (C) and (D). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the amendments, the household will be required to report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and verify all medical expenses at certification and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recertification. The household's monthly medical deduction for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its certification period will be based on the information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reported and verified by the household, and any anticipated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes in the household's medical expenses that can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonably expected to occur during the certification period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on available information about the recipient's medical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition, public or private insurance coverage, and current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
verified medical expenses. If the household reports a medical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expense at certification but cannot verify the expense at that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time, and if the amount of the expense cannot be reasonably 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anticipated based on available information about the recipient's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
medical condition, public or private insurance coverage, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current verified medical expenses, the expense will be considered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the time the amount of the expense or reimbursement is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reported and verified. The household will not be required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
file reports about its medical expenses during the certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period. If the household voluntarily reports a change in its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
medical expenses, the State agency will act on the changes in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with current regulations at 7 CFR 273.12(c).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is also making a related amendment to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations at 7 CFR 273.12(c) for changes in medical expenses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are discovered from a source other than the household. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, those regulations require the State agency to act on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all changes in a household's circumstances, including those it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discovers from a source other than the household. Often times, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
however, the State agency must contact the household to verify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such unreported changes. Since the intent of section 1717 is to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
avoid recurrent reporting and verification on the part of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
households receiving the medical expense deduction, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department is amending 7 CFR 273.12(c) to require that the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency act on those changes in medical expenses it learns of from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a source other than the household only if it can act without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contacting the household for further information or verification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The household will be informed about the changes in accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the notice requirements at 7 CFR 273.13. Those changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
learned from a source other than the household which are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
verified upon receipt and therefore necessitate contact with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
household for verification purposes shall not be acted upon until 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the household is recertified.

This rule is effective and must be implemented no later than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
October 1, 1994. For quality control purposes, any variances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resulting from the implementation of the rule shall be excluded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from error analysis for 120 days from the required implementation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date, in accordance with 7 CFR 275.12(d)(2)(vii). The provision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be implemented for all households that newly apply for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Program benefits on or after the required implementation date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current caseload shall be converted to these provisions at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the household's request, at the time of recertification, or when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the case is next reviewed, whichever occurs first. The State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency must provide restored benefits to such households back to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the required implementation date or the date of application 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whichever is later. If for any reason a State agency fails to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implement on the required implementation date, restored benefits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall be provided, if appropriate, back to the required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation date or the date of application whichever is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
later.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 As part of the Department of Commerce initiative to streamline export licensing requirements for exports to countries

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are demonstrating increased ability to safeguard reexports of U.S.-origin strategic goods and technology,
the Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) is extending to Taiwan export licensing benefits available under the provisions
of section 5(k) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (EAA). This action will lessen the administrative
burden on U.S. exporters and their foreign customers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Specifically, BXA is: Providing shorter processing times for license applications for Taiwan; and amending General
License GCG to authorize certain shipments of U.S.-origin commodities to Taiwan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule also amends the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) to include new requirements based on the implementation
of Import Certificate/Delivery Verification (IC/DV) procedures for Taiwan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The address for the authority administering the IC/DV system within Romania is also revised by this rule.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In April, 1994, Taiwan implemented an island-wide IC/DV system. This system extends the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial
Park IC/DV system and makes Taiwan eligible for general license GCG and 15 day/15 day license processing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) requires a foreign importer to file an International Import Certificate
(IC) in support of individual validated license applications to export certain commodities controlled for national
security reasons to specified destinations. The commodities are identified by the code letter ``A'' following the
Export Control Classification Number on the Commerce Control List, which identifies those items subject to Department
of Commerce export controls. An IC is an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undertaking by the government of the country of ultimate destination to exercise legal control over the disposition
of those commodities covered by an IC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BXA also requires a Delivery Verification Certificate (DV) on a selective basis, as described in 15 CFR 775.3(i).
A DV is issued by the government of the country of ultimate destination after the exported commodities have either
entered the export jurisdiction of that country or are otherwise accounted for by the importer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New documentation practices adopted by Taiwan warrant the inclusion of that country in the IC/DV procedure. This
rule amends the EAR by revising Taiwan's entry within the list of countries that issue Import Certificates and by revising
the name and address of the Taiwan authorities in the list of foreign offices that administer the IC/DV systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The main authority for administering the Taiwan IC/DV program is the Board of Foreign Trade, Ministry of Economic
Affairs. There are also two satellite offices: the Science-Based Industrial Park Administration and the Export
Processing Zone Administration. If the destination of the export is within the Science-Based Industrial Park or
the Export Processing Zone, then one should apply for the IC/DV at the appropriate satellite office. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule also revises the Romanian IC/DV authority address to the ``Authorities Administering Import Certificate/Delivery
Verification System in Foreign Countries'' table, Supplement No. 1 to Part 775. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the Export Administration Act (EAA) expired on August 20, 1994, the President invoked the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act and continued in effect, to the extent permitted by law, the provisions of the EAA and
the EAR in Executive Order 12924 of August 19, 1994.

1. This final rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. This rule involves collections of information subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). These collections have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under control numbers 0694&hyph;0001,
0694&hyph;0005, 0694&hyph;0007, 0695&hyph;0010, and 0694&hyph;0016. Licensing requirements under OMB control
numbers 0694&hyph;0005, 0694&hyph;0007, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
0694&hyph;0010 will be reduced as a result of this rule, while there will be a small increase under 0694&hyph;0001
and 0694&hyph;0016, thereby reducing overall the paperwork burden on the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Import Certificate issued by the Government of Taiwan does not constitute a collection of information under the
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalism
assessment under Executive Order 12612. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment are not required to be given for this
rule by section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5 U.S.C. 553) or by any other law, under section 3(a) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 603(a) and 604(a)) no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has to be or will be prepared. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5 U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, the opportunity for public participation, and a delay in
the effective date, are inapplicable because this regulation involves 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a military or foreign affairs function of the United States. Further, no other law requires that a notice of proposed

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment be given for this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, this regulation is issued in final form. Although there is no formal comment period, public comments on
this regulation are welcome on a continuing basis. Comments should be submitted to Sharron Cook, Office of Technology
and Policy Analysis, Bureau of Export Administration, Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Commerce, P.O. Box 273, Washington, DC 20044.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Subpart D of 24 CFR part 791 provides the procedures for allocating budget authority under section 213(d) of the Housing
and Community Development Act of 1974 among the HUD Field Offices for certain programs specified in 24 CFR 791.101(a).
The regulations currently provide that budget authority for the Indian housing program under 24 CFR part 905 shall
be allocated on the basis of the relative housing needs of the Indian tribal population, ``as measured by the Bureau
of Indian Affairs, and by data for non-BIA recognized groups served by the Indian housing program.'' (See 24 CFR 791.402(c)(2).)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) no longer provides data upon which HUD can make its determination. This rule amends
&sect;791.402(c)(2) to provide that HUD will base its determination upon data from the most recent, available decennial
census and, where appropriate, more recent data from the Bureau of the Census or other Federal agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Justification for Final Rule Making 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with its own regulations on rulemaking in 24 CFR part 10, the Department generally publishes a rule for
public comment before issuing a rule for effect, unless to do so would be impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary
to the public interest. This rule is being published for effect without prior public comment because the Department
believes to do so would be unnecessary. The decennial census is the source of data used in making determinations for
allocating budget authority in non-Indian housing programs, and therefore, is one the Department has confidence
in as a reliable and objective source.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Environmental Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with 40 CFR 1508.4 of the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality and 24 CFR 50.20(k) of the
HUD regulations, the policies and procedures contained in this rule relate only to internal administrative procedures
whose content does not constitute a development decision nor affect the physical condition of project areas or building
sites and, therefore, are categorically excluded from the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this document before
publication and by approving it certifies that the rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. The rule revises existing procedures for the allocation of housing assistance funds, but
will make no change in the economic impact of these procedures on small entities.

The Family
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

not have Federalism implications. Specifically, the rule will not substantially alter the established roles of
HUD and the States and local governments, including IHAs, in administering affected programs. As a result, the rule
is not subject to review.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 174 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides two alternative methods that taxpayers may use to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
account for research or experimental expenditures. A taxpayer may either deduct the expenditures in the year in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which they are paid or incurred, or treat the expenditures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as deferred expenses, amortizable over a period of at least 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
60 months. In 1957, the IRS adopted &sect;1.174&hyph;2(a)(1), which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defines the term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
research or experimental expenditures
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenditures which represent research and development costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the experimental or laboratory sense (22 FR 7901 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(October 4, 1957)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1993, the IRS proposed amendments to &sect;1.174&hyph;2(a)(1) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to clarify the definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
research or experimental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenditures
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 15819 (March 24, 1993)). The amendments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also provide guidance regarding section 174(e), which was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
added to the Code by the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1989. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 174(e) provides that the accounting rules of section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
174 apply to a research or experimental expenditure only to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the extent that the amount of the expenditure is reasonable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The IRS received comments on the proposed amendments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both in writing and at a public hearing on June 18, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This Treasury decision adopts the proposed amendments with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
several revisions in response to public comments.

A. Clarification of Uncertainty Test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted above, the 1957 regulations define 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
research or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experimental expenditures
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as expenditures which represent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
research and development costs in the experimental or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laboratory sense. The proposed amendments provide that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenditures represent research and development costs in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experimental or laboratory sense if they are for activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended to discover information that would eliminate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uncertainty concerning the development or improvement of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product. Under the proposed amendments, the requisite 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uncertainty exists if the information reasonably available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the taxpayer does not establish the capability or method 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for developing or improving the product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commentators expressed concern that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uncertainty test provided in the proposed amendments could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be construed to limit unduly the definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
research or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experimental expenditures.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In particular, the commentators 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
argued that the test could exclude expenditures incurred to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine the appropriate design of a product if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxpayer knows at the outset that the procedure will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
successful. In such a case, the taxpayer is not uncertain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as to either its capability to develop the product or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
method by which it will develop the product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Treasury Department and the IRS agree that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxpayer's knowledge that a product development project will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be successful does not preclude the process of determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the appropriate design of the product from qualifying as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
research. The Treasury Department and the IRS also agree 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the language of the uncertainty test provided in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed amendments could be construed to reach a result 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contrary to that intended. The final amendments thus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clarify the uncertainty test. Under the final amendments, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the requisite uncertainty exists if the information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available to the taxpayer does not establish either (i) The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capability or method for developing or improving the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product, or (ii) the appropriate design of the product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The uncertainty test, as clarified in the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendments, reflects the dual purposes of section 174. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress enacted section 174 not only to encourage research, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but also to avoid the difficult tax accounting questions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that would arise regarding research expenditures in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
absence of special tax accounting rules. See H. Rep. 1337, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
83d Cong., 2d Sess. (1954), reprinted in 1954 U.S.C.C.A.N. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4017, 4053. These difficult tax accounting questions would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not be limited to cases in which the success of a product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development project is in doubt. If a given line of inquiry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proves to be unfruitful, questions could arise regarding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether the costs involved could be deducted, or whether the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
knowledge gained from the inquiry might contribute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficiently to the ultimate design of the product that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs must be capitalized. In short, the tax accounting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
questions that section 174 was meant to resolve can arise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whenever the taxpayer is uncertain as to the capability or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
method for developing or improving the product, or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate design of the product.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendments apply the uncertainty test with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reference to ``the information reasonably available to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxpayer.'' The Treasury Department and the IRS agree with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the commentators that the meaning of the phrase 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
reasonably 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is unclear. Further, the phrase could be read to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impose an unintended restriction on the definition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
research or experimental expenditures. Information could be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered to be 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
reasonably available
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to a taxpayer if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxpayer can obtain the information through procedures that, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
while not particularly involved, are nonetheless in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nature of research activities. To avoid the ambiguities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resulting from the term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
reasonably,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the final amendments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide for the application of the uncertainty test with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reference to the information actually available to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxpayer. The removal of the term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
reasonably
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended to expand the information considered to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available to the taxpayer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Validation Testing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 1957 regulations exclude from the definition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
research the ordinary testing or inspection of materials or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products for quality control. Several commentators on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed amendments asked for clarification that research 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
includes validation testing to ensure that a product design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meets its intended objectives. In response to these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments, the final amendments clarify that the existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclusion for quality control testing does not apply to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing to determine if the design of a product is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Effective Date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final amendments retain the effective date of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed amendments, and thus apply to taxable years 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beginning after October 3, 1994. Some commentators requested that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed amendments apply to all open taxable years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the amendments merely clarify the existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
research or experimental expenditures,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retroactive application of the amendments is unnecessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Return positions consistent with the amendments will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with the existing regulations and will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognized as such by the IRS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Special Analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this Treasury decision is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also been determined that section 553(b) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, the notice of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rulemaking preceding these regulations was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted to the Small Business Administration for comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on their impact on small business.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Definition of research and experimental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenditures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In general.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) The term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
research or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experimental expenditures,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as used in section 174, means 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenditures incurred in connection with the taxpayer's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trade or business which represent research and development 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs in the experimental or laboratory sense. The term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generally includes all such costs incident to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development or improvement of a product. The term includes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the costs of obtaining a patent, such as attorneys' fees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expended in making and perfecting a patent application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Expenditures represent research and development costs in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experimental or laboratory sense if they are for activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended to discover information that would eliminate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uncertainty concerning the development or improvement of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product. Uncertainty exists if the information available to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the taxpayer does not establish the capability or method for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developing or improving the product or the appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design of the product. Whether expenditures qualify as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
research or experimental expenditures depends on the nature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the activity to which the expenditures relate, not the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nature of the product or improvement being developed or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level of technological advancement the product or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improvement represents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For purposes of this section, the term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
product
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
includes any pilot model, process, formula, invention, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technique, patent, or similar property, and includes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products to be used by the taxpayer in its trade or business 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as well as products to be held for sale, lease, or license. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
research or experimental expenditures
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not include expenditures for_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The ordinary testing or inspection of materials or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products for quality control (quality control testing); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Efficiency surveys; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Management studies; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Consumer surveys; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Advertising or promotions; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) The acquisition of another's patent, model, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production or process; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) Research in connection with literary, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
historical, or similar projects.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) For purposes of paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section, testing or inspection to determine whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular units of materials or products conform to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified parameters is quality control testing. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality control testing does not include testing to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine if the design of the product is appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) See section 263A and the regulations thereunder 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for cost capitalization rules which apply to expenditures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paid or incurred for research in connection with literary, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
historical, or similar projects involving the production of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
property, including the production of films, sound 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recordings, video tapes, books, or similar properties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Section 174 applies to a research or experimental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenditure only to the extent that the amount of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenditure is reasonable under the circumstances. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general, the amount of an expenditure for research or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experimental activities is reasonable if the amount would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ordinarily be paid for like activities by like enterprises 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under like circumstances. Amounts supposedly paid for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
research that are not reasonable under the circumstances may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be characterized as disguised dividends, gifts, loans, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
similar payments. The reasonableness requirement of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (a)(6) does not apply to the reasonableness of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
type or nature of the activities themselves. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) This paragraph (a) applies to taxable years 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beginning after October 3, 1994.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document contains final regulations concerning the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
low-income housing credit under section 42 of the Internal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revenue Code. The regulations provide rules relating to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order in which housing credit dollar amounts are allocated from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each State's housing credit ceiling under section 42(h)(3)(C) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the determination of which States qualify to receive credit from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a national pool of credit under section 42(h)(3)(D). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations affect State and local housing credit agencies and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxpayers receiving credit allocations, and provide them with

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 29, 1993, the IRS published a notice of proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 68799) proposing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendments to the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR part 1) under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These amendments provide guidance on several requirements of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
low-income housing tax credit relating to determinations of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing credit dollar amount available to housing credit agencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for allocation in any given year.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Written comments responding to the notice of proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking were received. A public hearing was scheduled for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
April 26, 1994, pursuant to a notice of public hearing published 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
simultaneously with the notice of proposed rulemaking. The IRS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received one request to speak at the public hearing. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request was withdrawn before the hearing date. On April 14, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1994, the IRS published a notice (59 FR 17747) cancelling the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public hearing on the proposed regulations. After consideration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the comments received, the proposed regulations are adopted as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revised by this Treasury decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Explanation of Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 42 provides for a low-income housing credit that may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be claimed as part of the general business credit under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
38. In general, the credit is allowable only if the owner of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualified low-income building receives a housing credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocation from a State or local housing credit agency (Agency) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the jurisdiction where the building is located. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The aggregate housing credit dollar amount that an Agency may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocate for any calendar year is limited to the State housing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit ceiling apportioned to the Agency for that year. Under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 42(h)(3)(C), the State housing credit ceiling of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State for any calendar year is an amount equal to the sum of: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) $1.25 multiplied by the State population (the population 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
component); (b) the unused State housing credit ceiling, if any, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the State for the preceding calendar year (the unused 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carryforward component); (c) the amount of State housing credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ceiling returned in the calendar year (the returned credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
component); plus (d) the amount, if any, allocated to the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the Secretary under section 42(h)(3)(D) from a national pool 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of unused credit (the national pool component). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final regulations set forth the rules governing the order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in which credit is allocated from the various components of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State housing credit ceiling under section 42(h)(3)(C) (the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stacking rules). In general, under the stacking rules, credit is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocated first from the sum of the population and returned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit components, then from the unused carryforward component, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and finally from the national pool component. The final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations also reflect the statutory rule that unallocated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit attributable to the national pool component cannot be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carried forward, and, therefore, is not included in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carryforward component for the following year. In addition, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final regulations provide that no credit allocated prior to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calendar year 1990, and no credit allowable under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
42(h)(4) (relating to the portion of credit attributable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible basis financed by certain tax-exempt obligations under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 103), may be returned for reallocation. Thus, this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit is not included in the returned credit component for any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commentator requested clarification of the rule in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed regulations that if the terms of the allocation violate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any requirement of section 42, the allocation is not valid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, the commentator expressed concern that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
misrepresentation by a taxpayer to an Agency would result in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocation being treated as not valid and as if it had never been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made and ineligible for treatment as a returned credit. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final regulations do not include this statement. First, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination of whether an allocation is valid is not within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scope of these regulations. Second, given the general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement that an allocation must be valid to qualify as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returned credit, it is unnecessary to include the additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement that, if the terms of the allocation violate any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement of section 42, the allocation is not valid and is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treated as if it had not been made. However, for all purposes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 42, including qualification as a returned credit, an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocation must be validly made. See, for example, &sect;&sect;1.42&hyph;1T and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1.42&hyph;6. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final regulations adopt the provision of the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations requiring that if a credit is returned within 180 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
days following the close of the first taxable year of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
building's credit period and a Form 8609,

Low-Income Housing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Credit Allocation Certification,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 has been issued for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
building, an Agency must notify the IRS that the credit has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returned. One commentator requested that the procedure for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notifying the IRS be clarified. Accordingly, the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations clarify that if all of the credit is returned, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency must follow the procedures in &sect;1.42&hyph;5(e)(3) for filing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Form 8823, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Low-Income Housing Credit Agencies Report of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Noncompliance.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In situations where the credit is only partially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returned, the Agency must follow the procedures prescribed for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
filing an amended Form 8610, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Annual Low-Income Housing Credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agencies Report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations permit an Agency to treat credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returned from a project to the Agency after October 31 of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calendar year and not reallocated by the Agency by the close of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the year as returned at the beginning of the succeeding calendar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year (the two-month rule). One commentator suggested that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two-month rule of the proposed regulations be changed to allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more time to reallocate credits before the close of the calendar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year. Accordingly, the final regulations provide that credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returned to the Agency after September 30 of any calendar year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and not reallocated by the close of the year may be treated as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returned at the beginning of the succeeding calendar year. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
response to another comment, the final regulations clarify that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an Agency, in its discretion, may treat a portion of a credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that is so returned and that is not reallocated before the close 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the calendar year as returned in the next calendar year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, to the extent any portion of a credit returned after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
September 30 of any calendar year is allocated by the close of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the calendar year in which it is returned, that portion of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit is included as part of the returned credit component of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State housing credit ceiling for the year in which the credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is returned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations provide that, if an allocation is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cancelled by mutual consent, a signed and dated written agreement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between the Agency and the allocation recipient (or its successor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in interest) must indicate the amount of the allocation returned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the date on which the credit is returned. Commentators 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggested that, if the terms of an allocation state that any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unused amounts are automatically returned to the Agency by mutual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement, the regulations should not require a signed and dated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
written agreement. If this suggestion were adopted, neither the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IRS nor the Agency would know with enough precision the amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit returned and the date on which the credit is returned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This information is necessary to determine with certainty the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returned credit component of the State housing credit ceiling and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to avoid discrepancies in the amount of credit allocated to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular project. Thus, the final regulations do not adopt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this suggestion.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Under section 42(h)(3)(D), States that have unused housing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit carryovers must assign them to the Secretary for inclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a national pool of unused housing credit carryovers (National 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pool), and the Secretary must allocate National Pool credit among 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualified States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In determining whether there is any unallocated credit within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State at the close of a calendar year, the housing credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dollar amounts apportioned to all Agencies within the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(including Agencies of constitutional home rule cities in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State) and the allocations of all Agencies within the State are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered. One commentator suggested that a constitutional home 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule city be considered alone rather than in combination with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other constitutional home rule cities or Agencies within a State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in determining access to the National Pool. Section 42(h)(3)(E) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does provide special rules for apportioning credits to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constitutional home rule cities. Under these rules, however, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credits are apportioned to these cities from the State housing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit ceiling. There is no provision in the Code that permits a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constitutional home rule city to receive credit that is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apportioned from the State housing credit ceiling. Accordingly, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the final regulations do not adopt this suggestion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to a de minimis exception for States that have 1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent or less of unallocated credit remaining in their State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing credit ceiling at the close of a calendar year (de 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimis rule), the proposed regulations provide that, in other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances where relief is deemed appropriate, the IRS may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine that a State is a qualified State eligible to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participate in the National Pool. One commentator requested that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States that cannot allocate their entire ceiling as a result of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
natural disaster be allowed to participate in the National Pool. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This type of relief exceeds the scope and intent behind the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited exception provided in the proposed regulations. Further, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this type of relief would be inequitable to other States that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualify for the National Pool. Thus, the final regulations do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not adopt this suggestion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commentator suggested that the de minimis rule provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an alternative fixed dollar amount measurement of de minimis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount to reflect unallocated amounts that are, as a practical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
matter, insufficient to provide an allocation to a project. Due 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to variations in construction and housing costs across the United 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, this suggestion was not adopted. Similarly, a suggestion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the final regulations provide a separate de minimis rule for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the set-aside for nonprofit organizations was not adopted. Under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the regulations, however, these situations can be addressed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the IRS on a case-by-case basis. Moreover, if appropriate, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional safe harbors could be provided in the future (e.g., to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respond to other common situations not addressed by the 1 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final regulations also amend &sect;1.42&hyph;5 to provide a cross 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reference to section 42(g)(8)(B), as added by section 13142(b)(3) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993. Section 42(g)(8)(B) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides that on application by the taxpayer, the Secretary may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waive any annual recertification of tenant income (the Waiver) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for purposes of section 42(g), if the entire building is occupied 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by low-income tenants. Instructions on how to obtain the Waiver 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be contained in a forthcoming revenue procedure.

Special Analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations, and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice of proposed rulemaking preceding these regulations was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted to the Small Business Administration for comment on its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact on small business.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In general. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State housing credit ceiling for a State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for any calendar year after 1989 is comprised of four components. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The four components are_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) $1.25 multiplied by the State population (the population 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
component); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The unused State housing credit ceiling, if any, of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State for the preceding calendar year (the unused carryforward 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
component); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The amount of State housing credit ceiling returned in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calendar year (the returned credit component); plus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The amount, if any, allocated to the State by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary under section 42(h)(3)(D) from a national pool of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unused credit (the national pool component). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The population component. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The population component of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State housing credit ceiling of a State for any calendar year is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined pursuant to section 146(j). Thus, a State's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population for any calendar year is determined by reference to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the most recent census estimate, whether final or provisional, of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the resident population of the State released by the Bureau of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Census before the beginning of the calendar year for which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State's housing credit ceiling is set. Unless otherwise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prescribed by applicable revenue procedure, determinations of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population are based on the most recent estimates of population 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contained in the Bureau of the Census publication, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Projections, Estimates of the Population of States. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
convenience, the Internal Revenue Service publishes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population estimates annually in the Internal Revenue Bulletin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(See &sect;601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The unused carryforward component. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The unused 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carryforward component of the State housing credit ceiling for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any calendar year is the excess, if any, of the sum of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population and returned credit components, over the aggregate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing credit dollar amount allocated for the year. Any credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amounts attributable to the national pool component of the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing credit ceiling that remain unallocated at the close of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calendar year are not carried forward to the succeeding calendar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year; instead, the credit expires and cannot be reallocated by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any Agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The returned credit component_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In general. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returned credit component of the State housing credit ceiling for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any calendar year equals the housing credit dollar amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returned during the calendar year that was validly allocated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the State in a prior calendar year to any project that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not become a qualified low-income housing project within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period required by section 42, or as required by the terms of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocation. The returned credit component also includes credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocated in a prior calendar year that is returned as a result 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the cancellation of an allocation by mutual consent or by an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency's determination that the amount allocated is not necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the financial feasibility of the project. For purposes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section, credit is allocated within a State if it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocated from the State's housing credit ceiling by an Agency of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State or of a constitutional home rule city in the State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Limitations and special rules. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following limitations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and special rules apply for purposes of this paragraph (d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General limitations. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notwithstanding any other provision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this paragraph (d), returned credit does not include any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit that was_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Allocated prior to calendar year 1990; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Allowable under section 42(h)(4) (relating to the portion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of credit attributable to eligible basis financed by certain tax-exempt bonds under section 103); or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Allocated during the same calendar year that it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received back by the Agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Credit period limitation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notwithstanding any other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision of this paragraph (d), an allocation of credit may not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be returned any later than 180 days following the close of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first taxable year of the credit period for the building that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received the allocation. After this date, credit that might 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
otherwise be returned expires, and cannot be returned to or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reallocated by any Agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Three-month rule for returned credit. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An Agency may, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its discretion, treat any portion of credit that is returned from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a project after September 30 of a calendar year and that is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reallocated by the close of the calendar year as returned on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
January 1 of the succeeding calendar year. In this case, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returned credit becomes part of the returned credit component of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State housing credit ceiling for the succeeding calendar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year. Any portion of credit that is returned from a project 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after September 30 of a calendar year that is reallocated by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
close of the calendar year is treated as part of the returned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit component of the State housing credit ceiling for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calendar year that the credit was returned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Returns of credit. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subject to the limitations of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraphs (d)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section, credit is returned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the Agency in the following instances in the manner described 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in paragraph (d)(3) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Building not qualified within required time period. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
building is not a qualified building within the time period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by section 42, it loses its credit allocation and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit is returned. For example, a building is not qualified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the required time period if it is not placed in service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the period required by section 42 or if the project of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the building is a part fails to meet the minimum set-aside 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of section 42(g)(1) by the close of the first year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the credit period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Noncompliance with terms of the allocation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a building 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not comply with the terms of its allocation, it loses the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit allocation and the credit is returned. The terms of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocation are the written conditions agreed to by the Agency and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the allocation recipient in the allocation document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Mutual consent. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the Agency and the allocation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recipient cancel an allocation of an amount of credit by mutual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consent, that amount of credit is returned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Amount not necessary for financial feasibility. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency determines under section 42(m)(2) that an amount of credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocated to a project is not necessary for the financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
feasibility of the project and its viability as a qualified low-income housing project throughout the credit period,
that amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of credit is returned.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Manner of returning credit_(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Taxpayer notification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After an Agency determines that a building or project no longer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualifies under paragraph (d)(2)(iv)(A), (B), or (D) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section for all or part of the allocation it received, the Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must provide written notification to the allocation recipient, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its successor in interest, that all or part of the allocation is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no longer valid. The notification must also state the amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the allocation that is no longer valid. The date of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notification is the date the credit is returned to the Agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If an allocation is cancelled by mutual consent under paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d)(2)(iv)(C) of this section, there must be a written agreement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
signed by the Agency, and the allocation recipient, or its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
successor in interest, indicating the amount of the allocation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that is returned to the Agency. The effective date of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement is the date the credit is returned to the Agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Internal Revenue Service notification. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a credit is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returned within 180 days following the close of the first taxable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year of a building's credit period as provided in paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

has been issued for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
building, the Agency must notify the Internal Revenue Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the credit has been returned. If only part of the credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has been returned, this notification requirement is satisfied 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when the Agency attaches to an amended Form 8610,

Form 8609 reflecting the correct amount of credit attributed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the building together with an explanation for the filing of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended Forms. The Agency must send a copy of the amended Form 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8609 to the taxpayer that owns the building. If the building is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not issued an amended Form 8609 because all of the credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocated to the building is returned, notification to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Internal Revenue Service is satisfied by following the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements prescribed in &sect;1.42&hyph;5(e)(3) for filing a Form 8823,

(e) The national pool component. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The national pool component 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the State housing credit ceiling of a State for any calendar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year is the portion of the National Pool allocated to the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the Secretary for the calendar year. The national pool 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
component for any calendar year is zero unless a State is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
qualified State. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(See paragraph (i) of this section for rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding the National Pool and the description of a qualified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State.) Credit from the national pool component of a State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing credit ceiling must be allocated prior to the close of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the calendar year or the credit expires and cannot be reallocated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by any Agency. A national pool component credit that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocated during a calendar year and returned after the close of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the calendar year may qualify as part of the returned credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
component of the State housing credit ceiling for the calendar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year that the credit is returned.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apportionment for projects involving qualified nonprofit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organizations described in section 42(h)(5) and &sect;1.42&hyph;1T(c)(5), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State housing credit ceiling for any calendar year is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined at the close of the calendar year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Stacking order. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 42(h)(3)(C), credit is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treated as allocated from the various components of the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing credit ceiling in the following order. The first credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocated for any calendar year is treated as credit from the sum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the population and returned credit components of the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing credit ceiling. Once all of the credit in these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
components has been allocated, the next credit allocated is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treated as credit from the unused carryforward component of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State housing credit ceiling. Finally, after all of the credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the population component, returned credit component, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unused carryforward component has been allocated, any further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit allocated is treated as credit from the national pool 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
component.

. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 42(h)(5) and &sect;1.42&hyph;1T(c)(5), at least 10 percent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a State housing credit ceiling in any calendar year must be set 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aside exclusively for projects involving qualified nonprofit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organizations (the nonprofit set-aside). However, credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocated from the nonprofit set-aside in a calendar year and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returned in a subsequent calendar year does not retain its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonprofit set-aside character. The credit becomes part of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returned credit component of the State housing credit ceiling for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the calendar year that the credit is returned and must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in determining the nonprofit set-aside of the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing credit ceiling for that calendar year. Similarly, credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amounts that are not allocated from the nonprofit set-aside in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calendar year and are returned in a subsequent calendar year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
become part of the returned credit component of the State housing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit ceiling for that year and are also included in determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the set-aside for that year.

An Agency may allocate credit from any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
component of the State housing credit ceiling as part of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonprofit set-aside and need not reserve 10 percent of each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
component for the nonprofit set-aside. Thus, an Agency may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfy the nonprofit set-aside requirement of section 42(h)(5) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and &sect;1.42&hyph;1T(c)(5) in any calendar year by setting aside for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocation an amount equal to at least 10 percent of the total

National Pool even though the State's unallocated credit is in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excess of the 1 percent safe harbor set forth in paragraph (A) of

this section. The Internal Revenue Service will make this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination based on all the facts and circumstances, weighing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heavily the interests of the States who would otherwise qualify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the National Pool. The Internal Revenue Service will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocated to a qualified State in any calendar year is an amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that bears the same ratio to the aggregate unused housing credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carryovers of all States for the preceding calendar year as that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State's population for the calendar year bears to the population

of all qualified States for the calendar year.

of this section are complied with. For example, the Filing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency of a State must ensure that all Agencies within the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that were apportioned a credit amount for the calendar year have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocated all of their respective credit amounts for the calendar

Agency A had allocated $80 of the State M housing credit ceiling.

Of the $80 allocated, $16 was allocated to projects involving

qualified nonprofit organizations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Application of stacking rules
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. The first credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocated is treated as allocated from the population and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returned credit components of the State housing credit ceiling, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the extent of those components. In this case, the $80 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit allocated is less than the sum of the population and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returned credit components. The excess of the sum of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population and returned credit components over the total amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocated for the calendar year ($110^80=$30) becomes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unused carryforward component of State M's 1995 State housing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit ceiling. Because Agency A did not allocate credit in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excess of the sum of the population and returned credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
components, no credit is treated as allocated from State M's $50 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unused carryforward component in 1994. Because none of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
component may be carried forward, all $50 is assigned to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary for inclusion in the National Pool. Under paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i)(3) of this section, State M does not qualify for credit from

the National Pool for the 1995 calendar year.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Nonprofit set-aside
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. Agency A allocated exactly the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount of credit to projects involving qualified nonprofit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organizations as necessary to meet the nonprofit set-aside 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement ($16, 10% of the $160 ceiling).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. By the close of 1994, Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A had allocated $130 of the State M housing credit ceiling. Of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the $130 allocated, $20 was allocated to projects involving

qualified nonprofit organizations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Application of stacking rules
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. The first $110 of credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocated is treated as allocated from the population and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returned credit components. In this case, because all of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population and returned credit components are allocated, no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount is included in State M's 1995 State housing credit ceiling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as an unused carryforward component. The next $20 of credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocated is treated as allocated from the $50 unused 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carryforward component. The $30 remaining in the unused 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carryforward component is assigned to the Secretary for inclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the National Pool for the 1995 calendar year. Under paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i)(3) of this section, State M does not qualify for credit from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the National Pool for the 1995 calendar year.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Nonprofit set-aside
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. Agency A allocated $4 more credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to projects involving qualified nonprofit organizations than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to meet the nonprofit set-aside requirement. This does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not reduce the application of the 10% nonprofit set-aside 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement to the State M housing credit ceiling for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
succeeding year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Additional fact
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. None of the applications for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit that Agency A received for 1994 are for projects involving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualified nonprofit organizations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Nonprofit set-aside
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. Because at least 10% of the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing credit ceiling must be set aside for projects involving a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualified nonprofit organization, Agency A can allocate only $144 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the $160 State housing credit ceiling for calendar year 1994 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
($160^16=$144). If Agency A allocates $144 of credit, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit is treated as allocated $110 from the population and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returned credit components and $34 from the unused carryforward 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
component. The $16 of unallocated credit that is set aside for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
projects involving qualified nonprofit organizations is treated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as the balance of the unused carryforward component, and is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assigned to the Secretary for inclusion in the National Pool. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under paragraph (i)(3) of this section, State M does not qualify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for credit from the National Pool for the 1995 calendar year.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. The $10 of returned credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
component was returned prior to October 1, 1994. However, a $40 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit that had been allocated in calendar year 1993 to a project 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involving a qualified nonprofit organization was returned to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency by a mutual consent agreement dated November 15, 1994. By 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the close of 1994, Agency A had allocated $160 of the State M 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing credit ceiling, including $16 of credit to projects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involving qualified nonprofit organizations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Effect of three-month rule
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. Under the three-month rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section, Agency A may treat all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or part of the $40 of previously allocated credit as returned on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
January 1, 1995. If Agency A treats all of the $40 amount as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
having been returned in calendar year 1995, the State M housing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit ceiling for 1994 is $160. This entire amount, including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the $16 nonprofit set-aside, has been allocated in 1994. Under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (i)(3) of this section, State M qualifies for the

. If Agency A treats all of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the $40 of previously allocated credit as returned in calendar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year 1994, the State housing credit ceiling for the 1994 calendar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year will be $200 of which $50 will be attributable to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returned credit component ($10+$40=$50). Because credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amounts allocated in a prior calendar year that are returned in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsequent calendar year do not retain their nonprofit character, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the nonprofit set-aside for calendar year 1994 is $20 (10% of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$200). The $160 that Agency A allocated during 1994 is first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treated as from the population and returned credit components, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which total $150. The next $10 of credit allocated is treated as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the unused carryforward component. The $40 of unallocated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit from the unused carryforward component includes the $4 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unallocated nonprofit set-aside. The entire $40 of credit from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the carryforward component is assigned to the Secretary for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inclusion in the National Pool for the 1995 calendar year. State

M does not qualify for credit from the National Pool for the 1995

calendar year.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
At the request of the Canadian National Railway Company, the Coast Guard is changing the operating regulations governing
the Canadian National railroad bridge at mile 3.8 across the Black Rock Canal in Buffalo, New York, by not requiring
bridgetenders to be in constant attendance at the bridge during periods of time when there is little or no significant
navigation on the Canal. This action will relieve the bridge owner of the burden of having a bridgetender in constant
attendance and will provide for the reasonable needs of navigation. Additionally, this rule adjusts the hours of
the Ferry Street bridge at mile 2.6 across the Black Rock Canal when the bridge is not required to have a bridgetender
in attendance.

Regulatory History
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 1, 1994, the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking entitled Drawbrige Operation Regulations;
Black Rock Canal, NY, in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 28324 and 28325). On June 17, 1994, the commander, Ninth Coast Guard District published the proposed rule as
a Public Notice (PN 09&hyph;03/94). Interested persons were given until August 1, 1994, and July 18, 1994, respectively,
to submit comments. Two letters were received commenting on the proposal. A public hearing was not requested and one
was not held. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Background and Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Presently, the Canadian National railroad bridge is required to have bridgetenders in constant attendance at all
times. The owner requested that they be allowed to remove bridgetenders from the bridge between the hours of 11 p.m.
and 7 a.m., seven days a week, from April 15 through November 30, with a requirement to open the bridge on signal when
notice is given at least two hours in advance of a vessel's time of intended passage through the draw. From December
1 through April 14, the bridge would be unattended at all times with a requirement to open the bridge on signal if notice
is given at least four hours in advance of a vessel's time of intended passage through the draw. At all times, the bridge
will be required to open as soon as possible for the passage of public vessels of the United States, State or local government
vessels used for public safety, and vessels in distress.

Discussion of Comments and Changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two comments were received from the notice of proposed rulemaking requesting that the hours when the bridges are unattended
be changed. The commenters requested the unattended periods for the bridges listed in the proposed rule, 11 p.m. to
7 a.m., be changed to conform with the period of time when the Black Rock Locks are unattended, between the hours of 12
midnight and 8 a.m., seven days a week. In addition, the regulations contained in 33 CFR 117.769 do not require the Ferry
Street bridge across the Black Rock Canal to be manned from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. The requested change of time is a reasonable
request and will benefit marine traffic using the Black Rock Canal by bringing the time period for the bridges and locks
in line when a vessel owner/operator is required to give an advance notice to transit the Canal. Therefore, section
117.769(a) of the proposed rule has been changed in the final rule by not requiring the bridges to be manned between
the hours of 12 midnight to 8 a.m.

Regulatory Evaluation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This regulation is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review
by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures
of DOT is unnecessary. The Coast Guard concludes this because the rule which is being changed allows for the removal
of bridgetenders during a period of time when there is little or no significant navigation on a waterway. In addition
this rule establishes a consistent period of time when an advance notice is required to have the bridges manned which
is less confusing to the person requesting passage through the locks and draws of the bridges.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), the Coast Guard must consider whether this action will
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently
owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant in their field and otherwise qualify as ``small business
concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The time period addressed by this regulation is consistent with the time period when most traffic using the Black Rock
Canal is already controlled by the operation of the Black Rock Locks and when there is little or no significant vessel
traffic on the waterway. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this rule will not have a significant
impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Instruction M16475.1B, promulgation of operating requirements or procedures for drawbridges is categorically
excluded from further environmental documentation. A Categorical Exclusion Determination Statement has been
prepared and placed in the docket.

1. Section 3507(f) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, as amended, 44 U.S.C. 3507(f), requires agencies to display
a current control number assigned by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (``OMB'') for each agency
information collection requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Section 0.408 of the Commission's Rules displays the OMB control numbers assigned to the Commission's non-form
information collection requirements. OMB control numbers assigned to Commission forms are not listed in this section
since those numbers appear on the forms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. This Order amends Section 0.408 to remove listings of information collections which the Commission has eliminated
and to add listings of new information collections which OMB has approved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Authority for this action is contained in Section 4(i) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 154(i)), as amended,
and Section 0.231(d) of the Commission's Rules. Since this amendment is a matter of agency organization procedure
or practice, the notice and comment and effective date provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act do not apply.
See 5 U.S.C. Section 553(b)(A)(d).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Accordingly, it is ordered, that &sect;0.408 of the Rules is amended as set forth in the Amendatory text, effective
on the date of publication in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS issues a technical amendment to clarify regulations that prohibit a vessel from participating in the Gulf of
Alaska (GOA) directed sablefish hook-and-line gear fishery when hook-and-line gear was deployed from that vessel
within 72 hours prior to the opening of that fishery. This technical amendment clarifies this prohibition by stating
that it applies only to vessels that deployed hook-and-line gear in the GOA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within 72 hours prior to the start of that fishery.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS published a final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(58 FR 28520, May 14, 1993) that prohibits participation in the GOA directed sablefish fishery by a vessel that has
deployed hook-and-line gear within 72 hours prior to the opening of that fishery. The rule was intended to apply only
to vessels that deployed gear in the GOA in advance of that fishery. As written, the rule implied that a vessel is prohibited
from participating in the GOA directed sablefish fishery if the vessel deployed hook-and-line gear in any fishery
within 72 hours prior to that opening. This interpretation is inconsistent with the preamble to the proposed rule,
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on April 1, 1993 (58 FR 17193), which explains that the prohibition applies only to vessels that deploy hook-and-gear
in the GOA within 72 hours prior to the opening. Because hook-and-line vessel operators participating in fisheries
in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area have expressed uncertainty as to the regulatory intent, &sect;672.7(k)
is clarified to specify that this prohibition applies only to vessels that fished in the GOA.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The groundfish fishery in the GOA exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the
Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management
Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed
by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 672.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with &sect;672.20(c)(1)(ii)(B), the annual TAC for Atka mackerel was established by the final 1994
specifications (59 FR 7647, February 16, 1994), as 1,000 metric tons (mt) for the Central Regulatory Area. At the same
time, the directed fishery for Atka mackerel in the GOA was closed under &sect;672.20(c)(2)(ii) in the final 1994
specifications in order to reserve amounts anticipated to be needed for incidental catch by other fisheries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined that, as of September 17, 1994, 995 mt of Atka mackerel in the Central
Regulatory Area of the GOA remains unharvested. This amount is in excess of the amount necessary as incidental catch
for other groundfish fisheries. Therefore, NMFS is terminating this closure and opening directed fishing for Atka
mackerel in the Central Regulatory Area of the GOA effective at 12 noon, A.l.t., September 30, 1994, until 12 midnight,
A.l.t., December 31, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All other closures remain in full force and effect.

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing regulations on certain requirements governing the submission,
review, and approval of abbreviated new drug applications (ANDA's). Specifically, these new regulations pertain
to patent issues, certification and notice of certification of invalidity or noninfringement of a patent by ANDA
applicants, effective date of approval of an application under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act),
and new drug product exclusivity. These regulations are intended to complete FDA's implementation of Title I of the
Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 24, 1984, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98&hyph;417) (the
1984 amendments) was enacted. The law consisted of two different titles. Title I authorized the approval of duplicate
versions of approved drug products (other than those reviewed and approved under section 507 of the act (21 U.S.C.
357)) under an ANDA procedure. Title II authorized the extension of patent terms for approved new drug products (including
antibiotics and biological drug products), some medical devices, food additives, and color additives. Congress
intended these provisions to provide a careful balance between promoting competition among brand-name and duplicate
or ``generic'' drugs and encouraging research and innovation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title I also amended section 505 of the act (21 U.S.C. 355) by requiring all New Drug Application (NDA) applicants and
holders to provide certain patent information, requiring ANDA applicants to certify as to the status of patents claiming
the drug product they intend to copy, providing for the submission and approval of applications for which the investigations
relied on by the applicant to satisfy the ``full reports'' of safety and effectiveness requirements were not conducted
by the applicant or for which the applicant had not obtained a right of reference or use from the person who conducted
the investigations, establishing rules for disclosure of safety and effectiveness data submitted as part of an NDA,
and providing specific time periods during which an NDA or an ANDA cannot be submitted or approved. The 1984 amendments
also required FDA to promulgate new regulations implementing the statute. In the

II. Highlights of the Final Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Patent Information, Certification, and Notice of Certification to Patent Owner and Certain Application Holders

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The statute prohibits the agency from making effective the approval of an ANDA or an application described by section
505(b)(2) of the act (referred to as a 505(b)(2) application) before all relevant product and use patents for the listed
drug (a drug product listed in an approved drug product list published by the agency) have expired, except where the
generic applicant asserts either that its product will not infringe the patent or that the patent is invalid. In the
latter case, approval of the ANDA or the 505(b)(2) application may not be made effective until the patent owner and
the NDA holder have been notified and have had an opportunity to litigate the issue of patent infringement or validity.
To facilitate the patent protection provisions, the statute requires that applications submitted under section
505(b) of the act include the patent number and expiration date of all relevant patents that claim the drug (including
product and formulation patents) in the application or use patents that claim a method of using the drug. The agency
publishes this patent information in its approved drug product list (``Approved Drug Products With Therapeutic
Equivalence Evaluations,'' also known as the ``Orange Book'') for each listed drug for which patent information
has been submitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A generic drug applicant submitting an ANDA that refers to a listed drug must include a certification as to the status
of all patents applicable to the listed drug. Similarly, an applicant submitting a 505(b)(2) application must make
certifications with respect to patents claiming any listed drug or claiming a use for such listed drug. If a generic
applicant certifies that a relevant patent expires on a specified date, the effective date of approval of the ANDA
or 505(b)(2) application will be delayed until the expiration of the patent. Thus, for example, if the patent expired
on January 1, 1995, the effective date of approval of the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application would be January 1, 1995. The
agency regards drug products with delayed effective dates as having tentative approvals; it does not consider the
approval to be final until the effective date and the issuance of a final approval letter (see 57 FR 17950 at 17956).
When a generic applicant certifies that any product or use patent is invalid or will not be infringed, the applicant
must give notice of such certification to the patent owner and appropriate approved application holder for the listed
drug. The generic applicant must include in the notice the factual and legal basis for the applicant's opinion that
the patent is invalid or will not be infringed. Finally, a patent owner has 45 days from receipt of the notice of certification
to file suit against the generic applicant to defend the patent. If the patent owner files suit within 45 days, the effective
date of approval of the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application may be delayed up to 30 months pending resolution of the lawsuit.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule describes: (1) The requirements for the submission of patent information by an NDA holder or applicant,
(2) the patent certification requirements applicable to generic applicants, and (3) the content of a patent certification
notice. The final rule also specifies: (1) When and to whom the notice is to be sent, and (2) the effect of each type of
patent certification on the effective date of approval of an application for a generic drug product.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Exclusivity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 505(c)(3)(D) and (j)(4)(D) of the act protects certain listed drugs, or certain changes in listed drugs,
from generic copying for specified periods by placing a moratorium on the submission, or by delaying the effective
date of approval, of ANDA's and 505(b)(2) applications for those listed drugs. These so-called ``exclusivity provisions''
provide the following periods of protection from generic competition: (1) A 10-year period of exclusivity for new
chemical entities approved during the period January 1, 1982, to September 24, 1984, the date of enactment of the 1984
amendments; (2) a 5-year period of exclusivity for new chemical entities approved after September 24, 1984; (3) a

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3-year period of exclusivity for drugs that are not new chemical entities approved after September 24, 1984, if the
applicant submitted an application containing reports of ``new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability
studies) essential to approval and conducted or sponsored by the applicant''; (4) a 3-year period of exclusivity
for certain changes made after September 24, 1984, if the applicant submitted a supplement containing reports of
``new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability studies) essential to approval and conducted or sponsored
by the person submitting the application''; and (5) a 2-year period of exclusivity for drugs that are not new chemical
entities, or for certain changes made to already approved drug products, approved during the period January 1, 1982,
to September 24, 1984. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is codifying the provisions regarding 5- and 3-year exclusivity; FDA is not codifying the other exclusivity
provision because they have expired. The final rule also defines certain terms used in the regulations, and clarifies
the agency's interpretation of each of the provisions.

III. Comments on the Proposed Rule

A. Section 314.50_Content and Format of an Application (21 CFR 314.50) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule contained several additions to the existing requirements in &sect;314.50. The proposed additions
focused on patent information and certifications and claimed exclusivity. Under proposed &sect;314.50(i), for
example, a 505(b)(2) applicant would be required to include in its application one of four possible certifications:
(1) That patent information on the reference listed drug had not been submitted to FDA; (2) that the patent had expired;
(3) the date on which the patent will expire; or (4) that the patent was invalid or would not be infringed by the manufacture,
use, or sale of the proposed drug product.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Two comments objected to the provision regarding use patents (patents that claim a use for the patented invention)
under proposed &sect;314.50(i). The comments explained that the provision would permit applicants to decide whether
a use would infringe a patent and whether the patent owner should be notified. Both comments asked FDA to require applicants
to send a certification of invalidity or noninfringement to all patent owners whose patents claim the active ingredient
involved in the proposed drug product. One comment would also revise the provision to withhold approval of an application
if the patent owner disagreed with the patent certification in order to give the patent owner an opportunity to initiate
a lawsuit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulation corresponds to the statutory language at section 505(b)(2)(B) of the act. The statute does not require
a patent certification with respect to a use patent if the applicant is seeking approval for a drug product that does
not claim a use protected by the patent. FDA also declines to revise the provision to have FDA withhold approval of an
application under these circumstances. The statute provides express and specific grounds for delaying an effective
date of approval (see section 505(c)(3) of the act). These do not include any express authority to delay an effective
date of approval based on an inadequate notice, and the agency is not prepared to infer such authority. NDA holders
are advised, however, to notify FDA of the patented uses that appear in the approved labeling for their products; this
will enable the agency to provide some guidance to applicants required to submit either a patent certification under
section 505(b)(2)(A) or (j)(2)(A) of the act, or a statement under section 505(b)(2)(B) or (j)(2)(A)(viii) of the
act. These uses will be listed in the Orange Book. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. One comment noted that ``United States Office of Patent and Trademark'' in proposed &sect;314.50(i)(1)(i) should
be ``United States Patent and Trademark Office.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA agrees and has revised the provision accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. One comment asked FDA to give examples of patent certifications under proposed &sect;314.50(i)(1)(i)(A)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) to (i)(1)(i)(A)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). As proposed, these provisions would require an applicant to certify that: (1) No patent information had been submitted
to FDA, (2) the patent has expired, or (3) the patent would expire on a specific date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Generally, most applicants making paragraph I, II, or III patent certifications simply paraphrase the language
used in &sect;314.50(i)(1)(i)(A)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) to (i)(1)(i)(A)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) for each patent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The agency, on its own initiative, has amended &sect;314.50(i)(1)(i)(A) to replace the reference to a patent that
claims ``the drug or drugs'' with a patent that claims ``a drug (the drug product or drug substance that is a component
of the drug product).'' The agency has made this amendment to clarify the types of patents for which a certification
should be made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The agency, on its own initiative, has also amended &sect;314.50(i)(1)(i)(A)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and &sect;314.94(a)(12)(i)(A)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) (21 CFR 314.94(a)(12)(i)(A)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
)) to include a reference to unenforceable patents. As proposed, these provisions would have required applicants
to certify that a patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use, or sale of the drug product that
is the subject of the application. The agency has revised these certification statements to clarify how an applicant
challenging a patent as unenforceable should word its paragraph IV certification. Although the agency realizes
that courts have, in patent cases, distinguished invalid patents from unenforceable patents, the only court addressing
the issue of unenforceable patents in the context of the provisions of section 505 of the act interpreted the phrase
``invalid or not infringed'' to include an unenforceable patent. (See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 873 F.2d 1418 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (applying section 505(j)(4)(B)(iii) of the act).) The agency agrees with the court's
construction of the act. The alternative interpretation, precluding applicants challenging patents as unenforceable
from filing certifications under paragraph IV, would be contrary to Congress' obvious intent in allowing patent
challenges under section 505 of the act and would lead to absurd results. Subsequent to the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has also made corresponding changes to other provisions, such as the notice requirements in &sect;&sect;314.52
and 314.95, to include certifications for ``unenforceable'' patents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Two comments disagreed with proposed &sect;314.50(i)(1)(ii), which would require an applicant to state that,
in its opinion and to the best of its knowledge, there are no patents that claim the drug or drugs on which investigations
that the applicant relied upon in its application were conducted or that claim a use for the drug or drugs. One comment
said applicants should only be required to certify that there are no listed patents. The other comment suggested deleting
the provision and combining this patent certification with a paragraph I (no patent information submitted) certification.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA believes the comments have misconstrued proposed &sect;314.50(i)(1)(ii). The provision would require a ``no
relevant patents'' certification if, ``in the opinion of the applicant and to the best of its knowledge,'' there are
no patents described in the patent certification section (&sect;314.50(i)(1)(i)). In other words, if an applicant
made one of the four patent certifications under &sect;314.50(i)(1)(i), the applicant would not make another certification
under &sect;314.50(i)(1)(ii). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. One comment strongly objected to proposed &sect;314.50(i)(4). The provision would require section 505(b)(2)
applicants whose applications were submitted after the late patent information is filed, or did not contain an appropriate
patent certification at the time of the late submission, to submit a patent certification on such patents. The comment
explained that section 505(d)(6) and 505(e)(4) of the act authorizes the agency, after providing an opportunity
for a hearing, to refuse to approve an application or to withdraw approval of an NDA for failure to provide patent information.
Thus, the comment argued that proposed &sect;314.50(i)(4) conferred a benefit on NDA applicants by permitting late
patent information submissions without applying the statutory requirements for timely submission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has considered this and other comments which suggest regulatory approaches for handling patents that
are filed outside the statutory time limits. Congress clearly intended to enforce timely submission of patent information.
The statute requires that patent information be submitted with the application, by amendment prior to approval of
the application, or within 30 days after the patent issues. (See 21 U.S.C. 355(b)(1) and (c)(2)). For the most extreme
example of untimely patent filing_when a pioneer fails to file required patent information within 30 days of notice
from the agency_Congress has provided the extreme remedy of withdrawal of approval of the new drug application. (See
21 U.S.C. 355(e)(4)). Congress did not directly address the question of patent filings that occur more than 30 days
after issuance of the patent and for which the agency does not provide notice of the deficiency. The agency could treat
these filings in a number of ways. The agency could refuse to publish in the list the untimely patent information. This
approach has been rejected because it would provide no notice to subsequent 505(b)(2) or ANDA applicants that a patent
exists that the NDA holder believes is applicable to the pioneer drug product. Absence of publication could lead an
applicant to submit a 505(b)(2) application or an ANDA that it would not have submitted had the patent been listed.
As a result, the applicant and the agency may expend resources unnecessarily. In addition, 505(b)(2) or ANDA applicants
could thereby subject themselves and the NDA holder to unnecessary patent litigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to publication of the proposed rule, the agency was asked to consider regulatory language designed to allow
a pioneer holder to update, at any time, its patent information. This approach has been rejected because it would allow
for manipulation of the patent filing system by the holder of the NDA and could result in delays in approval of otherwise
approvable ANDA's. For example, if patents could be filed at any time after issuance, the holder of the NDA could delay
the filing of a patent, and subsequent publication, until within 30 months prior to the expiration of the latest-expiring
patent. Even if the ANDA applicant does not believe the patent is applicable to the pioneer drug, it will then be required
either to file a paragraph III certification and wait until the patent expires, or to file a paragraph IV certification
and therefore initiate the procedure set out at section 505(c)(3)(C) and (j)(4)(B). This procedure requires that
the agency wait at least 30 months, unless a shorter or longer period is judicially ordered, before it makes effective
approval of the application. Even if the NDA holder is unsuccessful in defending the late-filed patent, it will have
extended its period of market monopoly in a manner inconsistent with the intent of Congress when it struck the balance
between protecting the patent rights of innovators and encouraging prompt and efficient entry of generics onto the
market. By requiring timely filing of patent information, the agency hopes to permit judicial resolution of patent
disputes without unduly extending the innovator's period of patent protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The approach adopted by the agency as best embodying the compromise adopted by Congress requires that if an NDA applicant
submits required patent information on an approved drug product more than 30 days after issuance of the patent, FDA
will publish the untimely information, but will not require ANDA and 505(b)(2) applicants with pending applications
who have previously submitted a certification, i.e. those applicants who would be prejudiced by the late submission,
to recertify to the new patent. Only applicants who initially submit ANDA's or 505(b)(2) applications after the submission
of the patent information or whose pending applications do not contain a valid certification at the time of submission
would be required to submit a certification as to that patent. (See &sect;&sect;314.50(i)(4) and 314.94(a)(12)(vi).)
While this could result in two categories of ANDA's for a pioneer drug, those without certifications for the late-filed
patent and those with certifications for that patent, this approach is the best means for discouraging manipulation
of the patent filing scheme and providing optimum notice of applicable patents. Disputes over patent issues arising
from this approach will be resolved by Federal courts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is the agency's opinion that this remedy may also prove suitable in certain instances when an NDA holder fails to
respond to an agency request for patent information within the statutory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30-day period. It is a less severe sanction than withdrawing the approval of the NDA, but nonetheless effectuates
congressional intent to encourage timely filing and protect patent rights.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
8. One comment asked FDA to clarify supplemental patent certifications under proposed &sect;314.50(i)(6)(i).
The comment noted that the provision would have applicants submit new patent certifications if a patent were found
valid and infringed, but does not instruct applicants what to do if a patent is found to be infringed, but also invalid.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has revised &sect;&sect;314.50(i)(6)(i) and 314.94(a)(12)(vii)(A) to state that an applicant does not have
to provide an amended patent certification if a court finds a patent to be invalid and infringed. FDA recognizes that
courts have the discretion to focus on patent infringement issues and not decide patent validity. However, court
decisions have also recognized the desirability of a court ruling on patent infringement even if the patent is held
invalid. (See, e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Medtronic, Inc. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
v. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Cardiac Pacemakers, Inc
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., 721 F.2d 1563 at 1583 (Fed. Cir. 1983).) (``Though an invalid claim cannot give rise to liability for infringement,
whether it is infringed is an entirely separate question capable of determination without regard to its validity.
Because both validity and infringement involve construction of a claim, and because the construction must be the
same in determining both, it is desirable to decide both questions at the same time.'') Moreover, in such instances,
the Supreme Court has indicated that ``of the two questions, validity has the greater public importance.'' (See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sinclair &amp; Carroll Co. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Interchemical Corp
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., 325 U.S. 327, 330 (1945).) Consequently, if a court finds a patent to be invalid and infringed, FDA will attach more
importance to the finding of invalidity, and will not require an amended patent certification even if the patent is
also found to be infringed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. The agency, on its own initiative, has also revised &sect;314.50(i)(6)(ii) regarding patent certifications
when a patent is removed from the list of patents for any reason other than a declaration of invalidity. Section 314.50(i)(6)(ii),
as proposed, would have required an applicant to certify that there are no patents that claim the drug or, if other relevant
patents claim the drug, to submit a request to withdraw the paragraph IV (patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will
not be infringed) certification. FDA has revised this section so that an applicant must certify that there are no patents
that claim the drug or, if other relevant patents claim the drug, to provide an appropriate patent certification.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. On its own initiative, the agency has also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revised &sect;314.50(i)(6)(iii)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) (now renumbered as &sect;314.50(i)(6)(iii)(B)). As proposed, this provision would not require an applicant to
amend a patent certification ``when information on an otherwise applicable patent is submitted after the 505(b)(2)
application is approved, whether or not the approval of the abbreviated application is effective.'' Because an approval
with a delayed effective date is tentative and is not final (see 57 FR 17950 at 17956), the agency has revised &sect;314.50(i)(6)(iii)(B)
to require section 505(b)(2) applicants to amend their patent certifications until the effective date of approval.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. FDA received five comments on proposed &sect;314.50(j) and the applicant's obligations when claiming marketing
exclusivity for a product. One comment would change proposed &sect;314.50(j) to have an applicant submit exclusivity
information ``with'' its application rather than ``to'' its application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA agrees, in part, with the comment. In general, applicants should submit exclusivity information with their NDA's.
If the NDA has been submitted, but has not been approved, the applicant should submit exclusivity information as an
amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. One comment would revise proposed &sect;314.50(j)(3) to have an applicant state that, ``to the best of its knowledge
or belief, a drug has not been approved.'' The comment said proposed &sect;314.50(j)(3) would require applicants
to ``prove a negative'' because they would have to show that ``no drug has previously been approved under section 505(b)
of the act containing any active moiety in the drug for which the applicant is seeking approval.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA agrees and has amended the rule accordingly.

13. Proposed &sect;314.50(j)(4)(i) contained a typographical error. As originally drafted, the provision interpreted
``new clinical investigations'' as a certification that, to the best of the applicant's knowledge, the clinical
investigations included in the application ``meet the definitions of `new' and `clinical investigations' set forth
in &sect;314.108(a).'' Proposed section 314.108(a), however, only defined ``new clinical investigation.'' The
agency has corrected &sect;314.50(j)(4)(i) to refer to ``new clinical investigation.'' The agency has also replaced
the reference to ``the clinical investigations'' with ``each of the clinical investigations.'' This change is intended
to clarify that each clinical investigation, as opposed to some clinical investigations, must meet the definition
of a ``new clinical investigation'' in &sect;314.108. The agency has also made a minor grammatical change to &sect;314.50(j)(4)
to simplify its sentence structure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. Proposed &sect;314.50(j)(4)(ii) interpreted the phrase ``essential to approval'' as:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A list of all published studies or publicly available reports of clinical investigations known to the applicant through
a literature search that are relevant to the conditions for which the applicant is seeking approval, a certification
that the applicant has thoroughly searched the scientific literature and, to the best of the applicant's knowledge,
the list is complete and accurate and, in the applicant's opinion, such published studies or publicly available reports
do not provide a sufficient basis for the approval of the conditions for which the applicant is seeking approval without
reference to the new clinical investigation(s) in the application, and an explanation as to why the studies or reports
are insufficient.

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Three comments would revise proposed &sect;314.50(j)(4)(ii) to have FDA declare whether a study is ``essential
to approval'' before the applicant begins the study or at the applicant's request. Another comment would consider
the agency's rejection of a suitability petition or ANDA as conclusive evidence that studies are ``essential to approval.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated elsewhere in this final rule, determining whether a study is essential for approval before a firm submits
an application or even begins the study is not always feasible. Research goals and objectives often change during
clinical investigations. Moreover, as stated in the preamble to the proposed rule, one cannot determine what studies
will be essential to approval of an application by a review of protocols without knowing what drugs have been approved
and what is in the published literature at the time the application is approved. If published reports of investigations,
other than those conducted or sponsored by the applicant, are sufficient to approve a drug product, no additional
studies would be essential to approval of that drug product as of the date of approval, and no exclusivity would be granted
(see 54 FR 28872 at 28900 and 28901). Thus, it is far more practical for FDA to decide whether a study is essential for
approval at the time the application is approved. FDA also believes that, if a pivotal study that could form the basis
for approval were published by someone other than the applicant after submission but before approval of the application,
there would be no exclusivity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency also declines to treat its rejection of a suitability petition or ANDA as conclusive evidence that studies
are ``essential to approval.'' FDA may refuse to approve a suitability petition or ANDA for a variety of reasons. For
example, under 21 CFR 314.93(e)(1)(ii), the agency may not approve a suitability petition that seeks to change an
active ingredient if the drug product that is the subject of the petition is not a combination drug. Under 21 CFR 314.127(a),
the agency may refuse to approve an ANDA if the methods used in, or the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture,
processing, and packing of the drug product are inadequate to ensure and preserve its identity, strength, quality,
and purity. Thus, the agency's refusal to approve a suitability petition or ANDA does not necessarily mean that studies
conducted or sponsored by the applicant are ``essential to approval.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. One comment also interpreted the terms ``scientific literature'' in proposed &sect;314.50(j)(4)(ii) as literature
existing at the time the application was submitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA agrees that &sect;314.50(j)(4)(ii) only requires applicants to provide a list of all published studies or publicly
available reports of clinical investigations known to the applicant at the time the applicant submits the application.

B. Section 314.52_Notice of Certification of Invalidity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or Noninfringement of a Patent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;314.52 described the process whereby an applicant would provide notice of certification of invalidity
or noninfringement of a patent. Proposed &sect;314.52(a) would have required applicants to provide notice to each
patent owner that is the subject of the certification and the holder of the approved application. Proposed &sect;314.52(b)
instructed applicants to provide notice after receipt of a letter from FDA stating that the application has been filed.
Proposed &sect;314.52(c)(6) specified the content of a notice, including a ``detailed statement of the factual
and legal basis of the applicant's opinion that the patent is not valid or will not be infringed.'' Proposed &sect;314.52(d)
would have required an applicant who amended its application to contain a patent certification to provide notice
of certification of invalidity or noninfringement of a patent. Proposed &sect;314.52(e) would have required applicants
to document receipt of notice.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
16. FDA received two comments on proposed &sect;314.52(a). One comment agreed with the provision, but stated that
notice to the holder of the approved application should be considered only as informational ``with no legal ramifications
since the NDA holder has 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
no
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 patent rights by reason of its NDA.'' (Emphasis added in original.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The legal ramifications under patent law, if any, of this notice of certification of invalidity or noninfringement
of a patent are beyond the scope of this rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. One comment objected to proposed &sect;314.52(a)(3). The comment explained that the provision would permit
an applicant whose application did not cover any use claimed in a patent to refrain from making any patent certifications
or providing any notice. The comment would require all applicants to provide notice of certification of invalidity
or noninfringement of a patent to all patent owners whose patents claim the active ingredient that is the subject of
the application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 505(b)(2)(A) of the Act, an application must contain a certification with respect to each patent which
claims the listed drug or which claims a use for such listed drug for which the 505(b)(2) applicant is seeking approval.
One of these patent certifications is that the patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use, or
sale of the new drug for which the application is submitted. (See section 505(b)(2)(A)(iv) of the Act). If an applicant
makes a ``paragraph IV'' certification, it must give notice to the patent owner and the NDA holder. (See section 505(b)(3)(A)
of the Act.) If, however, the applicant is not seeking approval for a use that is covered by a use patent, the statute
does not require a ``paragraph IV'' certification or notice to that patent owner and NDA holder. (See section 505(b)(2)(B)
and (b)(2)(A) of the Act.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, &sect;314.52(a) is consistent with the statute, and FDA declines to revise it as suggested by the comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
18. FDA received three comments on proposed &sect;314.52(c) regarding the content of a notice of certification of
invalidity or noninfringement of a patent. Two comments favored extremely detailed statements of the factual and
legal basis of the applicant's opinion that the patent is not valid or will not be infringed. These comments would require
the applicant to list all components used in the proposed drug product, the proportions of each component, and list
all grounds supporting its opinion that the patent is invalid or will not be infringed. One comment opposed disclosure
of the proposed drug product's formulation and also objected to the use of a ``designated intermediary'' in proposed
&sect;314.52(c)(6)(iii). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, the statute requires a notice of certification of invalidity or noninfringement of a patent to state that
an application has been submitted and to include ``a detailed statement of the factual and legal basis of the applicant's
opinion that the patent is not valid or will not be infringed.'' (See section 505(b)(3)(B) and 355(j)(2)(B)(ii).)
The proposed rule listed the type of information FDA considered necessary to enable patent owners to decide whether
to sue for patent infringement. The list at proposed &sect;&sect;314.52(c) and 314.95(c) generated substantial
debate, as reflected in the comments, as to the details to be included in a notice. The agency is neither prepared nor
required to become involved in issues concerning sufficiency of notice for purposes of enforcing patent law. Therefore,
FDA has revised both &sect;&sect;314.52(c) and 314.95(c) so that the detailed statement of the factual and legal
basis behind the applicant's opinion that the patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed must include:
(1) For each claim of the patent alleged not to be infringed, a full and detailed explanation why the claim is not infringed;
and (2) for each claim of a patent alleged to be invalid or unenforceable, a full and detailed explanation of the grounds
supporting the allegation. These provisions, as revised, paraphrase the statutory language. The sufficiency of
the notice, for purposes of patent enforcement, is an issue to be resolved by the applicant and the patent owner or the
holder of the approved application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has also revised &sect;&sect;314.52(c)(6) and 314.95(c)(6) by removing paragraphs (c)(6)(iii) entirely.
FDA is making this change due to the numbers of comments that objected to the use of a ``designated intermediary'' and
the ``referee'' concept in proposed &sect;&sect;314.52 and 314.95. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
19. One comment would amend proposed &sect;314.52(e) pertaining to documentation of receipt of notice of certification
of invalidity or noninfringement of a patent. The comment would include a signed receipt or delivery manifest as documentation
of notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 314.52(e) clearly states that documentation of notice may be a copy of the return receipt or ``other similar
evidence of the date the notification was received.'' The provision also states that FDA will accept as adequate documentation
of the date of receipt a return receipt or ``a letter acknowledging receipt by the person provided the notice.'' Thus,
&sect;314.52(e) does not limit an applicant to a particular form of documentation of notice. Applicants are required,
however, to obtain agreement from FDA in advance if they intend to use a form of documentation other than return receipt.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20. The agency has also revised &sect;314.52(f) to state that the 45-day period provided for in section 505(c)(3)(C)
of the Act will begin on the day following the date of receipt of the notice by the patent owner or its representative
and by the approved application holder. The reasons for this change are described in comment 62 below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency, on its own initiative, has also revised &sect;314.52(f) to state that the agency may begin the 45-day period
on a later date if the applicant has amended its application to state that a later date should be used. This could occur,
for example, where the applicant has amended its notice to the patent owner to provide more information regarding
the applicant's notice of invalidity or noninfringement. This revision is also consistent with the corresponding
provision for ANDA's.

C. Section 314.53_Submission of Patent Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;314.53 contained general requirements for the submission of patent information by NDA applicants
and NDA holders. For example, proposed &sect;314.53(b) would have required an NDA applicant to submit information
on each patent that claims the drug or drug product for which the applicant is seeking approval or a method of using the
drug that is the subject of the NDA or amendment or supplement and with respect to which a claim of patent infringement
could reasonably be asserted if a person not licensed by the owner of the patent engaged in the manufacture, use, or
sale of the drug product. Proposed &sect;314.53(c) described general reporting requirements, such as information
on the type of patent and the name of the patent owner, and also required applicants to submit ``certifications'' with
respect to formulation or composition patents (proposed &sect;314.53(c)(2)) and method of use patents (proposed
&sect;314.53(c)(3)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
21. One comment addressed patent information and amendments of patent information under proposed &sect;&sect;314.50(h)
and 314.53. These provisions would require each application under section 505(b) of the act to contain specific information
about each patent that claimed the drug product or a method of using the drug product. The provisions also would require
applicants to amend patent information or patent certifications and would permit the agency to disclose patent information.
The comment said FDA should only publish patent information filed by NDA applicants at the time FDA approves the NDA.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A drug product does not necessarily have a patent by the time FDA approves the NDA. The statute expressly recognizes
that a patent might issue after NDA approval, and, under such circumstances, instructs the NDA holder to file patent
information within 30 days of the patent's issue date. Once FDA receives this information, the agency is obliged to
publish it (see section 505(c)(2) of the act). Patent information might also change after NDA approval. For example,
the patent term restoration provisions at 35 U.S.C. 156 give patent holders the opportunity to extend patent terms.
The extended patent term may be as long as 5 years. However, patent owners cannot apply for patent term extension until
FDA approves the product for marketing (see 35 U.S.C. 156(d)(1)). Thus, patent term restoration (also known as ``patent
term extension'') always occurs after NDA approval, and patent owners who obtain such extensions usually notify
FDA of the new patent expiration date. The new expiration date will be important to ANDA applicants because section
505(j)(2)(A)(vii) of the act requires ANDA applicants to submit patent certifications. Consequently, FDA does
not accept the comment's suggestion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
22. One comment would amend proposed &sect;314.53 to establish a mechanism ``for review of submitted patent information
to determine, at least on a very general basis, applicability to the particular NDA in question.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA declines to adopt the comment. As stated elsewhere in this final rule, FDA does not have the expertise to review
patent information. The agency believes that its scarce resources would be better utilized in reviewing applications
rather than reviewing patent claims. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
23. FDA, on its own initiative, has amended &sect;314.53(b) by replacing the phrase, ``such patents consist of drug
(ingredient) patents'' with ``such patents consist of drug substance (ingredient) patents.'' The final rule also
replaces the phrase ``For patents that claim a drug or drug product'' with ``For patents that claim a drug substance
or drug product.'' These changes are intended to clarify the type of patents involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
24. One comment would amend proposed &sect;314.53(b) by requiring an applicant to declare that it holds each patent
or is the exclusive licensee of the patent owner or is authorized to submit patent information on behalf of the patent
owner. The comment would also prohibit an applicant from submitting patent information and would prohibit the agency
from listing any patent information if the applicant did not make any of these declarations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency declines to amend the provision. Under &sect;314.53(c), the applicant must provide the name of the patent
owner or, if the patent owner or applicant does not reside or have a place of business within the United States, the name
of an agent or representative who resides or maintains a place of business within the United States and is authorized
to receive notice of patent certification. Requiring an applicant to declare that it is the patent owner or exclusive
licensee or is authorized to submit patent information would go beyond the statutory language at section 505(b)(1)
of the act and would not serve any statutory purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA also declines to amend the rule to prohibit the applicant from submitting patent information or to prohibit the
agency from listing patent information without a declaration of ownership or license. Such an amendment would be
contrary to section 505(b)(1) of the act and may result in less published patent information, thereby causing applicants
to question the accuracy and validity of any patent information listed by FDA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
25. FDA received two comments that objected to proposed &sect;314.53(b) and (c) regarding the submission of patent
information by NDA applicants. Both comments claimed that the 1984 amendments only require NDA applicants to provide
patent numbers and patent expiration dates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA disagrees with the comments. Section 505(b)(1) of the act requires an applicant to file ``the patent number and
the expiration date of any patent which claims the drug for which the applicant submitted the application * * * and with
respect to which a claim of patent infringement could reasonably be asserted if a person not licensed by the owner engaged
in the manufacture, use, or sale of the drug.'' The requirement in &sect;314.53(b) and (c) that applicants provide
information on the type of patent and the name of the patent owner or authorized representative is consistent with
the purpose of section 505(b)(1) of the act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
26. One comment objected to proposed &sect;314.53(c)(2) and (c)(3). Proposed &sect;314.53(c)(2) would have required
an applicant to provide a patent certification for each formulation or composition patent in addition to certain,
general patent information. Proposed &sect;314.53(c)(3) would have required applicants to provide similar certifications
for method of use patents. The comment said that a patent may contain formulation, composition, and method of use claims.
The comment suggested deleting the proposed rule's classification of patents and replacing it with a general certification
that the patents listed by the applicant contain claims with respect to which the applicant could reasonably assert
a claim of infringement against a person engaged in the unlicensed manufacture, use, or sale of the drug for which the
application was submitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA acknowledges that a patent may contain a variety of claims, and has revised proposed &sect;314.53(c)(2) by creating
a single certification statement. The new certification statement would have an applicant state that, ``The undersigned
declares that Patent No. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XXXX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 covers the formulation, composition, and/or method of use of (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
name of drug product
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). This product is (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
currently approved under section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) [or] (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

): 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XXXXXXXX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.'' However, because section 505(b)(1) of the act specifically requires applicants to ``file with the application
the patent number and the expiration date of any patent which claims the drug for which the applicant submitted the
application or which claims a method of using such drug,'' and because FDA lacks patent law expertise, the agency strongly
encourages applicants to identify, to the best of their ability, the type of patent covering the drug or drug product.
This information will help FDA determine which claims cover the drug or drug product and which claims cover a method
of use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
27. One comment said FDA should not list formulation patents. Proposed &sect;314.53(c)(2) would require applicants
under section 505(b) of the act to provide information on formulation or composition patents, and FDA would publish
this information under &sect;314.53(e). The comment said this would increase the number of generic drug applications
by avoiding difficult questions of exclusivity for ``patentably distinct formulations'' and noted that patent
owners can always resort to patent law to halt possible patent infringement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA disagrees with the comment. The statute expressly requires applicants to file ``the patent number and the expiration
date of any patent which claims the drug for which the applicant submitted the application *&blank;*&blank;*'' (section
505(b)(1) of the act). Thus, if the formulation patent claimed the drug product in the application, the applicant
must file information on that patent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
28. One comment would revise proposed &sect;314.53(c)(2)(i), (c)(3)(i), and (c)(4) to refer to a ``declaration''
rather than ``certification.'' The comment explained that the 1984 amendments used the word ``certification''
with respect to patent information to be submitted by applicants under section 505(b)(2)(A) and (j)(2)(A)(vii)
of the act, so use of the word ``certification'' in proposed &sect;314.53(c) would be confusing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency agrees and has revised these and other sections of the rule accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
29. One comment would delete proposed &sect;314.53(c)(2)(ii) and (c)(3)(ii). The comment said that the provision
for the correction of patent information at proposed &sect;314.53(f) would ensure that patent information is correct.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions cited by the comment serve different purposes. As revised, &sect;314.53(c)(2)(ii) requires an applicant
to provide patent information about a product within 30 days after the date of approval; these provisions contemplate
the possibility that the patents pertaining to a product's formulation, composition, and uses may change between
the time the application is initially submitted and the time the application is approved (see 54 FR 28872 at 28909).
Although &sect;314.53(f) enables any person to dispute the accuracy or relevance of the patent information submitted
to FDA, it is the responsibility of the applicant, not the general public or the applicant's competitors, to ensure
that the information provided by the applicant is accurate. These provisions for amending patent information are
necessary for maintaining an accurate list of patent information and useful for applicants who must comply with the
patent certification requirements. Therefore, FDA declines to adopt the comment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30. FDA received two comments on proposed &sect;314.53(c)(4) (now renumbered as &sect;314.53(c)(3)), which would
enable an applicant to claim that there are no relevant patents that claim the drug product or a method of using the drug
product. One comment supported the provision; the other recommended deleting it entirely, stating that the only
party that would be injured by the failure to list a patent is the NDA applicant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA declines to delete the provision as suggested. The agency disagrees with the assertion that the NDA applicant
would be the only party injured by the failure to list a patent. The patent holder may be a person other than the NDA applicant
and may be injured if the patented invention is made, sold, or used without the patent owner's knowledge or consent.
Failure to list a patent may also result in injury to other applicants who devote resources towards submitting applications
for duplicate products without realizing that those products may be covered by the patent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
31. FDA, on its own initiative, has reorganized &sect;314.53(d) to clarify further when and where patent information
should be submitted. As revised, &sect;314.53(d)(1) pertains to patent information requirements for original
applications. New &sect;314.53(d)(2), formerly &sect;314.53(d)(2)(ii), applies to patent information requirements
for supplements, and a new &sect;314.53(d)(3), formerly &sect;314.53(d)(2)(i), applies to patent information
submitted after an application has been approved. The agency has renumbered the remaining paragraphs accordingly.

32. Proposed &sect;314.53(d) instructed applicants when and where to submit patent information in an original application
and in a supplement and would require an applicant to provide patent information within 30 days if a patent issues for
a drug, drug product, or method of use after the application had been approved. Three comments asked FDA to extend the
30-day period in proposed &sect;314.53(d) to 60 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA declines to accept the comment. The 30-day period is consistent with section 505(c)(2) of the act and permits the
agency to include the latest patent information in supplements to the Orange Book. If FDA provided for a longer time
period, the Orange Book and its supplements might be less likely to contain current patent information for each product,
and potential applicants might be misled by outdated patent information. FDA has, on its own initiative, clarified
&sect;314.53(d)(1) and (d)(3) to mention the 30-day deadline.

33. Proposed &sect;314.53(d)(2)(ii) (now renumbered as &sect;314.53(d)(2)) would require an applicant to submit
patent information for a patent that claims the drug, drug product, or a method of using the product if the applicant
sought approval of certain, listed changes through a supplemental application. One comment would revise proposed
&sect;314.53(d)(2)(ii) to require an applicant to provide a patent declaration for each supplement. The comment
explained that this would ``eliminate the risk that the four types of supplements described in the proposal do not
comprise the entire universe of supplements that may affect the patent information filed with the FDA.'' The comment
would also require an NDA applicant to submit information on patents that claim the formulation or composition each
time the NDA applicant submits a supplement to revise the formulation or composition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA disagrees with the comment. Section 505(b)(1) of the act requires an applicant to submit information on each patent
that claims the drug or a method of using a drug product for which a claim of patent infringement could reasonably be
asserted if a person not licensed by the owner engaged in the manufacture, use, or sale of the drug. The supplements
listed in new &sect;314.53(d)(2)(i)_supplements to change a formulation, to add a new indication or other condition
of use, to change the strength, or to make any other patented change regarding the drug, drug product, or any method
of use_are those that concern the drug product or a method of using the drug product. Additionally, new &sect;314.53(d)(2)(i)(D)
provides for the submission of patent information for any other type of patented change. Requiring an applicant to
provide patent information for all supplements, even if the supplement did not involve a change to the drug product
or a method of using the product (i.e., a change in the site of manufacturing), would increase the workload on applicants
and the agency without a significant benefit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The suggestion that FDA require an applicant to submit information on patents that claim the formulation or composition
each time the NDA applicant submits a supplement to revise the formulation or composition is apparently based on a
misreading of proposed &sect;314.53(d)(2)(ii)(A) (now renumbered as &sect;314.53(d)(2)(i)(A)). This section
already requires an applicant to provide such information. Thus, the comment's suggestion is unnecessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
34. One comment would revise proposed &sect;314.53(d)(2)(ii)(D) (now renumbered as &sect;314.53(d)(2)(i)(D))
to require the submission of patent information if the applicant submits a supplement to make any other patented change
``except patented manufacturing processes.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The suggested revision is unnecessary because &sect;314.53(b) clearly states that, ``Process patents are not covered
by [&sect;314.53] and information on process patents may not be submitted to FDA.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
35. One comment would delete proposed &sect;314.53(d)(2)(v) (now renumbered as &sect;314.53(d)(2)(iv)), which
would require an applicant to comply with the requirements for amending formulation, composition, or method of use
patent information. The comment said applicants are already required to comply with such requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA disagrees with the comment. Section 314.53(d)(2)(iv) requires applicants to amend the patent information to
account for changes proposed in supplemental applications whereas &sect;314.53(c)(2)(ii) and (d)(2)(ii) require
an applicant to amend patent information when there have been changes in status, or there is other new information
regarding the relevant patents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
36. Proposed &sect;314.53(d)(3) (now renumbered as &sect;314.53(d)(4)) would require an applicant to submit two
copies of each submission of patent information. One copy would go to the archival copy of the application and the other
copy would go to the chemistry, manufacturing, and controls section of the review copy. One comment would delete the
phrase ``of the review copy'' from proposed &sect;314.53(d)(3) on the grounds that the phrase appeared to be a typographical
error. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA believes that the comment misreads proposed &sect;314.53(d)(3). An applicant is required to submit an archival
copy and a review copy of an application consisting of several separately bound technical sections. New &sect;314.53(d)(4)
requires an applicant to provide two copies of each submission of patent information. One copy will go to the archival
copy of the NDA; the other will go to the chemistry, manufacturing, and controls technical section of the review copy
of the NDA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
37. FDA, on its own initiative, has amended &sect;314.53(e) regarding public disclosure of patent information.
As originally proposed, &sect;314.53(e) stated that, for each use patent, FDA would publish the ``approved indications
or other conditions of use covered by a patent and any unapproved indications or condition of use to which the applicant
certified.'' The agency is deleting the reference to ``any unapproved indications or condition of use'' to be consistent
with the patent information requirements in &sect;314.53(c).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
38. FDA received two comments on proposed &sect;314.53(f) regarding corrections of patent information errors.
The proposed provision would require a person disputing the accuracy or relevance of patent information submitted
to and published by FDA to first notify the agency in writing stating the grounds for the disagreement. The agency would
then ask the NDA holder to confirm whether the patent information was correct, but would not change the patent information
listed in the Orange Book unless the NDA holder withdrew or amended that information. If the NDA holder did not change
the patent information, a 505(b)(2) applicant or ANDA applicant would be required to make a certification for the
listed patent despite any disagreement as to its correctness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both comments said that FDA should ensure that patent information submitted to the agency is complete and applies
to a particular NDA. One comment would also amend the rule to have FDA confirm, upon request from any person, the accuracy
or relevance of the patent information submitted to the agency. One comment said the agency should not provide applicants
the grounds for a disagreement on the accuracy or relevance of patent information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated elsewhere in this rule, FDA does not have the resources or the expertise to review patent information for
its accuracy and relevance to an NDA. Therefore, the agency declines the comment's requests to ensure that patent
information is complete and relevant to an NDA and to confirm, upon request, the validity of patent information submitted
to the agency. The agency believes that the declaration requirements under &sect;314.53(c), as well as an applicant's
potential liability if it submits an untrue statement of material fact, will help ensure that accurate patent information
is submitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA also declines to amend the rule to prevent the agency from providing applicants the grounds for a disagreement
on the accuracy or relevance of patent information. Absent such information, a patent owner will be unable to evaluate
the disagreement or to explain whether the patent information is correct. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
39. One comment noted that proposed &sect;314.53(f) does not require applicants to correct patent listings. The
comment would revise the provision to permit applicants to ``make otherwise pertinent certifications while a listing
dispute is pending.'' The comment would also require FDA to notify the NDA holder of the disagreement within 15 days
of notification and require patent owners or NDA holders to respond to a disagreement on patent information or to withdraw
or amend the patent information within 30 days. The comment would then require FDA to immediately send the NDA holder's
response to the party that began the disagreement and inform the party whether the patent would remain listed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As originally proposed, &sect;314.53(f) expressly required an applicant to make ``an appropriate certification
for each listed patent'' notwithstanding any disagreement as to the correctness of the listed patent information.
If, as FDA assumes, the proposed reference to ``otherwise pertinent certifications'' means ``appropriate certifications,''
the proposal is unnecessary. If the proposed reference is to negate any responsibility to file an appropriate certification
for a patent that is subject to a dispute over listing, FDA rejects the proposal. Until the dispute is resolved, the
patent is listed within the meaning of the act. FDA also declines to amend the rule to impose deadlines for resolving
patent disagreements. The agency believes that such deadlines would be impractical, considering the agency's lack
of expertise in patent matters and the volume of applications FDA receives, and agency resources would be better spent
on reviewing applications rather than exchanging disputed patent information among parties as proposed by the comment.
The agency also notes that it has not had any significant problems with the informal procedures described in proposed
&sect;314.53(f) as most NDA holders have amended or corrected their patent information after FDA has informed them
of a dispute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has, however, revised &sect;314.53(f) to provide a new address for the submission of written statements
disputing the relevance or accuracy of patent information. Such statements should now be directed to the Drug Information
Services Branch in the Division of Drug Information Resources. This change reflects current FDA operations.

F. Section 314.94_Content and Format of an Abbreviated Application (21 CFR 314.94)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12) contained the patent certification requirements for ANDA's. For example, under
proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(i), an ANDA applicant would provide a patent certification with respect to each patent
that claims the reference listed drug or that claims a use of the reference listed drug for which the ANDA applicant
is seeking approval. Proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(ii) would permit an ANDA applicant to certify that there are
no relevant patents that claim the listed drug or a method of use of the listed drug. Proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(iii)
would permit an ANDA applicant to state that the use for which the applicant is seeking approval is not covered by a patent
claiming a use for the listed drug. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40. One comment claimed that proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(i)(A) was inconsistent with the statute because the
statute only requires ANDA applicants to make certifications for listed patents rather than patents issued by the
United States Patent and Trademark Office. Two comments added that the suggestion regarding patent searches that
FDA made in the preamble to the proposed rule was irrational and legally insupportable. One company, however, agreed
that ANDA applicants should submit patent certifications with respect to all patents, including those that had not
been submitted to FDA for listing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule simply paraphrases the statutory language in section 505(j)(2)(A)(vii) of the act. The rule does not require
ANDA applicants to conduct patent searches. If the applicant believes that no patent exists, the applicant is to submit
a patent certification under &sect;314.94(a)(12)(ii) that no relevant patents exist. If the applicant believes
that a patent exists but that the patent owner has not filed patent information at FDA, the ANDA applicant would certify
that, ``in its opinion and to the best of its knowledge,'' no patent information has been submitted (i.e., make a paragraph
I certification). FDA, however, believes it would be prudent for applicants to conduct patent searches if possible.
A patent search could reveal the existence of an unlisted, but valid, patent and thus prevent an unnecessary expenditure
of resources by applicants and FDA on a product that might not be marketable. A patent search might also enable ANDA
applicants to avoid unnecessary patent infringement litigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
41. One comment suggested that FDA publish all patent information, including descriptions of the patents and patent
numbers, in the Orange Book. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Orange Book already contains an addendum listing both patent and exclusivity information. This section provides
patent numbers and patent expiration dates as well as exclusivity codes and expiration dates. In addition, for a use
patent, FDA includes in the Orange Book a code identifying the indication covered by the patent. As for patent descriptions,
FDA lacks the expertise to review and summarize patents and individual patent claims and does not believe that expanding
the Orange Book to include patent descriptions would be an efficient use of FDA resources. However, persons who wish
to obtain a synopsis of a particular patent can consult the Official Gazette for Patents, which is published by the
United States Patent and Trademark Office. The Official Gazette for Patents contains short descriptions of patents
and is publicly available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
42. One comment asserted that FDA should list patents that claim drug products for which the patent owner is not seeking
or has not obtained approval. The comment explained that the statute requires NDA holders and applicants to submit
information on ``any patent which claims the drug for which the applicant submitted the application'' (section 505(b)(1)
of the act). The comment, citing &sect;314.50(d)(1), claimed that ``drug'' means the active ingredient while ``drug
product'' denotes a marketed product composed of active and inactive ingredients. Thus, because section 505(b)(1)
of the act uses the term ``drug,'' the comment continued, any patent that claims the active ingredient is a patent that
claims the drug for which the applicant submitted the application and should be listed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA disagrees with the comment's interpretation of section 505(b)(1) of the act. The statutory provision states
that patent information is to be filed on patents that claim the drug ``for which the applicant submitted the application.''
Similarly, the House Report accompanying the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act indicates that
the patent information to be filed ``includes the patent number and the expiration date of any patent which claims
the drug 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in the NDA 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

with respect to which a claim of patent infringement could reasonably be asserted *&blank;*&blank;*.'' H. Rept.
857, 98th Cong., 2d sess. 31&hyph;32 (1984) (emphasis added). Thus, both the statute and its legislative history
reveal that Congress intended the term ``drug'' to mean ``drug product'' rather than ``active ingredient'' because
NDA's are granted only for drug products and not for active ingredients. FDA's interpretation of this provision has
been upheld by a United States magistrate in

43. Several comments sought clarification regarding the interaction between proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(i)(A)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and &sect;314.94(a)(12)(v), 180-day exclusivity periods under section 505(j)(4)(B)(iv) of the act, and licensees.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because patent licensees are subject to 180-day exclusivity that has been granted to another applicant, the only
instance in which proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(v) would apply would be where a patent licensee would seek to have
an effective approval of its ANDA or 505(b)(2) application within 45 days of its receipt or filing (because the patent
holder has 45 days to file a lawsuit against an ANDA applicant making a paragraph IV certification). Because the agency
does not anticipate approving an ANDA or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
505(b)(2) application in 45 days, FDA, on its own initiative, removed the provisions in &sect;314.94(a)(12)(v)
and &sect;314.107(b)(1)(iv) related to consent by a patent owner to an immediate effective date of approval for a
licensee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
44. Two comments disagreed with proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(ii), which would require ANDA applicants to certify
that there are no relevant patents that claim the listed drug referred to in the ANDA. One comment said that ANDA applicants
should only be required to certify that no listed patents claim the listed drug referred to in the ANDA. The second comment
suggested deleting the provision and revising proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(i)(A)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) so ANDA applicants would certify that no patent information had been filed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA declines to accept the comments. As stated in the preamble to the proposed rule, an applicant makes a patent certification
under &sect;314.94(a)(12)(ii) if ``in the applicant's opinion and to the best of its knowledge, no relevant patents
claim the listed drug or a method of using the listed drug'' (54 FR 28872 at 28885). The applicant makes the patent certifications
under &sect;314.94(a)(12)(i) when it is aware of or believes that a patent covers the listed drug. (Id.) FDA believes
that &sect;314.94(a)(12)(ii) will enable FDA to ensure that each applicant has complied with the patent certification
requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
45. One comment asked FDA to define ``relevant'' for proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(ii). The word ``relevant'' refers
to those patents defined by section 505(j)(2)(A)(vii) of the act for which a patent certification would be required,
i.e., patents that claim the listed drug, or drug substance component thereof, referred to in the ANDA or that claim
a use of the listed drug or drug substance for which the ANDA applicant seeks approval and for which patent information
is required to be filed under section 505 (b) and (c) of the act and &sect;314.53. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although patents that are held to be invalid or unenforceable in a judicial decision may be removed from the list by
FDA, a patent that has been declared invalid or unenforceable in a lawsuit resulting in 180-day exclusivity will be
deemed relevant under &sect;314.94(a)(12)(ii) and will not be removed from the list until the end of the 180-day exclusivity
period. This will ensure that 180-day exclusivity cannot be avoided by changing a patent certification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
46. Several comments objected to proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(iii), which would require ANDA applicants to provide
a patent statement if the listed patent is for a method of use and that applicant does not intend to claim any of the patented
uses. The comments recommended that such ANDA applicants certify, under &sect;314.94(a)(12)(i)(A)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), that the listed use patent would not be infringed, thereby giving the patent owner notice of possible patent infringement.
One comment asked how proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(iii) would affect eligibility for the 180-day exclusivity
period. The comment explained that the statute requires ANDA applicants to make patent certifications under section
505(j)(2)(A)(vii) of the act and statements for method of use patents under section 505(j)(2)(A)(viii) of the act.
However, the comment stated, for method of use patents, the proposed rule could be interpreted as giving ANDA applicants
the option of making a patent certification of noninfringement under proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(i)(A)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) or a statement that the applicants' drug products do not involve a patented claim under proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(iii).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA does not intend &sect;314.94(a)(12)(i)(A)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) to authorize certifications with respect to patents that claim a use for the listed drug for which the applicant is
not seeking approval. The statute requires patent certifications only if the patent ``claims a use for [the] listed
drug for which the applicant is seeking approval *&blank;*&blank;*'' (section 505(j)(2)(A)(vii) of the act). The
statute requires an applicant to make a patent statement when a method of use patent ``does not claim a use for which
the applicant is seeking approval *&blank;*&blank;*'' (section 505(j)(2)(A)(viii) of the act).) The proposed
rule recognized this distinction. FDA stated that if a patent claims a method of using the listed drug, and labeling
for the ANDA applicant's proposed drug product does not contain any indications covered by the method of use patent,
the ANDA applicant ``should not submit a certification under &sect;314.94(a)(12)(i)(A) for such a patent'' (54
FR 28872 at 28886). The preamble also indicated that if the labeling for the ANDA applicant's product did contain an
indication that was claimed by a patent, the applicant should make a certification under &sect;314.94(a)(12)(i)(A).
(Id.) Thus, the two provisions cited by the comment are not overlapping, and an applicant does not have the option of
making a certification under &sect;314.94(a)(12)(i)(A)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) in lieu of, or in addition to, a statement under &sect;314.94(a)(12)(iii). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If, however, there are listed patents that present both a product and method of use claim, the applicant may file a paragraph
IV certification with respect to the product patent or patent claim and a statement that the product that is the subject
of the application does not involve a patented method of use with respect to the method of use patent or patent claim.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
47. One comment recommended revising proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(v) to provide NDA holders the opportunity to
consent to licensing agreements between ANDA applicants and patent owners. As written, proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(v)
did not address this issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Neither the statute nor the legislative history suggests that NDA holders should be given such a right, and the agency
is not prepared to infer such a right to interfere in the patent holder's enjoyment of its right to license. However,
as stated earlier, FDA has elected to remove the language in &sect;314.94(a)(12)(v) regarding consent by the patent
owner.

48. One comment objected, in part, to proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(vi), which would require an ANDA applicant to
provide a patent certification in response to an untimely submission of patent information if the ANDA was submitted
after the untimely submission of patent information or did not contain an appropriate patent certification at the
time the patent information was submitted. The comment correctly noted that FDA may refuse to approve or may even withdraw
approval of an application for failure to submit patent information (see section 505 (d)(6) and (e)(4) of the act).
The comment said these sanctions emphasize the importance of filing patent information, and FDA ``should not provide
any benefit to the NDA applicant who ignores the statutory requirement for timely submission of such information.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 314.94(a)(12)(vi) is intended to effectuate Congress' intent to enforce timely submission of patent information.
As discussed more fully in the response to comment 7 above, FDA believes a less severe sanction than the withdrawal
of NDA approval for late submission of patent information would ordinarily effectuate congressional intent. For
the reasons discussed in response to comment 7 FDA has concluded that if an NDA applicant submits required patent information
on an approved drug product more than 30 days after issuance of the patent, the agency will publish the untimely information
but will not require ANDA applicants with pending applications who have previously submitted a certification that
was correct at the time it was submitted, i.e., those applicants who would be prejudiced by the late submission, to
recertify as to the new patent. Applicants who initially submit ANDA's after the submission of the patent information
or whose pending applications do not contain a valid certification at the time of the submission would be required
to submit a certification as to that patent. The agency, therefore, declines to revise this provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA also notes that, if an ANDA applicant with a pending application voluntarily makes a patent certification for
an untimely filed patent, the ANDA applicant may withdraw the patent certification for the untimely filed patent.
The agency, on its own initiative, has amended &sect;314.94(a)(12)(viii) to make this clear. Additionally, if the
patent certification for the untimely filed patent was a paragraph IV certification (claiming that the patent is
invalid or would not be infringed), the agency would not consider the withdrawn paragraph IV certification to preclude
FDA from granting 180-day exclusivity to another ANDA applicant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
49. Proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(vii) would permit an ANDA applicant to seek confirmation of the correctness of
patent information, but would also require an ANDA applicant to submit the appropriate patent certification if the
disputed patent information was not amended or withdrawn. One comment suggested amending proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(vii)
to declare the end of the error correction process for patent information to be final agency action. The comment explained
that this section permits challenges to listed patents but, in conjunction with proposed &sect;314.53(f), neglects
to contain a process to require patent owners to withdraw or modify patent listings. The comment said that declaring
the end of the error correction process to be final agency action would enable ANDA applicants to seek judicial review
rather than wait for the patent owner to voluntarily correct the patent information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA disagrees with the comment. Disputes between ANDA applicants and patent holders regarding the validity or correctness
of the listed patent information must be resolved among the ANDA applicants and the patent holders rather than by agency
action. FDA stated this position in the preamble to the proposed rule (see 54 FR 28872 at 28910). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
50. One comment addressed proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(viii) and asked FDA to permit applicants to amend their
patent certifications if a patent is declared invalid. The comment proposed that any amendment, with the exception
of a paragraph IV certification being changed to a paragraph III certification, be considered nunc pro tunc (now for
then). If a patent were declared invalid, the comment suggested that an amendment from paragraph IV to paragraph III
be considered ``as if a III were originally filed, subject to a prior IV certificant's exclusivity rights during the
remaining lifetime of the patent.'' Finally, the comment said that applicants should be permitted to make a paragraph
I certification if the patent were removed from the list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA agrees in part with the comment. An applicant may change its certification at any time. Although there is no need
for the agency to pronounce such changes in certification nunc pro tunc, the agency agrees that the protection offered
by 180-day exclusivity should not be undermined by changes from paragraph IV certification or by the filing of original
certifications other than paragraph IV certifications. If a patent were removed from the list immediately upon a
court decision that the patent is invalid or unenforceable, an applicant with a subsequently filed application might
seek to certify that there is no relevant patent and seek an immediately effective approval. To ensure that this does
not occur, the agency has required that a patent remain on the list after being declared invalid or unenforceable until
the end of any applicable 180-day exclusivity period. This means that a patent is deemed to be relevant under &sect;314.94(a)(12)(ii)
until the end of the term of the patent or applicable 180-day exclusivity period, whichever occurs first. Thus, where
there is a patent that has been challenged by a paragraph IV applicant, a subsequent applicant will not be able to file
a certification that there is no relevant patent or seek an immediately effective approval until either the patent
or the 180-day exclusivity period expires. The agency has amended &sect;314.94(a)(12)(viii)(B) and made a similar
change to &sect;314.50(i)(6)(ii) to reflect this position. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency also notes that an applicant may withdraw its patent certification at any time. However, as stated earlier,
if an ANDA applicant made a paragraph IV certification and later withdraws that certification, the agency will not
regard the withdrawn paragraph IV certification as precluding the agency from granting 180-day exclusivity to a
subsequent ANDA applicant.

51. One comment suggested that ANDA applicants amend their patent certifications to a paragraph I certification
if FDA or the NDA holder ``delists'' a patent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated in the preamble to the proposed rule, the agency believes that a certification under &sect;314.94(a)(12)(ii),
stating that no relevant patents claim the listed drug, would be more appropriate if a patent is ``delisted'' (see
54 FR 28872 at 28886). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
52. One comment asked FDA to clarify proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(viii)(A) so that an amended patent certification
would be required if a patent were held valid and infringed but not required if a patent were held infringed, but not
valid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a claim is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the patent will ordinarily be removed from the list, and applicants
with pending applications containing certifications with respect to that patent must amend their certifications
accordingly to certify that no relevant patents claim the drug or, if another relevant patent claims the drug, to make
an appropriate certification regarding that patent. In the amendment, the applicant must state the reason for the
change in certification (that the patent has been removed from the list). A patent that is the subject of a lawsuit under
&sect;314.107(c) will not be removed from the list until FDA determines either that no delay in effective dates of
approval is required as a result of the lawsuit or that any such period of delay in effective dates of approval is ended.
The agency has amended &sect;314.94(a)(12)(viii)(B) to clarify its position regarding certifications and patents
removed from the list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency also advises applicants to submit any patent certification changes by letter if the applicant has not received
a ``not approvable'' letter from the agency. If the applicant has received a ``not approvable'' letter, it may include
the amended certification along with the complete response to the deficiencies in the ``not approvable'' letter.
This will enable FDA to process amendments more efficiently. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
53. Six comments addressed amended certifications under proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(viii)(C)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) which would not require applicants to amend their patent certifications when patent information is submitted after
the abbreviated application's approval ``whether or not the approval of the abbreviated application is effective.''
One comment would require amended patent certifications only if a new patent issued after the ANDA had been submitted
and make supplements optional after ANDA approval. Five comments would require ANDA applicants to amend patent certifications
until the effective date of their ANDA approvals because the existence of a patent would affect the ANDA's effective
date of approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of April 28, 1992 (57 FR 17950 at 17953), FDA stated that it had clarified its policies with respect to drug products
with delayed effective dates of approval. The agency stated that an approval with a delayed effective date is tentative
and does not become final until the effective date. Therefore, FDA has amended &sect;314.94(a)(12)(viii)(C)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) by deleting the phrase ``whether or not the approval of the abbreviated application is effective,'' and, consistent
with this change, and in response to the comments, by requiring an ANDA applicant to amend its patent certifications
until the effective date of ANDA approval.

G. Section 314.95_Notice of Certification of Invalidity or Noninfringement of a Patent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;314.95 described an ANDA applicant's obligations with respect to a notice of certification of invalidity
or noninfringement of a patent. Proposed &sect;314.95(a), for example, would require an ANDA applicant to provide
notice to the patent owner and the NDA holder. Proposed &sect;314.95(b) would require an ANDA applicant to send the
notice when it receives an acknowledgment letter from FDA stating that the ANDA is sufficiently complete for review
to begin. Proposed &sect;314.95(c) prescribed the contents of a notice of certification of invalidity or noninfringement
of a patent, including ``a detailed statement of the factual and legal basis of the applicant's opinion that the patent
is not valid or will not be infringed.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
54. One comment recommended that FDA revise the regulation by adding a mechanism whereby FDA or the United States Patent
and Trademark Office would review notices of certification of invalidity or noninfringement. The comment would
have FDA suspend the 45-day period provided by section 505(j)(4)(B)(iii) of the act until FDA or the United States
Patent and Trademark Office determined that the notice was sufficient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA declines to adopt the comment. As stated elsewhere in this preamble, FDA lacks expertise in patent law. Moreover,
neither FDA nor the United States Patent and Trademark Office currently has access to the additional resources that
would be necessary to review these notices, and a patent certification review system would subject the agency's decisions
to questioning that would require further resource expenditures and create delays in the statutory patent certification
and challenge process.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency does note, however, that in cases where the notice was deemed inadequate by the patent owner or exclusive
patent licensee and where the ANDA applicant subsequently amends the notice, the agency may, if the applicant amends
its ANDA with a written statement that the date of receipt of the amended notification should be considered the date
of receipt of notice, use the date of the amended notification to begin the 45-day statutory period for institution
of an action for patent infringement (see 54 FR 28872 at 28888; see also &sect;314.95(f)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
55. Two comments addressed return receipts under proposed &sect;314.95(a). One comment would amend the rule to provide
for signed receipts while the second would revise the rule to permit reliance on ``any appropriate federal rule for
transmitting notice to another party or for receipt of such notice.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under &sect;314.95(e), applicants are required to document receipt of a notice of invalidity or noninfringement
by submitting ``a copy of the return receipt or other similar evidence of the date the notification was received.''
The rule states that FDA will accept return receipts, letters acknowledging receipt by the person provided the notice,
or ``another form of documentation only if FDA has agreed to such documentation in advance.'' Thus, the rule provides
several methods for documenting receipt of a notice, so the comment's recommendations are unnecessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
56. One comment asked FDA to clarify when multiple notices might be required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 314.95(a) requires applicants to send notices to each patent owner and each holder (or its attorney, agent,
or other authorized official) of the approved application under section 505(b) of the act for the listed drug that
is claimed by the patent and for which the applicant is seeking approval (&sect;314.95 (a)(1) and (a)(2)). Consequently,
applicants could be obliged to send multiple notices under several situations. For example, a patent owner is usually
an individual whereas the holder of an approved application is often a corporation. The applicant, therefore, would
send one notice to the patent owner and another to the firm holding the approved application. If several patents cover
the listed drug, there may be several different patent owners, so the applicant would be required to provide separate
notices to each patent owner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
57. Two comments suggested revising proposed &sect;314.95(a)(1) to include the patent owner's name and address
in the Orange Book. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The patent owner's name and address are printed on each patent. As a result, whenever a prospective applicant examines
a patent to determine whether its proposed product would infringe any of the patent claims, the applicant would have
access to the patent owner's name and address. The comment's suggestion, therefore, is unnecessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
58. Several comments asked when and how applicants should send notices under proposed &sect;314.95(b). Two comments
would have an applicant provide a statement to FDA declaring that the applicant ``will give,'' rather than ``has provided,''
notice of certification of invalidity or noninfringement of a patent. These comments explained that the statute
does not specify a time for the notice, so the rule should permit applicants to decide when to send such notices. One
comment would revise the rule to give FDA 30 days to determine whether the ANDA was complete before the applicant would
be required to send a notice of certification of invalidity or noninfringement of a patent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The legislative history discussing a notice of certification of invalidity or noninfringement of a patent clearly
states that ANDA applicants should provide notice ``simultaneously with the submission of an ANDA'' and that Congress
did ``not intend that applicants be permitted to circumvent this notice requirement by filing sham ANDA's or ANDA's
which are substantially incomplete'' (see H. Rept. 857, 98th Cong., 2d sess. 24 (1984)). Thus, to permit applicants
to state that they ``will provide'' notice to the patent owner and holder of the approved application would be contrary
to congressional intent. Moreover, such a statement would be redundant relative to that required under &sect;314.94(a)(12)(i)
and would not inform FDA whether notice has, in fact, been provided. With regard to the suggestion of a 30-day deadline
for FDA to respond before an applicant sends notice, FDA believes such a requirement would be impractical. The time
required to review an application may vary depending upon the application's complexity, the review division's workload,
the timing and scope of an applicant's response to FDA's questions or requests, etc. Although FDA intends to review
applications expeditiously, current resources and priorities may not, in all instances, enable the agency to determine
whether an application is sufficiently complete for review to begin within 30 days after receiving the application.
Consequently, FDA declines to adopt the comments.

59. One comment argued that proposed &sect;314.95(b) creates a delay that is detrimental to ANDA applicants and is
contrary to the 1984 amendments and the legislative history. The comment said that proposed &sect;314.95(b) would
deprive ANDA applicants of ``statutory rights'' associated with the 45-day period and the 30-month period for the
effective date of an ANDA approval and could present problems among competing ANDA applicants. The comment said FDA
should permit ANDA applicants to provide notice upon submission of an application or have ANDA applicants await an
initial FDA determination (presumably as to whether the application is received) before providing notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA disagrees with the comment. As stated above, the legislative history expressly states that notice of certification
of invalidity or noninfringement of a patent must be given simultaneously with the submission of an ANDA and that the
ANDA cannot be a ``sham'' ANDA or one that is substantially incomplete (see H. Rept. 857, 98th Cong., 2d sess. 24 (1984)).
As written, &sect;314.95(b) is consistent with the legislative history because it requires the ANDA applicant to
provide notice once FDA has determined that the ANDA is substantially complete to permit a substantive review. To
permit an ANDA applicant to provide notice before FDA has determined whether the ANDA is sufficiently complete would
be contrary to the legislative history because it would only encourage ANDA applicants to file incomplete or ``sham''
ANDA's and to supplement them later to secure a place in the review queue in an attempt to secure the first ANDA approval.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
60. FDA received five comments regarding the exact contents of a notice of certification of invalidity or noninfringement
of a patent. Two comments would revise the rule to require applicants to disclose all components, including active
and inactive ingredients, in the applicant's prospective formulation, the proportions of those components, and
all grounds supporting the applicant's assertion that the patent is invalid or will not be infringed. Three comments
opposed disclosure of the applicant's formulation or composition information or a detailed statement of the applicant's
legal reasoning. These comments explained that such information and statements might compromise the applicant's
trade secrets and adversely affect the applicant's ability to engage in litigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above in comment 18, the agency did not anticipate that the list in proposed &sect;314.95(c) would generate
the debate reflected in the comments and, again, reiterates that the agency does not have the expertise or the desire
to become involved in issues concerning patent law and sufficiency of notice. Therefore, FDA has revised &sect;314.95
to require that the detailed statement of the factual and legal basis behind the applicant's opinion that the patent
is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed include the following: (1) For each claim of a patent alleged not
to be infringed, a full and detailed explanation why the claim is not infringed; and (2) for each claim of a patent alleged
to be invalid or unenforceable, a full and detailed explanation of the grounds supporting the allegation (see &sect;&sect;314.52(c)(6)(i)
and (c)(6)(ii) and 314.95(c)(6)(i) and (c)(6)(ii)). Disputes involving the sufficiency of the notice must be resolved
by the applicant, patent owner, and holder of the approved application rather than by action on the part of FDA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
61. FDA also received five comments opposing the use of a referee or designated intermediary under proposed &sect;314.95(c)(6)(iii).
The proposal would have required an ANDA applicant to describe a mechanism for disclosing the formulation or composition
of the proposed drug product to the patent owner or to a ``designated intermediary who will act as a referee'' on the
subject of patent invalidity or noninfringement. The comments said that the concept was legally unauthorized and
interfered with the traditional judicial process for resolving patent disputes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA agrees that traditional processes for resolving patent disputes, which do not involve the agency's regulations,
are appropriate under these circumstances. Therefore, the agency has deleted the provision in its entirety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
62. Proposed &sect;314.95(f) would presume a notice of certification of invalidity or noninfringement to be complete
and sufficient if the ANDA applicant complied with the regulatory requirements under &sect;314.95(a) through (e)
and would start the 45-day clock for filing a patent infringement suit on the date following receipt of the notice.
One comment challenged the presumption that a notice is complete and sufficient to permit the statutory 45-day period
to begin. The comment would revise the rule to require applicants to file a complete copy of the certification and notice
of service with FDA and delay the start of the 45-day period if any dispute over the certification's sufficiency arose.
A second comment argued that an approved application holder who is also an exclusive patent licensee might have different
interests than the patent owner. The comment would revise the rule to require notice to both the patent owner and to
the licensee or approved application holder. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to FDA's presumption that a notice is complete and sufficient to begin the 45-day period, &sect;314.95(c),
as amended, paraphrases the statutory language concerning notices and does not attempt to establish more detailed
requirements for ``sufficiency'' of a notice. FDA has revised &sect;314.95(f) to state that it will begin the 45-day
period on the first day after the documented date of receipt by the person(s) receiving the notice. FDA will be able
to determine this date because &sect;314.95(e) requires applicants to submit documentation of receipt of notice.
FDA may, if the applicant amends its ANDA with a written statement that a later date should be used, count from the later
date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA also agrees that an exclusive patent licensee's interests may differ from those of the patent owner. Therefore,
FDA has revised &sect;&sect;314.52(f) and 314.95(f) to start the 45-day period on the day following the date of receipt
of the notice by the patent owner or its representative and by the approved application holder.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
63. The agency, on its own initiative, is revising &sect;314.101(e) to add a new paragraph stating that the agency
will refuse to file a 505(b)(2) application or receive an ANDA if the drug product that is the subject of the 505(b)(2)
application or ANDA is protected by a 5-year exclusivity period under section 505(c)(3)(D)(ii) and (j)(4)(D)(ii)
of the act. This amendment is consistent with the statutory language and &sect;314.108(b)(2).

I. Section 314.107_Effective Date of Approval of a 505(b)(2) Application or Abbreviated New Drug Application Under
Section 505(j) of the Act) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;314.107 was intended to codify the requirements under section 505(c)(3) and (j)(4) of the act regarding
the effective dates of approval for a 505(b)(2) application or an ANDA. For example, if the 505(b)(2) applicant or
ANDA applicant certified that there are no relevant patents, that patent information has not been submitted, that
the patent has expired, or that the patent is invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed, and the patent owner has not
brought suit for patent infringement, proposed &sect;314.107(b)(1) would treat the date FDA issues an approval
letter as the effective date of approval. If the 505(b)(2) applicant or ANDA applicant certified that the patent would
expire on a specific date, proposed &sect;314.107(b)(2) would treat that specific date as the effective date of approval.
Proposed &sect;314.107(b)(3) described several situations in which the effective date of approval could vary,
depending upon the disposition of patent litigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;314.107 also implemented the ``180-day exclusivity period'' described in section 505(j)(4)(B)(iv)
of the act. In brief, section 505(j)(4)(B)(iv) of the act states that if an ANDA contains a paragraph IV patent certification
(declaring the patent to be invalid or not infringed) and the ANDA is for a drug for which a previous ANDA containing
a paragraph IV patent certification has been submitted, approval of the subsequently submitted ANDA will be made
effective 180 days after the date FDA receives from the previous ANDA applicant notice of the first commercial marketing
of the drug or the date a court holds the patent that is the subject of the patent certification to be invalid or not infringed,
whichever date is earlier (see section 505(j)(4)(B)(iv) of the act). Proposed &sect;314.107(c) provided that an
applicant must be the first ANDA applicant to submit a substantially complete application with a paragraph IV certification
and must have been sued for patent infringement in order to qualify for 180-day exclusivity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
64. One comment asked FDA to permit any person to contact FDA informally to determine whether the listed patent information
was correct and later petition the agency to correct any errors. As proposed, &sect;314.107 did not provide for inquiries
concerning patent information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 314.53(f) and 314.94(a)(12)(vii) describe the procedures that an applicant can use to question the validity
of patent information. In brief, if an applicant disputes the accuracy or relevance of patent information, it should
first notify FDA in writing and state the reasons for the disagreement. FDA will then request that the relevant NDA
holder confirm the validity of the patent information, but will not change the patent information itself unless the
NDA holder withdraws or amends the patent information. The agency believes that these procedures for determining
the validity of patent information are sufficient, and, therefore, declines to adopt the change suggested by the
comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
65. FDA, on its own initiative, has amended &sect;314.107(b)(1) to state that an approval will become effective on
the date FDA issues an approval letter except as provided under paragraphs (b)(3), pertaining to approvals resulting
from the disposition of patent litigation; (b)(4), pertaining to approvals where an applicant has submitted multiple
certifications; and (c), regarding subsequent ANDA submissions. These changes are to clarify that there are other
situations that may make an approval effective. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
66. Two comments would revise proposed &sect;314.107(b)(1)(iv) regarding a certification that a patent is ``invalid
or will not be infringed.'' The comments would have this certification state that the patent is ``invalid and will
not be infringed.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA declines to adopt the suggested language. The provision simply paraphrases the statutory language for a paragraph
IV certification (see section 505(j)(2)(A)(vii)(IV) of the act). The agency has, however, amended the provision
to account for a certification that a patent is unenforceable and, as stated earlier, removed the language regarding
consent from the patent holder. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
67. One comment asked FDA to amend proposed &sect;314.107(b)(1)(iv)(B)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) to require NDA holders to have a role in or consent to licensing agreements between patent owners and ANDA applicants.
The proposed rule would consider the effective date of approval for a 505(b)(2) application or an ANDA to be the date
FDA issues an approval letter if, among other things, the drug product is covered by a patent licensing agreement and
the 505(b)(2) application or ANDA contains a statement that the applicant has been granted a patent license and a statement
from the patent owner that it has a licensing agreement with the applicant for the proposed drug product and that the
patent owner consents to an immediate effective date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated elsewhere in this final rule, FDA believes that the negotiations surrounding licensing agreements and
the parties entering into such agreements are outside the scope of this rule. Additionally, as stated in the response
to comment 43 above, the agency has deleted the provisions in &sect;314.107(b)(1)(iv) relating to consent by a patent
owner to an immediate effective date of approval for a licensee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
68. The agency, on its own initiative, has made minor grammatical changes and other revisions to &sect;314.107 (b)(2)
and (b)(3). These revisions replace ``Upon patent expiration'' with ``Patent Expiration'' and ``Upon disposition
of patent litigation'' with ``Disposition of patent litigation.'' Additionally, the changes specify that the patent
owner must receive the notice of certification and clarify, in &sect;314.107(b)(3)(i)(B), the effective date of
approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
69. Proposed &sect;314.107(b)(3) described the effective date of approval of a 505(b)(2) application or ANDA upon
disposition of patent litigation. Under proposed &sect;314.107(b)(3)(i)(A), if an applicant certified that the
relevant patent was invalid or would not be infringed, and the patent owner or its representative brought suit for
patent infringement, the effective date of approval for the 505(b)(2) application or ANDA would be 30 months after
the date of receipt of the notice of certification of patent invalidity or noninfringement by the patent owner or its
representative unless a court extended or reduced the 30-month period. Proposed &sect;314.107(b)(3)(i)(B) described
the effective date of approval of a 505(b)(2) application or an ANDA upon disposition of patent litigation when the
patented drug product also qualified for 5 years of market exclusivity. Proposed &sect;314.107(b)(3)(ii) through
(b)(3)(iv) represented additional modifications to the effective date of approval due to court decisions or orders.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment concerned the proposed language in &sect;314.107(b)(3)(i) regarding the 30-month period. The comment
would amend this provision to shorten or lengthen the 30-month period pursuant to a court order.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The suggested change is unnecessary because &sect;314.107(b)(3)(i) through (b)(3)(iv) explains how the 30-month
period may be changed due to court decisions or orders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency also emphasizes that disposition of patent litigation will not result in automatic approval of a pending
application. FDA notes that section 505(c)(3)(C) and (j)(4)(B)(iii) of the act describe when approval of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
505(b)(2) application or an ANDA shall be made effective if an applicant submitting a 505(b)(2) application or ANDA
has made a paragraph IV certification and has or has not been sued for patent infringement. For example, if the applicant
made a paragraph IV certification, was sued for patent infringement, and the court hearing the patent infringement
suit decided that the patent was either invalid or not infringed, section 505(c)(3)(C)(i) and (j)(4)(B)(iii)(I)
of the act state, respectively, that approval of the 505(b)(2) application or ANDA may ``be made effective on the date
of the court decision.'' However, the agency interprets these provisions of the act as requiring, as a preliminary
matter, final agency approval of the application in order for any approval to be made effective. Thus, an applicant
with a tentative approval may not begin marketing its drug product until it has received an approval letter from the
agency because a tentative approval letter does not constitute a final ``approval'' of the application. In such cases,
the agency will examine the application to determine whether there have been any changes in the conditions under which
the application was tentatively approved. The tentative approval would become final and, therefore, effective
only when the agency sends an approval letter to the applicant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, an applicant that has not yet received a tentative approval letter may not begin marketing its drug product
in the event that a court reaches a decision in any related patent infringement litigation because there is no final
``approval'' by FDA that could be made ``effective'' within section 505(c)(3)(C)(i) or (j)(4)(B)(iii) of the act.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other provisions of the act support this interpretation of section 505(c)(3)(C)(i) and 505(j)(4)(B)(iii) of the
act as they relate to the expiration of the 30-month period or the date of the court decision. For example, section 505(j)(3)
of the act states that the agency shall approve an ANDA unless certain circumstances are found to exist. Section 505(j)(3)((A)
of the act prevents the agency from approving an ANDA if the agency finds that ``the methods used in, or the facilities
and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, and packing of the drug are inadequate to assure and preserve
its identity, strength, quality, and purity.'' Consequently, until FDA assesses the available information, often
from an additional current good manufacturing practices inspection, it cannot determine whether the applicant's
methods and controls used for the manufacture, processing, and packing of the drug are adequate to assure and preserve
the drug's identity, strength, quality, and purity and therefore, under section 505(j)(3) of the act, whether the
ANDA should be approved. Thus, unless FDA has formally approved an ANDA under section 505(j)(3) of the act, there is
no ``approval'' that could be made effective under section 505(j)(4)(B) of the act upon resolution of the patent litigation.
(Section 505(d) of the act establishes an analogous approval requirement for 505(b)(2) applications.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The legislative history provides additional support for FDA's interpretation. In describing the provisions regarding
effective dates of approval and court decisions, the House Report states:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The Committee wishes to emphasize that the court 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
may not order an ANDA approved
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 under this provision. These are times when approval of an ANDA may be made effective 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
if the FDA has approved the ANDA.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See H. Rept. 857, 98th Cong., 2d sess., Part 1, 27&hyph;28 (1984) (emphasis added). The same concept is applicable
to 505(b)(2) applications (see id. at 34). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interpretation of section 505(j)(4)(B) of the act reflects current FDA practice and revises the agency's previous
policy that was stated in the preamble to the proposed rule (see 54 FR 28872 at 28894). It also clarifies the agency's
position on delayed effective dates of approvals as expressed in the preamble to the final rule on ANDA content and
format that was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on April 28, 1992 (57 FR 17950 at 17956). Consequently, FDA, on its own initiative, has amended &sect;314.107(b)(3)
to clarify when approval of an application may become effective and by adding a new paragraph (b)(3)(v) to state that,
in order for an approval to become effective under paragraph (b)(3), the applicant must first receive a final approval
letter from the agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
70. One comment would restrict proposed &sect;314.107(b)(3)(ii) to district court orders. The comment would revise
the rule to state: ``If before the expiration of the 30-month period, or 71/2 years where applicable, the district
court decides such patent is invalid or not infringed, the approval will be made effective on the date of the district
court order or judgment.'' The comment would also replace the words ``a final order'' in proposed &sect;314.107(b)(3)(iii)
and (b)(3)(iv) with ``an order or judgment.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA declines to limit the rule to district court orders. As stated in the preamble to the proposed rule, FDA interprets
the requirement of a ``court decision'' to mean ``a final decision of a court from which no appeal can or has been taken''
(see 54 FR 28872 at 28895). Beginning the 180-day exclusivity period before the resolution of the appeals process
would render the exclusivity valueless to a prudent applicant who delayed marketing until the issues were resolved
on appeal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has, however, revised &sect;314.107(b)(3)(iii) and (b)(3)(iv) to refer to an ``order or judgment'' because
both terms are sometimes used to refer to actions that terminate an action or decide a matter in litigation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
71. Proposed &sect;314.107(b)(4) concerned applicants who made multiple patent certifications. In essence, the
proposed provision would consider the approval of a 505(b)(2) application or an ANDA to be effective on the last applicable
date. One comment would amend proposed &sect;314.107(b)(4) by adding a new sentence stating: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
If the applicant has submitted certifications under &sect;314.50(i) or &sect;314.94(a)(12) and has submitted
notice to the owner of the patent pursuant to &sect;314.95, and FDA subsequently receives a stipulation or order by
the district court notifying it that the applicant has amended its answer to add new arguments, not included in that
notice, in any ensuing suit for patent infringement, the date of approval will be calculated based on a 30-month period
starting at the date of receipt by FDA of each such stipulation or order, and the approval will become effective on the
last applicable date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternatively, the comment suggested that an ANDA applicant who amended its answer to a patent infringement suit
to include arguments that were not in the notice to the patent owner under &sect;314.95 would be considered to have
been uncooperative in expediting the lawsuit. The comment explained that these revisions would prevent generic
drug companies from amending their answers during patent infringement litigation to delay completion of a trial
and also delay the start of the 30-month period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA declines to adopt the comment's suggestion. As stated above, FDA has revised the notice requirements in &sect;&sect;314.52(c)
and 314.95(c) to parallel the statutory language rather than specify notice requirements. The agency has neither
the resources nor the expertise to engage in patent disputes or questions regarding sufficiency of notice. The statute
leaves the issue of extending the 30-month period (based on a lack of cooperation between the parties in patent litigation)
to the discretion of the trial court. The agency believes that the trial court should make determinations of cooperation
on a case-by-case basis. Accordingly, the agency declines to amend the rule to consider an applicant to be uncooperative
and to extend the 30-month period if the applicant amends an answer to a complaint in patent litigation to include an
argument not reflected in the notice to the patent holder. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
72. FDA received several comments on proposed &sect;314.107(c) and the 180-day exclusivity period against subsequent
ANDA's. As proposed, &sect;314.107(c) would provide 180-day exclusivity to the first ANDA applicant that made a
paragraph IV patent certification (that the patent was invalid or not infringed) and was sued for patent infringement.
Seven comments said the language requiring an ANDA applicant to have been sued in order for the 180-day exclusivity
period to become effective was contrary to the statute and to a judicial ruling in the U.S. District Court for the District
of Columbia. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 505(j)(4)(B)(iv) of the act can be applied straightforwardly only when an applicant who seeks the 180-day
period of exclusive marketing has been involved in a patent infringement lawsuit. To apply the section where there
has been no lawsuit would require that the agency ignore the textual relationship between section 505(j)(4)(B)(iii)
and (j)(4)(B)(iv) of the act and assume that Congress intended, contrary to the goals it stated in the legislative
history, to create an incentive for delay in generic competition, without any countervailing benefit to society.
Moreover, it would provide a windfall to an applicant who has not devoted the considerable time and money necessary
for patent litigation. Thus, consistent with the agency's longstanding interpretation of the act, &sect;314.107(c)
applies only when the first applicant has been sued. Although, as the comments state, one Federal district court reached
a contrary conclusion, the agency appealed that decision and, on appeal, the decision was vacated as moot (

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has, however, revised &sect;314.107(c) to clarify other issues, such as the start and end of the 180-day exclusivity
period, and to make minor editorial changes.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
73. One comment suggested revising proposed &sect;314.107(c) to state that the 180-day exclusivity period does
not apply to delay the effective date of approval of licensees to the NDA holder. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated above, FDA does not believe that an ANDA applicant who has made a paragraph IV certification and obtained
a patent license should be able to circumvent a 180-day exclusivity period. Consequently, the agency declines to
amend the provision as requested by the comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
74. Two comments would revise proposed &sect;314.107(c) to extend the 45-day period in which patent owners have to
file suit against an ANDA applicant. The proposal referred to the statutory 45-day period in which a patent owner would
have to file suit against an ANDA applicant. The comments would extend the 45-day period upon request or when the ANDA
applicant and the patent owner agree to an extension. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA declines to accept the comments' suggestion. The 45-day period for filing a lawsuit against an ANDA applicant
is fully consistent with section 505(j)(4)(B)(iii) of the act, and the agency finds that there are sound policy reasons
that outweigh extensions of the 45-day period. For example, if an ANDA applicant has provided notice to a patent owner
stating that the ANDA applicant believes that the patent is invalid or would not be infringed (a paragraph IV certification),
the patent owner may elect to bring suit against the ANDA applicant for patent infringement. If the suit is brought
within 45 days from the date the ANDA applicant provided the notice, section 505(j)(4)(B)(iii) of the act precludes
the agency from granting a final approval of the ANDA. If suit is not brought within 45 days, FDA could grant a final approval
of the ANDA upon expiration of this time period, assuming that the ANDA met all applicable requirements for approval.
Thus, amending the rule to provide the patent owner an extension to file suit beyond the 45-day period would not prevent
the agency from approving ANDA's during the extension (because the statutory restriction against making an approval
effective would no longer apply), even if the patent owner later decided to bring suit against the ANDA applicant and
prevailed in that lawsuit. Such a result would waste agency and industry resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA also notes that, in situations where an ANDA applicant has amended its notification to the patent owner and approved
NDA holder to make it more complete, the agency may, under &sect;314.95(f), consider the 45-day period to begin on
the day after the date of receipt of the amended notification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
75. One comment would revise proposed &sect;314.107(c) to begin the 180-day exclusivity period ``on the first day
that a court would allow non-infringing marketing (unless that decision were stayed)'' or ``30 months from receipt
of notice.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency declines to revise the rule as suggested. The rule, which paraphrases the statutory language at section
505(j)(4)(B)(iv) of the act, better reflects the plain meaning of the act. Revising the rule as requested by the comment
would begin the 180-day exclusivity period at the end of the 30-month period without regard to whether the applicant
had commenced marketing on that date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
76. Proposed &sect;314.107(c)(1)(i) would provide 180-day exclusivity to the first ANDA applicant to submit a complete
ANDA with a paragraph IV patent certification and ``to be sued within 45 days of the patent owner's receipt of notice.''
One comment said the rule, as drafted, created an incentive for frivolous claims of patent invalidity or noninfringement
because it would give ANDA applicants exclusivity even if the applicant was unsuccessful in defending against the
patent owner's lawsuit. The comment would replace the phrase ``to be sued within 45 days'' with ``and to successfully
defend a suit brought within 45 days.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA agrees and has amended &sect;314.107(c) accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
77. FDA received several comments regarding proposed &sect;314.107(c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii). These provisions
concerned the start of the 180-day exclusivity period. Proposed &sect;314.107(c)(1)(i) would begin the 180-day
exclusivity period on the date of the first commercial marketing of the drug product by the first ANDA applicant who
submitted a substantially complete ANDA containing a certification that the patent was invalid or not infringed
and who was sued for patent infringement within 45 days after providing notice to the patent owner. Alternatively,
proposed &sect;314.107(c)(1)(ii) would begin the 180-day exclusivity period on the ``date a decision of the court
holding the relevant patent invalid or not infringed'' if that date was earlier than the date of the first commercial
marketing. One comment would revise proposed &sect;314.107(c)(1)(ii) to include a cross-reference to the language
in &sect;314.107(b)(3) on patent litigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA declines to adopt the suggested revision. The agency believes that the meaning of &sect;314.107(c)(1)(ii) is
sufficiently clear so that the court referred to in &sect;314.107(c)(1)(ii) is the court deciding the patent infringement
suit. However, for reasons stated elsewhere in this document, the agency has amended this provision to include a reference
to unenforceable patents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
78. One comment would amend &sect;314.107(c), (c)(1)(i), and (c)(1)(ii) to permit an ANDA applicant to decide whether
to start the 180-day exclusivity period on the date it notifies the agency that the applicant has begun commercial
marketing of the drug product or to wait to see whether the court decision is appealed. If an appeal did result, the comment
would permit the ANDA applicant to have the 180-day period begin when a court issues a decision on the appeal.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA declines to amend the provision as suggested by the comment. The provision is consistent with section 505(j)(4)(B)(iv)
of the act by beginning the 180-day period on the date the first ANDA applicant has notified the agency that it has begun
commercial marketing of the drug product or the date of a court decision holding the patent to be invalid or not infringed,
``whichever is earlier'' (see section 505(j)(4)(B)(iv) of the act).) Allowing an applicant to begin marketing before
the commencement of the 180-day exclusivity period would, in effect, extend the exclusivity period in a manner that
is inconsistent with the plain meaning of the act. FDA also notes that the court decision must be a final decision from
which no appeal can be or has been taken (see 54 FR 28872 at 28895). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
79. FDA received four comments regarding ``substantially complete'' applications under proposed &sect;314.107(c)(2).
Proposed &sect;314.107(c)(2) would consider an ANDA to have been ``previously submitted'' with respect to another
application for the same listed drug ``if the date on which the first application was both substantially complete
and contained a certification that the patent was invalid or not infringed is earlier than the date on which the second
application was both substantially complete and contained the same certification.'' The proposal also stated that
a ``substantially complete'' application ``must contain the results of any required bioequivalence studies, or,
if applicable, a request for a waiver of such studies.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment asked FDA to provide information as to which ANDA was the first ``substantially complete'' ANDA. The comment
suggested that disclosing such information did not present any confidentiality problems because the ANDA applicant
would have revealed the existence of the ANDA when it provided notice of certification of invalidity or noninfringement
of the patent to the patent owner and NDA holder. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA agrees, in part, with the comment. Disclosing whether an ANDA had been received for a specific listed drug would
enable manufacturers to decide whether to develop a generic version of that drug and perhaps conserve the manufacturer's
resources. Such knowledge could, in turn, effectively reduce the number of applications for the same product and
thus also conserve agency resources. The agency, therefore, will disclose whether an ANDA has been received for a
particular drug, but, in order to preserve the confidentiality of the applicant, will not disclose when the application
had been received or the applicant's identity. Potential applicants who wish to inquire whether an ANDA for a specific
drug has been received can contact the Regulatory Support Branch (HFD&hyph;615), Food and Drug Administration,
7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855, 301&hyph;594&hyph;0315. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
80. Two comments disagreed with the language regarding ``substantially complete'' applications. One comment said
FDA should only determine whether an ANDA contains a bioequivalence test or waiver request and not focus on the results
of any required bioequivalence studies. The second comment suggested that a ``substantially complete'' ANDA be
one that contained a paragraph IV patent certification and a bioequivalence study that is ultimately approved. The
comment said this change would deter ANDA applicants from submitting ``superficial'' bioequivalence tests. The
comment also suggested that the agency establish criteria as to whether changes to an ANDA were so substantial that
the ANDA could no longer be considered as the first to be filed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since publication of the proposed rule, FDA has clarified its policies regarding the submission of incomplete ANDA's.
Under the earlier policy, ANDA applicants could submit ANDA's with bioequivalence study protocols and could provide
bioequivalence study data at a later date. This policy resulted in a significant and unwarranted expenditure of resources
in reviewing applications that had little potential for approval. Thus, in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of April 28, 1992, FDA announced that it would no longer accept an ANDA that does not contain complete bioequivalence
study data if such data are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required for approval (see 57 FR 17950 at 17959). A ``substantially complete'' application, therefore, should have
a complete bioequivalence study, or other information to show bioequivalence that could support approval of the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application. FDA will examine the bioequivalence information upon submission and, if the agency determines that
the bioequivalence information is facially insufficient to support a finding of bioequivalence, the agency will
not review the application under &sect;314.101(d). A decision by the agency after receipt of an application that
the bioequivalence information is inadequate for approval does not necessarily mean that the application was not
substantially complete at the time of submission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA also declines to establish criteria to establish whether changes to an ANDA were so substantial that it could not
be considered to have been filed. While certain changes in an ANDA (e.g., a change in the listed drug) would amount to
a new filing for purposes of &sect;314.107(c)(2), other changes (e.g., minor labeling changes) would not. The agency
believes a case-by-case approach is preferable because many products and manufacturers may be unique. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
81. The agency, on its own initiative, has revised the provisions in &sect;314.107 (c)(2) and (c)(3) to clarify their
intent. These provisions address the issues of the ``applicant submitting the first application'' for exclusivity
purposes, what constitutes a ``substantially complete'' application, and the effective dates of approval for subsequently
submitted applications if the first applicant is not ``actively pursuing'' approval. FDA has made similar editorial
changes at &sect;314.107(c)(4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
82. Four comments addressed proposed &sect;314.107(c)(3). The proposed provision would make an ANDA that had been
received after FDA had already received an ANDA for the same drug immediately effective if the agency concluded that
the first ANDA applicant ``is not actively pursuing approval of its abbreviated application.'' Three comments asked
FDA to define the phrase ``actively pursuing approval.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of this rule, the phrase ``actively pursuing approval'' is intended to encompass a drug sponsor's good
faith effort to pursue marketing approval in a timely manner. In determining whether a sponsor is actively pursuing
marketing approval, FDA will consider all relevant factors, such as the sponsor's compliance with regulations and
the timeliness of its responses to FDA's questions or application deficiencies during the review period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
83. One comment would revise proposed &sect;314.107(c)(3) to make a subsequently received ANDA immediately effective
upon a finding that the first applicant is not actively pursuing approval ``if [the subsequent application is] otherwise
eligible for an immediately effective approval.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency agrees and has amended the provision accordingly. This change will remind applicants that FDA will make
approval of a subsequent abbreviated application immediately effective if it satisfies all applicable requirements

84. FDA received five comments regarding the interpretation of ``the court'' and court judgments in proposed &sect;314.107(e)(1).
Proposed &sect;314.107(e)(1) stated that ``the court'' in &sect;314.107(b) and (c) referred to ``the court that
enters final judgment from which no appeal can be or has been taken.'' Three comments supported the proposal, but two
comments argued that FDA had misconstrued the 1984 amendments. One comment argued that the court finding a patent
to be invalid or not infringed should be ``the court of first instance'' or district court because a decision that a
patent was invalid or not infringed or a decision to issue an injunction would be done by a district court. Another comment
argued that interpreting ``the court'' to mean the court that enters final judgment ``effectively gives a patent
owner an additional extension of the patent *&blank;*&blank;* for the duration of the appeal'' and delay generic
competition. The comment would revise the rule to permit an ANDA applicant to market its drug product after it had prevailed
at the trial court level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA declines to amend &sect;314.107(e)(1) as suggested by the comments. To construe ``the court'' as a district court,
regardless of any appeal of the district court decision, would deny the benefits of exclusivity to a prudent applicant
that delayed marketing its product until resolution of an appeal by the patent holder (see 54 FR 28872 at 28894). Moreover,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if the patent holder appealed the district court decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and were able to obtain a stay or an injunction against the marketing of the applicant's product, the applicant could
lose the entire 180-day exclusivity period before the stay or injunction were lifted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given these considerations, FDA believes that any reference to ``the court'' must be the court that enters final judgment
from which no appeal can be or has been taken. (The reference to ``appeals'' does not include the certiorari process.
The likelihood of an appellate court decision being heard and overruled by the Supreme Court is too remote to warrant
delaying marketing and exclusivity pending resolution of a petition for writ of certiorari.) This interpretation
avoids potentially premature decisions on the effective date of ANDA approval and the loss of 180-day exclusivity.
FDA has, however, also revised &sect;314.107(e)(2) to clarify which court decisions will represent the ``final''
judgment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
85. One comment would revise proposed &sect;314.107(e)(2) to refer to a court order or judgment rather than simply
a court judgment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As amended, &sect;314.107(e)(2) refers to a court ``decision,'' which could be in the form of either an order or a judgment.
The agency has also made minor changes to &sect;314.107(e)(2) to clarify that the court decisions involve patent
issues and that a higher court can hold or affirm a lower court decision that a patent is invalid, unenforceable, or
not infringed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
86. A second comment would revise proposed &sect;314.107(e)(2) to require applicants to submit copies of a court
order or judgment to the Division of Generic Drugs or ``New Drug Evaluation Division (where applicable).'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA agrees with the comment, and has added &sect;314.107(e)(2)(iv) to require applicants to send a copy of a final
decision to the Office of Generic Drugs, or to the appropriate division in the Office of Drug Evaluation I or the Office
of Drug Evaluation II, whichever is applicable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
87. Proposed &sect;314.107(f) described how the 45-day period for filing a patent infringement suit would be determined.
In brief, under proposed &sect;314.107(f)(1), the 45-day period would begin on the day after the date the patent owner
or approved application holder, if an exclusive patent licensee, received a notice of certification of invalidity
or noninfringement of the patent. Proposed &sect;314.107(f)(2) would require the 505(b)(2) applicant or ANDA applicant
to notify FDA whether an action for patent infringement had been filed. Several comments objected to language in proposed
&sect;314.107(f) that would consider notice to or actions by exclusive licensees to be equivalent to notice to or
actions by a patent owner. The comments said that exclusive licensees do not always share the patent owner's interests.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA agrees and has revised the rule to remove language that would consider exclusive licensees to be equivalent to
patent owners.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
88. One comment objected to proposed &sect;314.107(f)(1) because it would start the 45-day period on the day after
the date the patent owner or the approved application holder, if an exclusive patent licensee, received notice of
invalidity or noninfringement of a patent. The comment argued that the 45-day period should begin on the day after
the date that the patent owner and the approved application holder received notice and, if these dates differed, the
latest date should mark the start of the 45-day period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency agrees with the comment and has revised &sect;314.107(f)(1) to begin the 45-day period on the day after
the date the patent owner and the approved application holder have received the applicant's notice of certification
of invalidity or noninfringement of a patent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
89. FDA received several comments on proposed &sect;314.107(f)(2). Absent a notice of an action for patent infringement,
the proposal would make the approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application effective immediately upon the expiration
of the 45-day period for filing a patent infringement suit or upon FDA's completion of the review and approval process,
whichever is later. The comments noted that the regulation would have ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicants notify FDA whether
a patent infringement suit had been filed and asked FDA to permit, by regulation, patent owners to notify FDA whether
it had brought suit. Alternatively, some comments would require the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant certify that it had
not been sued. The comments explained that these changes were necessary because ANDA and 505(b)(2) applicants would
have no interest in notifying FDA whether suit had been filed because, without such notice, they could immediately
secure effective approval of an application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has amended &sect;314.107(f)(2) to permit patent owners or their representatives to notify FDA whether
a patent infringement suit has been filed. The statute does not require applicants to certify that they have not been
sued, and the agency does not believe such a burden to be necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has also made minor revisions to &sect;314.107(f)(2) to place more emphasis on an applicant's obligation
to notify FDA immediately of the filing of any legal action within 45 days of receipt of a notice of certification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the agency has made a grammatical change in &sect;314.107(f)(2) to clarify that applicants must send
the notification to the Office of Generic Drugs or to the appropriate division in the Center for Drug Evaluation and
Research reviewing the application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
90. One comment addressed the requirement in proposed &sect;314.107(f)(2) that a 505(b)(2) applicant or ANDA applicant
notify FDA whether an action for patent infringement had been filed ``before the expiration of the 45-day time period
or the completion of the agency's review of the application, whichever occurs later.'' The comment argued that a patent
owner had 45 days to file a lawsuit after receiving a notice of certification of invalidity or noninfringement of a
patent and, therefore, a party should have an additional time period beyond the 45-day period for filing an action
for patent infringement for notifying the agency whether an action had been filed. The comment would revise the rule
to give a party an additional 15 days beyond the 45-day period to notify FDA whether an action for patent infringement
had been filed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency declines to revise the rule as suggested. FDA believes it is important to learn immediately if an action
for patent infringement is filed before the completion of the 45-day period to avoid an erroneous approval with an
immediate effective date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has, therefore, amended &sect;314.107(f)(2) to require applicants to notify FDA immediately whether any legal
action has been filed. The agency has also amended this subsection to clarify the identity of the ``applicant.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
91. FDA has, on its own initiative, clarified its notification requirements in &sect;314.107(f)(2)(iii). As proposed,
&sect;314.107(f)(2)(iii) would have required parties to identify a drug by its established name, but would not have
expressly required any identification of the drug if no established name existed. The agency has amended this provision
to require identification of the drug product by its established name or, if no established name exists, its active
ingredient(s). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
92. One comment asked FDA to publish information regarding the status and progress of patent infringement suits so
other ANDA applicants could decide whether to intervene in the suit ``and ask that the 30-month period be shortened
or lengthened in the event that it feels that one or both of the litigants are not reasonably cooperating in expediting
the action.'' Alternatively, the comment asked FDA to permit any interested party to petition the agency ``to remove
an ANDA from exclusivity considerations if it has not proceeded with due diligence_either in prosecution of its ANDA
or defense of an infringement suit.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA believes that ANDA applicants are capable of monitoring the progress of patent litigation without imposing the
additional burden of acquiring and publishing information on patent litigation on FDA. The agency, therefore, declines
to adopt the comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA also declines to amend the rule to permit third parties to petition the agency to deny exclusivity to an ANDA due
to the ANDA applicant's actions during litigation. Under the statute, the reduction or enlargement of the 30-month
period is left to the trial court's discretion. Intervention by the agency is unwarranted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
93. One comment suggested replacing the words, ``action to defend,'' in proposed &sect;314.107(f)(2)(iv) with
the words, ``action for patent infringement.'' The comment said that ``action to defend'' was not a term of art. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA agrees and has adopted the comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
94. FDA, on its own initiative, has modified the language regarding waivers in &sect;314.107(f)(3). The change is
intended to clarify that the patent owner does not object to FDA's approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application with
an immediate effective date and to account for those situations where the ANDA applicant or 505(b)(2) applicant and
the patent owner have agreed to extend the 45-day period.

J. Section 314.108_New Drug Product Exclusivity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;314.108 was intended to implement the new drug exclusivity provisions under section 505(c)(3)(D)
and (j)(4)(D) of the act. This section of the act provides specific time periods, known as new drug product exclusivity
or market exclusivity, during which the effective date of approval for a 505(b)(2) application or an ANDA must be delayed
or, in some cases, a 505(b)(2) application or an ANDA cannot be submitted. For example, section 505(c)(3)(D)(i) and
(j)(4)(D)(i) of the act grant a 10-year period of exclusivity to new chemical entities that were approved during January
1, 1982, to September 24, 1984. Section 505(c)(3)(D)(ii) and (j)(4)(D)(ii) of the act grant a 5-year period of exclusivity
to new chemical entities approved after September 24, 1984. These sections of the act expressly state that no 505(b)(2)
application or ANDA may be submitted during the exclusivity period except that such applications may be submitted
after 4 years if they contain a certification of patent invalidity or noninfringement. Section 505(c)(3)(D)(iii),
(c)(3)(D)(iv), (j)(4)(D)(iii), and (j)(4)(D)(iv) of the act grant a 3-year period of exclusivity to an application
or supplemental application that is approved after September 24, 1984, and contains ``reports of new clinical investigations
(other than bioavailability studies) essential to the approval'' of the application or supplemental application
and ``conducted or sponsored by'' the person submitting the application or supplemental application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 505(c)(3)(D)(v) and (j)(4)(D)(v) of the act granted a 2-year period of exclusivity to drugs that are not chemical
entities or for certain changes to already approved products that were approved during January 1, 1982, to September
24, 1984. FDA did not propose any regulations for this 2-year period because it expired on September 24, 1986. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The exclusivity provisions of the act do not provide any protection from the marketing of a generic version of the same
drug product if the generic version is the subject of a full NDA submitted under section 505(b)(1) of the act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
95. Proposed &sect;314.108(b)(4) would provide 3 years of exclusivity to an application that was submitted under
section 505(b) of the act, was approved after September 24, 1984, was for a drug product containing an active moiety
that had been previously approved in another application under section 505(b) of the act, and contained reports of
new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability studies) conducted or sponsored by the applicant that
were essential to approval of the application. Proposed &sect;314.108(b)(5) would provide 3 years of exclusivity
to a supplemental application that was approved after September 24, 1984, and contained reports of new clinical investigations
(other than bioavailability studies) conducted or sponsored by the applicant that were essential to approval of
the application.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several comments addressed the scope of new drug exclusivity. Two comments said FDA should grant exclusivity for
any change to an approved drug product or, alternatively, should grant exclusivity based on specific types of studies,
such as studies intended to reduce drug dosing or drug efficacy study implementation (DESI) upgrade studies. One
comment disagreed with the preamble to the proposed rule, which stated, ``FDA expects that only those changes in an
approved drug product that affect its active ingredient(s), strength, dosage form, route of administration or conditions
of use would be granted exclusivity'' (54 FR 28872 at 28899). Two comments asked FDA to clarify whether a clinical investigation
establishing new risks could be eligible for exclusivity. The preamble to the proposed rule had indicated that such
studies would not qualify for exclusivity because ``protection of the public health demands that all products' labeling
contain all relevant warnings'' (see 54 FR 28872 at 28899). One comment said FDA should accept an applicant's claim
of exclusivity alone. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two other comments sought to limit exclusivity or clarify its scope. One comment argued that the rule was too broad,
would confer ``an unearned windfall,'' and stifle generic competition. The comment explained that some variations,
such as reductions in dosage, require little effort but would nevertheless qualify for exclusivity. The comment
suggested that the rule define what types of changes would qualify for exclusivity. The second comment agreed with
the preamble that DESI upgrades should not qualify for exclusivity but asked FDA to create a procedure whereby parties
could contact FDA to determine whether exclusivity information was accurate. The comment said this would enable
third parties to decide whether to challenge decisions to grant or deny exclusivity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA disagrees with those comments that would grant exclusivity for any change to an approved drug product or accept,
without question, an applicant's claim that it is entitled to exclusivity. Under the statute and this final rule,
certain drugs or changes to drugs can receive 3 years of exclusivity if the application or supplement to an application
``contains reports of new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability studies) essential to the approval
*&blank;*&blank;*'' (see section 505(j)(4)(D)(iii) and (j)(4)(D)(iv) of the act). The phrase ``essential to the
approval'' suggests that the clinical investigations that warrant exclusivity must be vital to the application
or supplement. As stated in the preamble to the proposed rule, ``to qualify for exclusivity, there must not be published
reports of studies other than those conducted or sponsored by the applicant, or other information available to the
agency sufficient for FDA to conclude that a proposed drug product or change to an already approved drug product is
safe and effective'' (see 54 FR 28872 at 28900). For example, the agency would not consider studies to support a switch
from prescription to over-the-counter (OTC) status to be ``essential to approval'' if the agency already had sufficient
information to conclude that the OTC product would be safe and effective. (In OTC switch situations, FDA encourages
applicants to consult FDA to determine whether clinical investigations or any other actions are necessary to permit
FDA to approve a switch in a product's status.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA declines to define in the regulation the kinds of supplemental applications that, if supported by clinical investigations,
would warrant 3-year exclusivity. Although the preamble to the proposed rule identified certain types of changes
in a product that would normally warrant exclusivity (changes in active ingredient, strength, dosage form, route
of administration, or conditions of use), the agency did not intend to suggest that other types of changes would not
qualify. For example, changes in dosing regimen have resulted in grants of 3-year exclusivity. Changes that would
not warrant exclusivity are, as discussed in the preamble to the proposed rule, changes in labeling that involve warnings
or other similar risk information that must be included in the labeling of generic competitors. Applicants obtaining
approval for such changes in labeling would, in any event, have no valid interest in precluding such information from
the labeling of other products. Furthermore, FDA does not consider a study to be ``essential to approval'' simply
because the applicant conducted it and submitted the study for agency review (Ref. 1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA's interpretation is supported by statements that were made during the congressional debates surrounding the
3-year exclusivity provisions. Senator Orrin Hatch described the 3-year exclusivity provisions upon approval
of certain supplemental applications as protecting ``some changes in strength, indications, and so forth, which
require considerable time and expense in FDA required clinical testing'' (130 Congressional Record S10505, August
10, 1984) (statement of Senator Hatch)). Representative Henry Waxman said 3-year exclusivity was intended to ``encourage
drugmakers to obtain FDA approval for significant therapeutic uses of previously approved drugs'' (130 Congressional
Record H9114, (September 6, 1984)). Thus, an applicant is not entitled to 3-year exclusivity merely because it supplements
an approved application based in part on a clinical investigation or because it certifies to FDA that the clinical
investigation is essential to approval of the application or supplement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA also declines to create a new procedure whereby a party could contact FDA to determine whether exclusivity information
is accurate. Interested parties can obtain information on exclusivity decisions through the Freedom of Information
Act process (21 CFR part 20). Parties who wish to challenge an exclusivity decision can utilize the citizen petition
procedures (21 CFR 10.30).

96. One comment suggested that products whose labeling may not include certain therapeutic indications (due to exclusivity
or patent protection) be listed in the Orange Book as not being therapeutically equivalent to the innovator product.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

FDA addressed this comment in its response to a citizen petition submitted by the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association
(PMA). The response stated, in pertinent part:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In drafting the 1984 Amendments, the only mechanism that Congress provided for enforcing the exclusivity accorded
a new indication is the requirement that ANDA's and 505(b)(2) applications be given delayed effective approval for
the exclusive indication. During the period that ANDA's and 505(b)(2) applications may not be made effective, pioneers
thus have the exclusive right to promote and label their products for the exclusive indication. Nothing in the language
of the amended statute or its legislative history, however, suggests that Congress intended the granting of exclusivity
for a new indication to alter therapeutic equivalence ratings. Moreover, it would be inconsistent with the established
standards for making therapeutic equivalence determinations to rate two products as not therapeutically equivalent
simply because one is labeled with fewer than all the approved indications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA's standards for therapeutic equivalence determinations * * * have always been based upon scientific considerations
relevant to predicting the comparative pharmacological behavior of two products in or on the human body. There is
no scientific basis for concluding that differences in recommended indications are relevant to this prediction.
For example, the fact that a particular brand of drug is recommended in a medical journal article for an unlabeled use,
does not, from a scientific standpoint, render other brands of the same drug therapeutically or biologically inequivalent.
Similarly, the fact that a pioneer drug is labeled with a protected indication does not mean that generic copies of
the same drug are not therapeutically equivalent to the pioneer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In absence of any suggestion in the statute or legislative history that Congress intended FDA to alter the scientific
basis of therapeutic equivalence ratings to enforce exclusivity, FDA declines to consider non-scientific criteria,
i.e., the existence of exclusive indications, in making therapeutic equivalence decisions.

 (providing 10 years of exclusivity under section 505(j)(4)(D)(i) of the act for products offering the same therapeutic
moiety in different active ingredient forms if the salt or ester form was approved subsequent to the pure therapeutic
moiety form) was rejected by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Noting that such an interpretation
would award exclusivity to both an active moiety and a salt if the application containing the active moiety were submitted
first, but would award exclusivity only to the salt if the salt were submitted first, the court of appeals rejected
the interpretation as ``farfetched because it is not consistent with any legislative goal'' (see

 920 F.2d 984, 989). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the court of appeals appeared to agree with the agency's conclusion that exclusivity should be limited to
the first approved product containing the active moiety, the court found the agency's parsing of the operative statutory
phrase ``active ingredient (including any salt or ester of the active ingredient)'' to be linguistically impermissible
as set forth in the agency's administrative decision denying 10-year exclusivity to Abbott. Rather than interpret
the term ``active ingredient'' broadly to include the concept of active moiety, the agency interpreted the term narrowly
to refer to the form of the moiety in the product, but interpreted the parenthetical phrase ``(including any salt or
ester of the active ingredient)'' broadly to include all active ingredients that are different but contain the same
active moiety. Although the court noted that the agency had, subsequent to the administrative decision, voiced the
more linguistically permissible construction (interpreting the term ``active ingredient'' to refer to active
moiety), the court found that it could not consider this construction because it was not relied upon in the administrative
decision. The court thus remanded the case to the district court with instructions to remand the issue to the agency
for further consideration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The agency has concluded that the term ``active ingredient,'' as used in the phrase ``active ingredient (including
any salt or ester of the active ingredient),'' means active moiety. Thus, the agency declines to adopt the comments
suggesting removal of the definition of, and references to, ``active moiety'' from &sect;314.108.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA disagrees with the assertion that the definition of ``active moiety'' should not exclude chelates, clathrates,
and other noncovalent derivatives. As stated in the preamble to the proposed rule, exclusivity is intended to provide
incentives for innovation (see 54 FR 28872 at 28898 and 28899). The addition of a chelate, clathrate, or other noncovalent
derivative generally does not affect the active moiety of a drug product. The agency, therefore, does not believe
that providing exclusivity for chelates, clathrates, and other noncovalent derivatives of a previously approved
active moiety would be consistent with the statutory intent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
98. FDA received a number of comments regarding the term ``substantial support'' in the definition of ``conducted
or sponsored by the applicant'' in proposed &sect;314.108(a). The proposed rule stated, ``Ordinarily, substantial
support will mean providing 50 percent or more of the cost of conducting the study'' (see 54 FR 28872 at 28930). The comments
said the 50 percent figure was unrealistic, unnecessary, or unauthorized by law and argued that cost should not be
a controlling factor in determining new drug exclusivity. Other comments said the rule should permit firms to buy
studies because there is no basis to grant exclusivity to a firm that purchases an NDA and to deny exclusivity to a firm
that purchases a study. One comment asked how FDA would treat a publicly funded study. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 50-percent contribution requirement reflects a reasonable interpretation of section 505 (j)(4)(D)(iii) and
(j)(4)(D)(iv) of the act. A study can be conducted by or for only one applicant. Exclusivity based on less than 50-percent
funding would allow multiple parties to claim exclusivity against ANDA applicants as well as each other. Moreover,
the legislative history indicates that Congress created 3-year exclusivity to protect products whose development
required a significant time commitment and ``an investment of some magnitude'' (see 130 Congressional Record S10504
(August 10, 1984) (statement of Senator Hatch); 130 Congressional Record H9124&hyph;H9125 (September 6, 1984)
(statement of Representative Waxman)). Obviously, if a sponsor provided 50 percent or more funding to a study, its
investment represents a substantial portion of the study's funding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA acknowledges that there may be some rare circumstance in which less than 50-percent funding could constitute
``substantial support'' and merit exclusivity. FDA has, therefore, revised the rule to require: (1) A certified
statement from a Certified Public Accountant that the applicant provided 50 percent or more of the cost of conducting
the study; or (2) an explanation from the applicant why FDA should consider the applicant to have conducted or sponsored
the study if the applicant's financial contribution to the study is less than 50 percent if the applicant did not sponsor
the investigational new drug application. The agency has made a corresponding change to &sect;314.50(j)(4)(iii).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to studies that the applicant has purchased and publicly funded studies, FDA agrees that an applicant
who has purchased exclusive rights to a study should be able to obtain new drug exclusivity. FDA, therefore, has revised
the definition of ``conducted or sponsored by the applicant'' to state that the purchase of nonexclusive rights to
an investigation does not satisfy the definition. FDA emphasizes that the applicant must have exclusive rights to
the purchased study in order to be deemed to have sponsored a study. The purchase of nonexclusive rights by different
parties could result in multiple claims of exclusivity for the same study. For these reasons, FDA also believes that
most, if not all, publicly funded studies will not qualify for exclusivity. These studies are usually publicly available,
so FDA will not give one applicant exclusive rights based on a study that, by virtue of its funding, belongs to the general
public and is publicly available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
99. The agency, on its own initiative, has amended the definition of ``date of approval'' to note that the date of approval
``refers only to a final approval and not to a tentative approval that may become effective at a later date.'' This change
reflects FDA's position that drug products with delayed effective dates of approval are not listed drugs and that
an ``approval with a delayed effective date is tentative and does not become final until the effective date'' (see
57 FR 17950 at 17953). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
100. One comment said proposed &sect;314.108(a) failed to correspond to proposed &sect;314.50(j)(4)(i), which
states that &sect;314.108(a) defines ``new'' and ``clinical investigations.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;314.50(j)(4)(i) contained an error. The proposed rule does not contain separate definitions for
``new'' and ``clinical investigations''; it does, however, define ``new clinical investigations'' at &sect;314.108(a).
FDA has corrected &sect;314.50(j)(4)(i) accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
101. One comment objected to the last sentence in the definition of ``new clinical investigation.'' The comment claimed
that the definition would ``unnecessarily, and contrary to the Statute, ``expand and award an exclusivity for a previously
submitted study; and it unjustifiably distinguishes between safety and effectiveness.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the statute, 3-year exclusivity is awarded if the application or supplemental application contained reports
of new clinical investigations that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant and were essential to the approval
of the application or supplemental application (see section 505(j)(4)(D)(iii) and (j)(4)(D)(iv) of the act). The
legislative history indicates that 3-year exclusivity is for investigations requiring a considerable investment
of time and money and that are necessary for approval of important innovations (see 54 FR 28872 at 28899). Thus, FDA
interprets ``new clinical investigation'' as a clinical investigation whose data have not been relied upon by FDA
to demonstrate substantial evidence of effectiveness of a previously approved drug for any indication or safety
in a new patient population and do not duplicate the results of another investigation relied upon by FDA to demonstrate
a previously approved drug's effectiveness or safety in a new patient population. An applicant is not limited to recently
conducted clinical investigations; a clinical investigation that provides a ``new'' basis for drug approval can
qualify for exclusivity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
102. Two comments recommended revising the rule to address transfers of new drug exclusivity between an applicant
and all predecessors in interest, including licensors, assignors, joint venture partners, or other parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New drug exclusivity is not a property right, but is rather a statutory obligation on the agency. This statutory obligation
is based on data and information in an approved application. Although an applicant may purchase an application or
rights to data and information in an application (i.e., exclusive rights to a new clinical investigation), from which
exclusivity would flow, there is no property right to exclusivity itself that can be transferred separately and apart
from the application or data upon which exclusivity is based. The agency does, however, permit the submission or approval
of an ANDA when the holder of the exclusivity permits FDA to receive or approve the ANDA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA notes that joint venture partners differ from licensees, assignors, etc., because joint venture partners share
in developing a drug product. Consequently, FDA suggests that joint venture partners carefully consider how they
will seek approval of an application and define their rights and interests in the application to avoid questions regarding
applicability of the exclusivity provisions of the act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated above, FDA has revised the definition of the phrase, ``conducted or sponsored by the applicant,'' to construe
a party who has purchased exclusive rights to a study to have ``conducted or sponsored'' the study. This change will
enable a party who has acquired exclusive rights to a study to seek exclusivity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
103. Four comments asked FDA to create a mechanism that would determine whether a study was ``essential for approval''
either before an application would be submitted or before the study began. Proposed &sect;314.108(a) stated that
``essential to approval'' with regard to an investigation ``means that the application could not be approved by FDA
without that investigation, even with a delayed effective date.'' The proposal, however, did not discuss the procedure
by which FDA would determine a study to be ``essential to approval.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA declines to accept the comments. FDA cannot determine whether a study is essential for approval until the application
is approved. Research goals and objectives often change during clinical investigations. For example, the results
from a study designed to support a new indication could generate interest in a completely different indication. The
product ultimately approved may be a different product from that characterized in the original application. It is
also possible that newly available data in the public domain will obviate the need for the study prior to approval.
Thus, FDA will decide whether a study is essential for approval at the time of approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has, however, amended the definition of ``essential to approval'' to delete the reference to a delayed
effective date. This change is necessary because the agency no longer regards an application with a delayed effective
date as being approved. Instead, FDA considers such applications as being tentatively approved (see 57 FR 17950 at
17953). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
104. Proposed &sect;314.108(b)(2) would provide 5 years of exclusivity for a new chemical entity if a drug product
containing the new chemical entity was approved after September 24, 1984, in an application submitted under section
505(b) of the act. One comment said FDA should deny 5-year exclusivity to any section ``505(b)(2) application for
a new chemical entity that relies upon one or more investigations that are essential for approval of the application
but which were not conducted or sponsored by the applicant * * *.'' The comment explained that a 505(b)(2) applicant
could assemble literature demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of a drug product marketed before 1962 (when
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act was amended to require new drugs to be safe and effective for their intended
uses) or 1938 (when the Food and Drugs Act was amended to require new drugs to be safe for the conditions of their intended
use) and, under the rule, seek 5 years of new drug exclusivity. The comment said granting exclusivity to such drugs
would be inconsistent with statutory intent and the legislative history. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the statute, a drug product may qualify for 5 years of exclusivity if its active moiety has not been previously
approved in any other application (see section 505(c)(3)(D)(ii) and (j)(4)(D)(ii) of the act). For some drug products
marketed before 1938 or 1962, the active moiety will have been the subject of an approved application (under prior
versions of the act or as part of a combination product approved under the act), so the active moiety will be ineligible
for 5-year exclusivity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA also notes that the statute provides 5-year exclusivity for applications approved under section 505(b) of the
act and that such applications are submitted by persons who wish to introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate
commerce ``any new drug.'' (See section 505(a) and (c)(3)(D)(ii).) The term ``new drug'' is defined in section 201(p)
of the act (21 U.S.C. 321(p)). Drug products with active ingredients marketed before 1938 or 1962 may be ``new drugs,''
especially where there has been a change in the product's labeling, composition, or manufacturer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Products falling within the definition of a ``new drug'' must be approved under section 505(b) of the act and, as a result,
may qualify for 5-year exclusivity under the language of the act and consistent with legislative history. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
105. One comment said that FDA should provide 5 years of exclusivity for a single enantiomer of a previously approved
racemate. The comment asserted that FDA approval of a racemic drug mixture covers the mixture rather than the enantiomers
that compose the mixture. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency declines to revise the rule as requested by the comment. As stated in the preamble to the proposed rule, the
agency's position is that ``a single enantiomer of a previously approved racemate contains a previously approved
active moiety and is therefore not considered a new chemical entity'' (see 54 FR 28872 at 28898).

106. One comment asked FDA to interpret the phrase ``conditions of approval'' in proposed &sect;314.108(b)(4)(iv)
narrowly to limit exclusivity to studies conducted by the original applicant. Proposed &sect;314.108(b)(4) stated
that if an application: (i) Was submitted under section 505(b) of the act; (ii) was approved after September 24, 1984;
(iii) was for a drug product that contains an active moiety that has been previously approved in another application
under section 505(b) of the act; and (iv) contained reports of new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability
studies) conducted or sponsored by the applicant that were essential to approval of the application, the agency will
not make effective for a period of 3 years after the date of approval of the application the approval of a 505(b)(2) application,
or an ANDA for the conditions of approval of the original application, or an ANDA submitted pursuant to an approved
petition under section 505(j)(2)(C) of the act that relies on the information supporting the conditions of approval
of an original NDA. The comment said subsequent applicants who conduct their own studies to obtain approval should
not be subject to the original applicant's exclusivity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA believes that the comment misinterprets the scope of exclusivity. As stated in the preamble to the proposed rule
and the preamble to this final rule, market exclusivity does not provide any protection from the marketing of a generic
version of the same drug product if the generic version is the subject of a full NDA submitted under section 505(b)(1)
of the act (see 54 FR 28872 at 28896). As discussed earlier, the statute does not require that the original applicant
``conduct'' the study to obtain exclusivity. FDA interprets the act to allow for exclusivity where the applicant
has supported the study by providing more than 50 percent of the funding or by purchasing exclusive rights to the study.

IV. Analysis of Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has examined the impacts of this rule under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354).
Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and,
when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential
economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and equity). The
agency believes that this final rule is consistent with the regulatory philosophy and principles identified in the
Executive Order. In addition, the final rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined by the Executive Order
and so is not subject to review under the Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to analyze regulatory options that would minimize any significant
impact on small entities. Title I of Pub. L. 98&hyph;417 eliminated unnecessary regulatory barriers for generic
drug products and has resulted in generic competition on many important post-1962 drugs. Generic drug sales account
for a significant portion of total prescription drug sales, and many of these sales would not have occurred in the absence
of Pub. L. 98&hyph;417. This competition has saved consumers hundreds of millions of dollars per year, and FDA concludes
that this impact is directly attributable to the statute. This rule will not affect the pace or magnitude of this economic
impact. The rule simply clarifies and facilitates implementation of the act. Thus, FDA certifies that this rule will
not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, under the Regulatory
Flexibility Act, no further analysis is required.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(a)(8) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.

to FDA in the form of applications, notices, and certifications. FDA will use this information to determine whether
patent information for a drug product has been submitted and whether an applicant is seeking market exclusivity for
a particular drug product.

4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) of this section (``Paragraph IV Certification'') as to that patent and a statement that it has been granted a patent

After removal of a patent from the list. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a patent is removed from the list, any applicant with a pending application (including a tentatively approved application
with a delayed effective date) who has made a certification with respect to such patent shall amend its certification.
The applicant shall certify under paragraph (i)(1)(ii) of this section that no patents described in paragraph (i)(1)(i)
of this section claim the drug or, if other relevant patents claim the drug, shall amend the certification to refer
only to those relevant patents. In the amendment, the applicant shall state the reason for the change in certification
(that the patent is or has been removed from the list). A patent that is the subject of a lawsuit under &sect;314.107(c)
shall not be removed from the list until FDA determines either that no delay in effective dates of approval is required
under that section as a result of the lawsuit, that the patent has expired, or that any such period of delay in effective
dates of approval is ended. An applicant shall submit an amended certification as an amendment to a pending application.
Once an amendment for the change has been submitted, the application will no longer be considered to be one containing
a certification under paragraph (i)(1)(i)(A)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Other amendments. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(A) Except as provided in paragraphs (i)(4) and (i)(6)(iii)(B) of this section, an applicant shall amend a submitted
certification if, at any time before the effective date of the approval of the application, the applicant learns that
the submitted certification is no longer accurate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) An applicant is not required to amend a submitted certification when information on an otherwise applicable patent
is submitted after the effective date of approval for the 505(b)(2) application.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A statement that the applicant is claiming exclusivity.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) If the applicant claims exclusivity under &sect;314.108(b)(2), information to show that, to the best of its knowledge
or belief, a drug has not previously been approved under section 505(b) of the act containing any active moiety in the
drug for which the applicant is seeking approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) If the applicant claims exclusivity under &sect;314.108(b)(4) or (b)(5), the following information to show
that the application contains ``new clinical investigations'' that are ``essential to approval of the application
or supplement'' and were ``conducted or sponsored by the applicant:'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
``New clinical investigations.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' A certification that to the best of the applicant's knowledge each of the clinical investigations included in the
application meets the definition of ``new clinical investigation'' set forth in &sect;314.108(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
``Essential to approval.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A list of all published studies or publicly available reports of clinical investigations known to the applicant through
a literature search that are relevant to the conditions for which the applicant is seeking approval, a certification
that the applicant has thoroughly searched the scientific literature and, to the best of the applicant's knowledge,
the list is complete and accurate and, in the applicant's opinion, such published studies or publicly available reports
do not provide a sufficient basis for the approval of the conditions for which the applicant is seeking approval without
reference to the new clinical investigation(s) in the application, and an explanation as to why the studies or reports
are insufficient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
``Conducted or sponsored by.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If the applicant was the sponsor named in the Form FDA&hyph;1571 for an investigational new drug application (IND)
under which the new clinical investigation(s) that is essential to the approval of its application was conducted,
identification of the IND by number. If the applicant was not the sponsor of the IND under which the clinical investigation(s)
was conducted, a certification that the applicant or its predecessor in interest provided substantial support for
the clinical investigation(s) that is essential to the approval of its application, and information supporting
the certification. To demonstrate ``substantial support,'' an applicant must either provide a certified statement
from a certified public accountant that the applicant provided 50 percent or more of the cost of conducting the study
or provide an explanation of why FDA should consider the applicant to have conducted or sponsored the study if the applicant's
financial contribution to the study is less than 50 percent or the applicant did not sponsor the investigational new
drug. A predecessor in interest is an entity, e.g., a corporation, that the applicant has taken over, merged with,
or purchased, or from which the applicant has purchased all rights to the drug. Purchase of nonexclusive rights to
a clinical investigation after it is completed is not sufficient to satisfy this definition.

Public disclosure of patent information. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA will publish in the list the patent number and expiration date of each patent that is required to be, and is, submitted
to FDA by an applicant, and for each use patent, the approved indications or other conditions of use covered by a patent.
FDA will publish such patent information upon approval of the application, or, if the patent information is submitted
by the applicant after approval of an application as provided under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, as soon as possible
after the submission to the agency of the patent information. Patent information submitted by the last working day
of a month will be published in that month's supplement to the list. Patent information received by the agency between
monthly publication of supplements to the list will be placed on public display in FDA's Freedom of Information Staff.
A request for copies of the file shall be sent in writing to the Freedom of Information Staff (HFI&hyph;35), Food and
Drug Administration, rm. 12A&hyph;16, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Correction of patent information errors. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If any person disputes the accuracy or relevance of patent information submitted to the agency under this section
and published by FDA in the list, or believes that an applicant has failed to submit required patent information, that
person must first notify the agency in writing stating the grounds for disagreement. Such notification should be
directed to the Drug Information Services Branch (HFD&hyph;84), Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Food and
Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857. The agency will then request of the applicable new drug
application holder that the correctness of the patent information or omission of patent information be confirmed.
Unless the application holder withdraws or amends its patent information in response to FDA's request, the agency
will not change the patent information in the list. If the new drug application holder does not change the patent information
submitted to FDA, a 505(b)(2) application or an abbreviated new drug application under section 505(j) of the act submitted
for a drug that is claimed by a patent for which information has been submitted must, despite any disagreement as to
the correctness of the patent information, contain an appropriate certification for each listed patent.

Late submission of patent information. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a patent on the listed drug is issued and the holder of the approved application for the listed drug does not submit
the required information on the patent within 30 days of issuance of the patent, an applicant who submitted an abbreviated
new drug application for that drug that contained an appropriate patent certification before the submission of the
patent information is not required to submit an amended certification. An applicant whose abbreviated new drug application
is submitted after a late submission of patent information, or whose pending abbreviated application was previously
submitted but did not contain an appropriate patent certification at the time of the patent submission, shall submit
a certification under paragraph (a)(12)(i) of this section or a statement under paragraph (a)(12)(iii) of this section
as to that patent.

Amended certifications. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A certification submitted under paragraphs (a)(12)(i) through (a)(12)(iii) of this section may be amended at any
time before the effective date of the approval of the application. However, an applicant who has submitted a paragraph
IV patent certification may not change it to a paragraph III certification if a patent infringement suit has been filed
against another paragraph IV applicant unless the agency has determined that no applicant is entitled to 180-day
exclusivity or the patent expires before the lawsuit is resolved or expires after the suit is resolved but before the
end of the 180-day exclusivity period. If an applicant with a pending application voluntarily makes a patent certification
for an untimely filed patent, the applicant may withdraw the patent certification for the untimely filed patent.
An applicant shall submit an amended certification by letter or as an amendment to a pending application or by letter
to an approved application. Once an amendment or letter is submitted, the application will no longer be considered
to contain the prior certification.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a patent is removed from the list, any applicant with a pending application (including a tentatively approved application
with a delayed effective date) who has made a certification with respect to such patent shall amend its certification.
The applicant shall certify under paragraph (a)(12)(ii) of this section that no patents described in paragraph (a)(12)(i)
of this section claim the drug or, if other relevant patents claim the drug, shall amend the certification to refer
only to those relevant patents. In the amendment, the applicant shall state the reason for the change in certification
(that the patent is or has been removed from the list). A patent that is the subject of a lawsuit under &sect;314.107(c)
shall not be removed from the list until FDA determines either that no delay in effective dates of approval is required
under that section as a result of the lawsuit, that the patent has expired, or that any such period of delay in effective
dates of approval is ended. An applicant shall submit an amended certification. Once an amendment or letter for the
change has been submitted, the application will no longer be considered to be one containing a certification under
paragraph (a)(12)(i)(A)(4) of this section.

patent infringement within 45 days of receipt by the patent owner of the notice of certification from the applicant
under &sect;314.52 or &sect;314.95, approval may be made effective 30 months after the date of the receipt of the notice
of certification by the patent owner or by the exclusive licensee (or their representatives) unless the court has
extended or reduced the period because of a failure of either the plaintiff or defendant to cooperate reasonably in
expediting the action; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) If the patented drug product qualifies for 5 years of exclusive marketing under &sect;314.108(b)(2) and the patent

(ii) If before the expiration of the 30-month period, or 71/2 years where applicable, the court issues a final order
that the patent is invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed, approval may be made effective on the date the court enters
judgment; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If before the expiration of the 30-month period, or 71/2 years where applicable, the court issues a final order
or judgment that the patent has been infringed, approval may be made effective on the date the court determines that
the patent will expire or otherwise orders; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) If before the expiration of the 30-month period, or 71/2 years where applicable, the court grants a preliminary
injunction prohibiting the applicant from engaging in the commercial manufacture or sale of the drug product until
the court decides the issues of patent validity and infringement, and if the court later decides that the patent is
invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed, approval may be made effective on the date the court enters a final order
or judgment that the patent is invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) In order for an approval to be made effective under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the applicant must receive
an approval letter from the agency indicating that the application has received final approval. Tentative approval
of an application does not constitute ``approval'' of an application and cannot, absent a final approval letter from
the agency, result in an effective approval under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the applicant has submitted certifications under &sect;314.50(i) or &sect;314.94(a)(12) for more than one patent,
the date of approval will be calculated for each certification, and the approval will become effective on the last
applicable date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Subsequent abbreviated new drug application submission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If an abbreviated new drug application contains a certification that a relevant patent is invalid, unenforceable,
or will not be infringed and the application is for a generic copy of the same listed drug for which one or more substantially
complete abbreviated new drug applications were previously submitted containing a certification that the same
patent was invalid, unenforceable, or would not be infringed and the applicant submitting the first application
has successfully defended against a suit for patent infringement brought within 45 days of the patent owner's receipt
of notice submitted under &sect;314.95, approval of the subsequent abbreviated new drug application will be made
effective no sooner than 180 days from whichever of the following dates is earlier: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The date the applicant submitting the first application first commences commercial marketing of its drug product;
or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The date of a decision of the court holding the relevant patent invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(2) For purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the ``applicant submitting the first application'' is the applicant
that submits an application that is both substantially complete and contains a certification that the patent was
invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed prior to the submission of any other application for the same listed drug
that is both substantially complete and contains the same certification. A ``substantially complete'' application
must contain the results of any required bioequivalence studies, or, if applicable, a request for a waiver of such
studies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) For purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, if FDA concludes that the applicant submitting the first application
is not actively pursuing approval of its abbreviated application, FDA will make the approval of subsequent abbreviated
applications immediately effective if they are otherwise eligible for an immediately effective approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) For purposes of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, the applicant submitting the first application shall, if
sued for patent infringement, notify FDA of the date that it commences commercial marketing of its drug product. Commercial
marketing commences with the first date of introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce outside
the control of the manufacturer of a drug product, except for investigational use under part 312 of this chapter, but
does not include transfer of the drug product for reasons other than sale within the control of the manufacturer or
application holder. If an applicant does not promptly notify FDA of such date, the effective date of approval shall
be deemed to be the date of the commencement of first commercial marketing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Delay due to exclusivity. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency will also delay the effective date of the approval of an abbreviated new drug application under section
505(j) of the act or a 505(b)(2) application if delay is required by the exclusivity provisions in &sect;314.108.
When the effective date of an application is delayed under both this section and &sect;314.108, the effective date
will be the later of the 2 days specified under this section and &sect;314.108. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Court actions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) References to actions of ``the court'' in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section are to the court that enters final
judgment from which no appeal can be or has been taken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For purposes of establishing the effective date of approval based on a court judgment, the following dates shall
be deemed to be the date of the final decision of the court on the patent issues: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If the district court enters a decision that the patent is invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed, and the decision
is not appealed, the date on which the right to appeal lapses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the district court enters a decision that the patent is invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed, and the decision
is appealed, the date of the first decision or order by a higher court holding or affirming the decision of the district
court that the patent is invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If the district court enters a decision that the patent is infringed, and the decision is appealed, the date on
which the district court enters a judgment that the patent is invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed pursuant to
a mandate issued by a court of appeals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The applicant shall submit a copy of the entry of the order or judgment to the Office of Generic Drugs (HFD&hyph;600),
or to the appropriate division in the Office of Drug Evaluation I (HFD&hyph;100) or Office of Drug Evaluation II (HFD&hyph;500),
whichever is applicable, within 10 working days of a final judgment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Computation of 45-day time clock. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The 45-day clock described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section begins on the day after the date of receipt of the
applicant's notice of certification by the patent owner or its representative, and by the approved application holder.
When the 45th day falls on Saturday, Sunday, or a Federal holiday, the 45th day will be the next day that is not a Saturday,
Sunday, or a Federal holiday. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The abbreviated new drug applicant or the 505(b)(2) applicant shall notify FDA immediately of the filing of any
legal action filed within 45 days of receipt of the notice of certification. If the applicant submitting the abbreviated
new drug application or the 505(b)(2) application or patent owner or its representative does not notify FDA in writing
before the expiration of the 45-day time period or the completion of the agency's review of the application, whichever
occurs later, that a legal action for patent infringement was filed within 45 days of receipt of the notice of certification,
approval of the abbreviated new drug application or the 505(b)(2) application will be made effective immediately
upon expiration of the 45 days or upon completion of the agency's review and approval of the application, whichever
is later. The notification to FDA of the legal action shall include:

court on a specified date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The applicant of an abbreviated new drug application shall send the notification to FDA's Office of Generic Drugs
(HFD&hyph;600). A 505(b)(2) applicant shall send the notification to the appropriate division in the Center for
Drug Evaluation and Research reviewing the application. A patent owner or its representative may also notify FDA
of the filing of any legal action for patent infringement. The notice should contain the information and be sent to
the offices or divisions described in this paragraph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If the patent owner or approved application holder who is an exclusive patent licensee waives its opportunity
to file a legal action for patent infringement within 45 days of a receipt of the notice of certification and the patent
owner or approved application holder who is an exclusive patent licensee submits to FDA a valid waiver before the 45
days elapse, approval of the abbreviated new drug application or the 505(b)(2) application will be made effective
upon completion of the agency's review and approval of the application. FDA will only accept a waiver in the following
form:

Definitions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following definitions of terms apply to this section: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Active moiety 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
means the molecule or ion, excluding those appended portions of the molecule that cause the drug to be an ester, salt
(including a salt with hydrogen or coordination bonds), or other noncovalent derivative (such as a complex, chelate,
or clathrate) of the molecule, responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Approved under section 505(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
means an application submitted under section 505(b) and approved on or after October 10, 1962, or an application that
was ``deemed approved'' under section 107(c)(2) of Pub. L. 87&hyph;781. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Clinical investigation 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
means any experiment other than a bioavailability study in which a drug is administered or dispensed to, or used on,
human subjects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Conducted or sponsored by the applicant 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
with regard to an investigation means that before or during the investigation, the applicant was named in Form FDA&hyph;1571
filed with FDA as the sponsor of the investigational new drug application under which the investigation was conducted,
or the applicant or the applicant's predecessor in interest, provided substantial support for the investigation.
To demonstrate ``substantial support,'' an applicant must either provide a certified statement from a certified
public accountant that the applicant provided 50 percent or more of the cost of conducting the study or provide an explanation
why FDA should consider the applicant to have conducted or sponsored the study if the applicant's financial contribution
to the study is less than 50 percent or the applicant did not sponsor the investigational new drug. A predecessor in
interest is an entity, e.g., a corporation, that the applicant has taken over, merged with, or purchased, or from which
the applicant has purchased all rights to the drug. Purchase of nonexclusive rights to a clinical investigation after
it is completed is not sufficient to satisfy this definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Date of approval 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
means the date on the letter from FDA stating that the new drug application is approved, whether or not final printed
labeling or other materials must yet be submitted as long as approval of such labeling or materials is not expressly
required. ``Date of approval'' refers only to a final approval and not to a tentative approval that may become effective
at a later date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Essential to approval 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
means, with regard to an investigation, that there are no other data available that could support approval of the application.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FDA 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
means the Food and Drug Administration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
New chemical entity 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
means a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by FDA in any other application submitted under section
505(b) of the act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
New clinical investigation 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means an investigation in humans the results of which have not been relied on by FDA to demonstrate substantial evidence
of effectiveness of a previously approved drug product for any indication or of safety for a new patient population
and do not duplicate the results of another investigation that was relied on by the agency to demonstrate the effectiveness
or safety in a new patient population of a previously approved drug product. For purposes of this section, data from
a clinical investigation previously submitted for use in the comprehensive evaluation of the safety of a drug product
but not to support the effectiveness of the drug product would be considered new.

 This interim final rule implements recent amendments to the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (MMPA) by amending
the regulations implementing the MMPA to authorize, pursuant to a General Authorization for Scientific Research,
the harassment of marine mammals in the wild for purposes of bona fide scientific research, that does not have the potential
to injure marine mammals (Level B harassment).

) places a moratorium on the taking and importing of marine mammals by persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction with limited
exceptions. One exception is for the taking or importing of marine mammals for purposes of scientific research. The
MMPA Amendments of 1994 (1994 Amendments), enacted on April 30, 1994 (P.L. 103&hyph;238), among other things, require
that, within 120 days of enactment, NMFS issue a General Authorization for Scientific Research and implementing
regulations allowing takings of marine mammals in the wild for purposes of bona fide scientific research by no more
than Level B harassment (pursuit, torment, or annoyance of marine mammals that does not have the potential to injure
marine mammals). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 120-day deadline requires that this General Authorization be issued by interim final rule without prior notice
and opportunity for prior public comment. Comments on the General Authorization and implementing regulations are
invited and will be considered in issuing a final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Level B harassment is defined as any act of pursuit, torment, or annoyance which has the potential to disturb a marine
mammal or marine mammal stock in the wild by causing disruption of behavioral patterns, including, but not limited
to, migration, breathing, nursing, breeding, feeding, or sheltering but does not have the potential to injure a marine
mammal or marine mammal stock in the wild. Level A harassment is defined as any act which has the potential to injure
a marine mammal or marine mammal stock in the wild. In general, except for small take authorizations for harassment
under section 101(a)(5)(D) of the MMPA, a permit is required to take by Level A harassment. And, a permit is also required
to hunt, capture, or kill marine mammals for the purposes of scientific research, public display, or enhancing the
survival or recovery of a species or stock, or to take by Level B harassment for photography for educational or commercial
purposes.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In proposed revised permit regulations published on October 14, 1993 (58 FR 53320), NMFS proposed consolidating
three sets of permit regulations that have been implemented under the MMPA, the Fur Seal Act of 1966 (FSA) (16 U.S.C.
1151 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.), and the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) (16 U.S.C. 1531 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.). This interim final rule revises the permit sections of the implementing regulations of the FSA (50 CFR part 215)
to reference MMPA permit regulations (50 CFR part 216, subpart D) as the applicable regulations for the taking of North
Pacific fur seals for scientific research or exhibition purposes. The FSA permit regulations are also revised to
allow the taking of North Pacific fur seals involving only Level B harassment for the purpose of scientific research
under this interim final rule. (Note: North Pacific fur seals (Pribilof Island population) have been designated
as depleted under the MMPA.)

Collection of Certain Marine Mammal Parts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In enacting the 1994 Amendments it was the apparent intent of Congress to allow under a General Authorization the conduct
of scientific research activities involving certain low-impact types of taking of marine mammals in the wild, with
the goal of making a permit unnecessary for scientific research involving types of taking that do not have the potential
to injure marine mammals or marine mammal stocks. NMFS believes that such types of low-impact taking include the collection
of tissues, fluids, or other marine mammal parts sloughed, excreted, or otherwise discharged naturally by marine
mammals in the wild, where such collection may not necessarily involve the harassment of living marine mammals in
the wild. Accordingly, NMFS is amending &sect;216.26 of the implementing regulations (50 CFR part 216) to allow for
purposes of bona fide scientific research, without issuance of a permit, the collection of any tissues, fluids or
other marine mammal parts naturally sloughed, excreted or otherwise discharged by a living marine mammal in the wild.
Section 216.26 is also amended to: (1) Ensure that requirements for the registration, identification, transfer,
or other possession of such marine mammal parts are consistent with those already established for parts salvaged
from beached or stranded marine mammals (&sect;216.22(c)); (2) require that, in registering such marine mammal
parts, the person collecting the part must also state the scientific research purpose for which the part was collected;
and (3) prohibit the sale or trade of any such marine mammal part for commercial purposes.

Discussion of General Authorization and Implementing Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The implementing regulations for the General Authorization are organized into five parts: (1) The General Authorization
and the types of activities covered; (2) letter of intent requirements; (3) procedures for confirming that the General
Authorization applies or notifying the applicant that a permit is required; (4) the terms and conditions applicable
to activities conducted under the General Authorization, including reporting requirements; and (5) the circumstances
under which NMFS may suspend, revoke, or modify the authority to conduct scientific research under the General Authorization.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Scope 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Activities Included Under the General Authorization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Research activities that are likely to involve only Level B harassment of marine mammals, and therefore that may be
conducted under the General Authorization consistent with the requirements of these regulations, include: Photo-identification
studies; behavioral observations; vessel surveys; and aerial surveys over water or land, and over pinniped rookeries
if flown at altitudes greater than 1,000 ft (305 meters (m)). These activities are listed in &sect;216.45(a)(3).
This list may be expanded as new information becomes available and NMFS determines that other types of research activities
are likely to involve only Level B harassment. Comment is requested regarding what other types of research activities
are likely to involve only Level B harassment (i.e., no potential to injure) and can be clearly and uniquely categorized
as such in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The General Authorization also applies to persons issued a scientific research permit under the ESA that authorizes
the taking by Level B harassment of marine mammals listed as threatened or endangered. An ESA permit holder authorized
to conduct Level B harassment is not required to submit a separate letter of intent. Such Level B activities are included
under the MMPA General Authorization for Scientific Research and no letter of confirmation is needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Activities Not Included Under the General Authorization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated in section 2(b) of the 1994 Amendments, ``Except as otherwise expressly provided, nothing in this Act is
intended to amend, repeal, or otherwise affect any other provision of law.'' Thus, marine mammals listed as endangered
or threatened under the ESA may be taken for purposes of scientific research only after issuance of a permit for such
activities pursuant to the ESA (50 CFR part 222). And, except for Level B harassment, other types of taking of marine
mammals listed as threatened or endangered that are authorized under an ESA permit for scientific research are not
authorized under the General Authorization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Research activities involving the harassment of marine mammals in the wild that have the potential to injure a marine
mammal (Level A harassment) are not covered by the General Authorization. They may be conducted only pursuant to a
scientific research permit. Likewise, activities that involve the hunting, capturing, or killing of marine mammals
for the purposes of scientific research, public display, or enhancing the survival or recovery of a species or stock,
or taking by Level B harassment for photography for educational or commercial purposes, are not covered by the General
Authorization and require a permit.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although most population surveys are likely to involve only Level B harassment or no harassment at all, pinniped rookeries
are an area of concern because many pinniped species stampede into the water when startled or otherwise threatened
by a potential predator or by human activity. When a stampede occurs in a haulout area (in the non-reproductive season),
it generally does not involve a potential injury, but in a rookery situation, a stampede has the potential to injure
pups. The 1,000 ft (305 m) threshold for aerial surveys over pinniped rookeries serves as an objective standard that
may be used to determine whether such research may be conducted under the General Authorization or may involve potential
injury to marine mammals (i.e., Level A harassment) and, therefore, require a permit. In this regard, NMFS is interested
in comments on whether different species-specific aerial survey altitudes or methods associated with minimal disturbance
have been established definitively in the scientific literature. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the interest of simplicity and predictability, the interim final rule limits research activities that may be conducted
under the General Authorization to only those types listed in &sect;216.45(a)(3). In preparing this interim final
rule, however, NMFS considered including provisions that would have allowed research activities other than those
types listed in &sect;216.45(a)(3) to be included under the General Authorization; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, That in the letter of intent the applicant described the activity and furnished supporting documentation sufficient
for NMFS to determine that the activity likely would involve only Level B harassment. For example, although bleach
marking of pinnipeds in the wild is a type of research that could injure marine mammals (Level A harassment), if the
activity is being conducted by an experienced researcher using only non-toxic bleaching agents and proven direct
application methods on a species for which there is an established record of tolerance of such methods without any
disturbance with potential to injure (e.g., Northern elephant seals, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Mirounga angustirostris
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), NMFS, upon receipt of a letter of intent containing sufficient documentation, could determine such activity likely
would involve only Level B harassment and that the activity could be conducted under the General Authorization. NMFS
is requesting comment on whether the final rule should include such flexibility; i.e., allow persons to conduct,
under the General Authorization, a research activity that has not been listed in the regulations as a type of research
likely to involve only Level B harassment, if sufficient documentation is submitted to NMFS to make a determination
that the activity is bona fide scientific research and does not involve the potential to injure marine mammals or marine
mammal stocks.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An applicant submitting a letter of intent to conduct scientific research under the General Authorization must be
the principal investigator, or the appropriate institution, government entity, or corporation responsible for
the supervision of the principal investigator. If the research involves co-investigators, a single principal investigator,
who will be primarily responsible for the research to be conducted under the General Authorization, must submit the
letter of intent, with all co-investigators identified as such. Identification of both principal and co-investigators
ensures accountability for activities conducted under the General Authorization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All persons conducting an activity under the authority of the General Authorization must possess qualifications
(e.g., education or experience) commensurate with their duties and responsibilities, or must be under the direct
supervision of a person with such qualifications. Applicants must enclose with the letter of intent, curricula vitae
for themselves and any co-investigators that may conduct research activities under the General Authorization.
NMFS will consider this information in determining whether the research as described in the letter of intent can be
expected to be conducted in a manner involving no more than Level B harassment of marine mammals or marine mammal stocks.

Letter of Intent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Persons intending to conduct a scientific research activity of the type listed in &sect;216.45 (a)(3) under the General
Authorization must submit, at least 60 days before commencement of such research, a letter of intent by certified
return/receipt mail to the Chief, Permits Division, F/PR1, Office of Protected Resources, NMFS, 1335 East-West
Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910&hyph;3226. Persons issued an ESA scientific research permit authorizing the take
of marine mammals in the wild by Level B harassment, however, need not submit a letter of intent. Those Level B activities
are covered by the General Authorization, and no letter of confirmation is needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All letters of intent must include the name, address, telephone number, qualifications, and experience of the applicant
(i.e., principal investigator) and any co-investigator(s). Curricula vitae must be provided for each, including
a list of publications by such investigator relevant to the objectives, methodology, or other aspects of the proposed
research. Each letter of intent must be signed, dated, and include the certification statement specified at &sect;216.45(b)(3).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each letter of intent must include brief statements responsive to the information requirements of section 104(c)(3)(C)
of the MMPA: The species or stocks of marine mammals (common and scientific names) that are the subject of the scientific
research and any other species or stock of marine mammals that may be harassed during the conduct of the research; the
geographic location(s) in which the research is to be conducted, e.g., geographic name or lat./long.; the period(s)
of time over which the research will be conducted (up to 5 years), including the field season(s) for the research, if
applicable; the purpose of the research, including a description of how the proposed research qualifies as bona fide
research; and the methods to be used to conduct the research.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No later than 30 days after receipt of a letter of intent, NMFS will issue a letter to the applicant either: Confirming
that the General Authorization applies, notifying the applicant that all or part of the proposed research does not
qualify for the General Authorization and that a scientific research permit is required, or notifying the applicant
that the letter of intent was insufficient to determine whether the General Authorization applies and identifying
the deficiencies to enable the applicant to revise and resubmit the letter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Marine Mammal Commission (MMC) and Committee of Scientific Advisors were established under Title II of the MMPA
to, among other things, review applications for permits for the taking or import of marine mammals and provide comment
and recommendations to NMFS. Although the 1994 Amendments do not provide for the involvement of either the MMC or the
Committee of Scientific Advisors in the General Authorization for Scientific Research, a copy of each letter of intent
and NMFS' response will be forwarded to the MMC. This will allow the MMC to review all research activities involving
marine mammals, including research conducted under the General Authorization.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to ensure that research activities conducted under the General Authorization do not either individually
or cumulatively result in takes other than by Level B harassment, NMFS plans to coordinate and monitor research activities.
Monitoring will be accomplished, in part, through NMFS and MMC review of required annual reports. Coordination of
research activities will be accomplished, in part, by requiring persons conducting research under the General Authorization
to notify the appropriate NMFS Regional Office(s) at least 2 weeks before initiation of on-site activities. The Regional
Office(s) will review these notifications and coordinate upcoming research to minimize adverse impacts on marine
mammals in the wild. Where appropriate, Regional Offices may convene meetings to coordinate research under the General
Authorization. In the event of any circumstance where research activities result in a taking which exceeds Level
B harassment, for example, in the case of potential or actual injury to or death of a marine mammal or marine mammal stocks
in the wild, research activities must be immediately discontinued and the principal investigator must notify NMFS.
NMFS will determine whether: The research activity in question may continue under the General Authorization; revision
of the research methodology is necessary to remove any potential to injure marine mammals or marine mammal stocks;
or, a permit is necessary to continue the research. The reporting of such incidents is a condition of conducting research
under the General Authorization. Similarly, in certain instances (e.g., reports of abuse of the General Authorization),
it may be necessary for a NMFS observer to monitor research activities directly. Therefore, a condition of conducting
research under the General Authorization is that, upon notification, the principal investigator must allow a NMFS
observer to observe research activities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Persons conducting research under the General Authorization must submit annual reports of activity. This information
will be used to monitor the effects of the activities on individual animals and their populations, to assess possible
cumulative impacts, and to determine whether the activity is being conducted as described in the letter of intent.
Annual reports will also be used to track the progress of the research, to determine whether the research continues
to meet the bona fide requirement, and to allow for coordination with similar research in the same area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Photography (e.g., still photography, videotaping, and motion picture filming) often will be one of the methodologies
employed by researchers engaged in scientific research under the General Authorization. Such photography does
not require a photography permit issued under the MMPA provided the primary use of the resulting images will be for
the conduct of the research or presenting or publishing the results. In such case, such images may be incidentally
used for other scientific, educational, or commercial purposes provided the names of all photographers are disclosed
in the annual report and any photographs, videotape, or film obtained during the conduct of research under the General
Authorization are identified by a statement that refers to the General Authorization and includes the file number
provided by NMFS in the confirmation letter, the name of the photographer, and the date the image was taken. This statement
must accompany the image(s) in all subsequent uses or sales. The annual report must note incidental scientific, educational,
or commercial uses of the images. However, if the primary use of the images will be for educational or commercial use,
a separate photography permit must first be obtained.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to section 553(b)(3)(B) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries,
NOAA, (AA) finds there is a good cause to waive prior notice and opportunity to comment on this rule. It is contrary to
public interest to provide prior notice and opportunity for comment because of the deadline for implementation mandated
by the 1994 Amendments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to section 553(d) of the APA, the AA finds there is good cause to waive the required 30-day delay in the effective
date. Any delay in this action would deny timely coverage by the General Authorization to qualified persons. This
General Authorization grants an exception from the MMPA requirement to obtain a scientific research permit for the
taking of marine mammals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interim final rule involves an existing collection-of-information requirement subject to the Paperwork Reduction
Act that has been approved by OMB (control number 0648&hyph;0084). The burden for collection of that information
was estimated to average 43 hours per response, including the time to complete permit applications, complete reporting
requirements, and request subsequent modifications or authorizations. The public reporting burden for the collection-of-information
associated with the General Authorization established under the current rule is estimated to average 17 hours per
response. Send any comments regarding these burden estimates or any other aspect of these requirements, including
suggestions for reducing the burden to NMFS and OMB (see

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
These amendments add comprehensive crash resistant fuel system design and test criteria to the airworthiness standards
for normal and transport category rotorcraft. Application of these standards will minimize fuel spillage near ignition
sources and potential ignition sources and, therefore, will improve the evacuation time needed for crew and passengers
to escape a post-crash fire (PCF). Implementation of these amendments will minimize the PCF hazard saving lives and
substantially reducing the severity of physiological injuries sustained from PCF's in otherwise survivable accidents.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These amendments are based on a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) No. 90&hyph;24, issued September 27, 1990 (55
FR 41000, October 5, 1990). A correction to the NPRM was published on December 11, 1990 (55 FR 50931).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Post-crash fires (PCF's) are the primary cause of fatalities and injuries in otherwise survivable impacts resulting
from rotorcraft accidents. It is estimated that 5 percent of the occupants in survivable rotorcraft accidents are
killed or injured by PCF's annually. These types of fatalities and traumatic injuries will be substantially reduced
by the implementation of the design and test criteria of this amendment. Nearly all PCF's are caused by crash-induced
fuel leaks that quickly come in contact with ignition sources during or after impact. The fuel containment and hazard
elimination provisions contained in this amendment will, in the majority of cases, give occupants the time necessary
to escape a survivable crash before a post-crash fire (PCF) could become life threatening. A crash resistant fuel
system (CRFS) would not be expected to prevent all fires; however, a CRFS would, in the majority of survivable accidents,
either prevent a PCF or delay the massive fire, or fireball, long enough to allow the occupants to escape. These standards
have been validated by military safety statistics as significantly minimizing the PCF hazard and its associated
fatalities and injuries.

General
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Thirteen commenters, including representatives from small and large U.S. helicopter manufacturers, foreign airworthiness
authorities, and foreign helicopter manufacturers, commented on the NPRM. All commenters agree with the FAA that
CFRS installations will improve occupant survivability in parts 27 and 29 rotorcraft.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The majority of commenters fully support all of the proposals. No commenter opposes adoption of the proposed amendments.
One commenter proposes adoption of more stringent standards, and several commenters offer other counterproposals
and recommendations for specific proposals.

General Comments on the Proposals
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Unless specifically noted otherwise, the comments and responses apply to both proposed &sect;&sect;27.952 and
29.952, since the requirements in both are identical.

The Use of the Term ``Flammable Fluid''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Flammable fluids other than fuel should not be included in the amendments, since all on-board light and heavy oil systems
are affected. Accordingly, the commenter proposes that ``flammable fluid'' be changed to ``fuel.'' The FAA agrees
with this comment, and appropriate changes have been made.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter questions the accuracy of the economic analysis but offers no specific recommendations or corrections.
The FAA has reevaluated the analysis and found no changes were necessary based on this comment.

Rigidity of the Proposals
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A commenter states that the proposed amendments are ``too rigid'' in their approach and limit the designers' choices.
The FAA disagrees. Although the 50-foot drop height and certain strength requirements are specific, these and most
of the other requirements do not mandate specific designs. Objective rules allow flexibility in showing compliance.
An example of this flexibility is that bladders are not mandated; the rule specifies only freedom from leakage after
impact. The amendments are intended to be as flexible as possible to allow design innovation while at the same time
requiring a specific safety standard for a CRFS.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A commenter states that the amendments include some very detailed requirements that are more appropriate for a Technical
Standard Order (TSO). The FAA agrees that some of the details proposed for paragraphs 27.952 (e) and (f) and 29.952
(e) and (f) should not be regulatory requirements, are more appropriate for an advisory circular, and should not be
part of the proposed standard. Therefore, those details have been removed and placed in the draft advisory material.
However, the FAA disagrees with the commenter that the level of detail either in the proposals or in the advisory material
would necessitate a CRFS TSO.

The Standardized Approach of the Proposals

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A commenter believes that the standardized design and test approach of these amendments to CRFS certification, while
acceptable, is not as valid as the establishment of individual design criteria on a case-by-case basis followed by
a design review and a test program. However, the commenter offered no specific data or case histories to substantiate
this position. Since all past successful civil and military experience has been with a standardized design and test
approach, the FAA finds no historical or technical basis to support the commenter. Moreover, the FAA has determined
that a standardized design and test approach, when properly applied, still allows for adequate use of individual
design features that meet the specific safety standards.

A commenter expresses concern that the proposals are less stringent than the corresponding military standard because
of perceived differences in the military and civil environments. The commenter is especially concerned that fuel
tank bladders are not mandated. The commenter proposes verbatim adoption of the military standards. The FAA disagrees.
Based on independent studies, the General Aviation Safety Panel (GASP) committee recommendations, and past civil
CRFS service experience, the FAA has determined that the proposals, while less stringent than the military standard,
provide an equivalent level of safety considering the differences (such as violent atypical flight maneuvers, landing
maneuvers, and gunfire hazards) in the civil and military environments. While it is anticipated that most successful
fuel cell designs will involve the use of bladders, bladderless rigid designs (that provide the same level of safety
as designs with bladders) may be approved under the new standard.

A commenter questions the need for the specification of load factors in proposed &sect;27.516(d), since similar
load factors are specified in proposed &sect;27.952(b)(3). The FAA has determined that load factors are needed in
both &sect;&sect;27.561(d) and 27.952(b)(3). Section 27.561(d) applies to fuselage structure, and &sect;27.952(b)(3)
applies to fuel tanks. Although the load factors are identical, they are specified for different parts of the rotorcraft.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter correctly states that the load factors are clearly specified for fuel cells by their location on
the rotorcraft but asks which load factors are to be used for other major fuel system components. The load factors used
for each fuel cell location should be used for fuel cell components of significant mass in the same locations. Therefore,
this amendment is adopted as proposed.

All commenters support the proposed drop test, and most commenters favor the 50-foot drop height. However, two commenters
propose a reduction in the drop height for a bare fuel cell from 50 to 25 feet. Another commenter proposed a reduction
in drop height of a fuel cell test article configuration (i.e., a fuel cell installed in its representative airframe
structure) from 50 to 15 feet. Another commenter contends that since the military fuel cell drop test (and nearly 20
years of associated, successful safety experience) is at a 65-foot drop height, the proposed drop height should be
65 feet, not 50 feet. The proposed 50-foot drop height is based, in part, on an analysis of nearly 20 years of combined
military and civilian design and operational data. (The 15-foot reduction in drop height from the military standard
to the proposed civil standard equates their level of safety because of the elimination of the additional risks associated
with the military environment.) A significant part of this 20 years of data is based on approximately 1,500 civil rotorcraft
that have been certificated (on a voluntary, nonhazard basis) to design standards (including a 50-foot drop test)
analogous to these proposals. This 20 years of data and experience (from both the military and voluntary civil unit
installations) have resulted in a good operational safety record. This good safety record indicates that fuel tank
installations designed to these proposals (including the practical standard of a 50-foot drop height) successfully
minimize the post-crash fire hazard. Therefore, no change to the 50-foot drop height is warranted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter proposes deletion of the requirement to drop the fuel cell in its surrounding structure. The same
commenter asks if the bare tank drop test will follow the procedure of MIL&hyph;T&hyph;27422B when the surrounding
structure is free of projections or design features likely to contribute to tank ruptures. Another commenter states
that the requirement to drop a representative structure should be fully defined. The same commenter states that no
mention is made of production drop test requirements that would be made necessary by postproduction design changes
to either the fuel system or its surrounding structure. The FAA considers these suggested changes unnecessary because
(under Part 21) a design review (precipitated by a proposed design modification that affects the fuel cell-airframe
interface) would automatically require a review of the interface with regard to these proposed standards. If that
design review shows the surrounding structure is free of projections and hazards, the fuel cell may be dropped alone.
Additionally, MIL&hyph;T&hyph;27422B procedures may be used, except that the drop height is reduced to 50 feet.
Further, major post certification design changes, such as major changes to the fuel system cells or their locations,
automatically require recertification in accordance with FAR 21.93(a). Therefore, the amendments are adopted
as proposed.

A commenter notes that the proposed drop test criteria require that the fuel cell test article be filled 80 percent
with water with no mention of the contents of the other 20 percent. The commenter states that this is different from
part 23 Notice No. 85&hyph;7A (55 FR 7280, February 28, 1990) in that the proposed rotorcraft amendments do not require
the air to be removed from the fuel cell prior to the drop test. The commenter suggests that the best method of compensating
for the difference between the density of fuel and water is to leave the tank 100 percent full of fuel and adjust the drop
height to a lower value.

The FAA notes that the drop test criteria proposed in Notice 90&hyph;24 are the same as those proposed in part 23 Notice
85&hyph;7A and the same as those used to comply with MIL&hyph;T&hyph;27422B. There are standard, acceptable methods
of configuring (i.e., properly removing the air from) a soft flexible fuel cell, and there are standard, acceptable
methods of configuring (i.e., properly removing the air from) the vents on a rigid fuel cell. The air removal methods
intended by these proposals are the same as those used to comply with MIL&hyph;T&hyph;27422B and are accepted, industry
practice. It is impracticable to remove a significant amount of air from many rigid fuel cell designs by pulling a vacuum
without either inducing unacceptable stresses or causing structural failure. Extreme vacuum conditions inside
fuel tanks do not exist in practice. However, natural venting (involving partial vacuums) exists for rigid tanks
in a pre-crash, falling condition. A natural partial vacuum condition is intended to be duplicated for rigid tanks
by allowing normal vent function during the drop test. Flexible fuel cells will have the air removed by hand (i.e.,
by pushing out the air and resealing the bag) prior to the drop as is currently practiced by the industry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The method chosen to compensate for the density of water versus that of fuel (i.e., 80 percent full of water) is a standard
method. It is used successfully by the civil rotorcraft industry. The commenter's alternate method of reducing the
drop height has some merit but is not supported by current, known data.

A commenter notes that the amendments differ from MIL&hyph;T&hyph;27422B, in that the amendments require that the
tank be dropped in its surrounding structure, unless it is clearly shown that the structure is free from projections
and other such hazards. The commenter suggests that the FAA not adopt the requirement to drop the tank in the surrounding
structure. The FAA disagrees. The FAA concluded that in the interests of safety the tank should be dropped in its surrounding
structure. Only when all projections and other puncture hazards have been minimized by design will dropping a bare
fuel cell suffice to show compliance. The FAA's approach improves on the MIL&hyph;T&hyph;27422B criteria in that
an FAA-approved, documented certification design review will be required to minimize the surrounding airframe
projections and other puncture hazards prior to a bare tank drop test. Therefore, the amendments are adopted as proposed.

A commenter states that the load factors proposed in these sections are redundant to those contained in structural
&sect;&sect;27.561 and 29.561(d), that no procedures to conduct these tests have been defined, and that the cost
of this type of testing is not addressed. Two other commenters question the need for specification of separate load
factors by rotorcraft zone (i.e., location) for fuel cells that exceed the standard airframe load factors. The FAA
disagrees that the proposed load factors are redundant. They are for fuel cells and major mass items in the fuel system
only. The load factors are to be used in standard structural analysis to structurally design the fuel cells, other
major fuel system mass items, and their attachments. No special tests, other than the required structural substantiation
tests are intended. No costs have been added since the required structural analysis and test programs are already
conducted during certification for these components to the current load factors. The separate load factor specification
by zone is necessary to provide proper crash resistance for occupant safety and PCF prevention for fuel system components
located in three selected zones of the rotorcraft. They also provide the designer with specific criteria (i.e., load
factors) for proper static analysis of fuel system components in these specific zones. The load factors proposed
by &sect;&sect;27.952(b) and 29.952(b) are for fuel system components only; whereas, the load factors of current
&sect;29.561(d) are for the airframe only. However, load factors for fuel system components and airframe components
are compatible.

removal to be necessary because this phrase is intended to minimize a ``mechanical'' ballistic hazard from fuel system
components and not a PCF hazard. The amendments, in the commenter's view, are only intended to minimize a PCF. The commenter's
presumption is incorrect. The amendments are intended to provide a CRFS. This includes preventing impact-induced,
ballistic hazards to fuel system components as well as PCF hazards. Therefore, the amendments are adopted as proposed.

A commenter believes that the proposed amendments mandate self-sealing breakaway couplings and suggests that the
amendments be revised to include the words ``Where hazardous relative motion of fuel system components is likely
to exist during a crash, breakaway self-sealing couplings shall be required.'' Another commenter suggests that
no alternate, equivalent designs to breakaway fuel fittings be allowed by the amendments. A third commenter points
out that there is no mention of any pull-out strength requirements for fuel tank fittings as stated in MIL&hyph;T&hyph;27422B.
The amendments already express the intent of the wording suggested by the first commenter concerning hazardous relative
motion. Further, the FAA does not agree with the second comment that alternate, equivalent designs to breakaway fuel
fittings should not be allowed, since several proven, alternate, equivalent designs have already been approved.
Thus, alternate, equivalent designs for breakaway fuel fittings are acceptable. In response to the third commenter,
fitting strength and hose pull-out strength requirements of MIL&hyph;T&hyph;27422B are industry practice and
are acceptable as one means of compliance. Therefore, the amendments are adopted as proposed.

A commenter suggests that &sect;&sect;27.952(c)(2)(iii) and 29.952(c)(1)(iii) be changed to specify leakage
as one method of detecting an unlocked or otherwise faulty breakaway coupling. The FAA agrees that leakage is one method
of detecting an unlocked coupling but finds that the proposed wording of ``design provisions to visually ascertain''
adequately covers consideration of leakage as a means to verify locking of the couplings. Therefore, the amendments
are adopted as proposed.

after a breakaway coupling has performed its intended function. The FAA agrees with the intent of the comment but has
determined that this kind of detail is more appropriate in advisory guidance material. It is intended that industry
practice, which allows loss of entrapped fuel (up to 8 ounces) and fuel seepage (up to 5 drops per minute), be acceptable
after the valve has functioned. Therefore, the amendments are adopted as proposed.

loads at the frangible or deformable attachment location.'' The FAA recognizes the large variance in industry design

A commenter states that the proposed &sect;&sect;27.952(e)(1) and 29.952(e)(1) criteria largely repeat existing
criteria. The commenter provides several specific examples of the perceived repetition. Another commenter asks
why airframe mounted fuel filters are not acceptable in the engine compartment (i.e., fire zone) if engine mounted
filters are acceptable. The FAA maintains that the proposed sections relate to a post-crash configured rotorcraft,
that is radically different in terms of ignition sources, fuel leaks, and geometry than a pre-crash configured rotorcraft
even though similarities may exist. Prior to these proposed amendments, parts 27 and 29 applied only to pre-crash
(or flight) configured rotorcraft. Also, the proposed sections refer to the entire rotorcraft, not just specific
zones, such as the pre-crash configured exhaust system regulations that were cited by the commenter in a particular
example. However, because of this and other related comments, the FAA has decided to simplify the final rule by deleting
the proposed subsections relating to compliance methodology and moving the term ``occupiable areas'' from proposed
paragraphs e(4) to revised paragraphs (e).

A commenter states that the existing rules are adequate to ensure sufficient PCF protection for fuel tanks located
near occupiable areas. Therefore, from a practical view, sufficient separation cannot be economically achieved
to the extent that it would have a significant impact on preventing a PCF. Thus, the commenter suggests that &sect;&sect;27.952(e)(4)
and 29.952(e)(4) be removed. In contrast, the FAA believes that it is practical to enhance PCF safety through design
changes under proposed &sect;&sect;27.952(e)(4) and 29.952(e)(4). For example, moving a fuel cell an additional
1/4 or more inches aft of an occupied volume (within the maximum practicable extent of a given design envelope) could
avoid a major, occupant-drenching, post-crash fuel spill (and potential PCF). This could be accomplished by simply
adding 1/4 or more inches of crushable, energy absorbing airframe distance between the occupied volume and the fuel
cell. Such a design decision would not need to be considered under the current standards. Under these proposals it
would have to be considered. As stated previously, &sect;&sect;27.952(e)(4) and 29.952(e)(4) have been removed
in order to simplify the final rule by deleting the compliance methodology. However, the requirement for separation
of fuel tanks from occupiable areas is adopted in &sect;&sect;27.952(e) and 29.952(e).

A commenter states that, under his interpretation, proposed &sect;&sect;27.952(e)(6) and 29.952(e)(6) would
require firewalls to retain their sealing ability under the load factors of &sect;&sect;27.952(b)(1) and 29.952(b)(1)).
The commenter believes that all large mass items, such as engines and cowlings, in the vicinity of the firewall would
have to be restrained to prevent impact-induced firewall ruptures (i.e., preserve postimpact sealing ability).
The commenter further believes that, based on other common design requirements such as fuel line penetrations of
firewalls, the proposed amendment is impractical. Another commenter concurs with the proposed firewall survivable
impact sealing retention requirement, but is concerned that a direct application of the proposed &sect;&sect;27.952(b)(1)
and 29.952(b)(1) load factors would produce a stiff, heavy firewall that, while able to retain sealing capability,
would be heavy, uneconomical, and not have the intended crash-resistant design features.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenters misinterpreted the intent of proposed &sect;&sect;27.952(e)(6) and 29.952(e)(6). These proposals
are based on similar MIL&hyph;STD&hyph;1290 requirements that have been used in design for many years. The FAA does
not intend that a firewall designed to the load factors of &sect;&sect;27.952(b)(1) and 29.952(b)(1) would retain
its complete sealing ability under all post-crash threats. Thus, some leakage around typical vent and line penetrations
and other small post-crash penetrations of the firewall in a survivable impact are acceptable. Unless an obvious,
catastrophic hazard would be created in a survivable impact by atypical design features, restraint of the engines
and cowling to prevent impact-induced firewall rupture was not intended. The FAA intends that the firewall retain
its sealing ability in a survivable impact. The most significant problem addressed during the firewall design is
deformation of the firewall induced by fuselage deformations under crash conditions.

The requirement can be met by a firewall of a low stiffness, ductile design that can withstand the maximum vertical,
lateral, and horizontal crushing displacements that are estimated to occur in a survivable impact. A low stiffness,
ductile design can efficiently accommodate crash-induced deformations without shearing fuel or electrical lines
and without rupturing or otherwise losing its gross sealing ability (i.e., creating a major ignition source or fire
path). A displacement based firewall certification test should be conducted that shows that it is capable of performing
its intended gross sealing function in a survivable impact. As stated previously, in order to simplify the final rule
by deleting the compliance methodology, new &sect;&sect;27.952(e) and 29.952(e) are adopted as revised, and proposed
&sect;&sect;27.952(e)(6) and 29.952(e)(6) are removed.

A commenter recommends placing the detailed design criteria proposed by &sect;&sect;27.952(f) and 29.952(f) in
an advisory circular retaining only a shortened lead-in version of &sect;&sect;27.952(f) and 29.952(f). Another
commenter believes that &sect;&sect;27.952(f) and 29.952(f), while acceptable in principle, duplicate many current
FAR requirements and several other sections of 27.952 and 29.952. The commenter cited several examples of perceived
duplication. The FAA agrees with the first commenter's proposal to place detailed design criteria in the advisory
circular material. Therefore, proposed &sect;&sect;27.952(f)(1) through 27.952(f)(9) and 29.952(f)(1) through
29.952(f)(9) are removed. Sections 27.952(f) and 29.952(f) are revised to replace the proposed, detailed design
criteria specified after the phrase ``as follows:'' with a less detailed design criteria indicated by the phrase,''
*&blank;*&blank;* to be crash resistant *&blank;*&blank;*.'' Therefore, these amendments are adopted as revised.
Additionally, this revision answers the second commenter's perceived duplicity concerns.

Another commenter notes that the word `long' used in line 4 of &sect;29.952(f)(5) should be `along'. The FAA agrees
but no correction is necessary since this proposed paragraph was removed.

A commenter suggests that requirements for impact and tear resistance be included in the amendments. The commenter
correctly notes that the GASP report recommends specific impact and tear resistance values for civil rotorcraft
based on MIL&hyph;T&hyph;27422B requirements. The FAA agrees with the comment in general but notes that proposed
&sect;&sect;27.952(g) and 29.952(g) objectively requires that crash-resistant fuel cells be tear and impact resistant.
Further, it is intended that paragraphs 4.6.5.1 through 4.6.5.5 of MIL&hyph;T&hyph;27422B (modified for the civil
environment) may be used to provide one acceptable method of properly assessing impact and tear resistance. Therefore,
the amendments are adopted as proposed.

A commenter states full support for &sect;&sect;27.975(b) and 29.975(a)(7), which propose that the venting system
be designed to minimize spillage of fuel through the vents to an ignition source in the event of a rollover. However,
the comment suggests deletion of the phrase ``*&blank;*&blank;* is shown to be extremely improbable *&blank;*&blank;*''
because, in his view, in practical terms, it would be impossible for an applicant to demonstrate such a low probability.
The FAA agrees. The current term ``extremely remote'' rather than ``extremely improbable'' was intended. The FAA
has determined that ``extremely remote'' is the correct term. The amendments are adopted as proposed except for replacing
the word ``improbable'' with the word ``remote.''

Executive Order 12866 dated September 30, 1993, directs Federal agencies to promulgate new regulations and maintain
current regulations only if they are required by law, are necessary to interpret the law, or are made necessary by a
``compelling public need.'' The order also requires that agencies assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory
alternatives and select the alternative that maximizes the net benefits and imposes the least burden on society.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Additionally, the order requires agencies to submit a list of all rules, except those specifically exempted by the
Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) because they respond to emergency situations or other narrowly
defined exigencies, to determine if the rules constitute ``significant regulatory action.'' ``Significant regulatory
action'' means an action that is likely to result in a rule that may (1) have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million
or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs,
the environment, public health or safety, or state, local, or tribal governments or communities; (2) create a serious
inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially alter the
budgetary impact on entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients
thereof; or (4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the
principles set forth in the Executive Order. ``Significant regulatory action'' is submitted to centralized regulatory
review by OIRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OIRA and the FAA have determined that this rule is not ``a significant regulatory action.'' However, a cost-benefit
analysis, including evaluation of cost-reducing alternatives to this rule has been prepared. This analysis also
contains the regulatory flexibility determination required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act and a Trade Impact
Assessment. If more detailed economic information is desired, the reader may refer to the full evaluation contained
in the docket.

Benefits
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Studies have shown that a significant PCF hazards exist in rotorcraft operations. In a study of rotorcraft crashworthiness
dynamics, the FAA found that burn fatalities and injuries account for about 14 percent of rotorcraft accident casualties
and occur in about 20 percent of the accidents in which there are injuries. In a study comparing rotorcraft equipped
with and without a CRFS, the U.S. Army found that average thermal casualty costs per survivable accident were 95.4
percent lower in CRFS-equipped rotorcraft, and that 50 percent of all rotorcraft accidents with a PCF are survivable
prior to the onset of fire. An FAA review of NTSB rotorcraft accident data from 1983 through 1987 shows that 295 accidents
occurred that involved a crash landing or collision with an object resulting in fatalities, serious injuries, or
combinations of fatalities and injuries. Sixty-three of these accidents involved a PCF, in which about 77 percent
of the occupants were fatally injured, as compared to 42 percent of the occupants in accidents not involving a PCF.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the 63 accidents involving a PCF, there were 113 fatalities, 27 serious injuries, 5 minor injuries, and one noninjury.
The FAA estimates that the use of CRFS's would have altered these casualty distributions to approximately the following:
83 fatalities, 31 serious injuries, 24 minor injuries, and 8 noninjuries_a difference of 30 fewer fatalities with
some of the fatalities being reduced to serious injuries (4) and minor injuries (19).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to provide the public and government officials with a benchmark comparison of the expected safety benefits
of rulemaking actions with estimated costs over an extended period of time, the FAA currently uses a minimum value
of $1.5 million to statistically represent an avoided fatality. Serious injuries are estimated to have an average
cost of $640,000, and minor injuries are estimated to have an average cost of $2,300. Applying these values to the calculated
differences yields benefits of about $42 million [(30 fewer fatalities &times; $1.5 million) ^ (4 more serious injuries
&times; $640,000) ^ (19 more minor injuries &times; $2,300)]. The average benefit per accident involving a PCF is
approximately $670,000. Accounting for parts 27 and 29 separately, the average benefits are approximately $464,000
per part 27 rotorcraft accident involving a PCF and approximately $1,638,000 per part 29 rotorcraft accident involving
a PCF.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the 5-year study period, an average of 5,450 part 27 rotorcraft and an average of 1,150 part 29 rotorcraft were
in operation in the United States. During this period, the annual probability of a part 27 rotorcraft being involved
in a serious survivable accident with a PCF is estimated to be 1.903 &times; 10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
^3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 ((52 accidents / 5,450 part 27 rotorcraft) / 5 years). The corresponding probability for part 29 rotorcraft is 1.913
&times; 10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
^3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 ((11 accidents / 1,150 part 29 rotorcraft) / 5 years). Multiplying these probabilities by an estimated benefits per
accident with a PCF yields annual benefits of $885 per part 27 rotorcraft and $3,134 per part 29 rotorcraft. Assuming
15-year operating lives, these benefits when discounted equate to $3,103 per part 27 rotorcraft and $10,985 per part
29 rotorcraft.

Costs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule will increase costs for both rotorcraft manufacturers and operators. Manufacturers will incur increased
development, certification, and production costs; and operators (in addition to absorbing these costs in higher
rotorcraft acquisition costs) will incur increased operating costs due to the additional weight of the fuel system.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA estimates the development and certification costs per new rotorcraft certification will be $36,000. Most
of these costs are for testing, analysis, and documentation. The primary testing required by the rule is a test of each
fuel tank to show no loss of fuel under specified crash conditions. This can be accomplished by a simple, inexpensive
drop test.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There will be increased production costs associated with fuel tanks, fittings, and flexible fuel lines. The incremental
cost of a fuel tank meeting the requirements of the rule is estimated to be $30 per gallon of tank capacity. Part 27 rotorcraft
are assumed to have 50-gallon tanks that will cost $1,500 more as a result of this rule; part 29 rotorcraft are assumed
to have 200-gallon tanks costing $6,000 more. The FAA estimates that the cost per frangible, self-sealing fitting
is $60; that a typical part 27 rotorcraft will require 8 fittings, totaling $480; and that a typical part 29 rotorcraft
will require 10 fittings, totaling $600. Flexible fuel line sections are expected to add about $100 to the cost of a
fuel system for a part 27 rotorcraft and about $150 for a part 29 rotorcraft. The estimated total incremental production
costs are $2,080 per part 27 rotorcraft and $6,750 per part 29 rotorcraft.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that the rule will increase the weight of a part 27 rotorcraft by 9.5 pounds and a part 29 rotorcraft
by 33 pounds, and that each extra pound of weight increases average annual fuel consumption by 3.8 gallons per part
27 rotorcraft and 6.2 gallons per part 29 rotorcraft. Applying fuel prices of $1.87 per gallon for part 27 rotorcraft
and $1.78 for part 29 rotorcraft, the estimated increase in average annual operating costs is $68 ($1.87 &times; 3.8
gals. &times; 9.5 lbs.) per part 27 rotorcraft and $364 ($1.78 &times; 6.2 gals. &times; 33 lbs.) per part 29 rotorcraft.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assuming 15 years operating lives, the total incremental development, certification, production, and operating
costs when discounted are $1,426 per part 27 rotorcraft and $4,617 per part 29 rotorcraft.

Benefit/Costs Comparison

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Benefits exceed costs for both parts 27 and 29 rotorcraft. The net present value (discounted benefits minus discounted
costs) is $1,677 per part 27 rotorcraft and $6,368 per part 29 rotorcraft. The rule will be cost beneficial even if it
is only 50 percent effective in eliminating PCF fatalities and injuries.

Regulatory Flexibility Determination

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) of 1980 was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily
or disproportionately burdened by Government regulations. The RFA requires a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
if a rule is expected to have a ``significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' FAA Order
2100.14A, Regulatory Flexibility Criteria and Guidance, prescribes standards for complying with RFA review requirements
in FAA rulemaking actions. The FAA does not expect the rule to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small manufacturers or operators.

Trade Impact Assessment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The rule will have no impact on trade for either U.S. firms doing business in foreign markets or foreign firms doing
business in the United States. In the United States, foreign manufacturers must meet U.S. requirements, and thus
will gain no competitive advantage. In foreign countries, U.S. manufacturers are not bound by parts 27 and 29 requirements
and can choose whether or not to implement the provisions of this rule on the basis of competitive and other considerations.
Also, the Joint Airworthiness Authority (JAA) and Transport Canada are both in the process of adopting this rule.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the reasons discussed in the preamble and based on the findings in the Regulatory Flexibility Determination and
the Trade Impact Assessment, the FAA has determined that these amendments are not major under Executive Order 12866.
In addition, the FAA certifies that these amendments do not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. These amendments
are considered nonsignificant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). A regulatory
evaluation of the amendments, including a Regulatory Determination and Trade Impact Analysis, has been placed in
the docket. A copy may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket (AGC&hyph;10), Docket No. 26392, 800 Independence

Except for fuel tanks located so that tank rupture with fuel release to either significant ignition sources, such
as engines, heaters, and auxiliary power units, or occupants is extremely remote, each fuel tank must be designed
and installed to retain its contents under the following ultimate inertial load factors, acting alone.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fuel line self-sealing breakaway couplings. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Self-sealing breakaway couplings must be installed unless hazardous relative motion of fuel system components
to each other or to local rotorcraft structure is demonstrated to be extremely improbable or unless other means are
provided. The couplings or equivalent devices must be installed at all fuel tank-to-fuel line connections, tank-to-tank
interconnects, and at other points in the fuel system where local structural deformation could lead to the release
of fuel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The design and construction of self-sealing breakaway couplings must incorporate the following design features:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The load necessary to separate a breakaway coupling must be between 25 to 50 percent of the minimum ultimate failure
load (ultimate strength) of the weakest component in the fluid-carrying line. The separation load must in no case
be less than 300 pounds, regardless of the size of the fluid line.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A breakaway coupling must separate whenever its ultimate load (as defined in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section)
is applied in the failure modes most likely to occur.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) All breakaway couplings must incorporate design provisions to visually ascertain that the coupling is locked
together (leak-free) and is open during normal installation and service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) All breakaway couplings must incorporate design provisions to prevent uncoupling or unintended closing due
to operational shocks, vibrations, or accelerations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) No breakaway coupling design may allow the release of fuel once the coupling has performed its intended function.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) All individual breakaway couplings, coupling fuel feed systems, or equivalent means must be designed, tested,
installed, and maintained so that inadvertent fuel shutoff in flight is improbable in accordance with &sect;27.955(a)
and must comply with the fatigue evaluation requirements of &sect;27.571 without leaking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Alternate, equivalent means to the use of breakaway couplings must not create a survivable impact-induced load
on the fuel line to which it is installed greater than 25 to 50 percent of the ultimate load (strength) of the weakest
component in the line and must comply with the fatigue requirements of &sect;27.571 without leaking.

Frangible or deformable structural attachments.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Unless hazardous relative motion of fuel tanks and fuel system components to local rotorcraft structure is demonstrated
to be extremely improbable in an otherwise survivable impact, frangible or locally deformable attachments of fuel
tanks and fuel system components to local rotorcraft structure must be used. The attachment of fuel tanks and fuel
system components to local rotorcraft structure, whether frangible or locally deformable, must be designed such
that its separation or relative local deformation will occur without rupture or local tear-out of the fuel tank or
fuel system components that will cause fuel leakage. The ultimate strength of frangible or deformable attachments
must be as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The load required to separate a frangible attachment from its support structure, or deform a locally deformable
attachment relative to its support structure, must be between 25 and 50 percent of the minimum ultimate load (ultimate
strength) of the weakest component in the attached system. In no case may the load be less than 300 pounds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A frangible or locally deformable attachment must separate or locally deform as intended whenever its ultimate
load (as defined in paragraph (d)(1) of this section) is applied in the modes most likely to occur.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

arrangement for the spaces between the liner and its container must maintain the proper relationship to tank vent
pressures for any expected flight condition.

In addition_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Each filler must be marked as prescribed in &sect;27.1557(c)(1);

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This action amends the operational guidelines of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part 101 for model rockets
that: use not more than 125 grams (4.4 ounces) of propellant; are made of paper, wood, or breakable plastic; contain
no substantial metal parts; and weigh not more than 1,500 grams (53 ounces). This amendment is necessary to provide
for the operation of the technologically advanced, larger category, model rockets and to ensure that their operation
is in concert with the maximum level of safety protection for aircraft, flight crews, and the flying public. The FAA
believes that this amendment will foster important aeronautical education and research activities, while retaining
appropriate operational safety precautions.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On May 28, 1985, the National Association of Rocketry (NAR) and the Hobby Industry Association (HIA) filed a joint
petition requesting that the FAA amend 14 CFR 101.1, by raising the upper weight limit on excepted model rockets from
16 ounces to 1,500 grams (approximately 53 ounces) and the allowable propellant mass from 4 ounces to 125 grams (approximately
4.4 ounces). At present, 14 CFR 101.1 exempts ``model'' rockets having no more than 4.0 ounces of propellant and weighing
no more than 16 ounces, including the propellent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the NAR/HIA joint petition, the FAA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), Notice 92&hyph;12,
57 FR 41628, Sep. 10, 1992. Notice 92&hyph;12 proposed to amend 14 CFR Part 101 by adding &sect;101.22, Special provisions
for larger model rockets, and by amending &sect;101.25, Notice requirements, to accommodate larger model rockets.
In summary, model rockets that use not more than 125 grams of propellant; that weigh not more than 1,500 grams, including
the propellant; that are constructed principally of paper, wood, or breakable plastic, and continue to have no substantial
metal parts; may be operated in a controlled airspace, within 5 miles of the boundary of any airport, within 1,500 feet
of any person or property that is not associated with the operations or at night. These operations may be conducted,
provided that persons operating these model rockets give prior notification of launch activities and other pertinent
launch information to the FAA Air Traffic Control (ATC) facility nearest the place of intended operation between
24 and 48 hours prior to beginning the operation and the manager of any airport whose landing area or runway is within
5 miles of the model rocket launch site.

Analysis of Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Interested persons were invited to participate in this rulemaking effort by submitting written data, views, or arguments.
All comments received during the comment period were considered before making a determination regarding this final
rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the comment period, a total of 117 comments were received in response to Notice 92&hyph;12. Two comments were
received from the NAR, and one comment each, from the Airline Pilots Association (ALPA), the Arizona Pilots Association,
the Airport Transport Association (ATA), and the National Fire Protection Association. Ninety-one comments were
received from individuals, eight from pilots, six from model rocket associations, three from teachers/professional
educators, and one each from a scientist, an aerospace educational organization, and a model rocket manufacturer.
A discussion of these comments follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter supports the NPRM as written. All other commenters oppose the NPRM and support, instead, either the
original NAR petition or the development of regulatory action which proposes fewer model rocket notification requirements.
Comments opposing the NPRM are summarized in the following categories, each of which is subsequently discussed more
fully:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Approximately 95 commenters state there is no need for a separate category of ``Large Model Rockets''; they favor
adoption of NAR's original petition for rulemaking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Approximately 74 commenters believe the NPRM's proposed notification requirements are burdensome and unnecessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Approximately 8 commenters state the FAA needs to update its rules to reflect the current technology of model rocketry
and to promote the inherent educational value of the hobby.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Approximately 3 commenters oppose both the NPRM and NAR's original petition for rulemaking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Approximately 4 commenters suggest regulatory alternatives to the NPRM.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters oppose the proposal to establish a separate category of ``Large Model Rockets'' and instead
support the NAR's original petition to broaden the exempt definition of model rockets. Based upon NAR and FAA studies,
commenters argue that air traffic will not be adversely affected by the NAR's requested increase in the maximum, unregulated
model rocket liftoff and propellant weight. The NAR reiterates that, ``not a single documented incident of model
rockets interfering with aviation, hitting or harming aircraft on ascent or descent of the rocket, or impairing aircraft
flight operations has occurred''. Commenters attribute this enviable safety record to rocketeers' voluntary compliance
with the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Model Rocket Safety Code.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Accordingly, they consider the code and a rocketeer's own visual and aural check as sufficient launch safety measures.
Moreover, several commenters assert that increasing model rocket weight may actually improve model rocket safety
as heavier rockets are purported to have larger drag coefficients, achieve lower altitudes, have shorter flight
duration, and be more easily seen by aircraft than lighter rockets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA agrees that the model rocket industry has a long and distinguished record of safety. However, as noted in Notice
92&hyph;12, the FAA must acknowledge the remote, yet inherent increase in hazard potential that accompanies greater
model rocket propellant/mass weight. This consideration is particularly relevant for general aviation aircraft
and rotorcraft, which operate at a lower velocity and flight altitude, making them especially vulnerable to collision
with larger, more powerful model rockets. In order to provide a maximum level of safety protection to aircraft passengers
and crew members, the FAA has determined that operational safeguards, beyond the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Model Rocket Safety Code
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and rocketeers' own diligence, are needed for larger rockets with greater propellant/mass weight. Therefore, a
regulatory category that segregates larger rockets from smaller rockets is required.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of commenters believe that the proposed notification requirements for ``Large Model Rocket'' launches
are unnecessary and burdensome. Commenters argue that the FAA has cited ``no cases where notification would have
increased air safety above and beyond .&blank;.&blank;. current regulations which require no notification.''
Several commenters also mention the potential for conflict to occur between lawful rocketeers and airport/ATC officials
who are unfamiliar with model rocketry and with 14 CFR Part 101 entitlement. Two commenters detail occasions where
misinformation was believed to have resulted in the denial of waiver applications or the interruption of model rocket
launch competitions. Commenters are equally troubled by the requirement to notify air traffic officials within
24 to 48 hours of ``Large Model Rocket'' launches, regardless of where these launches occur.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed notification requirements assist the FAA and airport officials in determining how model rocket launch
activities may affect flight operations in a given area. The proposed requirements are not intended to hinder or minimize
model rocket activity, but merely to ensure that airspace is mutually accommodating of both model rocket operations
and aircraft operations. To this end, FAA or airport officials review model rocket launch information and make it
available to pilots, as necessary, via air traffic control or through Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) publications. NOTAMs
highlight events that may result in airspace restrictions and give time frames in which restrictions will be in effect.
Review of NOTAMs offers pilots an opportunity to adjust or reschedule their flight plans in light of planned aerial
activity. Because a pilot's awareness of model rocket launches enhances this safety process, the proposed notification
requirements are beneficial. Additionally, to facilitate disclosure of requested model rocket launch data, the
NPRM proposed a decrease in the amount and specificity of information currently required from rocketeers. For example,
when there are multiple participants at a single event, rather than give names and addresses for every rocketeer,
a single person may be designated as the event launch coordinator for the operation. Similarly, rather than provide
the specific number, size, weight, and maximum altitude of each rocket to be launched, the appropriate individual
may estimate the information. The FAA further concludes that the current level of safety will not be decreased by utilizing
the less restrictive reporting requirements as proposed in the NPRM when a single name and address of the person provided
is that of the event launch coordinator, and this person is the one who has provided the other required launch data estimates
for that event.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters recommend that notification of the airport manager or FAA tower facility be required only when
large model rockets will be launched into controlled airspace or within 5 miles of an airport.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current prohibition against operating such model rockets in controlled airspace, within 5 miles of an airport,
within 1,500 feet of any non-participant, or between sunset and sunrise, will not apply provided the person operating
the model rocket complies with the proposed modified provisions of &sect;101.25. The intent of the notice requirement
is not to exclude or hinder model rocket operations, but to provide notification of such operations to afford an adequate
level of safety for person and property in the air, as well as on the ground.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters maintain that the notice requirement is unrealistic for several reasons: Model rocket launch times are
inherently unpredictable as they are dependent upon favorable cloud cover and weather conditions; many impromptu
launches occur at model rocket meets, making it difficult to give prior disclosure of the total number of participants
and other launch information; the notification process may prove too complex for novice or youthful rocketeers;
and, the notification process is likely to be cost intensive to the FAA, as the agency will be forced to process a presumably
high number of waiver applications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA disagrees that the notification process may prove too complex for novice or youthful rocketeers. Through
voluntary compliance with the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Model Rocket Safety Code,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 model rocketeers of all ages have proven a ready aptitude and willingness for ensuring launch safety and have demonstrated
an awareness of how to knowledgeably operate scientific equipment. The effective handling of these important responsibilities
is believed to be an accurate indicator of rocketeers' ability to adhere to the proposed notification requirements.
The FAA acknowledges that the agency will incur costs in receiving, recording, and evaluating notification information;
but, the agency determines these costs to be minor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters believe the FAA needs to update 14 CFR Part 101 to reflect the current technology of model rocketry
and to promote the inherent educational value of the hobby. According to the NAR, original model rocket limitations
were set in light of what was the only foreseeable type of model rocket propellant at the time, black powder. Over the
years, new propellant technologies have emerged that are vastly superior to black powder, both in terms of specific
impulse and a capability to accommodate more complex payloads, e.g. cameras, radio control receivers, and computer
equipment. One commenter mentions that it is difficult to construct these payloads while remaining within the present
16 ounce total weight limitation. Most commenters agree that the more diverse payloads available with larger-sized
rockets present unique opportunities for promoting scientific study. Teachers and rocketry clubs report using
larger rockets as educational aids. Science professionals use them in collecting data and conducting analysis.
These groups believe their efforts help the United States remain academically and technologically competitive.
As such, they assert that the FAA's proposed restrictions on large model rockets are counterproductive to scientific
achievement and overall growth of the model rocket industry.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Three major factors form the basis of the proposed amendment: (1) The FAA's support in fostering public interest in
aeronautics through model rocketry; (2) the agency's recognition of the importance for model rocketeers to utilize
state-of-the-art technology to enhance educational value and international competitiveness; and (3) the agency's
responsibility to ensure aircraft flight safety. Accordingly, the proposed amendment reflects the FAA's desire
to support the advancement of model rocketry while maintaining an assurance that larger and faster rockets do not
jeopardize the safety of aircraft in flight.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters oppose both the NPRM and NAR's original petition. The Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) and the
Air Transport Association (ATA) believe that the larger and more powerful rockets pose a potential threat to air traffic
safety. Both organizations underscore the point that larger model rockets are capable of achieving aircraft cruising
altitudes. In this regard, ALPA believes collision with a model rocket can cause aircraft damage beyond that ``comparable
to the impact of large hailstones'' and that penetration of the aircraft wing skin is likely. For this reason, ALPA
believes that the current provisions of 14 CFR Part 101 best ensure safety and recommends that the notification requirements
be applied to any rocket firing surpassing 1500 feet above ground level (AGL), regardless of airport proximity. Additionally,
ALPA recommends that a safety officer should visually survey rocket firings in controlled areas and manufacturers
should provide a copy of applicable FAA regulations relating to launch activities. The ATA favors ensuring safety
by permitting no unmanned rockets within a 30-mile radius of regulated airspace.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA acknowledges a minimal risk increase in hazard potential that accompanies the operation of larger, more powerful
rockets. This minimal risk increase was confirmed by a March 1991 FAA study, Model Rocketry Hazard Study, conducted
as part of the agency's analysis of in-flight collision probability between aircraft and model rockets. In concert
with the study's final report recommendation, Notice 92&hyph;12 proposed certain guidelines for large model rocket
launches. These proposed guidelines, together with rocketeers' proven launch safety vigilance, effectively lessen
the minimal risk increase in hazard potential associated with heavier model rockets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter concurs with the safety concerns raised by ATA and ALPA and alleges that hazardous incidents have occurred
with larger model rockets. This commenter believes that present technology offers model rockets sufficient propellant
capacity so that the FAA should set a maximum allowable rocket weight of 3 pounds and hold propellant mass to a maximum
62.5 grams. To further ensure safety, this commenter recommends that the FAA establish clear, defined limits for
model rocket construction material. The commenter contends that ``hi-tech'' paper and plastic are being used to
construct more durable rockets than 14 CFR 101 intends.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No data was provided by the commenter to support the allegation, and the FAA has no other data which substantiates any
occurrence of hazardous instances with larger model rockets. The FAA shares the viewpoint that model rockets only
be constructed of paper and other breakable material. To reiterate this agency intent, Notice 92&hyph;12 maintains
the current language of &sect;101.1(c), which outlines appropriate material for model rocket construction. However,
to issue explicit direction on the manufacture of model rockets, which appears to be the commenter's suggestion,
goes beyond the FAA's regulatory purview.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters asked that the FAA create a uniform set of regulations pertaining specifically to model rockets
weighing greater than 53 ounces launch weight. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA acknowledges the commenters' suggestions and concerns. However, since Notice 92&hyph;12 conveyed only
those proposals contained in the original NAR petition. Recommendations to create an additional set of uniform rules
specifically for model rockets would be a separate rulemaking action and is beyond the scope of this particular action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NAR and several other commenters assert that an apparent typographical error in Notice 92&hyph;12 incorrectly
reports the NAR's estimate of model rocket launches as 250,000 since the inception of the sport. Commenters state
that the appropriate number, as submitted in NAR's 1985 study, is 250,000,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has investigated the commenters' assertion and noted that Notice 92&hyph;12 reference was ``250,000 launches
of model rockets since the inception of the sport .&blank;.&blank;.'' The estimate, as contained in the NAR report
is, ``At the time the NAR's petition was submitted in 1985, NAR informed the FAA that more than 250,000,000 launches
had been made.'' Because the number of launches of model rockets since the inception of the sport was not used in any
FAA rulemaking calculations, the correct figure is hereby noted in this document and has no further bearing on this
rulemaking activity.

Cost-Benefit Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA has determined that this final rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'', as defined by Executive Order
12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review). The anticipated costs and benefits associated with this final rule are summarized
below. (A detailed discussion of costs and benefits is contained in the full evaluation in the docket for this final
rule).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Costs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule for unmanned rockets consists of provisions that specify what persons operating certain model rockets
(rockets using not more than 125 grams of propellant; made of paper, wood, or breakable plastic; containing no substantial
metal parts, and weighing not more than 1500 grams including propellant) would be required to do. The final rule is
designed to accommodate the advancement of model rocketry with regulations that will also provide an adequate level
of assurance that such rockets will not jeopardize the safety of aircraft in flight.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that the changes in the final rule will have a no cost impact to users of model rockets. In fact, the
changes might produce a cost savings. The savings associated with these changes, however are considered negligible
and unquantifiable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 101.22(a)(2), however, may impose minor costs on the FAA. Persons operating model rockets will have to provide
the information required in existing &sect;101.25 to the manager of that airport and to the FAA ATC facility that is
nearest the place of the intended operation. The FAA would then incur costs associated with receiving, recording,
and evaluating the material that has been received. The FAA believes that these costs will be minor.

Benefits
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule will provide benefits, in that the FAA has determined that the final regulations will accommodate the
advancement of model rocketry and simultaneously provide an adequate level of assurance that such rockets will not
jeopardize the safety of aircraft in flight.

Conclusions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based upon the fact that there are little or no compliance costs coupled with the potential benefits, the FAA concludes
that the final rule is cost beneficial.

Regulatory Flexibility Determination
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily
and disproportionately burdened by government regulations. The RFA requires agencies to review rules that may have
``a significant cost impact on a substantial number of small entities.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regards to this regulatory evaluation, there is no cost associated with any of the amendments. The FAA has determined
that the amendments contained herein will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities.

International Trade Impact Assessment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendments apply to users of model rockets in the United States only. There is no economic impact resulting from
any of the amendments and the FAA has determined that these regulations will not have an impact on international trade.

Federalism Determination
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship between
the national government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the reasons discussed in the preamble, and based on the findings in the Regulatory Flexibility Determination
and the International Trade Impact Assessment, the FAA has determined that this regulation is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. This rule is not considered significant under DOT Order 2100.5,
Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). In addition, the FAA certifies that this rule will not have
a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A regulatory evaluation of the final rule, including a Regulatory Flexibility
Determination and Trade Impact Assessment, has been placed in the docket. A copy may be obtained by contacting the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 16762) a proposal to amend 50 CFR part 20, with comment periods ending July 21 for early-season proposals and
September 2 for late-season proposals. The deadline for late-season proposals was subsequently extended to September
9 in the September 7

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 46320). These regulations would be proposed for certain designated members of the avian families Anatidae
(ducks, geese, and swans); Columbidae (doves and pigeons), Gruidae (cranes); Rallidae (rails, coots, moorhens,
and gallinules); and Scolopacidae (woodcock and snipe). These species are designated as ``migratory game birds''
in conventions between the United States and several foreign nations for the protection and management of these birds.
All other birds designated as migratory (under 10.13 of Subpart B of 50 CFR Part 10) in the aforementioned conventions
may not be hunted. On June 8, 1994, the Service published for public comment a second document (59 FR 29700) which provided
supplemental proposals for early- and late-season migratory bird hunting regulations frameworks. On June 23, 1994,
a public hearing was held in Washington, DC, an announced in the April 7 and June 8

, to review the status of waterfowl. Proposed hunting regulations were discussed for these late seasons. On August
17, 1994, the Service published a fourth document (59 FR 42474) containing final frameworks for early migratory bird
hunting seasons from which wildlife conservation agency officials from the States, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands
selected early-season hunting dates, hours, areas, and limits for 1994&hyph;95. The fifth document in the series,
published August 24, 1994 (59 FR 43684), dealt specifically with proposed frameworks for the 1994&hyph;95 late-season
migratory bird hunting regulations. On September 1, 1994, the Service published in the

 consisting of final late-season frameworks for migratory game bird hunting regulations, from which State wildlife
conservation agency officials selected late-season hunting dates, hours, areas, and limits for 1994&hyph;95.
The final rule described here is the ninth in a series of proposed, supplemental, and final rulemaking documents for
migratory game bird hunting regulations and deals specifically with amending subpart K of CFR part 20 to set hunting
seasons, hours, areas, and limits for species subject to late-season regulations and those for early seasons that
were previously deferred.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NEPA considerations are covered by the programmatic document, ``Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement:
Issuance of Annual Regulations Permitting the Sport Hunting of Migratory Birds (FSES 88&hyph;14),'' filed with
EPA on June 9, 1988. Notice of Availability was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on June 16, 1988 (53 FR 22582). The Service's Record of Decision was published on August 18, 1988 (53 FR 31341). However,
this programmatic document does not prescribe year-specific regulations; those are developed annually. The annual
regulations and options are being considered in the Environmental Assessment, ``Waterfowl Hunting Regulations
for 1994,'' which is available upon request.

Endangered Species Act Consideration
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In August 1994, the Division of Endangered Species concluded that the proposed action is not likely to jeopardize
the continued existence of listed species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of their critical
habitats. Hunting regulations are designed, among other things, to remove or alleviate chances of conflict between
seasons for migratory game birds and the protection and conservation of endangered and threatened species and their
habitats. The Service's biological opinions resulting from its consultation under section 7 are considered public
documents and are available for inspection in the Division of Endangered Species and the Office of Migratory Bird
Management.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule establishes minimum standards for real estate appraisals made by staff, fee panel and contract appraisers
in determining the maximum insurable mortgage amount in most HUD/FHA single family (one-to-four family) and multifamily
transactions; and establishes criteria for the selection of appraisers by mortgagees. The rule also distinguishes
those appraisals that may be performed by state licensed appraisers from those that must be performed by state certified
appraisers.

II. Publication of the Proposed Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 16, 1993, the Department published in the above Docket, at 58 FR 48556, a proposed rule entitled ``Appraisals
and Property Valuation''. The proposal, among other things, would promulgate a new part 267 to title 24 of the Code
of Federal Regulations containing minimum standards for HUD real estate appraisals and criteria for the selection
of appraisers by mortgagees. The preamble to the proposed rule describes, in greater detail than below, the legislative
background for this rulemaking and set the rulemaking in the context of certain administrative changes that the Department
had been considering on its own initiative. The preamble also explains the significant provisions of proposed part
267 as well as certain conforming amendments to other parts of HUD regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule implements two statutory provisions. Section 142 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform
Act of 1989 (Reform Act) requires that the appraisal of all property securing an FHA-insured mortgage be performed
in accordance with generally approved appraisal standards.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 322 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act (Cranston-Gonzalez) provides that single
family Direct Endorsement (DE) mortgagees may choose the appraisers who evaluate properties securing FHA-insured
mortgages and states that those appraisers may be legal entities as well as natural persons.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Furthermore, as explained in the proposed rule, HUD, on its own initiative, has been revising its procedures for qualifying
appraisers and for requiring their use in various FHA programs. The objective is to identify under each program the
particular method of determining who is qualified to perform the appraisal, consultancy or other type of evaluation,
based on differences inherent in the broad range of insurance programs that comprise Titles I and II of the National
Housing Act (Act, NHA).

As a consequence of the Congressional mandates and its own initiatives, the Department published the proposed rule
which elicited 384 written public comments. Some of these comments raised a single issue, while others expressed
multiple questions or concerns. Many were repetitive. In this rule, a number of changes are the direct consequence
of, or are easily traceable to, public comments, as explained below. Also being adopted are changes originated by
the Department as a result of having further considered its proposal. Mainly, these modifications are designed to
simplify the rule in its final form and to address comments which objected to the burdensomeness of several proposed
requirements. In addition, there are a number of editorial revisions that were needed to correct errors and improve
readability; they are self-explanatory and are not discussed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Differences Between the Proposed and Final Rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule differs from the proposal in two general respects. The first difference is in response to a view expressed
by several commenters that the proposed rule was difficult to follow and should be split into separate rules covering
single family and multifamily programs, respectively. HUD does not believe that such radical restructuring is necessary
but does recognize that FHA's single and multifamily programs differ enough that a division of the proposed rule's
content along those lines would be helpful. Consequently, the final rule has reorganized the new part 267 into three
subparts. Subpart A includes material common to both single and multifamily programs, subpart B relates exclusively
to single family programs and subpart C relates only to multifamily programs. This revision has necessitated a technical,
non-substantive redrafting of various proposed sections, e.g., the definition of ``appraisal'' has been tailored
to fit subparts B and C, but these changes do not affect meaning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not as obvious is a shift in the final rule toward a less incursive regulatory posture that gives greater recognition
to accepted industry standards and practices. Several HUD standards contained in the proposal are being deleted
and the Departure Provision of the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) is being acknowledged
with respect to single family programs. Regarding this latter change, FHA currently requires that all single family
appraisals be ``complete appraisals'', as that term is defined under Standard 1 of USPAP, but instances may arise
when the Departure Provision will be invoked to authorize ``limited appraisals'' under specific circumstances
and on a case-by-case basis. In general, we are increasingly convinced that, with legislative prompting, the appraisal
profession is moving in the direction of effective self-regulation and that HUD should limit its role to adapting
industry requirements and practices to particular FHA needs rather than competing with broader ongoing efforts
to improve the reliability of residential appraisals and the overall performance of the appraisal industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Set forth below is a discussion of significant changes from the proposed rule contained in each of the three subparts
of new part 267. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 -->
Subpart A_General 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In &sect;267.1 (applicability), paragraph (b)(2) has been changed to add a reference to &sect;201.23(b)(3) regarding
the ``trade-in'' of a borrower's equity in a manufactured home. As a result, part 267 now excludes appraisals used
in determining the borrower's equity in an existing manufactured home traded for a new manufactured home to be purchased
with a Title I loan. This reference was inadvertently omitted from the proposed rule. Also, in paragraph (b)(3) of
&sect;267.1, the exception for property improvement loans has been broadened by changing the phrase ``one- to-four
family dwellings'' to ``property'' since the exception should cover Title I commercial and multifamily property
improvement loans as well as one-to-four family dwellings. The paragraph has also been revised to reflect a recent
decision by the Department to enhance the Title I program.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
``FIRREA'' (Title XI of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act 1989) has been included
as definition (d) under &sect;267.2 to aid the reader. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A broad description of ``Single family program'' has been included as definition (j) under &sect;267.2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``USPAP'' has been included as definition (l) under &sect;267.2 and to it has been added the provision of former &sect;267.4(c)(4).
That provision states the Department's policy of recognizing any changes or additions to USPAP which the Appraisal
Standards Board may from time to time adopt, unless HUD publishes in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 its decision not to recognize a change or addition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;267.3, paragraph (b)(1) [formerly &sect;267.6(b)(1)] prohibits certain discriminatory acts. It has
been extensively revised in response to numerous comments about the burdensomeness for mortgagees of reporting
on the relative frequency with which they use women and minority status appraisers. At the same time, we have been careful
to ensure the public availability of the data which would have been provided by those reports and which for single family
programs the Department will now obtain elsewhere in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of &sect;267.3. The Department
will be scrutinizing that data carefully. We will not countenance discrimination by lenders against female and minority
status appraisers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For single family programs, HUD will compile an annual report directly from information which the Department will
maintain for each appraiser listed on the Roster. Information with respect to gender and minority status will be furnished
by the appraiser at the time he or she applies for listing. This is permitted by the newly-added reference to ``such
further information as HUD may require'' in &sect;267.8(d)(2). When the mortgagee accesses the Computerized Homes
Underwriting Management System (CHUMS), giving the appraiser's certification or license number, the information
on the appraiser will be recorded from the Roster data bank. For fee panel appraisers, HUD will record the information
from the Roster data at the time the panelist is assigned. The Department will be able to prepare the annual report directly
from this information and will make it available to members of the public upon request. See &sect;267.3(c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to multifamily programs, there do not exist systems analogous to CHUMS and the Roster, and consequently
the data must be furnished by Delegated Processors, contract appraisers and consultants, and each housing finance
agency (HFA) participating in the Department's HFA Risk-Sharing Program. Since the number of multifamily cases
processed is considerably less than single family activity during a given time span, this burden should not be unreasonable.
Details of this reporting requirement will be specified in one of the terms of the contract/agreements which HUD executes
with its Delegated Processors, contract appraisers and consultants and HFAs. Because reporting under multifamily
programs is being implemented by contractural obligation, and because that obligation is not set forth under existing
contracts, the data will not become immediately available when this rule takes effect. As of the effective date provided
at the beginning of this preamble, however, all new contractural agreements and all renewals or renegotiations of
existing agreements will provide for the data to be furnished thereafter. See &sect;267.3(c)(5). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;267.6(c) relating to competency is now paragraph &sect;267.3(d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new &sect;267.4, entitled `` waiver'', has been added at the end of subpart A. The section authorizes the Assistant
Secretary-Commissioner to waive any requirement in part 267 not mandated by statute when enforcement of that requirement
would adversely affect the purposes of the NHA. It is unlikely that this waiver authority would be invoked often under
part 267. However, HUD has been including a similar waiver provision in many recently adopted rules because it does
permit administrative flexibility in unusual circumstances when invariable application of a rule would be unfair
or contrary to program objectives.

Subpart B_Single Family Programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In &sect;267.5, entitled ``Definitions applicable to single family programs'', paragraph (a), defining ``Appraisal'',
no longer includes the phrase ``as estimated by HUD staff or an appraiser under contract with HUD'' which appeared
in proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;267.2(b)(2). The effect of this change is that the DE lender, not HUD, will be responsible for estimating replacement
cost under the section 220 single family program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In customary usage, the term ``single family'' is well established. However, there are FHA programs that do not fit
the usual concept of one-to-four family dwellings, yet are governed by one-to-four family appraisal standards and
procedures, specifically, Title I multifamily and non-residential property improvement loans. The revised definition
(c) under &sect;267.5, ``one-to-four family residential property'', covers this anomaly. Note that there is no
parallel definition of multifamily programs, which simply include all other FHA mortgage origination transactions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 267.6 follows proposed &sect;267.3, but with minor editing to improve readability and clarity.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 267.7, Appraisal standards, represents an extensive revision of proposed &sect;267.4 on this subject.
Specifically: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The proposed rule stated that the USPAP Departure Provision would not apply to FHA single family appraisals. The
preamble to the proposed rule stated a concern that the Provision might be used to dispense with important information
gathering. (See 58 FR 48560). After considering the matter more fully, we have decided that this concern is unjustified.
Each of the appraisal forms permitted by HUD makes clear what information is required and any deficiency should be
readily noticed by the review appraiser or underwriter. Also, the Provision will only be invoked under unusual circumstances,
subject to mutual agreement of the mortgagee and appraiser, after obtaining consent from the local HUD office. Should
appropriate circumstances arise and a complete appraisal not be required, the Provision gives HUD the administrative
flexibility to save the parties needless expense. The Department expects that eventually, as experience is gained,
a handbook addition or other directive will be issued with respect to Departure situations in single family programs.
In view of the foregoing, the Provision is being given recognition for single family programs and reference to it (as
being inapplicable) has been dropped from former &sect;267.4(a)(1), now &sect;267.7(a)(1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Section 267.4(a)(3) of the proposed rule is being deleted as unnecessary and somewhat redundant since &sect;267.7(a)(8)
of the final rule covers the question of property valuation methods in greater detail. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Section 267.4(a)(4)(i) of the proposed rule described the appraisal report forms. That section has been revised
in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;267.7(a) of the final rule to extract the language pertinent to single family programs. Two Federal National
Mortgage Association forms are also being added as acceptable for FHA single family purposes; these are somewhat
more detailed than the Uniform Residential Appraisal Report and offer an alternative means of presenting the data.
In addition, former &sect;267.4(a)(4)(iii) required sufficient ``depth of analysis'' to reflect the complexity
of the property. HUD has concluded that the data necessary for an appraisal which satisfies the other FHA standards
will necessarily reveal whether the property is complex so as to require a certified rather than a licensed appraiser.
Therefore, the need for this separate and rather vague standard is avoided and the language of proposed &sect;267.4(a)(4)(iii)
has been dropped from this final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Proposed &sect;267.4(a)(7) is being deleted as not really pertinent for single family programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Proposed &sect;267.4(a)(11) is being deleted to simplify the appraiser's responsibilities. We agree with several
commenters that the added burden of requiring the appraiser to check the property's legal description is not justified
by the remote likelihood of a mistake in the address. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Section 267.7(a)(8) still requires the appraiser to certify that the racial/ethnic composition of the neighborhood
has in no way affected the appraisal determination. However, the phrase ``or socioeconomic'' has been dropped as
part of this certification. The term was not susceptible to a clear understanding. It was, in fact, misleading, since
the economic composition of the surrounding neighborhood, e.g., level of property maintenance, is a valid consideration
in determining value, whereas any consideration of the social mix and demographics is precluded by the rule's explicit
warning that the appraiser must not give weight to racial and ethnic aspects of the neighborhood
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

In addition to the certification requirement of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;267.7(a)(8) it should also be noted that the Uniform Residential Appraisal Report Form states in bold type
that ``[r]ace and the racial composition of the neighborhood are not appraisal factors.''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(7) Proposed &sect;267.4(a)(12), now &sect;267.7(a)(9), describing valuation methods, has been revised to extract
the relevant single family provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 267.8(a)(1)(i)(A) of the rule contains a parenthetical phrase to make clear that a mortgagee selecting an
appraisal organization may also select a particular employee within that organization to perform the appraisal.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 267.8(c)(1) embodies the prohibitions of proposed &sect;267.5(c), but has been simplified in one respect.
Proposed &sect;267.5(c)(1) addressed contracts between the mortgagee and the appraiser if the two were affiliated.
While this relationship is still prohibited in multifamily cases, in single family programs, where DE mortgagees
may employ staff appraisers, it is inconsistent with much of the lending industry's practice. The prohibition has
therefore been dropped from &sect;267.8(c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;267.8(d)(1), the list of legal entities which, together with natural persons, comprise eligible types
of appraisers has been expanded from the list in &sect;267.5(d)(1) of the proposed rule to include joint ventures,
limited liability companies and other organizations. In addition, &sect;267.8(d)(1) has been redrafted to explain
the options available to a DE mortgagee in need of an appraiser, i.e., an independent contractor, a staff employee
or a fee panelist. Section 267.5(d)(1) of the proposed rule did not cover these options; paragraphs (d)(1)(i), (d)(1)(ii)
and (d)(1)(iii) focused instead on appraiser qualifications, which made them somewhat redundant since appraiser
qualifications were also set forth in &sect;267.5(d)(2), now &sect;267.8(d)(2), describing the Roster. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;267.5(d)(1)(iv) has been incorporated into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;267.8 (d)(1) of this rule and revised to make it clear that the mortgagee and appraiser share not only concurrent
but also equal responsibility for the accuracy and thoroughness of an appraisal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;267.8(d)(2), the appraiser, rather than providing evidence of compliance with the items listed in proposed

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;267.5(d) (2)(i)&hyph;(vi), may now certify that he or she satisfies the requirements of that paragraph. Also,
two of the proposed requirements have been dropped: there is no obligation to obtain errors and omissions insurance
unless the mortgagee requires it and there is no fee for being listed on the Roster. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 267.8(f)(1) [proposed &sect;267.5(h)] no longer requires as a condition to transferring an appraisal that
the accepting mortgagee have ``adopted appraisal review procedures in accordance with this part''. Inclusion of
this condition in the proposed rule was an error. There is no appraisal review procedure contained in the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 267.5(f) of the proposed rule, regarding the extent to which others may assist the appraiser, has been deleted.
As explained above, the thrust of many changes which distinguish this rule from the proposal is to place a greater reliance
on USPAP and, wherever possible, to achieve compatibility with generally accepted practices of the appraisal industry.
Consistent with this approach, the Department looks to USPAP to set criteria for the ``assistance of others''.

Finally, mention should be made of the conforming amendment under 24 CFR part 204, Coinsurance, contained in the proposed
rule (58 FR 48566). On March 30, 1994 (59 FR 14809, Docket No. R&hyph;94&hyph;1717), the Department proposed termination
of its single family coinsurance program but the proceeding in Docket No. R&hyph;94&hyph;1717 is still open. Until
final action is taken, part 204 remains in effect and is being amended by this rule.

Section 267.9, Definitions applicable to multifamily programs, extracts from &sect;267.2 of the proposed rule
those definitions pertinent to multifamily programs. As with &sect;267.5, some editorial changes have been required
to accommodate this separation of the definitions from the format in which they were proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 267.10, Qualified appraisers and appraisals, derives from &sect;267.3 of the proposal. It has been redrafted
to fit exclusively multifamily programs. Note also that paragraph (a) provides for HUD employees performing multifamily
appraisals to be qualified as certified general appraisers not later than December 31, 1996, unless the Assistant
Secretary-Commissioner specifies otherwise in an individual case. It is FHA's goal to qualify its staff appraisers
in accordance with the standards of a state as soon as possible. However, the Department is currently undertaking
an extensive reorganization and restructuring of its field office functions and jurisdictions. Very likely, a number
of HUD Multifamily appraisers, including some who have already attained certified general status, will be retiring
in the near future. Time is required to recoup such losses and our current estimate is that we will not be able to achieve
comprehensive certification of multifamily appraisers until the end of 1996. Some currently certified employees
will remain, of course, and others will become certified before that time, but we cannot set a precise schedule because
available training funds for the 1995 and 1996 fiscal years are not known nor is the retirement rate predictable with
much accuracy. Moreover, the dispatch with which HUD can accomplish conprehensive certification of its staff appraisers
will be directly proportional to the extent of training and experience required by different states so progress will
undoubtedly vary from one field office to another. We have set a date of December 31, 1996 for achieving full staff certification
in multifamily programs; however, in the event funding and attrition rates differ appreciably from our projections,
we will adjust the effective date to make it earlier if possible, later if necessary.

As is the case with &sect;267.7, which sets standards for single family appraisals, &sect;267.11 has been extensively
revised both to reduce requirements and to extract specific_in this case multifamily_appraisal standards. In most
respects, &sect;&sect;267.7 and 267.11 are alike, except that in &sect;267.11: 1) the prescribed appraisal forms
are different; 2) the review of historical sales prices covers a three-year (or more), rather than a one-year, time
span; 3) proposed rule paragraphs 267.4(a)(7) and (a)(8), concerning marketing period and factors that affect income
and the absorption period, are relevant for multifamily sales and are included; and 4) the reference to valuation
methods focuses on the greater concern with replacement cost in multifamily programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons cited above in the description of &sect;267.8, the provision regarding the assistance of others,
&sect;267.5(f) of the proposed rule, has been deleted. However, &sect;267.12 contains a new paragraph (b)(2), inadvertently
omitted from the proposed rule, that outlines the relationship between an appraiser and a Delegated Processor. Paragraph
(b)(2) explains that HUD must review and approve each appraiser who works for a Delegated Processor, either as an employee
or as an independent contractor. We also review and approve each appraiser employed under a Technical Discipline
Contract (TDC).

The Two Main Issues
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most of the comments addressed one or both of the principal objectives of the rule: to require the certification or
licensing of appraisers for FHA-insured mortgages and to enable DE mortgagees to use appraisers of their own choosing
for FHA transactions.

The Certification/Licensure Issue
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As was pointed out in the proposed rule, the requirement that FHA appraisers must be certified or licensed, depending
upon the nature of the transaction, is based on section 142 of the Reform Act, and parallels a similar Congressional
mandate in FIRREA that only certified general, certified residential or licensed persons may perform appraisals
involving federally related transactions. Thus, when section 142 was enacted, a system of state certification and
licensing was already under development. This was beneficial in two respects. First, it obviated the need for HUD
to develop its own regulatory structure with a resultant drain on staff and budgetary resources. Second, by drawing
upon the FIRREA system as an established resource, HUD could fulfill its regulatory responsibility with a minimum
of added expense to homebuyers. We believe that most appraisers will soon be certified and/or licensed in order to
participate in the broad range of federally related transactions and also to enhance their own professional stature.
The cost of added training and membership will then be distributed over a wide base of consumers. Moreover, there will
probably be a dwindling pool of unlicensed and uncertified appraisers upon which mortgagees can draw so that, quite
apart from the mandate of section 142, debate over the need for such accreditation in FHA programs will become academic.
In any event, HUD retains its control over appraisal fees permitted for single family programs to make sure that they
do not rise disproportionately.

The Appraiser Selection Issue
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With respect to the DE mortgagee's right to choose appraisers, we specifically requested comment from the public.
It is not possible for HUD to preclude that choice by rulemaking, since the mortgagee's right to choose has been mandated
by Congress and is therefore beyond the scope of agency policy. However, we wanted to assess the extent and weight of
public opinion in order to ascertain if there were a good case HUD might present to Congress for repealing the provision.
We found that public opinion was fairly well balanced between support and opposition. Some commenters argued that
lender choice would lead to abuse and distorted valuation; others that it would do no more than serve to simplify and
speed the appraisal process. We turned, therefore, to an analogy with experience already gained, inferring that
use of the staff appraisers employed by many major lending firms should have the same potential for abuse and the same
tendency to encourage lender-dictated property values. Yet increasing experience with this practice has not indicated
that the accuracy or thoroughness of lender staff appraisals has been compromised by pressure on the employee. We
have concluded that serious concern about the integrity of lender-selected appraisers is not supported by current
evidence and we do not plan to pursue the matter legislatively at this time.

Comment on review appraisers: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department has not adequately addressed the need for qualifying review appraisers. Furthermore, there is no
recognition of the difference between a technical review and an administrative review as those terms are understood
within the appraisal industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD has given considerable thought to the general question of appraisal reviews and who performs them. For FHA purposes,
reviews are essentially of two types. First are those incidental to the duties of the DE underwriter. In these instances,
the appraisal is accepted on its face, while certain factors are weighed into the decision of whether or not to underwrite,
and if so, whether to change the loan amount on the basis of an adjustment to value. This is not an appraisal action; it
is an underwriting judgment as we explained in the proposed rule. Along with these judgments, the underwriter exercises
administrative review responsibilities, checking to see if the appraiser has properly completed the form, noting
the comparables used, etc. We see no element of technical review in this role of the underwriter, who is not certified
or licensed in most cases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second type of review is technical, as compared to administrative. With respect to multifamily transactions,
technical reviews are conducted by HUD staff or by a contractor and may result in a revision of the appraisal report.
In the case of single family transactions, they are conducted by HUD staff and may provide a basis for administrative
sanctions, but they do not materially affect the appraisal report. Whether a technical review is performed by a contractor
or by HUD staff, the reviewer must be certified in the case of multifamily programs and either certified or licensed,
as is necessary, for single family programs. In order to make HUD's own internal practices consistent with the standard
that we apply to private sector appraisers, the Department intends that over the next several years, every FHA multifamily
and single family staff appraiser who performs reviews will become either certified or licensed, whichever is appropriate
for the nature of the reviews that he or she performs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comment on loan correspondents choosing appraisers: The proposed rule does not clarify whether loan correspondents
or their sponsors should choose the appraiser.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department expects sponsors to be responsible for underwriting single family loans submitted by their loan correspondents.
Consistent with this approach, the sponsor must select the appraiser.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comment on limiting market value with replacement cost: It is ill-advised and inconsistent with USPAP for HUD to stipulate
that market value shall not exceed replacement cost. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department agrees with several of the commenters that there are instances when replacement cost does not keep
step with market value, and this is precisely why a limitation is needed. We do not agree that a property can adequately
secure a debt for any sum greater than is sufficient to replace the property. For purposes of mortgage financing, value
must be ascertained prudently. It is not the same, for example, as the value assigned to property when setting a market
price. For FHA purposes, it is fair and sensible to limit market value by replacement cost, particularly since it will
be supported by an actual construction contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are puzzled by the assertion of one commenter that HUD's policy is inconsistent with USPAP. Standards Rule 1&hyph;5
of USPAP states that the appraiser must consider and reconcile the quality and quantity of data available and analyzed
within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approaches used and the applicability or suitability of those approaches which are set forth in Standards Rule 1&hyph;4.
For FHA, the acceptable approach is market value, although replacement cost is recognized as a limit to data acquired
from the sales of comparable properties. We see no conflict with USPAP in this regard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comment on reporting market conditions and trends: Why require the appraiser to analyze and report on current market
conditions and trends if, as stated in the preamble to the proposed rule, such conditions and trends should not be factored
into the estimate of value?

of value.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This statement failed to make a basic distinction between what is meant by ``trend'' in multifamily compared with
single family programs, and caused several commenters to question the usefulness of trending in single family appraisal
work. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A multifamily appraiser must give consideration to long-term projections of market changes in order to estimate,
for example, project income from rents over the life of the mortgage. Trends are therefore of twofold significance
in multifamily cases: they address projected changes in both the intrinsic value of the property and in its earning
ability. Hence, they are essentially forward-looking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By comparison, the existence of rapidly rising or declining prices for single family properties can be ascertained
by analysis of recent sales data. Looking at sale prices within the preceding six months, the appraiser can estimate
the rate of increase or decrease in an area. These rates of change will have an effect on the value of the subject property
and must be taken into consideration.

For both single family and multifamily transactions, however, it should be borne in mind that conditions and trends

Comment on reporting the use of minority appraisers: Reporting on the use of minority and female appraisers is burdensome,
unnecessary and if nevertheless adopted, should be HUD's responsibility.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This is an important initiative. It is intended to address two matters of concern. One is the perceived underutilization
of minority and female appraisers in general. Second is a perceived underutilization of minority appraisers in communities
where they might be more knowledgeable about trends and conditions and more sensitive to community problems. However,
the Department recognizes the burden this reporting requirement places on mortgagees, especially in FHA's high
volume single family programs. We have therefore revised the requirement so that HUD will accept virtually all responsibility
for compiling and reporting the information for those programs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comment on differing appraiser classifications: Why does the proposed rule not distinguish between the different
levels of certification, such as a Certified General Appraiser compared with a Certified Residential Appraiser?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We do distinguish between certified general and certified residential appraisers in those instances where the distinction
must be made. Thus, when the reference is to multifamily programs, ``certified general'' is intended and the rule
will usually so state. When we are referring to single family programs that require the services of a certified appraiser,
as described in &sect;267.5(b), the rule makes no distinction because either a certified general or a certified residential
appraiser would be appropriate for the assignment. Some jurisdictions have provided for other variant classifications
which this rule does not seek to distinguish. We rely instead on the state accreditation agencies_prompted by the
benefits of reciprocity and guided by the Appraiser Qualifications Board_to maintain comparable standards within
the different classifications for use by FHA, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council members and
other interested agencies such as the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) and the Farmers Home Administration.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comment on continuing the use of DVA certificates of reasonable value (CRVs) and HUD conditional commitments: According
to HUD's Direct Endorsement regulations, in particular 24 CFR 203.5(e): ``In lieu of appraising the property, the
mortgagee may utilize a HUD conditional commitment (for proposed construction only), or a Department of Veterans
Affairs certificate of reasonable value.'' Will this continue to be the practice under the Roster system? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Lenders may continue to rely on conditional commitments and CRVs. Part 267 will not affect this interchangeability.
For some time now, both HUD and DVA, by administrative instructions, have required certified or licensed appraisers
for single family appraisals. Moreover, appraisals for veteran housing programs must comply with USPAP. Thus, DVA
and FHA requirements are comparable in key respects and are mutually acceptable. Of course this interchangeability
could end if either agency were to lessen its standards for appraisers or appraisals. We point out also that HUD requires
virtually all applications for mortgage insurance to be processed under the DE program, so very little use is made
of HUD conditional commitments. This fact tends to discourage the mutual recognition of CRVs and conditional commitments
(or at least DVA's recognition of HUD commitments) since 38 U.S.C. 1831 requires that CRV appraisers be assigned on
a rotational basis from a fee panel selected and maintained by DVA_a requirement incompatible with the DE lenders'
freedom to select their appraisers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comment on the integrity of DE staff appraisers: It is naive and pointless to require that DE lenders separate the appraisal
function from their underwriting operations in order to protect the autonomy and integrity of staff appraisers.
Policy and decisionmaking for every corporate component coalesce at the top of the business structure and filter
downward; a staff appraiser cannot avoid being influenced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are aware of the potential for pressure on staff appraisers, but short of prohibiting the practice altogether,
there is no completely satisfactory solution. We believe that by removing the appraiser from the direct supervision
of the loan production department, two advantages accrue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, the appraiser is at least free from the everyday case-by-case control of loan officers. An appraiser may sense
that too many unfavorable appraisals can impede on his or her career track (of course, a self-employed appraiser under
contract with a lender can feel similar pressures), but there will at least not be instances where one's immediate
supervisor looks for a specific value in every case assigned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, when the nexus of decisionmaking shifts upward, if undue influence is manifest, it is usually easier to fix
accountability. If there is a consistent problem, it will very likely have originated at upper corporate levels.
Top management of a maleficent lending institution will find it more difficult to avoid culpability by claiming that
fraudulent or misleading appraisals are the result of nothing more than faulty supervision or insensitivity to potential
trouble at the loan officer level. Of course none of our precautions, including appraiser independence, can guarantee
that a staff (or contract) appraiser will escape undue pressure. Ultimately, we look to the integrity and long-range
business judgment of the mortgagees themselves to counter serious abuse and destructive practices. As we have observed
previously, there has been a very good overall record on the part of mortgagees and staff appraisers in this regard.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comment on the advisability of the Roster system: The idea of establishing a Roster for single family appraisers appears
to be an offshoot of the fee panel system and is therefore a repudiation of the mortgagee's right to select the appraiser.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Roster and the fee panel are in fact totally different in concept and purpose. The fee panel was initiated as a means
of controlling the quality of appraisers in terms of training, diligence, judgment and professionalism. It functioned
mainly at a time when there was little other assurance in these respects. It afforded a means of training appraisers
in FHA requirements and procedures and it also served to limit the pool of appraisers so that panelists could be kept
active in FHA programs and their experience level would benefit accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Circumstances have now changed completely. First and most importantly, FIRREA has raised and standardized the level
of appraiser competence nationwide so that it is no longer a major concern. Second, the law now permits DE mortgagees
to select appraisers. This means that a system of assigning panelists, unless the mortgagee requests the assignment
or is not DE approved (and most now are) would be illegal_a fact which is overlooked by those commenters who urge HUD
to retain the strict panel assignment system. In a practical sense, it also means that there are far more potential
FHA single family appraisers than this agency, with its increased budget constraints, could hope to train in the manner
that it once did. We must now rely on FIRREA and State accreditation boards to do much of what HUD has done in the past.
The fee panel will continue in a diminished role, and only for those lenders who wish to continue using it. This does
not mean that HUD will abdicate its responsibility for guarding against poor appraisal work. We are instituting the
Roster as a means of monitoring and quickly remedying problems. However, unlike the fee panel system, the Roster will
list any applicant who holds current credentials under state certification/licensing law, who has acquainted himself
or herself with FHA program requirements, and who has a good professional record, including competency in performing
FHA assignments. The Roster will thus provide a rapid means of confirming that the appraiser is in good standing at
the time the mortgagee requests an FHA case number and identifies the appraiser selected. That is its purpose_it is
a monitoring control, not a system for training and qualifying FHA appraisers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comment on the need to list fee panelists on the Roster: The proposed rule does not clarify whether fee panelists must
be listed on the Roster.

Section 267.8(d)(1) now clarifies that fee panelists must be listed on the HUD Appraiser Roster. Otherwise, minority

Comments on the scope of the Roster: Must an appraiser apply for listing on the Roster in every state where the appraiser

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The appraiser must apply to the HUD Office (or to any one of the state's HUD Offices if there are several) in each state
where he or she intends to perform an appraisal. The reason is that every state has its own numbering system and the only
practical means of correlating the Roster data and the record of state accreditation is to maintain a list of all the
various certification and/or license numbers pertaining to that appraiser. Individual employees as well as the
employing institution must be listed since the performance of both will be monitored. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comment on removal from the Roster: If HUD needs to remove an appraiser from the Roster for any reason, it should report
that fact to the state licensing board. Two commenters, in fact, suggested that HUD ``punish'' a disqualified appraiser.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is HUD's intention to report cases of fraudulent or incompetent appraisals and other serious violations of appraisal
professional conduct to state accrediting boards. However, the commenters who favor ``punishment'' mistake the
purpose of the Roster. As we said previously, it is not a device for applying sanctions; it is simply a quality control
measure to assure that appraisers who have not maintained their credentials, or who for some reason have not met FHA
standards, are removed from the system where they can cause a problem. Congress did not make HUD a watchdog or enforcer
for the appraisal industry when it enacted section 142 of the Reform Act, and it would be inappropriate to base a punitive
process on the Roster system. When we discussed the Roster in the Proposed Rule, we explained that 24 CFR part 24 relating
to Government debarment and suspension procedures does not apply to the removal of an appraiser from the listing,
but we also cautioned that the Department will invoke part 24 whenever circumstances call for remedial action and
&sect;267.8(d)(3) so states.

This is a matter that has not been resolved. The Department is exploring several means of helping appraisers who have
not been through fee panel training to become knowledgeable about specific program requirements. We are expediting
this matter and will advise interested members of the public as soon as there is further information. In the meantime,
appraisers should bear in mind that it would be a violation of USPAP's Competency Provision to undertake an assignment
for which the appraiser has not been adequately trained and is not qualified.

organizations, or the number of professional organizations, that an appraiser may choose to join. Our conclusion
in the proposed rule on this point remains unchanged.

Comment on appraising Secretary-held properties: It is short-sighted and ill-advised for HUD to exempt the sale
of Secretary-held properties from part 267. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD disposition properties are indeed exempted from the requirements of part 267, but they are nonetheless subject
to a valuation process in determining what would be an acceptable return on the disposition sale. Moreover, if FHA
mortgage insurance is used to finance that sale, the maximum allowable mortgage is based on the bid amount capped by
the FHA mortgage limit applicable to the area. No appraisal is required, and should the mortgagee on its own initiative
call for one, this part 267 would not apply.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A Rule Recently Adopted by the Federal Financial Agencies
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 7, 1994 (59 FR 29482) the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of Thrift Supervision (the Agencies), after publishing
a proposed rule for public comment, amended their respective parts of title 12 of the Code of Federal Regulations regarding
the appraisal of real property pursuant to FIRREA. These amendments increase from $100,000 to $250,000 the minimum
threshold for residential real estate appraisals as provided by that statute and also broaden existing exemptions
from various other appraisal requirements. In addition, the amendments revise existing provisions with respect
to appraisal content and appraiser independence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In developing this final rule, HUD took the Agencies' amendments into consideration. However, we do not believe it
would be appropriate for the Department to adopt a threshold mortgage amount that triggers the need for an appraisal.
HUD is charged with a specific Congressional mandate under section 202(e) of the NHA to assure the quality of each appraisal
used in determining the value of the security for an FHA insured mortgage. The Secretary's accountability in this
regard is more immediate and direct than that of the Agencies in establishing a system of state accreditation under
FIRREA. Moreover, protection of the FHA insurance funds is a duty of the greatest importance to HUD. We do not believe
that we could fulfill these responsibilities by accepting as security for FHA insured mortgages properties that
have not been thoroughly appraised. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department will therefore require appraisals for single family and multifamily programs as set forth in &sect;267.1,
without exception. Various considerations that underlie the Agencies' other amendments with respect to appraisal
standards, appraiser independence and miscellaneous related matters are, we believe, comprehensively addressed
in this rule. Therefore, specific changes to the Agencies' regulations need not be discussed or included in this rulemaking
which alone governs requirements for FHA mortgage insurance transactions.

In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the undersigned hereby certifies that this rule
does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The eligibility and performance
requirements contained in this rule are consistent with requirements already established by other government agencies
for lender eligibility. Accordingly, the economic impact of this rule would be minimal, and would affect small and
large entities equally.

A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations

The Finding of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection and copying Monday through Friday, 7:30 a.m.
until 5:30 p.m. in the office of the Rules Docket Clerk, Office of General Counsel, Room 10276, Department of Housing

Federalism, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
has determined that the policies contained in this rule do not have federalism implications and thus are not subject
to review under the Order. The rule is limited to imposing additional eligibility and performance requirements on
private lenders. The only point of policy contained in part 267 with even an indirect implication for federal-state
relationships is the decision that a HUD appraiser should be subject to the certification requirements of any one
state, but not necessarily other states in which he or she is assigned to perform appraisals. As explained previously,
the standards of various jurisdictions developed pursuant to FIRREA should result in a reasonably uniform level
of competence, and qualifying HUD employees in every jurisdiction would involve many dollars and staff hours spent
on a largely duplicative effort. For purposes of section 142 of the Reform Act, certification by any one state should
therefore be sufficient. In reaching this conclusion, HUD parallels OMB's decision with regard to FIRREA that:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) For a mortgage insured under Title II of the National Housing Act, the appraiser may be: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Employed on the staff of the Direct Endorsement mortgagee or selected by the Direct Endorsement mortgagee (which
includes being selected as an individual from the staff of a selected appraisal organization), provided the appraiser
is listed on the Appraiser Roster provided under this &sect;267.8; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Assigned by HUD from membership on one of its fee panels.

Mortgagees, staff and fee appraisers: conflicts of interests. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) A mortgagee must avoid conflicts of interest and other relationships which affect, either in reality or in appearance,
the credibility of the appraisal. Accordingly, a mortgagee may not contract with an appraiser or appraisal organization
to perform an appraisal of a property if the builder or seller of the property owns, is owned by, is affiliated with,
or has a financial interest in the appraiser or appraisal organization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) An appraiser must avoid conflicts of interest and other relationships which affect, either in reality or in appearance,
the credibility of the appraisal. Accordingly, a fee appraiser may not have any interest, direct or indirect, in the
property being appraised. A staff appraiser of a Direct Endorsement mortgagee may not have any direct interest, financial
or otherwise, in the property being appraised, and is permitted an indirect interest only by reason of his or her employment
by a mortgagee that has its appraisal operations isolated from its other activities in accordance with paragraph
(b) of this section.

General rule for Direct Endorsement cases. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a mortgage is to be processed by Direct Endorsement, the mortgagee may: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Contract with a fee appraiser to perform appraisal services. The contract may be with an individual, a corporation,
a partnership, a sole proprietorship, a joint venture, a limited liability company, or any other legal entity recognized
for the purpose by the state, which the mortgagee has chosen at its sole discretion, provided that the individual appraiser
selected to perform the appraisal is listed on the current HUD Appraiser Roster set forth in paragraph (d)(2) of this
section. The mortgagee, concurrently and equally with the appraiser whom it has chosen, accepts full responsibility
for the accuracy, integrity and thoroughness of the appraisal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Use an appraiser employed on its staff, provided that the appraiser is listed on the current HUD Appraiser Roster.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Request HUD to assign an appraiser from one of its fee panels. Fee panelists must be listed on the HUD Appraiser
Roster. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD Appraiser Roster. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) HUD will maintain a nationwide listing on an Appraiser Roster of appraisers who are permitted to perform appraisals
in connection with HUD's single family programs. Being listed on the Roster does not indicate a warranty or endorsement
by HUD of any appraiser or appraisal, and &sect;200.145(c) of this chapter applies to each appraisal performed in
accordance with this part. Each applicant for listing or periodic relisting must certify that he or she: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Holds a current certification or license from a state whose qualification standards are in compliance with FIRREA,
as determined by the Appraisal Subcommittee (and must include his or her current certificate or license number);

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Has read HUD Handbook 4150.1 and related Mortgagee Letters; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Is not listed on HUD's Credit Alert Interactive Voice Response System; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Is not debarred, suspended or in any way disqualified from participating in HUD programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) In addition, the applicant must submit such additional information as HUD may require. Application to be listed
on the Roster must be made at any HUD Office in each state where the applicant will perform appraisals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Removal from the Roster. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD may at any time remove the appraiser from the Roster for cause. Cause includes, but is not limited to, significant
deficiencies in appraisals, failure to maintain standing as a state certified or state licensed appraiser and prosecution
for committing or attempting to commit fraud, misrepresentation or other offence that may reflect on the appraiser's
character and integrity. Such removal shall not be governed by the procedures of part 24 of this Title. The appraiser
shall, however, be subject to other sanctions in accordance with part 24 of this title. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a mortgage is not processed by the Direct Endorsement procedure, the appraiser will be assigned from a fee panel
or otherwise designated by HUD. A mortgagee using the Direct Endorsement procedure may also request HUD to assign
an appraiser from a fee panel.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A Direct Endorsement lender may accept an appraisal that was prepared by an appraiser engaged directly by another
mortgagee, provided that the appraisal was performed in accordance with this part and that the mortgagee accepting
the appraisal has: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Reviewed the appraisal report under its review procedures; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The appraiser or consultant may be:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A member of HUD's staff;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Selected by the Delegated Processor in accordance with terms and conditions agreed to in writing by HUD and the
Delegated Processor;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Selected to perform appraisals in accordance with the terms and conditions of a formal contract between HUD and
an institution or individual performing the services, or in accordance with the terms and conditions of a Purchase
Order; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Qualifications. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD exercises contractual control over the qualifications of those individuals and organizations that perform
appraisal and consultation services in FHA multifamily programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Appraisers and consultants performing services under HUD contracts for Delegated Processing and Technical
Discipline assignments will be selected on the basis of criteria and procedures set forth in the solicitation, pursuant
to the Federal Acquisition Regulations, 48 CFR Chapter I.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Under the Delegated Processing Program HUD contracts with a HUD-approved processing company to perform mortgage
insurance underwriting processing and to make a recommendation to HUD. HUD makes the final underwriting determination.
The Delegated Processor must identify the staff or contract review appraiser(s) and consultant(s) and must submit
their qualifications, based upon requirements as set forth in the contract between HUD and the Delegated Processor,
for review and approval. The Delegated Processor may subcontract appraiser and consulting functions, but must identify,
prior to performing the appraisal or consultation, the appraiser or consultant selected under the subcontract and
must provide a resume or qualifications for review and approval by the HUD field office concerned.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Under the Housing Finance Agency Risk-Sharing Program, HUD delegates to state and local housing finance agencies
the authority to originate and service loans that are fully insured by FHA. Under this program, participating agencies
share in the risk associated with monetary losses that may be incurred as a result of loan defaults. An HFA may use either
in-house or contract appraisers who meet certification requirements. The Risk-Sharing Program requires compliance
with USPAP and therefore requires that appraisals be performed by certified general appraisers accredited by the
