<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This action modifies the Class E airspace at the Harper Municipal Airport, Harper, Kansas. Prior to the Airspace Reclassification,
the Class E airspace for Harper, Kansas, was designed to exclude that airspace east of 98 degrees longitude. However,
during Airspace Reclassification, the excluded area, including the Bob Park Airport (private), was inadvertently
omitted. The intended effect of this action is to exclude the Class E airspace east of 98 degrees longitude above the
Bob Park Airport (private) located northeast of Harper, Kansas. The area will be depicted on aeronautical charts
to provide a reference for pilots operating in the area.

History
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 7, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to modify Class
E airspace at the Harper Municipal Airport, Harper, Kansas (59 FR 4612).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to Airspace Reclassification, the Class E airspace area for Harper, Kansas excluded that airspace east of 98
degrees longitude. During Airspace Reclassification, this excluded area was inadvertently omitted. The NPRM proposed
to exclude that airspace ``north of Hwy 160 and east of longitude 98 00
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;00
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; W. Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments
on the proposal to the FAA. One commenter objected to the proposal because it did not exclude all the airspace east of
98 degrees longitude. The inclusion of the airspace ``north of Hwy 160
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; within the excluded area was in error. This amendment corrects that error in the NPRM by deleting the Class
E airspace east of 98 degrees longitude, which was inadvertently omitted in the airspace reclassification. It has
been determined this exclusion will not compromise safety to aircraft arriving or departing the Harper, Kansas,
Municipal Airport. Class E airspace designations for airspace areas extending upward from 700 feet or more above
ground level are published in paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9B, dated July 18, 1994, and effective September 16
1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will
be published subsequently in the order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
The Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) amends Class E airspace at Harper, Kansas,
by excluding the Class E airspace east of 98 degrees longitude above the Bob Park airport (private) located northeast
of Harper, Kansas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034: February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

 This document amends the Customs Regulations to allow bonded carriers to transport merchandise within port limits
without having to obtain a cartman's license. It also amends the regulations to allow the operators of foreign trade
zones, container station and centralized examination stations and the proprietors of bonded warehouses to transport
merchandise from within the district to their respective facilities. These amendments will result in savings of
time and money for both the trade and Customs.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Customs requires that the carriage of imported merchandise, for which duty has not yet been paid, only be accomplished
by certain bonded carriers. A cartman is one who undertakes to transport goods or merchandise within the limits of
a port. A lighterman is one who transports goods or merchandise on a barge, scow, or other small vessel to or from a vessel
within the port or from place to place within a port. The regulations regarding cartage and lighterage of merchandise
are set forth in Part 125 of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR Part 125). The regulations regarding the bonding of carriers
which receive merchandise for transportation in bond, and the licensing of cartmen and lightermen are set forth in
Part 112 of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR Part 112). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, pursuant to &sect;&sect;112.2(b) and 112.21, Customs Regulations, Customs requires a bond and a license
to transact business as a cartman or a lighterman for the cartage or lighterage of merchandise entered for warehouse,
designated for examination, taken to container stations, or taken into custody as unclaimed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 29, 1992, Customs published a Notice of Proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rulemaking (NPRM) in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (57 FR 49049) proposing to consider within port transfers by cartmen and lightermen like other in-bond movements
and to allow bonded carriers, in most instances, to carry in-bond cargo within a port without requiring them to obtain
cartman or lighterman licenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the document, it was proposed that cartage and lighterage of merchandise designated for examination,
taken to container stations, taken into custody as unclaimed or destined for admission to a foreign trade zone either
may be done under the bond of a licensed cartman or lighterman, or if approved by the district director, under the bond
of a foreign trade zone operator, container station operator, centralized examination station operator, or a bonded
carrier. However, a license would still be necessary to obtain to carry in-bond merchandise within a port for the cartage
of merchandise entered for warehouse; the reason for this exception was that 19 U.S.C. 1565 contained a statutory
requirement that a cartman be licensed for cartage of merchandise entered for warehouse. Customs issued the proposal
because it believes that the elimination of the license requirement will save Customs and the trade time and money.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Statutory Change Since Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 8, 1993, the President signed the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (Pub. L. 103&hyph;182,
107 Stat. 2057). Section 666 of Title VI (Customs Modernization) amended 19 U.S.C. 1565 to allow the cartage of merchandise
entered for warehouse by bonded carriers as well as by licensed cartmen. Accordingly, the statement in the proposal
that a license is required to transact business as a cartman and lighterman for the cartage or lighterage of merchandise
entered for warehouse is no longer consistent with the statute. The statutory impediment to allowing the cartage
of merchandise entered for warehouse by bonded carriers that existed at the time the proposal was published no longer
exists.

Analysis of Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A total of 19 entities responded to the proposal. Generally, each respondent supported the proposal and stated that,
if adopted, the proposal would eliminate unnecessary and redundant paperwork for both Customs and the trade, would
expedite the movement of cargo within port limits, and would be a positive step in simplifying Customs procedures.
Of the 19 commenters, seven fully supported the measure. The remaining commenters, although generally supportive
of the purpose of the proposed amendments, suggested some changes. Some sought clarification regarding the types
of cartage authorized to be performed by the operators of foreign trade zones, centralized examination stations
and container stations. Specific comments requesting changes and clarifications and Customs responses are set
forth below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Seven commenters requested that the measure be expanded to include transfers between foreign trade zones and subzones,
whether within or adjacent to the same port of entry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations currently provide that cargo movements carried out outside the port limits but within the district
boundaries may be accomplished by a bonded carrier. This applies to transfers between foreign trade zones and subzones.
The final regulation set forth in this document provides that cargo destined for a foreign trade zone or subzone may
be picked up within the district by the operator of the foreign trade zone or subzone to which it is going. This is specified
by the new language for &sect;112.2(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter requested a more liberal wording of the proposed language for 19 CFR 112.2. The language for 19 CFR 112.2
reads, in part: ``Cartage *&blank;*&blank;* may be done under the bond of a cartman, *&blank;*&blank;* or, if approved
by the district director, a bonded carrier *&blank;*&blank;*.'' The commenter felt that the proposed language would
still require companies with extensive route systems to submit an application of some sort in every Customs district
where they anticipate performing the cartman function. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the future, approval of the bond of a bonded carrier by the district director would indicate approval by Customs
for the bonded carrier to engage in cartage. The rule would permit bonded carriers to transfer merchandise within
port limits without the need for an application or a cartman or lighterman license; therefore, there is no need to further
amend or adopt a more liberal wording of the proposed language in 19 CFR 112.2.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Three commenters requested that 19 U.S.C. 1565 be amended to eliminate the requirement for cartmen licenses for cargo
movements into bonded warehouses. They suggested that such an amendment could be accomplished through the Customs
Modernization Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted previously in this document, section 666 of Title VI (Customs Modernization) of the North American Free Trade
Agreement Implementation Act (Pub. L. 103&hyph;182) amends 19 U.S.C. 1565 to eliminate the requirement for a cartman's
license for cargo movements into bonded warehouses. Any carrier designated as a carrier of bonded merchandise may
cart merchandise destined for entry into a bonded warehouse. The final regulation has been amended to reflect the
statutory amendment.

One commenter suggested that Customs clarify whether a foreign trade zone operator is only entitled to engage in cartage
for a foreign trade zone, a container station operator only for a container station, a centralized examination station
(CES) operator only for a CES, and a bonded warehouse proprietor only for a bonded warehouse, while a licensed cartman
or bonded carrier would be entitled to engage in cartage for any of those facilities, and whether district directors
would be allowed some discretion in this matter.

Customs agrees that the best policy is that a foreign trade zone operator would be limited to the transportation of
merchandise to his foreign trade zone, a container station operator to his container station, a CES operator to his
CES, and a bonded warehouse proprietor to his bonded warehouse. A licensed cartman or a bonded carrier would be entitled
to engage in transporting merchandise for any of those facilities, the cartman within the port limits and the carrier
within the district boundaries. Language to this effect has been inserted in the new &sect;112.2(b). Once a district
director has approved the respective entity's bond, that entity may engage in transporting merchandise as provided
for in these regulations.

The commenter suggests that the conditions of the custodial bond in 19 CFR 113.63 and the foreign trade zone operators
bond in 19 CFR 113.73 should be revised to conform with the proposed change in 19 CFR 112.2(b).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 113.63, Customs Regulations, has been altered slightly to conform with the changes. Regarding the foreign
trade zone operator's bond, Customs agrees that the current foreign trade zone operator's bond is inadequate to secure
the operator's performance with respect to movement of goods from one zone to another. Changes have been made to 19
CFR 113.73 in the final rule.

A commenter suggested that conforming changes referring to bonded carriers under 19 CFR 112.2(b) should be added
to 19 CFR 125.11 (a) and (b).

One commenter suggested that the procedures in part 125 seem to refer principally to cartmen, lightermen and, as proposed
in the NPRM, bonded carriers. He suggests that procedures pertaining to bonded warehouse proprietors and to operators
of container stations, centralized examination stations, and foreign trade zones should be made clear in the final
rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Customs agrees that procedures pertaining to cartage and lighterage by bonded warehouse proprietors and operators
of container stations, centralized examination stations and foreign trade zones should be included within part
125. Part 125 is amended accordingly.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter observed that both bonded warehouses and foreign trade zones are facilities with specific boundaries.
He suggested that Customs make clear whether receipt of merchandise by bonded warehouse proprietors for the purpose
of cartage constitutes receipt into a bonded warehouse and whether receipt of merchandise by a foreign trade zone
operator for the purpose of cartage constitutes receipt into an activated foreign trade zone area and the conferring
of foreign trade zone status.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Receipt of merchandise for cartage purposes to a bonded warehouse by its proprietor or to a foreign trade zone by its
operator constitutes receipt into the bonded warehouse or admission into the foreign trade zone. Customs approval
of such transfers will continue to be accomplished through existing local procedures.

After careful consideration of the comments received and further review of the matter, it has been determined that
the proposed amendments, modified as discussed above, should be adopted. The final regulation will allow the cartage
and lighterage of merchandise for all purposes by bonded carriers without the necessity of obtaining a cartage license.
It will also allow bonded warehouse proprietors, foreign trade zone operators, container station operators and
centralized examination station operators to engage in limited cartage and lighterage under their respective bonds
and to transport merchandise to their respective facilities from anywhere in the district in which their facility
is located.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Roussel-Uclaf, Division Agro-Veterinaire, 163 Avenue Gambetta, 75020, Paris, France, is the sponsor of NADA 130&hyph;951,
represented by Hoechst-Roussel Agri-Vet Co., P.O. Box 2500, Rt. 202&hyph;206, Somerville, NJ 08876&hyph;1258.
The NADA provides for use of halofuginone hydrobromide (Stenorol) Type A medicated article to make Type C medicated
broiler feed used for the prevention of coccidiosis. The sponsor filed a supplemental application which provides
for the use of 2.72 grams per ton (3 parts per million) halofuginone hydrobromide for replacement cage layers and replacement
broiler breeders for the prevention of coccidiosis. The supplemental NADA is approved as of October 12, 1994 and the
regulations are amended in 21 CFR 558.265(c) to reflect the approval. The basis for approval is discussed in the freedom
of information summary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This approval is for use of a Type A medicated article to make a Type C medicated feed. Halofuginone hydrobromide is
a Category II drug that, as provided in 21 CFR 558.4, requires an approved form FDA 1900 for making a Type C medicated
feed. Therefore, use of a halofuginone hydrobromide Type A article to make a Type C medicated feed as in NADA 130&hyph;951,
as supplemented, requires an approved form FDA 1900. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the freedom of information provisions of part 20 (21 CFR part 20) and &sect;514.11(e)(2)(ii) (21
CFR 514.11(e)(2)(ii)), a summary of safety and effectiveness data and information submitted to support approval
of this application may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm.
1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b(c)(2)(F)(iii)), the
approval of this supplemental application qualifies for 3 years of marketing exclusivity beginning October 12,
1994 because the supplemental application contains reports of new clinical or field investigations (other than
bioequivalence or residue studies) or human food safety studies (other than bioequivalence or residue studies)
essential to the approval of the supplemental application and conducted or sponsored by the applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the
action will not have a significant impact on the human environment and that an environmental impact statement is not
required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained in an
environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM is approving proposed Program Amendment Number 65 Revised to the Ohio permanent regulatory program (hereinafter
referred to as the Ohio program) under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The amendment
was initiated by Ohio and is intended to update rule references and to make the Ohio program as effective as the corresponding
Federal regulations. The amendment concerns the authority of successor agencies within the Ohio Department of Natural
Resources and the availability of Ohio's permit, inspection, and enforcement records to the public.

II. Submission of the Proposed Amendment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated February 23, 1994 (Administrative Record No. OH&hyph;1990), the Ohio Department of Natural Resources,
Division of Reclamation (Ohio), submitted proposed Program Amendment Number 65 (PA 65). In that submission, Ohio
proposed to revise two rules in the Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) to correct outdated rule references and to adopt
language similar to corresponding Federal regulations concerning the availability of documents for public view.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of PA 65, Ohio provided a draft example of the public notice on availability of documents which Ohio would post
at one of the two locations specified by OAC section 1501:13&hyph;1&hyph;10(B).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the March 10, 1994, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 11227), and, in the same document, opened the public comment period and provided an opportunity for a public
hearing on the adequacy of the proposed amendment. The public comment period closed on April 11, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letter dated June 17, 1994 (Administrative Record No. OH&hyph;2029), OSM provided its comments to Ohio on the February
23, 1994, submission of PA 65. By letter dated July 20, 1994 (Administrative Record No. OH&hyph;2033), Ohio resubmitted
Program Amendment Number 65 Revised (PA 65R) which is intended to resolve the requirements in OSM's June 17, 1994,
letter. Ohio proposed new revisions to one rule and modified the draft example of the notice on the availability of
documents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM reopened the public comment period in the August 5, 1994, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 39994). The public comment period closed on August 22, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to a comment made by the Soil Conservation Service (SCS), United States Department of Agriculture (Ohio
Administrative Record No. OH&hyph;2056), OSM requested that Ohio provide a written statement for the Administrative
Record clarifying the points of agreement between the Division and the SCS. By letter dated September 23, 1994 (Ohio
Administrative Record No. OH&hyph;2058), Ohio provided OSM with its intentions regarding the filing of coal mining
related documents at SCS field offices.

1. Corrected Rule Reference
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OAC section 1501:13&hyph;1&hyph;05 establishes that, in the event of a consolidation or reorganization of offices
within the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR), the OAC rules which now apply to the Division of Reclamation
shall apply to and be the rules of any other Division or office which succeeds the Division of Reclamation as the administering
agency for Ohio Revised Code Chapter 1513. Ohio is revising this rule to expand the specific references to the Division
of Reclamation's rules to cover additional rules adopted by Ohio since OAC section 1501:13&hyph;1&hyph;05 was first
promulgated. There is no counterpart Federal rule. However, the Director finds that this revision will not render
the Ohio program inconsistent with the requirements of SMCRA and the Federal regulations.

2. Availability of Records
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Ohio is revising OAC section 1501:13&hyph;1&hyph;10 paragraph (B)(2) to provide additional ways that members of
the public may review Ohio's permit, inspection, and enforcement documents. Ohio is proposing that local district
offices of the ODNR, Division of Reclamation, shall maintain copies of all documents pertaining to both existing
and proposed mining operations within their jurisdiction, or post for public inspection a description of the information
available for mailing and a procedure for obtaining such information. If Ohio does not maintain a district office
in the specific county of the existing or proposed mining operation, Ohio shall either:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Make copies of all records, reports, inspection materials, and other subject information available for public
inspection at that county's office of the county recorder or at that county's office of the Soil Conservation Service
(SCS) of the United States Department of Agriculture; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Post, at that county's office of the county recorder or at that county's office of the SCS, a description of the documents
available for inspection and the procedure by which members of the public may request copies of these documents. At
its own expense, Ohio shall promptly provide copies of documents by mail upon request of any resident of the area of
the mining operation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The counterpart Federal rule at 30 CFR 840.14(c) provides that the regulatory authority shall make copies of these
documents available for public inspection or maintain a description of the information available for mailing and
the procedure for obtaining such information at a Federal, State or local government office in the county where mining
is occurring or proposed to occur. The proposed rule provides Ohio with options for meeting the obligation to make
permitting documents available to the public in the county where mining is occurring or proposed to occur. The Director,
therefore, finds that the revised State rule is no less effective than 30 CFR 840.14(c).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ohio has designed a public notice on availability of documents which Ohio would post at that county's office of the
county recorder or at that county's office of the SCS as specified in OAC section 1501:13&hyph;1&hyph;10(B)(2)(b).
This proposed notice clarifies that public comments on applicable permitting, inspection, enforcement, and regulatory
documents shall also be available for public inspection and copying. Ohio is also listing in the public notice the
counties which are under the jurisdiction of each of its five coal-regulatory district offices. The Director finds
that the proposed notice satisfies the requirements of and is no less effective than 30 CFR 840.14(c)(2).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Director solicited public comments and provided an opportunity for a public hearing on the proposed amendment.
The Ohio Historic Preservation Office provided comments in support of the proposed amendment. No other public comments
were received, and because no one requested an opportunity to testify at a public hearing, no hearing was held.

Federal Agency Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), the Director solicited comments on the proposed amendment from various Federal
agencies with an actual or potential interest in the Ohio program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The U.S. Department of Labor, Mine Safety and Health Administration, acknowledged the proposed amendment with no
comment. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service (SCS), expressed concern with the requirement
that copies of all records, reports, inspection materials, and other information be retained in SCS field offices.
The SCS noted that this could involve a substantial amount of information in some counties with accelerated mining
activity. However, the SCS was not against posting for public inspection a description of the information available
for mailing and a procedure for obtaining such information upon request by any resident of the area where mining is
occurring. Based on Ohio's letter dated September 23, 1994 (Administrative Record N. OH&hyph;2058), Ohio will make
sure that any approach for filing documents or posting notices at SCS offices would be acceptable to the SCS. As discussed
above, the Director has determined that Ohio's options for meeting the obligation to make permit, inspection, and
enforcement documents available to the public in the county where the mining is occurring or proposed to occur are
no less effective than the Federal regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No other comments were received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(ii), the Director is required to obtain the written concurrence of the EPA with respect
to any provisions of a State program amendment that relate to air or water quality standards promulgated under the
authority of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) or the Clean Air Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). None of the revisions that Ohio proposed to make in this amendment pertain to air or water quality standards. Therefore,
OSM did not request EPA's concurrence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), OSM solicited comments on the proposed amendment from EPA (Administrative
Record No. OH&hyph;1993). The EPA responded on March 16, 1994, (Administrative Record No. OH&hyph;1999) that Ohio
should add language in its proposed amendment to cover both existing and proposed mining operations. The Director
notes that Ohio's revised amendment at OAC section 1501:13&hyph;1&hyph;05 (B)(2) and (B)(2)(b) covers both existing
and proposed mining operations and therefore satisfies EPA's concerns.

V. Director's Decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the above findings, the Director approves the proposed program amendment as submitted by Ohio on February
23, 1994, and revised and resubmitted on July 20, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal regulations at 30 CFR Part 935 codifying decisions concerning the Ohio program are being amended to implement
this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program amendment process
and to encourage States to conform their programs with the Federal standards without undue delay. Consistency of
State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA.

Executive Order No. 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 (Management
Planning and Review). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Executive Order 12778 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that, to the extent allowed by law, this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections
(a) and (b) of that section. However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory
programs and program amendments since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM.
Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1253 and 1255) and 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15 and 732.17(h)(10), decisions
on proposed State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the requirements
of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731 and 732 have been met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

National Environmental Policy Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule does not contain information collection requirements which require approval by OMB under the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon corresponding Federal regulations for which
an economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements
previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule
would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the corresponding
Federal regulations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking was not published for this regulation and it is being
made effective in less than 30 days after 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 publication. Publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking and delaying the effective date of this regulation would
be contrary to the public interest since the event is expected to result in a high concentration of spectator and participant
vessels, and the actual stipulations of the special local regulations were not finalized in time for publication
more than 30 days prior to the start of the event.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although this regulation is published as a final rule, without prior notice, an opportunity for public comment is
nevertheless desirable to ensure the regulation is both reasonable and workable. Accordingly, persons wishing
to comment may do so by submitting written comments to the office listed under 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->

in this preamble. Those providing comments should identify the docket number (CCGD11&hyph;94&hyph;004) for the
regulation and also include their name, address and reason(s) for each comment presented. Persons wanting acknowledgment
of receipt of comments should enclose a stamped, self-addressed postcard or envelope.

Discussion of Regulation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The event prompting a need for these Special Local Regulations is the International America's Cup Class World Championships
which will be conducted in the San Diego area in October and November 1994. In addition, exhibition races will be held
on two dates in October and November 1994 within San Diego Bay; special local regulations establishing measures promoting
the safety of these exhibition race is the subject of separate rulemaking (CGD11&hyph;94&hyph;006).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These regulations are intended to promote safe navigation on the waters of San Diego Bay, Mission Bay and the IACC race
venue during the IACC World Championship Races by controlling the traffic entering, exiting and traveling within
these waters. The anticipated concentration of spectator and participant vessels associated with these races poses
a safety concern, which is addressed in these special local regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A channel within San Diego Bay has been designated for the exclusive use of IACC vessels during specifically prescribed
hours. This channel (the America's Cup Channel) is adjacent to the dredged main ship channel and bounded by the shoreline
of North Island. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Within the geographic area of applicability of these special local regulations, speed limits and operating requirements
have been established for orderly passage to and from the IACC shore facilities and race venue. The America's Cup Channel
passes through the Security Zone listed in 33 CFR 165.1105 adjacent to naval piers J through P on the western shore of
North Island. Participants, vessels carrying race officials, and patrol vessels may transit this Security Zone
during the periods these Special Local Regulations are in effect, unless otherwise notified through Broadcast Notice
to Mariners and by patrol vessels on scene.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Speed limits and operating requirements are also established for other vessel traffic operating within the regulated
areas during times when most IACC and spectator vessels are expected to transit the harbors. During these same times,
vessels shall not operate exclusively under sail within the regulated areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations also provide for a one-way traffic pattern and a five knot speed limit. These requirements will be
activated by the Patrol Commander when necessary to ensure the safety of navigation. Activation of these regulations
will be announced by patrol vessels on scene and by Broadcast Notice to Mariners.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, several non-anchorage areas are established for the period of these regulations to promote smooth
traffic flow and ensure access to docks and piers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These Special Local Regulations will be enforced for that portion of the race venue which is located within the navigable
waters of the United States to minimize navigational dangers and ensure the safety of vessels participating in and
viewing the races. Nonobligatory guidelines are included for that portion of the race venue which falls outside the
navigable waters of the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All vessels which fail to comply with this regulation while operating within the regulated areas during the regulatory
periods are subject to citation for failure to comply with this regulation, and subject to the penalties presented
in 33 U.S.C. 1236 and 33 CFR 100.50.

Regulatory Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This regulation is not a significant regulatory action under Section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under Section 6(a)(3) of that Order. It has been exempted from review
by the Office of Management and Budget under that Order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this regulation to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10(e) of the Department of Transportation
regulatory policies and procedures is unnecessary.

Federalism. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard has analyzed this regulation in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive
Order 12612 and has determined that this regulation does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

Environmental Assessment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The environmental impact of this regulation has been analyzed in the Environmental Assessment (EA) prepared by America's
Cup 1995, the organizing committee of the races, in connection with its application for a Coast Guard regatta permit.
A copy of the EA has been made a part of the public docket and is available for review at the Eleventh Coast Guard District
Offices at the address listed under

ADDRESSES.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard has reviewed the EA submitted by the sponsors of the event, considered the environmental impact of
this regulation and concluded that, under section 2.B.2 of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, it will have no significant
environmental impact and it is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. A Finding of No
Significant Impact (FONSI) has been prepared in connection with the regatta permit, has been made part of the public
docket, and is available for review at the address listed under

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(A) All spectator vessels should remain clear of the race venue and avoid interfering with any participant, AC'95
Vessels or Official Vessels. Interference with race activities may constitute a safety hazard warranting cancellation
or termination of all or part of the World Championship race activities by the Patrol Commander.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Any unauthorized entry within the race course perimeter, as marked by the AC'95 Vessels and Official Vessels,
by spectator vessels constitutes a risk to the safety of marine traffic. Such entry will constitute a factor to be considered
in determining whether a person has operated a vessel in a negligent manner in violation of 46 U.S.C. 2302.

One way traffic and five knot speed limit. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Patrol Commander may implement one-way traffic patterns and a five knot speed limit in the regulated areas or portions
thereof if the Patrol Commander deems it necessary to ensure safe navigation. Notice of one-way traffic and a five
knot speed limit shall be made by Broadcast Notice to Mariners. If one-way traffic patterns are implemented, spectator
and participant vessels are required to transit the applicable regulated area(s) in either an inbound direction
(proceeding into port) or an outbound direction (proceeding to sea). No traffic in any direction other than inbound
or outbound (i.e., cross traffic) will be permitted in the area of implementation. If a five knot speed limit or one-way
traffic is implemented, all participant and spectator vessels shall also abide by all other nonconflicting provisions
contained within these special local regulations associated with the regulated area. If a five knot speed limit is
implemented in San Diego Bay, all traffic entering or exiting the harbors will be required to make a speed of no more
than five knots through the water.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking was not published for this regulation and it is being
made effective in less than 30 days after 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
publication. Publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking and delaying the effective date of this regulation would
be contrary to the public interest since the event is expected to result in a high concentration of spectator and participant
vessels, and the actual stipulations of the special local regulations were not finalized in time for publication
more than 30 days prior to the start of the event.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although this regulation is published as a final rule, without prior notice, an opportunity for public comment is
nevertheless desirable to ensure the regulation is both reasonable and workable. Accordingly, persons wishing
to comment may do so by submitting written comments to the office listed under 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->

in this preamble. Those providing comments should identify the docket number (CCGD11&hyph;94&hyph;006) for the
regulation and also include their name, address and reason(s) for each comment presented. Persons wanting acknowledgment
of receipt of comments should enclose a stamped, self-addressed postcard or envelope.

Discussion of Regulation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The event prompting a need for these Special Local Regulations is the International America's Cup Class World Championships
which will be conducted within San Diego Bay in October and November 1994. In addition, ocean races will be conducted
in the Pacific Ocean offshore of San Diego in October and November 1994; special local regulations establishing measures
promoting the safety of these ocean races is the subject of separate rulemaking (CGD11&hyph;94&hyph;004).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
/
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These regulations are intended to promote safe navigation on the waters of San Diego Bay during the exhibition races
by controlling the traffic entering, exiting and traveling within these waters. The anticipated concentration
of spectator and participant vessels associated with these races poses a safety concern, which is addressed in these
special local regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the regulatory period prescribed in these regulations, specified portions of San Diego Bay will be closed
to all vessel traffic except vessels designated by the U.S. Coast Guard Patrol Commander. A designated channel, adjacent
to the dredged main ship channel, bounded by the shoreline of North Island and passing through the Security Zone defined
in 33 CFR 165.1105 adjacent to naval piers J through P on the western shore of North Island will be available for non-participating
vessels to enter, exit and travel within San Diego Bay during the regulatory period. Those vessels wishing to use this
channel to enter or exit San Diego Bay must obtain permission to proceed from the Patrol Commander at least 30 minutes
prior to the expected transit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Speed limits and operating requirements are also established for other vessel traffic operating within the regulated
areas during the exhibition races and when most IACC and spectator vessels are expected to transit the harbors. During
these times, spectator vessels shall not operate exclusively under sail within the regulated areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These operating requirements are applicable to all vessels operating within San Diego Bay preceding, during and
following the IACC boat races, unless otherwise specified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All vessels which fail to comply with this regulation while operating within the regulated areas during the regulatory
periods are subject to citation for failure to comply with this regulation, and subject to the penalties presented
in 33 U.S.C. 1236 and 33 CFR 100.50.

Regulatory Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This regulation is not a significant regulatory action under Section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under Section 6(a)(3) of that Order. It has been exempted from review
by the Office of Management and Budget under that Order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this regulation to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10(e) of the Department of Transportation
regulatory policies and procedures is unnecessary.

Federalism
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard has analyzed this regulation in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive
Order 12612 and has determined that this regulation does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

Environmental Assessment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The environmental impact of this regulation has been analyzed in the Environmental Assessment (EA) prepared by America's
Cup 1995, the organizing committee of the races, in connection with its application for a Coast Guard regatta permit.
A copy of the EA has been made a part of the public docket and is available for review at the Eleventh Coast Guard District
Offices at the address listed under 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard has reviewed the EA submitted by the sponsors of the event, considered the environmental impact of
this regulation and concluded that, under section 2.B.2 of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, it will have no significant
environmental impact and it is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. A Finding of No
Significant Impact (FONSI) has been prepared in connection with the regatta permit, has been made part of the public
docket, and is available for review at the address listed under

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Tacoma, Washington, area was designated nonattainment for PM&hyph;10 and classified as moderate under sections
107(d)(4)(B) and 188(a) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), upon enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) of 1990.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 See 56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991) (official designation codified at 40 CFR 81.348). The air quality planning requirements
for moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas are set out in subparts 1 and 4 of part D, title I of the Act.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA has issued a ``General Preamble'' describing EPA's preliminary views on how EPA intends to review SIPs and SIP
revisions submitted under Title I of the Act, including those State submittals containing moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment
area SIP requirements (see generally 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) and 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992)). Because EPA is describing
its interpretations here only in broad terms, the reader should refer to the General Preamble for a more detailed discussion
of the interpretations of title I advanced in this notice and the supporting rationale. In this rulemaking action
on the State of Washington's moderate PM&hyph;10 SIP for the Tacoma nonattainment area (referred to as Tacoma or the
Tacoma Tideflats), EPA is applying its interpretations taking into consideration the specific factual issues presented.
Additional information supporting EPA's action on this particular area is available for inspection at the address
indicated above. Those States containing initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas (those areas designated
nonattainment under CAA section 107(d)(4)(B)) were required to submit, among other things, the following provisions
by November 15, 1991:

 Subpart 1 contains provisions applicable to nonattainment areas generally and subpart 4 contains provisions specifically
applicable to PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas. At times, subpart 1 and subpart 4 overlap or conflict. EPA has attempted
to clarify the relationship among these provisions in the ``General Preamble'' and, as appropriate, in today's notice
and supporting information.

1. Provisions to ensure that reasonably available control measures (RACM) (including such reductions in emissions
from existing sources in the area as may be obtained through the adoption, at a minimum, of reasonably available control
technology (RACT)) shall be implemented no later than December 10, 1993; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Either a demonstration (including air quality modeling) that the plan will provide for attainment as expeditiously
as practicable but no later than December 31, 1994, or a demonstration that attainment by that date is impracticable;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Quantitative milestones which are to be achieved every three years and which demonstrate reasonable further progress
(RFP) toward attainment by December 31, 1994; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Provisions to ensure that the control requirements applicable to major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 also
apply to major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 precursors except where the Administrator determines that such
sources do not contribute significantly to PM&hyph;10 levels which exceed the NAAQS in the area (see sections 172(c),
188, and 189 of the Act). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional provisions are due at a later date. States with initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas were
required to submit a permit program for the construction and operation of new and modified major stationary sources
of PM&hyph;10 by June 30, 1992 (see CAA section 189(a)). The Washington State Department of Ecology (WDOE) submitted
the new source review requirements for this area on October 22, 1993. EPA will address that submittal in a separate

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 document.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Such States also were required to submit contingency measures by November 15, 1993, which become effective without
further action by the State or EPA, upon a determination by EPA that the area has failed to achieve RFP or to attain the
PM&hyph;10 NAAQS by the applicable statutory deadline (see CAA section 172(c)(9) and 57 FR 13510&hyph;13512 and
13543&hyph;13544). EPA addresses the contingency measures the State has submitted for Tacoma in part II.8 of the
discussion below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. This Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 110(k) of the Act sets out provisions governing EPA's review of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565&hyph;13566).
Section 110(k)(4) of the Act authorizes EPA to approve a plan revision based on a commitment by the State to adopt specific
enforceable measures by a date certain, but not later than one year after the date of approval of the plan revision.
EPA would then assess the approvability of the submittal after the State fulfilled its commitment. However, if the
State fails to comply with its commitment, section 110(k)(4) provides that a conditional approval shall be treated
as a disapproval. If the conditional approval is converted to a disapproval, the sanctions clock under section 179
of the Act and the Federal implementation plan clock under section 110(c)(1) of the Act will begin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this action, EPA is granting conditional approval of the plan revisions submitted to EPA for Tacoma, Washington,
on November 15, 1991 and June 30, 1994 (hereafter generally referred to as a single submittal), except for the following
elements of the SIP which are described below or in the Technical Support Document associated with this rulemaking.
EPA is approving these following elements without conditions: exclusion from precursor controls, the monitoring
network, the procedures for consultation and public notification, the provisions for revising the plan and the adequacy
of funding and authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA conditionally approves the submittal because it does not fully meet certain applicable requirements of the CAA
for moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas. The submittal does not meet the requirements to provide for the implementation
of RACM (including RACT), to demonstrate timely attainment of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS (or demonstrate that timely attainment
is not practicable), and to provide for quantitative milestones and reasonable further progress. See CAA sections
172(c)(1), 189(a)(1)(C), 189(a)(1)(B) and 189(c). Some of the control measures relied on to satisfy these requirements
have not been made enforceable emission limitations. CAA sections 110(a)(2)(A) and 172(c)(6). However, the State
has submitted a commitment to adopt specific enforceable measures on or before January 1, 1995, and to address the
applicable requirements of the Act. In its June 30, 1994 SIP revision, the State committed to submitting federally
enforceable emission limits to EPA by January 1, 1995 for the following major stationary sources identified in the
SIP: Buffelen Woodworking, Continental Grain, Continental Lime, Domtar Gypsum, Puget Sound Plywood, USG Interiors,
US Oil and Refining, Woodworth, Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Corporation and Simpson Tacoma Kraft Company. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The submittal is substantive and contains some specific enforceable control measures. Accordingly, EPA is conditionally
approving the submittal, as authorized under section 110(k)(4) of the CAA. EPA also approves, without conditions,
the separable exclusion from precursor controls as described in part II.5 below, the monitoring network, the procedures
for consultation and public notification, the provisions for revising the plan and the adequacy of funding and authority.

Analysis of State Submission
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Procedural Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act requires States to observe certain procedural requirements in developing implementation plans and plan
revisions for submission to EPA. Section 110(a)(2) of the Act provides that each implementation plan submitted by
a State must be adopted after reasonable notice and public hearing.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 110(l) of the Act similarly provides that each revision to an implementation plan submitted by a State under
the Act must be adopted by such State after reasonable notice and public hearing.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Also section 172(c)(7) of the Act requires that plan provisions for nonattainment areas meet the applicable provisions
of section 110(a)(2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA also must determine whether a submittal is complete and therefore warrants further EPA review and action (see
CAA section 110(k)(1) and 57 FR 13565). EPA's completeness criteria for SIP submittals are set out at 40 CFR part 51,
appendix V. EPA attempts to make completeness determinations within 60 days of receiving a submission. However,
a submittal is deemed complete by operation of law if a completeness determination is not made by EPA six months after
receipt of the submission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of Washington Department of Ecology conducted a public hearing to receive public comment on the State implementation
plan revision for PM&hyph;10 in Tacoma on November 7, 1991. WDOE adopted the implementation plan for the area on November
15, 1991, and submitted it to EPA the same day. In 1994, the plan was revised to amend its request for conditional approval.
WDOE conducted a public hearing to obtain public input on this revision on February 17, 1994. The letter revising the
request for conditional approval was submitted to EPA on June 30, 1994. The November 15, 1991 and June 30, 1994 SIP submittals
were reviewed by EPA to determine completeness in accordance with the completeness criteria set out at 40 CFR part
51, appendix V. Letters dated May 12, 1992 and August 1, 1994, were forwarded to the WDOE indicating the completeness
of the submittals and the next steps to be taken in the review process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. PM&hyph;10 Emissions Inventory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 172(c)(3) of the Act requires that nonattainment plan provisions include a comprehensive, accurate and
current inventory of actual emissions from all sources of relevant pollutants in the nonattainment area. The emissions
inventory should also include a comprehensive, accurate and current inventory of allowable emissions in the area.
See, e.g., CAA section 110(a)(2)(K). Because the submission of such inventories are necessary to an area's attainment
demonstration (or demonstration that the area cannot practicably attain), the emissions inventories must be received
with the attainment/nonattainment demonstration submission (see 57 FR 13539). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
WDOE submitted an emissions inventory of estimated actual emissions for the base year of 1987 and the attainment year
of 1994. The 24-hour emission inventory identified three major source categories contributing to particulate matter
in the Tacoma Tideflats. These are, in descending order of greatest contribution, industrial stack emissions (66
percent); vehicle resuspended road dust (18 percent); and industrial fugitive emissions (13 percent). Other contributing
sources were area sources, such as residential wood combustion and motor vehicle exhaust. The emission inventory
is dominated by one point source, the Simpson Tacoma Kraft Company (Simpson), a paper pulp producer, which accounts
for 45 percent of the emission inventory. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For sources within the nonattainment area, the emissions inventory provides a comprehensive list of particulate
sources and utilizes appropriate factor and estimations that were available at the time the SIP revision was prepared.
However, the emission inventory may underestimate the impact of PM&hyph;10 sources outside of the nonattainment
area. Possibly due to where the nonattainment area boundaries were drawn, there may be a significant source of PM&hyph;10
outside of the nonattainment area. As is discussed in the Technical Support Document (TSD), substantial evidence
indicates that imported residential wood combustion accounts for a large portion of the PM&hyph;10 in the Tacoma
Tideflats. For further information, the reader is referred to the TSD accompanying this action, which is available
at the EPA address indicated above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The emissions inventory estimating actual emissions along with additional available information provides a sufficient
basis for determining the technical adequacy of the attainment demonstration for this area consistent with the requirements
of section 172(c)(3) of the Clean Air Act.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 An additional attainment year emission inventory issue, relating to the attainment demonstration, and other requirements,
is the use of actual instead of allowable emission estimates for projecting attainment. This issue will be discussed
in more detail under the demonstration section of this document. Again, the reader is referred to the TSD corresponding
with this action for further information.

The EPA issued guidance on PM&hyph;10 emissions inventories prior to the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments
in the form of the 1987 PM&hyph;10 SIP Development Guideline. The guidance provided in this document appears to be
consistent with the Act. See CAA section 193.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
3. RACM (Including RACT) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted, the initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas must submit provisions to ensure that RACM (including
RACT) are implemented no later than December 10, 1993 (see CAA sections 172(c)(1) and 189(a)(1)(C)). The General
Preamble contains a detailed discussion of EPA's interpretation of the RACM (including RACT) requirement (see 57
FR 13539&hyph;13545 and 13560&hyph;13561). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In broad terms, the State should identify available control measures evaluating them for their reasonableness in
light of the feasibility of the controls and the attainment needs of the area. A State may reject available control
measures if the measures are technologically infeasible or the cost of the control is unreasonable. In addition,
RACM, does not require controls on emissions from sources that are insignificant (i.e. de minimis) and RACM does not
require the implementation of all available control measures where an area demonstrates timely attainment of the
NAAQS and the implementation of additional controls would not expedite attainment. 57 FR 13540&hyph;13544.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Washington's control strategy for the Tacoma area provides for attainment of the 24-hour standard based on control
of industrial emissions, fugitive industrial emissions including resuspended road dust, and residential wood
combustion. However, as indicated below, some of the control measures are deficient because they are not reflected
in enforceable emission limitations. See CAA sections 110(a)(2)(A) &amp; 172(c)(6). The State has committed to
address this deficiency and, based on section 110(k)(4) of the CAA, EPA is conditionally approving the submittal
relative to the RACM (Including RACT) requirement. The available control measures to be implemented in Tacoma include
the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
a. Industrial Controls
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The largest single reduction in the projected emission inventory results from the control of industrial stack emissions.
As stated earlier, Simpson accounts for 45 percent of the emission inventory. In 1991, Simpson replaced the #2,3,4,5
hogged fuel boilers and #1 oil boiler at the mill with a new hogged fuel boiler. Emissions from the new boiler represent
a 984 kg/day reduction in emissions, almost half of Simpson's previous emissions, or roughly 19 percent of the total
baseline emissions inventory.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, changes in industrial processes resulted in decreased emissions; for example, U.S. Oil and Refining
and Simpson changed fuel sources to burn natural gas. The SIP assumes that emissions from mobile sources will grow
modestly from 1987 to 1994. Even including these growth projections, the overall reduction in industrial PM&hyph;10
stack emissions due to implementation of controls for all sources combined is projected to be 17 percent of the base
year's inventory. However, these industrial changes and controls have not been expressed as enforceable emission
limitations. As discussed earlier, WDOE has committed to submit enforceable emissions limits on the industrial
sources by January 1, 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
b. Industrial Fugitive and Resuspended Road Dust 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Tacoma emission inventory identified industrial fugitive emissions and resuspended road dust as significant
contributors of particulate matter to the airshed. The Puget Sound Air Pollution Control Agency (PSAPCA) is a local
air pollution control agency that has jurisdiction over four counties in Washington State; PSAPCA's jurisdiction
includes the Tacoma Tideflats. PSAPCA's fugitive dust regulation (Regulation I, section 9.15) was designed to reduce
fugitive dust from commercial and industrial activities and also to reduce dust emissions from paved and unpaved
roads and parking lots. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PSAPCA requires ``Best Available Control Technology (BACT)'' under section 9.15 for all fugitive emissions from
all incinerators, boilers, manufacturing equipment and air pollution control equipment. The Tacoma attainment
plan lists and documents emission reductions from several major facilities that were required to pave roads or add
PM&hyph;10 controls as the result of PSAPCA's application of section 9.15. Puget Sound Plywood, Lone Star, Woodworth
and Buffelen were required to either pave roads or modify production processes to comply with section 9.15. The SIP
estimates that the application of section 9.15 would result in a reduction of 73 kg/day of fugitive emissions from
industrial sources. After accounting for an increase of 39 kg/day due to industrial growth, the net total reduction
from the base year to the attainment year of fugitive emissions is 34 kg/day. EPA accepts the emission reductions claimed
from this control measure as reasonable. Since it is generally impractical to source test fugitive emission sources,
a SIP must rely on calculated emission estimates, and control efficiency estimates, to arrive at emission reduction
estimates.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Control of resuspended road dust is a significant component of section 9.15. PSAPCA applies the same section 9.15
BACT provisions to dust emissions from both private and public paved and unpaved roads. In addition, all private roadways
adjoining paved public roads and all commercial properties with access points abutting paved public roads in the
Tacoma nonattainment area are required to implement BACT to stabilize vehicular entrances and exits. The control
measure also appropriately prioritized preventing material deposition on roadways over mitigating measures after
deposition. Looking specifically at the control of resuspended road dust, the plan uses an overall emission reduction
credit of 37 percent from resuspended road dust. EPA accepts this estimate as reasonable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
c. Residential Wood Combustion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As previously noted, there is a substantial body of evidence indicating that imported residential wood combustion
is a large source of Tacoma's PM&hyph;10. All three receptor models concluded that woodsmoke was one of the main sources
of particulate matter in the Tacoma Tideflats area. The most recent receptor modeling study suggested that residential
wood combustion was an unexpectedly strong source of PM&hyph;10. This is also supported by the Saturation Study conducted
by EPA. Additional discussion of the impact of imported residential wood combustion can be found in the TSD associated
with this action. Because of the likely impact of imported residential wood combustion on Tacoma's airshed, the available
control measures adopted for residential wood combustion are discussed here.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PSAPCA initiated a voluntary woodsmoke curtailment program throughout its four county jurisdictional area, including
Tacoma, in the winter of 1987&hyph;88. The program changed to mandatory curtailment beginning with the 1988&hyph;89
heating season, pursuant to WAC 173&hyph;433 and the PSAPCA Regulation I, Article 13. The curtailment program is
a two stage plan. At Stage I, which is imposed when ambient PM&hyph;10 levels reach 75 &mu;g/m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the use of uncertified stoves and fireplaces are banned. At Stage II, imposed when PM&hyph;10 levels reach 105 &mu;g/m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, all woodheating (fireplaces, certified and uncertified woodstoves) is prohibited. The program exempts homes
with no other source of heat. WDOE and PSAPCA regulations contain additional controls, including the prohibition
of all fuels except dry, seasoned wood in woodheating devices. Plume opacity for woodheating devices is limited to
20 percent, with brief exceedances allowed for fire starting and stoking. PSAPCA serves as the primary enforcement
agency for the curtailment and opacity portions of the control program. Both WDOE and PSAPCA administer public education
programs targeted at residential wood burning. Throughout the State, WDOE also enforces a ban on the sale of uncertified
woodstoves. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The strength and depth of the legislated woodsmoke program, and the size and historical effectiveness of the agencies
involved, demonstrates to EPA's satisfaction that the Tacoma area is achieving a sufficient compliance rate to justify
the 70 percent emission reduction credit taken for these measures. A more detailed analysis of the Washington woodsmoke
curtailment plan is contained in the TSD. Since PSAPCA administers the woodsmoke curtailment program throughout
its four-county jurisdictional area and the program affects sources both within the nonattainment area and in adjoining
areas, the 70 percent emission reduction credit is applicable to both residential wood combustion generated in the
nonattainment area and imported residential wood combustion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated, where sources of PM&hyph;10 contribute insignificantly to the PM&hyph;10 problem in the area, EPA's
policy is that RACM does not require the implementation of potentially available control measures. 57 FR 13540. Further,
EPA has indicated that for some sources in areas which demonstrate timely attainment, RACM does not require the implementation
of otherwise available control measures that are not ``reasonably'' available because their implementation would
not expedite attainment (see 57 FR 13543). In the Tacoma situation, EPA believes the significant sources, as well
as several less significant sources, of PM&hyph;10 in the area have been reasonably controlled. Thus, EPA believes
that RACM does not require the implementation of potentially available control measures or technology for other
de minimis sources of PM&hyph;10 in the area. Further, EPA believes implementation of such additional controls in
this area would not expedite attainment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A more detailed discussion of the individual source contributions, their associated control measures and an explanation
as to why certain available control measures were not implemented, can be found in the TSD. EPA has reviewed the State's
explanation and associated documentation and concludes that it adequately justifies the control measures to be
implemented. However, as addressed in more detail in part II.4 below, not all of the emission reductions necessary
to ensure expeditious attainment of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS are embodied in enforceable emission limitations. Thus,
EPA is conditionally approving the control measures submitted for Tacoma, based upon a commitment by the State that
it will submit to EPA by January 1, 1995, legally enforceable emission limits for the significant stack sources in
Tacoma. See CAA section 110(k)(4). This conditional approval is discussed further in the section below.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Demonstration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted, the initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas must submit a demonstration (including air quality
modeling) showing that the plan will provide for attainment as expeditiously as practicable but no later than December
31, 1994 (see section 189(a)(1)(B) of the Act). The General Preamble sets out EPA's guidance on the use of modeling
for moderate area attainment demonstrations (57 FR 13539). Alternatively, if the State does not submit a demonstration
of attainment, the State must show that attainment by December 31, 1994, is impracticable (CAA section 189(a)(1)(B)(ii)).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several studies have been conducted to determine sources of particulate matter in the Tacoma nonattainment area.
WDOE and PSAPCA employed pollutant dispersion models in the Tacoma nonattainment area using both guideline and non-guideline
models. Neither RAM (guideline) nor WYNDvalley (non-guideline) yielded results that were well correlated to measured
values. It is difficult to determine precisely why dispersion modeling failed to yield acceptable values in the Tacoma
Tideflats when similar approaches have proven successful elsewhere, but the TSD raises possible explanations,
including where the boundaries of the nonattainment were drawn and how the background PM&hyph;10 concentration
was established. The reader is referred to the ``Description of Air Quality Modeling'' section of the TSD associated
with this action for further information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to dispersion modeling, three receptor modeling studies were conducted in the Tacoma Tideflats to try
to determine source contribution of PM&hyph;10. Separate from these receptor modeling studies, a saturation study
was conducted to determine the site of maximum impact in the Tacoma nonattainment area. Unfortunately, no single
study conclusively apportions the amount of PM&hyph;10 attributable to different sources. As is discussed in the
TSD, EPA has reservations about each of these studies because of study design flaws, errors in conducting the study,
or changing composition of particulate matter in the airshed. See the ``Attainment Demonstration'' section of the
TSD for a longer discussion of the individual studies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Faced with several studies, none of which were definitive, the WDOE attempted to address several diverse scenarios
to demonstrate attainment and maintenance of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS in the area. The SIP contains three demonstrations
of attainment and maintenance all using rollback, a modified attainment demonstration that EPA may accept on a case-by-case
basis. The first demonstration presented in the SIP is based on receptor modeling and proportional rollback; the
second used a dispersion modeling study and proportional rollback; and the last was based on straight rollback. Tacoma's
SIP meets the criteria for using rollback as outlined in EPA guidance (Attachment 5 of''PM&hyph;10 Moderate Area
SIP Guidance: Final Staff Work Product,'' April 2, 1990). EPA's primary concern about the demonstrations in the SIP
is that they underestimate the amount of PM&hyph;10 from residential wood combustion coming into the nonattainment
area from surrounding areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in the TSD, EPA believes that when looking at the receptor modeling and saturation studies as a whole,
there is a substantial body of evidence indicating that residential wood combustion was and is a major source of PM&hyph;10
in the airshed. As discussed in the TSD, this residential wood combustion is probably being imported into the nonattainment
area, and a conservative lower bound estimate is that 35&hyph;45 percent of the PM&hyph;10 in the Tacoma Tideflats
on the design day is attributable to residential wood combustion. A more detailed discussion of this point can be found
in the ``Attainment Demonstration'' of the TSD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA notes that there has been uncertainty over source contribution in the Tacoma nonattainment area despite numerous
efforts by PSAPCA, WDOE, EPA and other entities to characterize the airshed. In reviewing the SIP, EPA has considered
all relevant studies referenced in the SIP as well as additional information, such as the saturation study. Based
on these studies, EPA finds that imported residential wood combustion is a much larger source of PM&hyph;10 than currently
accounted for in the SIP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To evaluate the impact of imported residential wood combustion into the nonattainment area, the TSD associated with
the rulemaking contains a rollback analysis that incorporates a relatively conservative estimate of the residential
wood combustion being imported into the nonattainment area. As noted earlier, Tacoma's SIP meets the criteria for
using rollback. In the ``Attainment Demonstration'' discussion of the TSD, EPA sets out a rollback scenario that
incorporates the estimate that 35&hyph;45 percent of the PM&hyph;10 in the Tacoma Tideflats on the design day is attributable
to residential wood combustion. A mandatory residential woodsmoke curtailment program is being imposed over a four-county
area that includes the Tacoma Tideflats and surrounding contiguous areas. As discussed earlier in section II.3 of
this document, PSAPCA's mandatory woodstove curtailment program warrants a 70 percent control measure credit.
After applying control measure credit for the mandatory woodstove curtailment program, the rollback scenario presented
in the TSD demonstrates; to EPA's satisfaction, that the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS will be attained by 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assurance of attainment and maintenance rests with the SIP's control measures. The SIP contains a broad array of control
measures aimed at both industrial and residential sources. Based on the emission inventory and related information
about the estimated contribution from residential wood combustion, these control measures, when they are made fully
enforceable (see below), will be sufficient to ensure attainment and maintenance. It should be noted that a major
problem with the attainment demonstration is the attainment year emission inventory used for point (stack) sources.
The inventory was based on actual emission estimates. EPA's Guideline on Air Quality Models (Revised, July 1986)
generally requires use of allowable emissions in inventories for the purposes of modeling attainment of the NAAQS
(see also CAA sections 110(a)(2)(A), 110(a)(2)(K) and 172(c)(6) of the Act). The requirement takes into consideration
possible increases from existing sources allowed by their permits, registrations, or other regulatory mechanisms
and ensures that the control measures relied on in the SIP are based on enforceable emission limitations. WDOE and
PSAPCA, based on comments from EPA, were not able to demonstrate that all point source emissions in the nonattainment
area would be unable to increase significantly above actual levels. Consequently, there is no objective assurance,
or legally enforceable mechanism in place, to restrict a point source from emitting above the estimated actual rate,
should the source have the physical capacity. Therefore, to ensure that the NAAQS will be protected in the Tacoma nonattainment
area, the currently allowable emission limits must be reduced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Despite the fact that Tacoma has been monitoring daily at the site determined to be the site of maximum impact and has
not had an exceedance of the NAAQS at any monitor in four years, there are no legal limits in place to prevent future increases
from a few industrial facilities that could consequently threaten attainment of the NAAQS. On June 30, 1994, WDOE
submitted a request for conditional approval of the Tacoma nonattainment plan based on a commitment to reconcile
the actual/allowable emission limitation issue and thereby establish an enforceable attainment demonstration.
WDOE's commitment includes a schedule to issue regulatory orders to appropriate point sources within the nonattainment
area that will restrict emissions (i.e. establish allowable emission limitations) at or below the ``actual'' emission
estimates used in the attainment demonstration. EPA conditionally approves the attainment demonstration for Tacoma
on the basis of this commitment. See CAA section 110(k)(4). The revisions to the emission limitations for the affected
sources will make enforceable the actual emission limitations already being achieved and implemented in the area.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Like the attainment demonstration, Tacoma's SIP contained three maintenance demonstrations. The first demonstration
is based on receptor modeling and proportional rollback; the second used a dispersion modeling study and proportional
rollback; and the last was based on straight rollback; however, the last demonstration failed to show maintenance
through 1997. EPA believes that the failure of the third demonstration to show maintenance through 1997 is due to the
SIP's low estimate of imported residential woodsmoke.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the ``Evaluation of Attainment Demonstration'' section of the accompanying TSD, EPA considered additional information
and analyses in assessing the maintenance demonstration, including using rollback that differs from the SIP in its
estimate of the amount of residential wood combustion affecting the airshed. EPA believes that after evaluating
all of the studies of the Tacoma Tideflats, there is sufficient evidence to support an interpretation that imported
residential wood combustion is a much stronger source of PM&hyph;10 than currently accounted for in the SIP. Similar
to the demonstration of attainment presented in the ``Attainment Demonstration'' of the TSD, EPA believes a greater
background value that accounts for a large importation of residential woodsmoke should be employed in the maintenance
demonstration. Using the emission inventory, growth factors, and point source emission levels presented in the
SIP, considering additional information about the contribution of residential wood combustion and employing the
same background value as was used in the attainment demonstration discussed in the TSD, the rollback analysis demonstrates
maintenance through 1997, and would therefore satisfy the initial quantitative milestones due for this area, as
discussed in part II.6 below. However, as with the attainment demonstration, some of the control measures relied
on to demonstrate continued maintenance of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS in the SIP are deficient because they are not reflected
in enforceable emission limitations. See CAA sections 110(a)(2)(A) &amp; 172(c)(6). The State has committed to
address this deficiency and, based on section 110(k)(4) of the CAA, EPA is conditionally approving the submittal
relative to the quantitative milestone and reasonable further progress requirements discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The accompanying TSD discusses the dispersion, receptor and saturation studies conducted in the Tacoma Tideflats,
estimates the amount of PM&hyph;10 attributable to residential wood combustion, and presents a rollback demonstration
for attainment and maintenance that incorporates the estimate that 35&hyph;45 percent of the PM&hyph;10 in the Tacoma
Tideflats on the design day is attributable to residential wood combustion. The reader is referred to the TSD associated
with this document for a more detailed discussion of any of these points.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The control requirements which are applicable to major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10, also apply to major stationary
sources of PM&hyph;10 precursors unless EPA determines such sources do not contribute significantly to PM&hyph;10
levels in excess of the NAAQS in that area (see section 189(e) of the Act). The General Preamble contains guidance addressing
how EPA intends to implement section 189(e) of the Act (see 57 FR 13539&hyph;13540 and 13541&hyph;13542). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The three receptor modeling studies conducted in the Tacoma Tideflats show that sulfates and nitrates are not a significant
portion of the Tacoma PM&hyph;10 in the airshed. The three studies are discussed in the TSD. The two receptor modeling
studies conducted during the 1980s show that nitrates accounted for less than 4 percent of the total PM&hyph;10 sampled
mass, while sulfates contributed even less measuring less than 2.5 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third receptor modeling study, the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Evaluation of the Atmospheric Deposition of Toxic Contaminants to Puget Sound
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 study was conducted in the Tacoma Tideflats during 1989 and 1990. The Atmospheric Deposition Study collected fine
particulate (&gt; 2.5 &mu;m) and coarse particulate (&gt; 50 &mu;m). Most of the precursor particles would be occurring
in the fine particle range. The analysis of the fine particles showed that SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 was 9.3 percent of the total mass of fine particles, while NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 accounted for approximately 5 percent of total mass of fine particles. As discussed in the ``Evaluation of Attainment
Demonstration'' in the accompanying TSD, the Atmospheric Deposition Study was conducted during a period when the
airshed was considerably cleaner than the design year. Moreover, control measures were in place during the Atmospheric
Deposition Study's sampling period; five of the sampling days occurred during a ban on the use of uncertified woodstoves.
Therefore, the results of this study are likely to show less PM&hyph;10 due to woodsmoke than probably occurred during
the design year. Correspondingly, the study's assessment of the amount of SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and NO

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 found in the airshed is likely to be greater on a percentage basis than would have been the case during the design year.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due to the relatively small amount of sulfates and nitrates in the airshed, EPA has determined that it is unlikely that
precursors do not contribute significantly to PM&hyph;10 levels which exceed the NAAQS in Tacoma. In addition to
these receptor analyses, a review of the emissions inventory for this area did not reveal any major stationary sources
of PM&hyph;10 precursors. The effect of this finding is to exclude major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 precursors
from PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area control requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While EPA is making a general finding about the contribution of PM&hyph;10 precursors for Tacoma, the determination
is based on the current character of the area including the existing mix of sources in the area. It is possible, therefore,
that future growth could change the significance of precursors in the area. The EPA intends to issue future guidance
addressing such potential changes in the significance of precursor emissions in an area.

6. Quantitative Milestones and Reasonable Further Progress (RFP)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area plan revisions demonstrating attainment must contain quantitative milestones
which are to be achieved every three (3) years until the area is redesignated attainment and which demonstrate RFP,
as defined in section 171(1), toward attainment by December 31, 1994 (see section 189(c) of the Act). Reasonable further
progress is defined in CAA section 171(1) as such annual incremental reductions in emissions of the relevant air pollutant
as are required by Part D or may reasonably be required by the Administrator for the purpose of ensuring attainment
of the applicable NAAQS by the applicable date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While section 189(c) plainly provides that quantitative milestones are to be achieved until an area is redesignated
attainment, it is silent in indicating the starting point for counting the first 3-year period or how many milestones
must be initially addressed. In the General Preamble, EPA addressed the statutory gap in the starting point for counting
the 3-year milestones, indicating that it would begin from the due date for the applicable implementation plan revision
containing the control measures for the area (i.e., November 15, 1991 for initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment
areas). See 57 FR 13539. As to the number of milestones, EPA believes that at least two milestones must be initially
addressed. Thus, submittals to address the SIP revisions due on November 15, 1991 for the initial moderate PM&hyph;10
nonattainment areas must demonstrate timely attainment of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS, the second milestone should, at
a minimum, provide for continued maintenance of the standards.

 Section 189(c) provides that quantitative milestones are to be achieved ``until the area is redesignated attainment.''
However, this endpoint for quantitative milestones is speculative because redesignation of an area as attainment
is contingent upon several factors and future events.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes it is unreasonable to require planning for each nonattainment area to cover quantitative milestones
years into the future because of the possibility that such time may elapse before an area is in fact redesignated attainment.
On the other hand, EPA believes it is reasonable for States initially to submit a sufficient number of milestones to
ensure that there is continuing air quality protection beyond the attainment deadline. Addressing two milestones
will ensure that the State continues to maintain the NAAQS beyond the attainment date for at least some period during
which an area could be redesignated attainment. However, in all instances, additional milestones must be addressed
if an area is not redesignated attainment within the time period covered by the initial milestones.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In implementing RFP for this initial moderate area, EPA has reviewed the attainment demonstration and control strategy
for the area to assess whether the initial milestones have been satisfied and to determine whether annual incremental
reductions, different from those provided in the SIP, should be required in order to ensure attainment of the PM&hyph;10
NAAQS by December 31, 1994 (see CAA section 171(1)). As indicated, the State of Washington's PM&hyph;10 SIP for Tacoma
demonstrates attainment in 1994 and maintenance through 1997, and therefore would satisfy RFP and initial quantitative
milestones (see 57 FR 13539) if all of the control measures relied upon were reflected in enforceable emission limitations.
However, as discussed previously, WDOE and PSAPCA based attainment and maintenance demonstrations on actual emission
estimates instead of the required allowable rates. The State has committed to adopt the necessary enforceable allowable
emission limits by January 1, 1995. Accordingly, as with other requirements discussed elsewhere in this document,
EPA is conditionally approving the submittal relative to the RFP and initial milestone requirements. CAA section

7. Enforceability Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All measures and other elements in the SIP must be enforceable by WDOE and EPA (see CAA sections 172(c)(6), 110(a)(2)(A)
and 57 FR 13556). EPA criteria addressing the enforceability of SIP's and SIP revisions were stated in a September
23, 1987, memorandum (with attachments) from J. Craig Potter, Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, et
al. (see 57 FR 13541). Nonattainment area plan provisions must also contain a program that provides for enforcement
of the control measures and other elements in the SIP (see CAA section 110(a)(2)(C)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
WDOE's control measures and regulations for control of Particulate Matter, which are contained in the SIP, are addressed
above under the section headed ``RACM (including RACT).'' These control measures apply to the types of activities
identified in that discussion including, for example, fugitive emissions from point sources; vehicle resuspended
road dust; and residential wood combustion. The SIP provides that the affected activities will be controlled throughout
the entire nonattainment area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The TSD contains further information on enforceability requirements including enforceable emission limitations;
a description of the rules contained in the SIP and the source types subject to them; test methods and compliance schedules;
malfunction provisions; excess emission provisions; correctly cited references of incorporated methods/rules;
and

reporting and recordkeeping requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both WDOE and PSAPCA have responsibilities in the implementation and enforcement of control measures in the Tacoma
nonattainment area. PSAPCA retains authority over all area sources and all but the two stationary sources in Tacoma
that are regulated by the Department of Ecology. PSAPCA has many compliance inspectors and, as discussed further
in the TSD, EPA considers PSAPCA's staffing level adequate to ensure that the Tacoma attainment plan is fully implemented.
As a necessary adjunct of its enforcement program, PSAPCA also has broad powers to adopt rules and regulations, issue
orders, assess penalties, require access to records and information, and receive and disburse funds. The Washington
State Department of Ecology has adequate authority to implement and enforce the plan in the event PSAPCA fails to make
a good faith effort to implement and/or enforce the regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The two point sources in the Tacoma nonattainment area not under PSAPCA's jurisdiction are the Simpson Tacoma Kraft
Company and Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Corporation. These sources are regulated by the Washington State Department
of Ecology. The Washington State Department of Ecology's legal authorities, personnel and funding sources are discussed
in the accompanying TSD. EPA finds these authorities and funding mechanisms adequate to ensure that the State will
be able to enforce the control measures in the Tacoma nonattainment area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Controls on area sources, such as the residential wood combustion program and the fugitive dust control program are
also enforceable. Discussion and justification of EPA's reasoning can be found in the control measure section of
this document and the TSD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, as discussed elsewhere in this document, the use of actual emission estimates rather than the significantly
higher emission limits allowed in the current WDOE or PSAPCA regulations is unacceptable. WDOE, PSAPCA, and EPA could
only enforce the allowable emissions that are currently contained in the WDOE or PSAPCA regulations. There are no
mechanisms for any of the regulatory agencies to enforce the emission estimates used in the attainment and maintenance
demonstration because they are well below the legal limits allowed in the WDOE or PSAPCA regulations. A discussion
regarding the use of actual instead of allowable emissions contained in the demonstration portion of this document
provides background for the enforceability decision. The Region is granting a conditional approval of the Tacoma
attainment plan based on the commitment contained in the June 30, 1994, submittal which will make the emissions from
point sources enforceable at or below the levels used to demonstrate attainment and maintenance. EPA will need additional
technical documentation from WDOE if the emission levels in the regulatory orders are greater than those used in the
attainment and three year maintenance demonstrations. Additionally, WDOE would need to provide cogent attainment
and maintenance demonstrations in order for the SIP to be fully approved.

8. Contingency Measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As provided in section 172(c)(9) of the Act, all moderate nonattainment area SIP's that demonstrate attainment must
include contingency measures (see generally 57 FR 13510&hyph;13512 &amp; 13543&hyph;13544). These measures must
be submitted by November 15, 1993, for the initial moderate nonattainment areas. Contingency measures should consist
of other available measures that are not part of the area's core control strategy. These measures must take effect
without further action by the State or EPA, upon a determination by EPA that the area has failed to make RFP or attain
the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS by the applicable statutory deadline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assessing the adequacy of Tacoma's contingency measures is tied to the attainment demonstration because Tacoma
has submitted industrial emissions controls in excess of those needed to demonstrate timely attainment of the PM&hyph;10
NAAQS as a contingency measure. As discussed above, Simpson's boiler replacement alone represents a 984 kg/day reduction
in emissions, almost half of Simpson's previous emissions, or roughly 19 percent of the total baseline emissions
inventory. Based on the rollback discussion provided in the accompanying TSD, the Tacoma SIP contains emissions
limits and contingency measures that provide for reductions greater than the 25 percent contingency measure emissions
reduction value suggested in the General Preamble (57 FR 13543&hyph;13544). Further discussion can be found in the
``Contingency Measure'' section of the accompanying TSD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The contingency measures submitted as part of the Tacoma SIP ranged from a commitment to implement mobile source controls
to crediting the emission limitations already existing in the SIP that would be in excess of those needed to address
the RACM (including RACT) requirement. The two mobile source contingency measures in the 1991 SIP were directed at
reducing emissions from diesel vehicles: (1) the establishment of an inspection and maintenance (I/M) program,
and (2) the reduction in sulfur content of on-highway diesel fuel. In 1993, Washington State expanded its I/M program
to include the Tacoma area, and the desulfurization program was implemented nationally.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Only the measures that are being implemented prior to a determination that the area has failed to timely attain or achieve
RFP, that would be in excess of those necessary to provide for timely attainment of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS and that, therefore,
go beyond RACM (including RACT) can be relied on as contingency measures. The measures will provide for continued
emissions reduction progress beyond the core control strategy. Further, because the State would implement these
precautionary measures prior to a determination that the area has failed to timely attain the NAAQS or achieve RFP,
these measures essentially provide advance contingency benefit and satisfy the requirement that they ``take effect
. . . without further action by the State, or the Administrator.'' EPA believes it would be unreasonable to penalize
or otherwise discourage the State from taking the arguably more precautionary air quality management step of accelerating
the implementation of these contingency measures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, it cannot be determined whether these measures are in excess of those necessary to provide for expeditious
attainment and necessary to address RACM (including RACT) until the State addresses the deficiencies associated
with its core control strategy. As indicated elsewhere, the State has committed to convert measures necessary to
address RACM (including RACT) to enforceable emission limitations. Until this commitment is fulfilled, EPA cannot
conclude that the contingency measures go beyond the core control strategy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, EPA is conditionally approving these contingency measures. Due to the submission of emission reductions
that are purportedly in excess of those necessary to demonstrate timely attainment and necessary to satisfy RACM
as a contingency measure, final approval or disapproval of these contingency measures must be determined when WDOE
submits the regulatory orders establishing enforceable emission limits for the stationary sources in the Tacoma
Tideflats.

III. Implications of This Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA conditionally approves the plan revisions submitted to EPA for the Tacoma, Washington, nonattainment area on
November 15, 1991, and June 30, 1994, except for the following elements which EPA approves in full. EPA also approves,
without conditions, the separable exclusion from precursor controls as described in part II.5 above, the monitoring
network, the procedures for consultation and public notification, the provisions for revising the plan and the adequacy
of funding and authority. EPA will assess the final approvability of the submittals EPA is conditionally approving
after the State fulfills its commitment to submit enforceable emission limitations by January 1, 1995. If the State
fails to comply with its commitment, the conditional approval will become a disapproval.

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2224), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. OMB has exempted this regulatory action from Executive Order 12866
review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by December 12, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by
the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor
does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (see CAA
section 307(b)(2), 42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(2)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment
and anticipates no adverse comments. This action will be effective on December 12, 1994 unless adverse comments are
received by November 14, 1994. If the EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all
public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on the proposed rule (please see the proposed
rule published, simultaneously, in the proposal section of this

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Conditional approvals of SIP submittals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements,
but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval
does not impose any new requirements, EPA certifies that it does not have a significant impact on small entities affected.
Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility
analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The CAA forbids EPA
to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the conditional approval is converted to a disapproval under section 110(k), based on the State's failure to meet
the commitment, it will not affect any existing State requirements applicable to small entities. Federal disapproval
of the State submittal does not affect its State-enforceability. Moreover, EPA's disapproval of the submittal does
not impose a new Federal requirement. Therefore, EPA certifies that this disapproval action does not have a significant
impact on a substantial number of small entities because it does not remove existing State requirements nor does it
substitute a new Federal requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any State implementation plan. Each request for revision to the State implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements.

I. Clean Air Act Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA or Act), requires certain States to revise and improve existing I/M programs
or implement new ones. All ozone nonattainment areas classified as moderate or worse must implement a basic or enhanced
I/M program depending upon its nonattainment classification, regardless of previous requirements. In addition,
Congress directed the EPA in section 182(a)(2)(B) to publish updated guidance for State I/M programs, taking into
consideration findings of the Administrator's audits and investigations of these programs. The States must incorporate
EPA's guidance into SIPs for all areas required by the Act to have an I/M program. Metropolitan statistical areas with
populations of 100,000 or more that are within the Northeast Ozone Transport Region also are required to meet EPA guidance
for enhanced I/M programs.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA has designated three areas as nonattainment for ozone in the State of New Hampshire. The New Hampshire portion
of the Boston-Lawrence-Salem Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area is classified serious for ozone, the
Portsmouth-Dover-Rochester Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), also classified serious for ozone, and the Manchester
MSA, classified marginal for ozone. The designations for ozone were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (FR) on November 6, 1991 (56 FR 56694) and November 30, 1992 (57 FR 56762) and have been codified in the Code of Federal
Regulations (CFR) at 40 CFR 81.300 through 81.437. Based on these nonattainment designations, an enhanced I/M program
is required in Hillsborough, Rockingham, and Strafford Counties. In addition, these MSAs have populations of over
100,000 and are included in the Ozone Transport Region. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although parts of Merrimack County are in the Manchester MSA, the county could be exempted since, in New England, MSAs
are defined by town, not by county; more than fifty percent of the MSA population would still be in the I/M program; and
the population density is less than 200 persons per square mile. Under EPA's I/M rule 40 CFR 51.350(b)(1) such portions
of Merrimack County are not required to implement I/M. However, all of Merrimack County is included to provide an opportunity
to generate enforceable emission reductions that may be used to help provide opportunity for economic growth. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By this action, EPA is conditionally approving the New Hampshire I/M SIP revision. EPA has reviewed the State submittals
against the statutory requirements under the Act and for consistency with EPA regulations. In letters dated May 19,
1994 and June 28, 1994, New Hampshire indicated its intent to address a number of outstanding issues discussed in this
document as well as in the July 18, 1994 notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR), and to submit necessary revisions to EPA
by August 18, 1994. New Hampshire submitted such revisions on August 18. They are consistent with the NPR as discussed
below and fully meet the requirements of the I/M rule, except for the portions being conditionally approved in this
document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three parts of the program, on-road testing, compliance via diagnostic inspection, and enforcement against inspectors
require more time to resolve and provide the basis for today's conditional approval. As requested by New Hampshire,
the state will have until July 29, 1995 to submit revisions to address these three areas. If such revisions are submitted
by that date, fulfill the conditions set forth in this document, and fully meet the requirements of the I/M rule, the
state will have met the specified conditions and the I/M SIP will be fully approved. If not, this conditional approval
will automatically convert to a disapproval. A summary of EPA's analysis is provided below. In addition, more detailed
support for conditionally approving the State submittal is contained in the technical support document which is
available from the New England Regional Office, listed above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 5, 1992 (57 FR 52950), EPA published a final regulation establishing the I/M requirements, pursuant to
sections 182 and 187 of the Act. The I/M regulation was codified at 40 CFR part 51, subpart S, and requires States to submit,
by November 15, 1993, an I/M SIP revision including all necessary legal authority and the items specified in 40 CFR
51.350(a)(1) through 51.373.

On February 28, 1994, April 19, 1994, and April 21, 1994, the State of New Hampshire submitted an I/M SIP for its three
nonattainment areas. Public hearings for the submittals were held on January 5 and 6, 1994 for the February 28, 1994
SIP submittal, and on March 8, 1994 for the April 19, 1994 SIP submittal. The April 21, 1994 submittal contained only
administrative materials to supplement the April 19 submission. EPA submitted written comments to the state on March
18, 1994. In letters dated May 19, 1994 and June 28, 1994, the state agreed to submit by August 19, 1994, additional information
to address the areas discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The submittals provide for the implementation of an enhanced I/M program in four counties in New Hampshire beginning
in 1995. New Hampshire will be implementing a biennial, test-only I/M program meeting the requirements of the I/M
performance standard and other requirements contained in EPA's I/M rule. Testing will be overseen by the New Hampshire
Department of Safety (NHDOS) and the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (NHDES), with actual testing
done by a contractor. Other aspects of the New Hampshire I/M program include: testing of 1968 and later light duty vehicles
and trucks and heavy duty trucks, evaporative emission testing for 1975 and later model year vehicles, a test fee to
ensure the State has adequate resources to implement the program, enforcement by registration suspension, a repair
effectiveness program, contractual requirements for testing convenience, quality assurance, data collection,
minimum expenditure, time extension and hardship waivers, reporting, test equipment and test procedure specifications,
public information and consumer protection, inspector training and certification, and penalties against inspector
incompetence. In addition, the enhanced I/M program will include: IM240 testing for 1981 and newer vehicles, an on-road
testing program, and emission recall enforcement.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 18, 1994, EPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) for the State of New Hampshire (59 FR 36408). The
NPR proposed conditional approval of the New Hampshire enhanced inspection and maintenance program. In response
to the NPR an additional submittal was made by New Hampshire on August 18, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NPR identified eight areas which needed to be addressed by New Hampshire. The August 18, 1994 submission by New
Hampshire adequately addressed these areas. Each one is discussed below and the state's response summarized.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 1. Enhanced I/M Performance Standard_Some of the assumptions used by New Hampshire in the MOBILE5a modeling demonstration
needed to be revised. The assumptions for gasoline Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) and vehicle refueling emissions used
in the model program were not the same as those used in the New Hampshire proposed program. The state was also asked to
review the assumptions for compliance and waiver rates and revise them if appropriate. The compliance and waiver
rates are discussed elsewhere in this document. The state revised the assumptions appropriately in the August 18,
1994 submittal, which included a new MOBILE5a modeling demonstration showing that the performance standard will
be met with the proposed New Hampshire program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Network Type and Program Evaluation_The state did not have provisions to bar contractor employees from referring
motorists to particular repair facilities. The state has provided contract language drafted by the New Hampshire
Office of the Attorney General, the substance of which will be included in the final contract, to bar contractor employees
from referring motorists to particular repair facilities and to provide for appropriate penalties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Vehicle Coverage_The state did not provide adequate information on vehicles subject to the program. In its August
18 submittal, New Hampshire included a table showing the number of subject vehicles by model year and provided information
on exempt vehicles.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Quality Control_The state did not address the required quality control manual in sufficient detail. The state
indicated in previous submittals that the quality control manual will be developed by the contractor. The manual
will follow specifications for quality control per EPA's Technical Guidance, and New Hampshire regulations. In
the August 18 submittal, New Hampshire included a table of contents for the manual. Based on these documents, the resulting
quality control manual will meet EPA requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Waiver Rate_The state offered to provide additional guidance on procedures for waiver review, and to reconsider
the 1% waiver rate in the original submittal. The state explained in the August 18 submittal that the present waiver
rate is less than one half of one percent, and that in order to qualify for a waiver, verification of repairs must be done
by a highly trained state referee, and repairs must be performed by a certified mechanic who will have attended up to
120 hours of training. Although New Hampshire does not expect the waiver rate to increase, they increased the rate
in the SIP to 2%.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Motorist Compliance Enforcement_The state needed to submit information justifying a 99% compliance rate, describing
the computer matching system, handling of exempt vehicles, fleet vehicles, and tracking of out of state exemptions
and time extensions. In the August 18 submittal, the state described a 12 point enforcement program which will assure
a 99% compliance rate. The state also described the software and hardware upgrades which will be made to the computer
matching system. As part of the Enforcement Compliance Procedures also submitted on August 18, change of status actions,
which could make a previously subject vehicle exempt, must be verified by a Highway Enforcement Officer. Fleet vehicles
must be tested at the contractor facilities and meet the same requirements as other vehicles. A more detailed fleet
plan will be developed as part of the contract. New Hampshire explained that out of state exemptions and time extensions
would be tracked with the computer system, and vehicle owners would be issued registration suspensions when the time
of the extension ran out if the vehicle was not in compliance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Quality Assurance_The state agreed to address certain points in the August 18 submittal. The August 18 submittal
stated that audit reports will be entered onto the host computer of the contractor, and a hard copy of the audit report
will be kept in the stations file in the I/M office. The report filed with the audit results will contain enough evidence
to request an administrative hearing if necessary. Anyone suspected of violating regulations would be targeted
for additional auditing. The DOS intends to assign officers that do not have regular contact with a particular facility
to conduct covert audits. Auditors will receive 128 hours of training at a vocational technical college covering
rules of the program, emission failures and emission repairs. Auditors will also be involved in acceptance testing
of the program and will receive quality assurance, quality control, and equipment training from the contractor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Improving Repair Effectiveness_The state agreed to submit a plan to transmit information to the repair industry.
The August 18 submittal stated that New Hampshire will require the contractor to issue a quarterly newsletter to repair
facilities containing national information and tips, local program changes, training courses, common problems,
diagnostic tips, and other assistance issues.

Conditional Approval
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The August 18, 1994 submittal reaffirmed New Hampshire's commitment to submit by July 29, 1995 revisions addressing
compliance via diagnostic inspection, the inspector penalty schedule, and standards for remote sensing technology.
All three require regulation revisions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Compliance via diagnostic inspections were allowed for all model years in the original submission, but in a letter
dated May 19, 1994, the state indicated that it will establish procedures and a policy which will allow compliance
by this mechanism only on 1981 and newer vehicles subject to IM240 tests at final cutpoints or lower. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The New Hampshire Enhanced I/M Rule, Section 16, does not require imposition of substantial penalties as defined
by EPA's I/M rule (six month suspension) or equivalent retainage on the first offense by inspectors for violations
that directly affect emission reduction benefits. In its letter to EPA dated June 28, 1994 New Hampshire stated that
Section 16 will be revised to be consistent with the penalties required by the EPA rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The state has not established standards for the on-road testing program. In a letter dated May 19, 1994, the state
commits to develop and submit standards to EPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The state has committed, in it's May 19 and June 28, 1994 letters to submitting revisions addressing the three issues
discussed above by July 29, 1995. Section 110(k)(4) of the CAA provides that, if a state fails to comply with its commitment,
such conditional approval will convert to a disapproval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other specific requirements of EPA's I/M rule and the rationale for EPA's proposed action are explained in the NPR
and will not be restated here. No public comments were received on the NPR. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Response to Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 18, 1994 (59 FR 36408), EPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) for the State of New Hampshire. The
NPR proposed conditional approval, or in the alternative, disapproval of the New Hampshire I/M SIP submitted by the
State. No public comments were received on the NPR.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Final Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is conditionally approving the New Hampshire Enhanced Vehicle Inspection and Maintenance Program as a revision
to the New Hampshire SIP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to a SIP shall be considered in light of specific technical, economic,
and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted elsewhere in this document, the EPA received no comment on the proposed action. Accordingly, the Regional
Administrator has reclassified this action from Table 1 to Table 3 under the processing procedures published in the
FR on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214), and revisions to these procedures issued on October 4, 1993, in an EPA memorandum
entitled ``Changes to State Implementation Plan (SIP) Tables.'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulatory Process
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the FR on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro,
Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this action
from Executive Order 12866 review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator certifies that SIP approvals under sections 107, 110 and 172 of the Clean
Air Act will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. SIP approvals (or redesignations)
do not create any new requirements but simply approve requirements that are already state law. SIP approvals (or redesignations),
therefore, do not add any additional requirements for small entities. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State
relationship under the Clean Air Act, preparation of a flexibility analysis for a SIP approval would constitute Federal
inquiry into the economic reasonableness of the State actions. The Clean Air Act forbids EPA to base its actions concerning
SIPs on such grounds.

, 427 U.S. 246, 96 S. Ct. 2518 (1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 If the conditional approval is converted to a disapproval under section 110(k), based on the state's failure to meet
the commitment, it will not affect any existing state requirements applicable to small entities. Federal disapproval
of the state submittal does not affect its state-enforceability. Moreover, EPA's disapproval of the submittal does
not impose a new Federal requirement. Therefore, EPA certifies that in the event EPA disapproves the state submittal,
this disapproval action would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities because it would
not remove existing state requirements nor does it substitute a new Federal requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by December 12, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by
the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor
does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section
307(b)(2).)

Under Executive Order 12866, (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines
``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal
governments or communities;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) Materially
alter the budgetary impact of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients
thereof; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has been determined that this rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the terms of Executive Order
12866 and is therefore not subject to OMB review.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is approving a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Maryland. This revision consists
of an emission statement program for stationary sources which emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and/or nitrogen
oxides (NOx) at or above specified actual emission threshold levels. The intended effect of this action is to approve
in the State of Maryland a regulation for annual reporting of actual emissions by sources that emit VOC and /or NOx in
accordance with sections 184(b)(2) and 182(f) of the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA). This action is being taken under
section 110 of the Clean Air Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On June 21, 1994 (59 FR 31962), EPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) for the State of Maryland. The NPR
proposed approval of the Maryland's Emission Statement Program. The formal SIP revision was submitted by the State
of Maryland on November 13, 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Maryland's Department of the Environment (MDE) submitted a revision to Maryland's SIP which requires owners of stationary
sources that emit VOCs and/or NOx, above specified actual emission applicability thresholds, to submit annual statements
certifying emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other specific requirements of the SIP revision on Emission Statements and the rationale for EPA's proposed action
are explained in the NPR and will not be restated here. No public comments were received on the NPR.

Final Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is approving amendments to COMAR 26.11.01, General Administrative Procedures, to revise section .01, Definitions,
and to add section .05&hyph;1, Emission Statements, as a revision to the State of Maryland SIP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any State Implementation Plan. Each request for revision to the State Implementation Plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action has been classified as a Table 3 action for signature by the Regional Administrator under the procedures
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The OMB has exempted this regulatory action from Executive Order
12866 review.

Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by December 12, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by
the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor
does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action to approve Maryland's Emission Statements Program may not be challenged later
in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission, at the request of Ocean Isle Broadcasting Company, allots Channel 228A to Ocean Isle Beach, NC, as
the community's first local aural transmission service. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
59 FR 4020, January 28, 1994. Channel 228A can be allotted to Ocean Isle Beach in compliance with the Commission's minimum
distance separation requirements, at coordinates 33&hyph;53&hyph;40 North Latitude and 78&hyph;28&hyph;26
West Longitude, with a site restriction of 4.3 kilometers (2.7 miles) west to avoid a short-spacing to vacant but applied-for
Channel 229A at Wrightsville Beach, NC. The allotment at Ocean Isle Beach is short-spaced to the presently licensed
facility of Station WLTT, Channel 228A, Shallotte, NC. However, pursuant to the modification of Station WLTT's license
to specify operation on Channel 279C3, a construction permit specifying the new channel has been granted and the licensee
has now filed an application for license to cover its construction permit (BLH&hyph;940210KA). Final action on a
construction permit application for Channel 228A at Ocean Isle Beach may be withheld pending the licensing of Station
WLTT at the site specified in its construction permit. With this action, this proceeding is terminated.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Occupational Safety and Health Administration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(OSHA) is issuing a final standard specifying safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements covering all logging operations, regardless of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the end use of the forest products (saw logs, veneer bolts, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pulpwood, chips, etc.). This standard replaces the existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard at 29 CFR 1910.266, that had applied only to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pulpwood logging, and thereby expands coverage to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection for all employees engaged in logging operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final standard addresses the unique hazards found in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logging operations, and supplements other general industry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards in 29 CFR part 1910. The final standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
strengthens and further clarifies some provisions of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing standard, and eliminates unnecessary provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised standard also requires training for all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees in this high risk industry. OSHA believes this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard will significantly decrease the number of employees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
killed or injured in this industry.

reference of certain publications listed in the standard is

I. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(OSHA) is issuing a final standard detailing safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for logging operations, regardless of the end 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of the forest products (saw logs, veneer bolts, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pulpwood, chips, etc.). Logging consists of felling trees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(usually by chain saws), removing the limbs and branches 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(limbing), and cutting or splitting the trees into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manageable logs (bucking). Trees and logs are then moved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(yarding) to central locations (landings) by one of several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methods (e.g., skidding or forwarding). In relatively flat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terrain, logs are hooked to a tractor and dragged to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
landing. When terrain is very steep or rough, logs may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transported by steel cables attached to a winching apparatus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(cable yarder) via a system of cables, blocks, pulleys, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carriages (cable yarding). Then logs are partially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suspended and dragged over the ground (high-lead yarding) or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hoisted into the air and conveyed on overhead cables (sky-line yarding) to the landing. At the landing, logs are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mechanically loaded onto trucks, railroad cars or barges for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transport to sawmills. In some cases logs are formed into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
log rafts for transport by water to sawmills. Logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations require employees to work in all types of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weather, on all types of terrain and in isolated, remote 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
locations. (Logging operations and regional characteristics 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are discussed in greater detail in the profile of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logging industry in the Regulatory Impact Analysis.)

II. Regulatory History 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA's existing pulpwood standard was adopted pursuant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to Section 6(a) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1970 (the OSH Act) (29 U.S.C. 655(a)). Section 6(a) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permitted OSHA, within two years of the enactment of the OSH 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act, to promulgate as OSHA standards any existing national 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consensus standard or established Federal standard. At that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time, the only national consensus standard covering logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations was the American National Standards Institute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard that was limited to pulpwood logging (ANSI O3.1&hyph;1971, Pulpwood Logging Safety Standard) (Ex 2&hyph;13).
OSHA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pulpwood standard has remained virtually unchanged since it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was first adopted.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After OSHA adopted the ANSI pulpwood logging standard, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trade associations with interests in the logging of other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forest products, such as sawlogs and veneer bolts, joined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with ANSI to revise the pulpwood logging standard to include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all logging operations within the United States. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expanded ANSI standard was approved May 19, 1977 (ANSI 03.1&hyph;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1978, Safety Requirements for Logging) (hereafter ``1978 ANSI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logging standard'') (Ex. 2&hyph;14). That standard adopted most of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the safety practices contained in the earlier standard, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applying them to all logging operations throughout the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1978 ANSI logging standard, however, was withdrawn 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by ANSI in 1984 because no final action was taken to revise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or reaffirm it. Since ANSI procedures require that action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be taken to reaffirm, revise, or withdraw a standard no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
later than five years after the date of its publication, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1978 ANSI logging standard was withdrawn by default. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently there is no national consensus standard covering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logging operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In July 1976, the National Institute for Occupational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Safety and Health (NIOSH), published a criteria document, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recommendations For An Occupational Standard For Logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
From Felling To First Haul that was applicable to all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logging operations (Ex. 4&hyph;3). The NIOSH document addressed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the hazards and safe work practices involved in felling, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bucking, limbing, yarding and loading operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NIOSH criteria document differed from OSHA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pulpwood logging standard in several ways: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The criteria document included all logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations such as those relating to sawlogs, veneer bolts, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
poles and pilings rather than being limited only to pulpwood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) It included training requirements for employees; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) It did not include provisions dealing with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment protective devices, personnel transport, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
off-highway truck transport, chipping operations, or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
construction and maintenance of roads, trails, and bridges; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) It recommended pre-placement and periodic medical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examinations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final standard for logging operations, as did 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA's proposed rule, adopts many of the recommendations of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the NIOSH criteria document, including expansion of coverage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to all logging operations, emphasis on safe work practices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and training, and elimination of provisions not unique to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logging operations, such as that involving construction of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
roads and bridges.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Six states have promulgated standards covering logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations under the OSH Act State plan procedure set forth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in section 18 of the OSH Act (29 U.S.C. &sect;667) and in OSHA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations (29 CFR Part 1902), which requires State plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States to adopt standards which are at least as effective as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those promulgated under section 6 of the OSH Act. 29 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1902.03(c). These States, Alaska (Ex. 2&hyph;17), California 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ex. 2&hyph;18), Hawaii (Ex. 2&hyph;19), Michigan (Ex. 2&hyph;20), Oregon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ex. 2&hyph;21) and Washington (Ex. 2&hyph;22), have adopted standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which provide more protection than OSHA's pulpwood logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard by covering all logging operations within their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States. The standards of the five western states also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contain a much higher level of detail and specification than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either the 1978 ANSI logging standard or OSHA's pulpwood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logging standard. OSHA used these standards as source 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documents during development of this final standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 2, 1989, OSHA published a notice of proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking (NPRM) to amend OSHA's pulpwood logging standard, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
29 CFR 1910.266, to include requirements for all logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations (54 FR 18798). Thereafter, on May 11, 1990, OSHA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published a notice of hearing in which 10 issues were raised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for additional comment (55 FR 19745). There were 92 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments submitted in response to the proposed rule and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Informal public hearings were held on July 24&hyph;25, 1990, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in Washington, D.C., and on August 21&hyph;23, 1990, in Portland, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OR, to allow interested persons who had objections to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule to have an opportunity to state those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
objections. There were 23 companies, organizations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associations and individuals who participated in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearings.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the close of the hearing Administrative Law Judge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
John M. Vittone established a 60-day post hearing comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period, until October 22, 1990, for the submission of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional information and data supplementing the testimony 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided at the hearing. The post-hearing comment period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was followed by another 30 days, until November 21, 1990, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for hearing participants to submit final briefs, analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and summations. OSHA received 12 comments during the post-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing comment period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has considered all evidence, comments and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testimony entered into the rulemaking record and presented 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the public hearing in developing this final standard.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The safety hazards present in the logging industry are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
well-known,
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 and there is no dispute among participants in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this rulemaking that logging is a high hazard industry (Ex. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2&hyph;1 through 2&hyph;10, 2&hyph;30, 5&hyph;18, 38B, 38C). The tools and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment which logging employees use or operate, such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chain saws, axes and tractors, pose hazards wherever they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are utilized in industry. As logging employees use their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tools and equipment, they are dealing with massive weights 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and irresistible momentum of falling, rolling, and sliding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trees and logs. The hazards are even more acute when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dangerous environmental conditions are factored in, such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uneven, unstable or rough terrain; inclement weather 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including rain, snow, lightning, winds, and extreme cold; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remote and isolated work sites where health care facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are not immediately accessible. The combination of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazards present a significant risk to employees working in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logging operations throughout the country, regardless of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
type of timber being logged, where it is logged or the end 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of the wood.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has identified a number of health hazards that are also
present in the logging industry (Ex. 5&hyph;42). According to NIOSH, 20 to 50 percent of employees in felling operations
may be affected by hand-arm vibration syndrome. Logging employees are also exposed to chain-saw exhaust, wood dust,
tree fungi and bacteria. However, NIOSH has said that at this time there is insufficient data to project the magnitude
of risk for some of these potential health hazards. The final rule on logging addresses health hazards, but only in
certain specific ways (e.g., safety and health meetings). However, for those health hazards not specifically addressed
in the logging final rule, other sections of Part 1910 apply. For example, occupational noise exposure is addressed
by 29 CFR 1910.95. A permissible exposure limit for occupational exposure to wood dust is contained in 29 CFR 1910.1000.
OSHA notes that hand-arm vibration, manual lifting and other risk factors associated with musculoskeletal disorders
are being addressed in OSHA's rulemaking on ergonomic safety and health management.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There is also no dispute that these hazards and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resulting injuries and fatalities are severe and are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited to the pulpwood sector of the industry (Ex. 2&hyph;1, 5&hyph;6, 5&hyph;10, 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;18, 5&hyph;21,
5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;42, 5&hyph;46, 5&hyph;48, 5&hyph;49, 5&hyph;54, 5&hyph;61, 5&hyph;65). The 1992 Census of
Fatal Occupational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Injuries, a public report compiled by the Bureau of Labor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Statistics (BLS), indicated there were 158 fatalities in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logging industry, which amounts to a 2 in 1,000 risk of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
death each year. The National Institute for Occupational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Safety and Health (NIOSH) estimates that there are 16,500 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compensable injuries each year in the logging industry (Ex. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
37). This amounts to an incidence rate of 1 in every 5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loggers. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(USDA), the accident rate in the logging industry has pushed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
workers' compensation insurance to 40 percent of payroll 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs (Ex. 5&hyph;18). The USDA estimates that this now amounts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to $90 million annually in the Pacific Northwest Region 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alone. According to a study conducted by the Bureau of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Labor Statistics (BLS), as least 47 percent of all injuries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reported occurred in non-pulpwood logging operations (Ex. 2&hyph;1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following discussion of the accident and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injury data shows that injury incidence rate for the logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry is among the highest industry incidence rates in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the country.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA looked at several data sources to identify and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characterize the degree of risk faced by employees in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logging industry. The data show that the logging industry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has one of the highest injury incidence rates. For example, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the most recent injury incidence rate for the logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry (15.6) compiled by the BLS is almost double the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incidence rate for the combined private sector (7.9). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logging incidence rate was also well above the incidence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate for the manufacturing sector (11.2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assess the level of risk in logging operations, OSHA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relied primarily on the following data sources. These data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources are described and discussed below.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Bureau of Labor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Statistics (BLS) publishes annual reports that list the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimates of injuries in the private sector during the year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under consideration, Occupational Injuries and Illnesses in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the United States by Industry (Ex. 2&hyph;1, 2&hyph;2, 2&hyph;3, 2&hyph;4, 2&hyph;5, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2&hyph;6, 2&hyph;7, 2&hyph;8, 2&hyph;9, 2&hyph;10, 2&hyph;30, 38B and 38C). The data and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information are broken down industry by industry according 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes. The BLS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injury reports and data are generated from inquiries to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selected employers about the OSHA Form 200 (Log and Summary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Table 1 shows BLS occupational injury incidence data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the logging industry for 1972 through 1991. The data in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Table 1 were derived from the BLS data using SIC code 241 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Logging Camps and Logging Contractors). While this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
classification covers the majority of the employees engaging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in logging operations, it does not cover loggers employed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mills (SIC 242&hyph;Sawmills and Planing Mills) and other loggers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
working for other miscellaneous employers (SIC 24&hyph;Lumber and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wood Products, Except Furniture). Although the incidence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rates for SIC 242 and 24 are very close to the rates for SIC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
241, OSHA did not include incidence rates for those SIC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
codes in its determination of incidence rates for logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because BLS does not provide incidence rates for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occupational categories within a SIC code. As such, OSHA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was not able to identify and segregate out the percentage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accidents which occurred while employees were performing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logging as opposed to other operations in those related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industries. OSHA is aware that there has been a move on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part of some mill owners to increasingly use private 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contractors rather than mill employees to harvest the trees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the mills process. OSHA believes, however, that SIC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
241 does capture the vast majority of employees performing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logging operations. To the extent that some logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations may still be performed by employees in other than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIC 241, OSHA does not believe that their accident data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significantly alter the level of risk present in logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations.

While the injury incidence rate remains high in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logging industry, the BLS data show a steady decrease in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incidence rate for the industry since the pulpwood logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard was adopted in 1971.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 The decrease in incidence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rates occurs in both lost-workday and non-lost-workday cases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In contrast, the data also show a steady increase in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average number of lost workdays per case, that indicates that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the severity of injuries has increased over time.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
The decrease in injuries since 1971 is also due in part to adoption of comprehensive logging standards by six states.
For example, the state of California, which has a comprehensive standard, reported 457 logging fatalities in the
1950s, prior to adoption of the standard. In 1981, after the logging standard had been promulgated, California's
logging fatalities hit a record low (6 fatalities) (Ex. 2&hyph;11).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The 1991 logging industry incidence rates still remain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
far above the total incidence rates and lost-workday incidence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rates for other industries, as Table 2 indicates. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
example, the most recent logging industry incidence rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(15.6) is almost double the incidence rate for the private 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sector combined (7.9). It is also 40 percent higher than the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturing sector incidence rate (11.2). The logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injury incidence rates also are well above the incidence rates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the construction industry (12.8) and mining (7.1), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industries generally considered as high hazard.

The most recent lost-workday incidence rate for logging was 9.9, which is almost double the 5.0 incidence rate in the
manufacturing sector and almost three times the 3.7 incidence rate for the private sector combined. The lost-workday
rate, that is an indicator of the severity of cases, is extremely high in the logging industry (274.8 lost workdays
per 100 full-time workers). It is more than three times the private sector lost-workday rate (79.8) and more than double
the manufacturing lost-workday rate (101.1).

2. Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Bureau of Labor Statistics also publishes an annual Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries (CFOI). The CFOI is
a systematic and verifiable count of fatally injured public and private sector workers. This census uses administrative
records, such as death certificates, workers' compensation fatality claims, medical examiners' records, and other
reports to Federal and State agencies, to identify the workplace fatalities and complete descriptive data on the
workers and circumstances of their deaths. According to the 1992 CFOI, the most recent data available, 158 logging
employees were killed while performing logging operations. Table 3 shows that more than 60 percent were using power
tools and performing cutting activities at the time of their death. Almost 20 percent were killed while operating
logging machines or vehicles.

Applying the CFOI fatality estimate to the most recent logging employment estimate of 72,100 developed for the Regulatory
Impact Analysis (see Section VI of this preamble), the fatality incidence rate is .22. The logging industry fatality
incidence rate is 8.1 times higher than the fatality incidence rate the mining sector (.027), the next closest industrial
division. In addition, the logging fatality rate is 53.6 times higher than the fatality rate for the manufacturing
sector (.0041).

3. BLS Work Injury Report (WIR). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The most detailed data source available to the Agency on logging injuries and their causes is a June 1984 BLS Work Injury
Report survey of 1,086 injured logging employees, hereafter referred to as the WIR survey (Ex. 2&hyph;1). It is significant
to note that all 1,086 injuries occurred within just a three-month period.

Not all questions were answered by all survey participants, therefore, total responses vary in each table of data
presented.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Included in the report are employees who were injured while performing logging activities at the logging site or while
moving or transporting logs across terrain. Motor vehicle accidents were included when the accident occurred at
the work site, while hauling logs to the mill, returning from the mill, or transporting tools, equipment, or workers
to or from the logging site in company-owned vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Almost one half (47%) of those responding indicated they were performing non-pulpwood logging operations, therefore
they were not covered by OSHA's existing pulpwood logging standard. Another 17 percent did not know what type of timber
they were logging.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 OSHA believes it is reasonable to assume that some percentage of those employees were not covered by OSHA's existing
logging standard and therefore, more than one half of the injured employees were not covered by the OSHA standard.
Approximately 35 percent of the injured employees were engaged in pulpwood logging operations.

Of those who responded, 62 percent were engaged in clear cutting, 27 percent in selective cutting, and 8 percent in
salvage logging. Approximately 4 percent did not know the type of logging being conducted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The survey also contained the following information: (1) the work site where the injury occurred (Table 4); (2) work
activity being performed at the time of the accident (Table 5); (3) causes of the accidents (Table 6); (4) sources of
the accidents (Tables 7&hyph;10); (5) protective equipment in use at the time of the accident (Table 11); (6) safety
features of vehicles or equipments operated at the time of the accident (Table 12); (7) safety training given prior
to the accident (Table 13); (8) factors contributing to the injury (Table 14); (9) severity of the injury (Table 15&hyph;16).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Table 4 shows that more than one-half of employees injured were at cutting sites in the woods, while only 20 percent
were injured at landings. In addition, more than one-half of those injured were working on sloping terrain at the time
and more than 60 percent reported that the work site contained moderate or heavy brush.

Table 5 shows 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that almost one-half of all injured employees were engaged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in cutting activities (felling, limbing, bucking) at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time of their accidents, and almost one-fourth of all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injured employees were felling trees. Twenty-eight percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the employees were injured during yarding operations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(choker setting or hooking up, tractor or cable skidding, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chasing). The remainder of the accidents occurred when the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logs were being prepared to move from the landing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(loading/unloading and rigging) or were being transported to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the mill or other final destination. Other unspecified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logging activities accounted for eight percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accidents. Finally, servicing and maintaining of equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accounted for four percent of the accidents, a figure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is consistent with the information found for servicing or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintenance accidents throughout general industry. (See 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Docket S&hyph;012A.) Table 3 outlines the activity being

sources of injuries into employees hit by trees; injured in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
slips or falls; while using chain saws; and while operating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment or motor vehicles (Tables 7&hyph;10). As Table 7 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicates, almost one-half of those employees injured by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trees were hit by falling wood.

It should be noted that in a majority of cases where an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employee slipped or fell, the fall was due to an uneven 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surface. Many of these employees lost their balance on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those uneven surfaces, such as standing on felled trees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other employees slipped and fell from slippery or loose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bark, sudden shifting of trees or logs, protruding roots, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deadwood, leaves, vines, other wood litter and rocks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated above, one-fifth of all employees were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injured while operating chain saws, as shown in Table 9. Of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these employees, about two-thirds were hurt when the chain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
saw kicked back.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Also included in the WIR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey was information about the type of protective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment being worn or used at the time of the accident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Table 11 shows that the majority of employees were wearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logging boots, gloves and head protection when they were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injured. However, less than one-third of those injured were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wearing leg protection, even though almost 60 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injuries investigated occurred when employees were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performing activities that required the use of a chain saw 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(brushing, felling trees, limbing, and bucking). In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, only six of the 33 employees injured while 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operating equipment or vehicles were using seat belts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since more than one-half of all injured employees said they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were working on sloping terrain at the time, OSHA believes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it is reasonable to assume that some of the machine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accidents were rollovers or tipovers and that seat belts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could have prevented some of those injuries.

information on whether employees had received safety

training prior to their accidents. Table 13 indicates that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
over one-third of the injured employees had never received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training on safe work practices or in the operation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
machines and vehicles used in logging operations. Only 40 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of employees injured said they had received training

of the injured employees said that a danger tree had 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contributed to the accident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Human factors also contributed to accidents, according 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the injured employees. More than 20 percent said that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fast speed at which they had been working contributed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their accident. OSHA notes that 10 percent of those injured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were unaware of the hazards when they were injured.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The WIR survey also indicates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that when employees were injured in logging operations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their injuries were more severe than injuries occurring in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other industry sectors. Table 15 shows that almost three- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fourths of those injured missed more than 1 day of work due 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to their injuries. Over 30 percent missed more than 10 days 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of work. The average lost-time case resulted in 23 days 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
away from work. In addition, Table 16 shows that more than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one-fifth of those injured were hospitalized an average of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
six nights.

4. OSHA First Reports of Serious Injury (FRSI). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA also utilizes a telephone reporting system for the field staff to inform the national office of the occurrence
of serious or significant accidents. This telephone call system is part of the OSHA emergency communications system.
Regional Administrators are required to file first reports of fatalities, catastrophes and other important events
(such as those that receive significant publicity) to the National Office. The information is recorded on a form entitled
First Report of Serious Accident (FRSI). Approximately 1,200 reports are received by the National Office yearly.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
None of the reports are screened prior to OSHA receiving them to eliminate those from a certain industry, occupation
or because of other factors. None of these reports may be considered statistically significant by themselves in attempting
to determine the number of accidents that have occurred. However, they do give an indication of where many serious
accidents have occurred and the types of work being performed at the time of the accidents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has examined the FRSI reports and identified 105 (Ex. 4&hyph;65) that occurred while employees were performing
logging operations. These accidents occurred between October 1985 and December 1989. Table 17 lists the logging
accident reports as a percentage of all accident reports received.

The percentages attributable to logging injuries are particularly large in relation to the total employment in the
industries represented. Using employment rates for 1985&hyph;1989 for the private sector and for the logging industry,
OSHA observes that the percentage of accidents recorded on the FRSI for logging for each year far exceeded the percentage
of employees in logging compared with the private sector. Whereas, logging employment constituted one tenth of one
percent of total private sector employment, the reports of serious accidents in logging averaged about two percent
of the total accidents. Table 18 lists these employment rates as they appear in the BLS annual reports entitled, Occupational
Injuries and Illnesses in the United States by Industry, (followed by the year of the data). (See section A above.)

OSHA was also able to identify from the FRSI reports the activity that was being conducted at the time of the accident
and the causes of the accidents. For example, more than one-half were involved in cutting activities when they were
seriously injured. OSHA also notes that almost nine percent were seriously injured in machine rollover or tipover
accidents while only 1 employee was injured by a jillpoke. Table 19 lists the activity being conducted or the causes
of the accidents.

5. OSHA Fatality/Catastrophe Investigations Report (FCI).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 OSHA regulations require that all workplace fatalities be reported to the nearest OSHA Area Office. Employers are
required to complete a Fatality/Catastrophe Event Report Form (OSHA 36), which is reviewed by the OSHA Area Director
to determine whether an investigation of the fatality is warranted. In 1989, OSHA published a study of 141 logging
fatalities that occurred during the period of 1978&hyph;84 (Ex. 4&hyph;61). These fatalities do not represent all
logging industry fatalities during that time period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the study, 71 percent of those logging employees killed were out in the cutting area. Only one percent
each were killed on skid trails or at landings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The study also indicated that 43 percent of those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
killed were felling trees at the time. Employees performing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
yarding and bucking and limbing operations each accounted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for 13 percent of the fatalities. The overwhelming majority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of employees (72%) were killed when they were struck or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
crushed by a tree, log or limb, while 17 percent were killed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in machine accidents. One percent were killed in chain-saw 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accidents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unsafe work practices, misjudgments and lack of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training or supervision accounted for 42 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fatalities while less than one percent were due to equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

6. Maine Bureau of Labor Statistics.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The State of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Maine Bureau of Labor Statistics (Maine BLS) has compiled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
various statistics on injuries and fatalities in the logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry (Ex. 4&hyph;174, 4&hyph;175, 4&hyph;176). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Maine BLS conducted a detailed survey of 189 logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employee injuries that occurred between May and July of 1982 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ex. 4&hyph;175). This number does not represent all logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees who were injured during that period. According to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this survey, 35 percent of employees reporting injuries were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
struck by trees, logs or limbs. Chain-saw accidents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accounted for 26 percent of the reported injuries while 13 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of the logging employees were injured in slips or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
falls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to Maine BLS, the category that showed a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significantly higher than average percentage of disabling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injuries was chain-saw accidents. Over one-half of all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chain-saw accidents involved kickback. In over 70 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the kickback accidents, the chain saws were equipped with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chain brakes. Maine BLS said that chain brakes had played a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant role in lessening the effects of the injury. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Less than 13 percent of chain-saw accidents where chain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brakes were present resulted in hospitalization, while 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nearly 50 percent of the accidents involving other than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chain saws resulted in hospitalization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This survey also indicates that two-thirds of all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logging accidents resulted in lost workdays and 13 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of all injuries required at least one overnight in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hospital. The average hospitalization was for five days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Maine BLS has also compiled statistics from 1980&hyph;87 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chain-saw injuries that resulted in a first report of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
serious injury (Ex. 4&hyph;176). According to this report, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average chain-saw injuries for each year was 362. Of those, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an average of 237 (65%) were disabling injuries, that is, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injuries which result in lost workdays. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Maine BLS has also examined disabling logging injuries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reported from 1985&hyph;87 that had resulted in lacerations (Ex. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4&hyph;174). During those three years, there were an average of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
183 disabling lacerations each year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

7. Washington State Logging Fatalities.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A detailed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
study has been compiled on logging fatalities in the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Washington from 1977&hyph;83 (Ex. 4&hyph;129). Of the 135 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fatalities that occurred during those years, the study 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyzed 92 percent of them. Death certificates and reports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of investigations by Washington OSHA were used in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to this study, the overall annual fatality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate for logging during this period was approximately 2 per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1,000 full-time employees. Those employees who were killed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
had a mean length of experience in the logging industry of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11.6 years. Less than 10 percent had less than one year's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experience. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
More than 40 percent of all loggers killed were engaged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in felling activities, while 23 percent were killed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performing yarding operations. Almost 20 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loggers were operating logging machines at the time of their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accident. Table 20 shows the jobs employees were performing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the time of their accident.

More than 65 percent of all employees killed were hit or crushed by a log or tree. While most of these employees who were
hit or crushed by a tree were the result of their own activity, more than eight percent were hit by trees being felled
by another employee. Approximately nine percent were killed in machine rollover accidents, while 10 percent of those
employees killed were struck by a machine or vehicle. Table 21 shows the causes of the accidents in which loggers were
killed.

According to the study, accident investigation reports indicted that many of the deaths would not have occurred if
the employees had been following safe work practices and had remained out of hazardous areas (e.g., other occupied
work areas).

C. Need for agency action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
OSHA believes that current logging methods and the inherent dangers posed by work in the woods, such as those caused
by inclement weather, uneven terrain and isolation from health care facilities, present significant hazards to
employees engaged in logging operations across the nation, regardless of the type logging being conducted or the
end use of the wood. The presentation of data in the preceding section further demonstrate the level of risk to which
all loggers are exposed. Nevertheless, the existing OSHA safety standard for pulpwood logging (29 CFR 1910.266)
specifically addresses only one segment of the logging industry_logging operations whose forest product ends up
as pulp. Although OSHA does not know precisely the breakdown of employment and occupational injuries between pulpwood
and other logging operations, the data and other information available to OSHA indicate that similar hazards exist
in both sectors of the industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The preceding section has shown that the logging industry remains a high risk industry, regardless of the end use of
the forest product. In particular, the data show: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Employees engaged in logging operations have a substantially higher risk of injury and death than workers in many
other industries, including other high hazard industries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. If they are injured, loggers are more likely to be hospitalized and lose workdays compared to employees in most other
industries, as evidenced by the very high lost-workday incidence rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. When loggers are injured, their injuries are much more severe and result in longer hospitalizations and more lost
time per employee than do the injuries of employees in most other industries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Loggers also have a much higher incidence of fatalities than employees in other industries.

In addition, the Regulatory Impact Analysis for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final logging standard estimates, based on the various data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the record, that there are an average of 158 fatalities, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6,798 lost workday injuries and 3,770 non-lost workday 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injuries that occur each year in the logging industry. (For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further discussion see section VI of this preamble.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the 72,100 employees engaged in logging operations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as defined by the final rule, only 38 percent (27,170) are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
covered by State Plan State logging standards,
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently provide protection regardless of kind of logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation in which the loggers are employed. Of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimated 62 percent (44,930) of logging employees who are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not covered by State plan State standards, OSHA estimates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that at only one-third (16,478) are covered by the existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pulpwood logging standard. That means that almost two-thirds (28,452) are not covered by any Federal or State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logging standard. (This estimate is consistent with the WIR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey, which indicated that only 35 percent of those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveyed were engaged in pulpwood logging operations.)

In 1977, the leading states in logging employment (with 48 percent of the total) were Washington (15, 400), Oregon
(14,000), California (6,100) and Maine (4,300). By 1982, the employment pattern had shifted and the leading states
(with 42 percent of the total) were Washington (11,900, down 3,500); Oregon (11,300, down 2,700); Georgia (5,400,
up 1,600); and Alabama (5,000, up 1,200). California (3,900, down 2,200), was no longer one of the leaders. Overall
logging employment in the Pacific Coast states decreased 22% during this period. The South was the only region in the
country to show an increase in logging employment (21%). This employment trend, resulting in the change from harvesting
the Pacific Coast's old-growth timber to increased harvesting of third and forth-growth pine forests in the south,
means that an increasing proportion of logging employment is in states not covered by state logging standards. (As
noted earlier, only Alaska (16th in 1982), California (7th), Hawaii (very small), Michigan (19th), Oregon (2nd)
and Washington (1st) have OSHA approved state logging standards covering all loggers.) This means that as the centers
of activity (and employment) shift from the old growth forests of the pacific coast to the pine forests of the south,
fewer employees conducting general logging (non-pulpwood logging) will be covered by these State plan State logging
standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The preceding section shows there has been a steady 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decrease in injury and lost-workday incidence rates since 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the adoption of OSHA's existing pulpwood logging standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the State plan State standards. In addition to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further reduction in accidents for those employers currently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
covered by OSHA and State logging standards, OSHA believes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a substantial reduction in incidence rates can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieved by promulgating a uniform national logging standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that provides protection for all employees engaged in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logging operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In developing the proposed rule, OSHA used the l978 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ANSI standard as its model for a uniform national logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard, since many of its requirements were stated in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance language. This is in keeping with the Agency's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination that properly drafted performance standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can adequately address safety and health hazards without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unnecessarily impeding technological advancement and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employer innovation. The final rule provides a base level 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of safety for employees in all logging operations. At the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same time, it still allows those State plan States with more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complicated or specialized local conditions to develop their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
own detailed standards, as several States have already done. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many participants in this rulemaking have said that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comprehensive performance-based logging standard is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to reduce the risk of injury and death (Ex. 5&hyph;6, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5&hyph;10, 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;18, 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;22, 5&hyph;42, 5&hyph;46, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tr. W1 21, 73, 202). OSHA agrees with these commenters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency believes that the integrated program of personal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protective equipment; equipment, machine and vehicle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protective devices, inspection and maintenance; work 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practices; and training contained in the final rule is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonably necessary and appropriate to reduce the high 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injury and fatality incidence rates in this industry.

A. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
As a result of issues raised by those commenting on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed logging standard, OSHA solicited information on 10 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
major issues in the notice of public hearing (55 FR 19745, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
May 11, 1990). OSHA requested detailed information on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variety of issues including training, personal protective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment, first aid, chain-saw protective devices, and seat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
belts. These issues were discussed by the participants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the public hearings and in post-hearing comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The evidence submitted to the record is summarized and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluated in the following discussion of each issue and in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the summary and explanation of the final rule.

1. Training. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments on the proposed rule generally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supported the need for training. Several commenters, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
however, raised specific questions about particular training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issues. As a result, OSHA requested in the hearing notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further comment on the following training issues: Effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date of training, sufficiency of training, and portability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a. Effective date for training. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the proposed rule, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA would have required employers to be in compliance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all provisions of the final logging standard within 60 days 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of publication of the rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule did not provide extended compliance time for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employers to familiarize themselves with the standard and to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
develop and conduct training. Some commenters said 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional time to meet the training requirements of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule was unnecessary (Ex. 9&hyph;3, 9&hyph;13; Tr. OR 343). These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters said that in many logging establishments training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is already being provided and that employers would not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require significant time to incorporate the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training requirements into their ongoing programs. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other commenters argued that the effective date for training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be delayed because additional time was necessary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
develop the required training program and to train employees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ex. 5&hyph;2, 5&hyph;27, 9&hyph;1, 9&hyph;2; Tr. W2 243&hyph;44). Commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed various effective dates for training. For example, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Northeastern Loggers Association, Inc., recommended a 2-year phase-in of the training requirements (Ex. 5&hyph;2).
The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
American Pulpwood Association, Inc. (APA), however, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supported a shorter six-month phase-in period:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Safety training programs for loggers are largely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific to a function (for example, proper felling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technique). A fully comprehensive training package 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will have to be developed to meet the training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements. APA is attempting to develop training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs and have them available by the end of 1989.&blank;*&blank;*&blank;* APA will seek OSHA staff review of its
training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program as it is developed. We'd like a brief delay in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforcement, just long enough for us to have something 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available for employers (Ex. 5&hyph;27). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the hearing there was little testimony about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delaying the effective date for training. Mr. Doug 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Domenech, testifying on behalf of APA, repeated APA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
position that employers should be given some additional time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to comply with training requirements: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The training is a very needed thing and, unfortunately, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we just don't have the infrastructure to provide that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training. That's why *&blank;*&blank;* we *&blank;*&blank;* hope that OSHA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will give some kind of variance on time before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
citations are delivered because it's just not out 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there. If loggers had to comply with a training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement today, they'd all be cited (Tr. W2 243&hyph;44).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the same time, however, Mr. Alex Hansen, of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Associated Oregon Loggers, Inc. (AOL), testified that Oregon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loggers already were in compliance with the training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions contained in the proposed rule: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
As far as we're concerned in Oregon, you could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implement the training tomorrow. We already have it in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
place. We don't have a problem with it. We're 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advocates of safety training in the woods. I know some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other states have some problems. They haven't been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
doing it or maybe not as strenuous as the Oregon rules, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and I understand their problems, but as far as our association is concerned, if you pass it tomorrow, we're in compliance
(Tr. OR 343).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The record indicates that training materials and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
courses for logging safety are widely available and that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
many logging establishments have implemented training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs (Ex. 4&hyph;122, 4&hyph;123, 4&hyph;181, 5&hyph;20, 5&hyph;33, 9&hyph;1, 9&hyph;2, 9&hyph;5, 9&hyph;6,
36; Tr. W1 163&hyph;64, W2 113, 115, 125, 199&hyph;201, OR 87, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
259&hyph;60, 393, 546&hyph;47, 566). Trade associations such as AOL, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
APA and the Montana Logging Association have been providing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training materials on an on-going basis (Ex. 5&hyph;27). APA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected to have completed a comprehensive training package 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for its members companies by 1989. In addition, state 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agricultural extension services are a source of training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information (Ex. 4&hyph;122, 4&hyph;123). Several hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participants submitted descriptions of their training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs and the actual training materials (Ex. 21, 22, 23, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
24, 26, 28, 29). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA is aware that many of the existing training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs are based on the training requirements of OSHA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pulpwood logging standard. Because the training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements have been revised in this final rule, current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training programs will have to be reviewed and upgraded, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when necessary, to meet the revised requirements. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, the training provisions of the final rule vary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some degree from the proposed rule. As such, employers who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made changes in their programs in response to the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule will have to review their training materials to assure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA is aware that employers, trade associations and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other organizations that provide training will need time to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepare and/or update training programs to meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of the final rule and will need time to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training to employees. However, the record also shows that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
many companies and organizations already have developed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training programs that meet most of the requirements of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rule (Ex. 5&hyph;20, 5&hyph;27, 5&hyph;52, 5&hyph;69, 9&hyph;2; Tr. OR 343). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many establishments, especially those in States that have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logging standards, already are providing training (Ex. 21, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
22, 23, 24, 26, 28, 29). Therefore, OSHA does not believe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a lengthy delay is necessary to meet the training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of the final rule. The Agency believes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extending the effective date of the standard for 120 days 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after publication of the final rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be sufficient to allow employers and others to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
familiarize themselves with the final rule, to update 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training programs to meet the provisions of the final rule, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and to conduct initial training. This phase-in period also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will give employers time to determine whether current and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new employees have received the training in all of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elements specified in this section or whether they will need 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b. Sufficiency of training. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second issue raised in the hearing notice concerned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
what training OSHA would consider sufficient to meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training requirements in the final rule. Some commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supported OSHA's preference for performance based training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ex. 9&hyph;3, 9&hyph;15). Other commenters argued for detailed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifications to be included in the training requirements, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including a minimum number of hours of training (Ex. 9&hyph;13, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9&hyph;19). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, the final rule contains training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements in performance language to allow employer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flexibility in tailoring training programs to the individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances under which they operate. The final rule sets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forth the basic elements that must be covered in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employer's training program, such as safe performance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assigned work tasks; safe use of tools; recognition and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control of workplace hazards; prevention and control of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general logging hazards; and the requirements of the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard. The training provisions also require that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees initially work under supervision and that they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrate the ability to perform their work tasks safely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before being released from supervision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed elsewhere in this preamble, each logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishment has unique conditions or hazards associated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with its logging operations, that result in unique methods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of operation. OSHA believes that the general elements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the training provisions allow employers to take into account 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those differences while still requiring the employer to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assure through training that each employee is able to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
perform the job safely.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On the basis of information submitted to the record and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the testimony presented during the hearings, OSHA has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined that employers will not have difficulty in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complying with the training requirements of the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that the performance-based elements adopted in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the final rule will enhance employee safety and will provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees with the tools to permit them to actively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participate in providing their own protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Industrial Truck Association (ITA) recommended that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA specify in greater detail the training required for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industrial truck operators (Ex. W1 5&hyph;47, Tr. 221&hyph;27). ITA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
urged OSHA to adopt the training provisions from the ASME 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B56.6 standard on rough-terrain forklift trucks. Mr. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
William Montweiler, testifying for ITA, stated:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Part Two of the B56.6 standard addresses general safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and operating practices that are highly relevant to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule's training provisions. Although ITA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pleased that the proposed rule's training provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide greater detail than OSHA's industrial truck 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule, these provisions can be made still more effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by additional particularity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule merely requires that employees be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trained to recognize safety hazards and trained ``in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safe use or maintenance of any machinery, equipment, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tools that they may be required to operate or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintain.'' This directive, we feel, is inadequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because it fails to state the elements that comprise an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective training program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By contrast, paragraph 5.17.4 of the B56.6 voluntary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard lists numerous elements of a proper training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program specific to rough-terrain forklift truck 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation, including explanation of the safety-related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aspects of truck and component design; location and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
function of controls; supervised practice; oral, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
written, and operational performance testing; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refresher courses. ITA requests, therefore, that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final logging operations rule incorporate the training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions contained in the B56.6 standard.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA believes that the performance-based and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
competency-based training provisions contained in the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard adequately address ITA's concerns, and that more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific requirements in this standard for forklift truck 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator training are not warranted for several reasons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, the record indicates there is not a significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of rough-terrain industrial trucks used in logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations. Mr. Richard Lewis, testifying on behalf of APA, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confirmed the limited use of rough-terrain industrial trucks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the logging industry:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The American Pulpwood Association currently employs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seven technically trained foresters, two in Washington 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and five in division offices throughout the U.S. And 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collectively we've worked in the field for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately 103 man years, and we get out on logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations every month and sometimes once a week, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we have never, never observed the use of a rough 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terrain fork lift in a logging operation (Tr. OR 478&hyph;79 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OR).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Second, the ASME standard to which ITA refers, B56.6, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not focus on any unique problems with the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industrial trucks in logging operations. Conversely, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logging standard is intended primarily to deal with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
workplace hazards that are unique to logging operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, in any event, the final standard achieves the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same training outcome as the B56.6 standard: demonstrated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ability to safely operate a rough-terrain industrial truck.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA is in agreement with ITA that safety in industrial truck operation is important in the logging industry as well
as all other industries. OSHA believes that the issue of training of industrial truck operators is more appropriately
addressed in more detail in OSHA's forthcoming proposed standard on industrial truck operator training. OSHA believes
the major safety issues involving industrial truck operation can be fully and specifically examined and addressed
in that rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
c. Portability of training. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The third issue raised regarding training involves the portability of training; that is, whether current and new
employees who are experienced and previously trained must receive additional or supplemental training. The proposed
rule would have required that each new employee be trained, regardless of whether he/she had been trained previously.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters supported the proposed requirement (Ex. 9&hyph;2, 9&hyph;3, 9&hyph;9, 9&hyph;13). Several commenters
disagreed with the scope of employees that need training, stating that trained and experienced loggers should not
require the same training as an inexperienced new employee (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;33, 5&hyph;39, 9&hyph;2; Tr.
W1 63, OR 85). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that training is important for all loggers regardless of whether they have no logging experience or
have many years of experience. The need to provide training for even experienced loggers is buttressed by the WIR survey
of injured loggers, which indicated that over one third of those injured had never received training (Ex. 2&hyph;1).
In addition, more than 60 percent of those injured had worked 5 years or more in the logging industry. In fact, only 22
percent of those injured had worked in the logging industry for one year or less. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the same time, OSHA does not want to penalize those employers who already have instituted training programs that
meet the requirements of the final rule or can easily be brought into compliance with the final rule. In addition, OSHA
does not want to impose an unnecessary burden on an employer who hires loggers who have received the training required
by this section on a prior job. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to eliminate unnecessary duplication of training in the final rule, OSHA is not requiring employers to retrain
employees who have received training in the specific requirements of this section. The final rule only requires the
employer to train employees in those elements in which the current or new employee has not been trained. For example,
an employee may need to be trained to recognize hazards that are specific to the terrain in which the work is being done,
and to utilize safe work practices to avoid or control these hazards. In addition, a new employee, even if experienced
in logging operations, may not be familiar with various work site procedures of the new employer, such as signals to
be used. It is important for new employees to be brought up to speed with the current logging practices so other members
of the logging crew are not placed at risk by the actions or inactions of the new employee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has included in the final rule a provision that each new employee and each employee who must be trained work under
the supervision of a designated person until they can demonstrate the ability to perform their new duties safely.
OSHA's position on the supervision requirement was supported by various hearing participants. For example, various
witnesses at the hearing noted that close supervision of new employees, regardless of their experience, is a widely
accepted practice in the logging industry and a means of determining whether the employee's previous training was
adequate (Tr. W1 91&hyph;92, OR 95&hyph;97, 204&hyph;05, 275&hyph;76, 374, 456&hyph;57, 635&hyph;36). As such,
OSHA believes that the inclusion of the supervision requirement in the final rule will provide the necessary safety
to both the new and current employee, and will not impose a significant burden on the employer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2. Personal protective equipment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the hearing notice OSHA raised the issue about who should pay for personal protective equipment (PPE) that employees
are required to use or wear. The Agency proposed that employers 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
provide
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 PPE and assure it is used by employees when required. OSHA's intent in the proposed rule was that the employer provide
personal equipment at no cost to the employee. PPE items included in the proposed rule were gloves, leg protection,
logging boots, safety helmets (hard hats), eye or face protection, and respiratory protection.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters agreed that the personal protective equipment specified in the proposed rule should be used. (Ex.
5&hyph;32, 5&hyph;42, 5&hyph;64, 9&hyph;2, 9&hyph;15, 9&hyph;16, 9&hyph;20). Some commenters urged OSHA to require
that the employer be responsible for providing all PPE (Ex. 9&hyph;3, 9&hyph;13). They said that only if the employer
provided the PPE could he assure its quality, design and maintenance. However, many other commenters opposed requiring
logging employers to provide certain types of PPE, and their opposition focused primarily on logging boots (Ex. 5&hyph;11,
5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;32, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;45, 5&hyph;51, 5&hyph;55, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92, 9&hyph;2, 9&hyph;5,
9&hyph;15, 9&hyph;17, 9&hyph;18; Tr. W1 74&hyph;75, 110, 177, OR 22, 79, 205, 262, 441, 533, 632, 701). Many commenters
did not give any reason why the employer should not be required to pay for PPE. Other commenters contended primarily
that employers would be financially burdened if they had to pay for certain high cost PPE, such as individually-fitted
and non-reusable logging boots, in an industry that has such a high turnover rate. Other reasons for not requiring
the employer to provide certain types of PPE were the use of certain PPE by employees outside the workplace, and industry
custom. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters noted that employee turnover in the logging industry is very high (Ex. 5&hyph;11, 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;39,
5&hyph;49, 5&hyph;51, 5&hyph;55, 5&hyph;56, 5&hyph;63, 5&hyph;65, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92; Tr. W1 74&hyph;75,
110, 177, OR 22, 79, 205, 262, 441, 533, 632, 701). Some commenters also indicated that employees sometimes work only
one or two weeks before leaving, often taking jobs at another logging establishment (Ex. 5&hyph;55, 5&hyph;74 through
5&hyph;92; Tr. OR 78). These commenters argued that it would be unfair to require employers to pay for expensive logging
boots given the high turnover rate of the logging industry. One commenter said: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
[I]t frightens us to think that we might be providing a $300 pair of boots for a man that's there a week (Tr. W1 74). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These commenters also contend that for some PPE, particularly logging boots, employers might have to buy new PPE every
time they hire a new employee. First, this would be necessary because terminated employees do not return PPE they are
issued (Ex. 5&hyph;45). Second, these commenters argue that, unlike PPE such as ear muffs and head and leg protection,
logging boots are an item of PPE that cannot be reused by other employees because of size and hygienic concerns (Ex.
5&hyph;29, 5&hyph;43, 5&hyph;44, 5&hyph;62, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92, 9&hyph;1, 9&hyph;15, 9&hyph;21; Tr.
OR 78). Because logging boots cannot be worn by other employees, these commenters said employers view logging boots
as ``personal clothing.'' In addition, these commenters said that even if employees did return their logging boots,
new employees would be unwilling to wear used logging boots. One commenter said: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Suppose a new employee comes to work in the spring and finds he can't or doesn't want to be a logger so he hands in his $200
boots with two weeks wear and tear and leaves. Is the next guy going to accept ``used'' boots someone else wore? (Ex.
5&hyph;78) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The commenters said that requiring employers to pay for new PPE, primarily logging boots, for each new employee would
place a considerable financial burden on employers (Ex. 5&hyph;32, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;45, 9&hyph;15; Tr. W1 74,
OR 78, 350). They said the cost would be particularly burdensome for small establishments that comprise the vast majority
of the logging industry. Their basis for this conclusion is that logging boots are very costly, ranging from $60 to
$400 a pair (Ex. 5&hyph;45, 9&hyph;15; Tr. W1 74, OR 78, 350). In addition, they said employees need two to three pairs
of logging boots a year. The commenters, however, did not present any financial or economic evidence as to the burden
(e.g., effect on profits, sales, etc.) on the industry as a whole, and particularly small employers as a group, of providing
logging boots. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter said employers should not be required to pay for logging boots that are used by employees away from workplace
(Ex. 5&hyph;39). This commenter said employees take their logging boots with them when they seek new employment (Ex.
5&hyph;39). He also said employees use their logging boots for hunting and cutting their own wood (Ex. 5&hyph;39).
In contrast, the record shows that other types of PPE (e.g., leg protection, safety glasses and hearing protection)
remain with the employer, therefore, they are not used away from the workplace (e.g., Ex. 5&hyph;32). In addition,
one commenter said that these types of PPE are already being provided by many establishments as standard industry
practice (Ex. 5&hyph;32).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, several commenters said that employers should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not be required to pay for certain PPE because the custom in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the logging industry is that employees, especially piece-rate workers, provide their own PPE, particularly logging

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
boots (Ex. 5&hyph;11, 5&hyph;24, 5&hyph;45, 5&hyph;67, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These commenters said that piece-rate workers provide all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``tools of the trade,'' that includes some types of PPE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the record also shows that some logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishments do provide logging boots (Ex. 5&hyph;32; Tr. W1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
177). For example, one commenter said:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
[T]he way we set it up is that when you're with us 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for one year we will buy you three pair of boots 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and we will supply all safety equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After you are with us for one month, we will supply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety chaps, the helmet, the whole works. The first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
day you come on the job we will supply the helmet, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
helmet with the eye protection and the ear protection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Tr. W1 177). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter said: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In most instances items such as ear plugs, safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
glasses, bucking chaps or any other safety item 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to work in a safe environment are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided (Ex. 5&hyph;32).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA has carefully reviewed the evidence in the record 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and, for several reasons, has decided in the final rule to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delete the general requirement that the employer be required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to provide logging boots. However, the final rule does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require that such boots be worn by logging employees, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
holds the employer responsible for assuring that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employee has logging boots and wears them. As to the other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PPE requirements specified in paragraph (d), OSHA has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retained the language of the pulpwood logging and proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards that the employer provide such PPE at no cost to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the employee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OSH Act imposes on employers the responsibility for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with standards and for providing safe working 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions for employees. This responsibility has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognized in OSHA's personal protective equipment standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at 29 CFR 1910.132 through 29 CFR 1910.138. Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1910.132(a) establishes the employer's obligation to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and maintain personal protective equipment whenever such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment is necessary by reason of the hazards in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
workplace. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1910.132(b) does recognize that in some limited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances that employees may provide their own PPE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, OSHA emphasizes that this practice is not the norm, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but rather an exception based on unusual or specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances. In addition, section 1910.132(b) underscores 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the employer's continuing obligation to assure the adequacy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and maintenance of the PPE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The record shows that special circumstances exist in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the logging industry which may make it appropriate for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees to provide their own logging boots. First, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
record shows that the logging industry is highly transient, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and that logging boots, unlike other PPE required by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rule, are not the kind of PPE that can be reused. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Logging boots purchased to fit one employee may not fit the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
next employee. It is important that logging boots fit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properly or the boot may not provide the necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection. Therefore, based on current turnover rates in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the industry, employers would have to purchase non-reusable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logging boots costing $200 to $400 many times a year for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
newly-hired employees, even though there is a significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
likelihood that these employees will remain in the job for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only a short time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the record shows that logging employees tend to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
move from one logging establishment to another, taking their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``tools of the trade'' with them, particularly their logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
boots. OSHA believes it may be appropriate in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
situation to allow employees to take their logging boots to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the next place of employment, rather than requiring the new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employer to provide logging boots. Logging boots are both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portable (i.e., not limited in use to or maintained at a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular workplace, like respirators for instance) and in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most cases they fit only that particular employee therefore 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they cannot be reused by other employees. The other items 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of PPE required by the final rule, such as leg and head

readily used by other employees.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Third, there is evidence in the record that employees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
do use their logging boots away from work. Employees come 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to and leave work wearing their logging boots, suggesting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the boots are used away from the workplace. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, commenters cited specific activities where logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
boots are used away from the logging work site. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters did not provide any comparable evidence that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other items of PPE required by the final rule are also used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by employees away from the workplace. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, OSHA has decided in the final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not to require the employer to provide logging boots. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency emphasizes that it is the totality of the special 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances in the logging industry that justify this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination. Of the reasons discussed above, none of them 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standing alone would provide sufficient justification for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
departing from the general requirement that employers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide PPE. Rather, it is the combination of these reasons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and special circumstances in the logging industry that make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it appropriate to allow employees to provide their own 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logging boots. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA also emphasizes that regardless of who provides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the logging boots, the final rule makes the employer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsible for assuring that logging boots are used by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employee and are maintained in a serviceable condition. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, in the final rule the employer is responsible for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assuring that logging boots are inspected before initial use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during a workshift. Attendant to this requirement, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employer is also responsible for assuring that damaged and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defective equipment is either repaired or replaced before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
work is commenced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the other items of PPE required by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rule, OSHA does not believe there is sufficient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence in the record to justify a departure from OSHA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
long-established policy. Neither industry practice nor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
turnover rates compel the Agency to relieve employers of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obligation to pay for the other items of PPE for loggers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Indeed, evidence in the record shows that many employers are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently providing these other items of PPE (Ex. 5&hyph;32, 9&hyph;15; Tr. W1 177). The record shows that, unlike
logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
boots, these items of PPE tend to remain at the workplace 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and are amenable for use by other employees. Further, there 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is no evidence in the record of an established practice of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees using such PPE away from the workplace. Also, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there is no evidence of established and uniform industry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practice of transporting such PPE from job to job. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in the final rule, OSHA is requiring, except for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logging boots, that the employer provide PPE at no cost to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the employee.

3. Leg protection.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the hearing notice OSHA raised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
three issues concerning leg protection for chain-saw 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operators: specifications for leg protection, the area to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be protected, and potential disadvantages of leg protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a. Specifications.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed rule would have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required that chain-saw operators wear leg protection made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of ballistic nylon or other material that provides at least 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalent protection. Many commenters supported the leg 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection requirement for chain-saw operators (Ex. 5&hyph;5, 5&hyph;7, 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;30, 5&hyph;33, 5&hyph;42,
5&hyph;45, 5&hyph;51, 5&hyph;60, 5&hyph;68, 5&hyph;73, 9&hyph;9&hyph;11; Tr. W2 126&hyph;28). Several commenters
and hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participants also supported OSHA's position that leg 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection meet certain criteria (Ex. 5&hyph;30, 5&hyph;60, 5&hyph;68, 5&hyph;73; Tr. W2 126&hyph;28). Two commenters
suggested that OSHA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require leg protection made with KEVLAR because they believe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
KEVLAR provides more protection than ballistic nylon (Ex. 5&hyph;5, 5&hyph;30). One of these commenters said KEVLAR
leg 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection provides 50 percent more protection than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ballistic nylon with a fraction of the weight and bulk, thus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowing easier movement and reducing fatigue (Ex. 5&hyph;30). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This commenter also said that the U.S. Forest Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifications call for KEVLAR leg protection. Other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters stated that a testing protocol for leg protection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be adopted rather than specifying that leg protection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be comprised of any certain type of material (Ex. 5&hyph;60, 5&hyph;68, 5&hyph;72). One commenter said OSHA should
adopt the ISO or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Canadian testing standards for leg protection (Ex. 9&hyph;16). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, other commenters said there was no consensus in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this country regarding an appropriate testing standard (Ex. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5&hyph;60, 5&hyph;68, 5&hyph;72). One commenter proposed that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following testing standard be adopted:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
[T]he protective garment must have a minimum ``Threshold 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chain Speed'' of 2500 feet per minute for operators 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using chain saws with an engine displacement of under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
65 cc and 3000 feet per minute for operators using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chain saws with an engine displacement of over 65 cc. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further the test procedure developed and currently used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the US Forest Service [should] be adopted and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defined as the test method used to measure the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Threshold Chain Speed'' of safety material (Ex. 5&hyph;68).

Another commenter proposed that a different testing

standard be adopted in OSHA's final rule: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Other participants opposed specific criteria for leg 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection performance for several reasons (Tr. W2 206&hyph;07, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OR 472&hyph;75, 496&hyph;98, 513&hyph;14). First, some argued that there 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were no national consensus or State standard to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidance on specification standards. Second, others 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commented that a specification standard limited to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``ballistic nylon'' was too restrictive (Ex. 5&hyph;30; Tr. W2 189&hyph;90). Third, others stated that there are
no standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishing specific performance criteria of the material 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for leg protection. For example, APA testified:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
APA does not know of any state leg protection apparel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard in existence or under development. I can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report to you that our association has a special 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
committee working on the development of a safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apparel standard, and this committee has generally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accepted the Quebec Research Institute testing method, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and now it's kind of rewriting this testing method to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meet the American Society of Testing Materials 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidelines. So the committee is close to completing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its work on endorsing an approved test procedure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The next step in the committee's charge is to develop a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
voluntary performance testing standard that would apply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for leg protection, safety boots and other apparel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
That's going to be a little way down the road. It's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
own opinion that the work of this committee is not yet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mature and that OSHA should probably not attempt to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include any specific performance testing standard for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
leg protection or other safety items at this time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
They're recommending that you defer the inclusion of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific leg protection performance testing standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
until the next revision of the OSHA logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations, whenever that might be. It may be ten 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years from now or fifteen years from now. At this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
point in time, we feel it's much more important to get 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any safety equipment worn, rather than to worry about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether or not it meets specific performance standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Tr. OR 472&hyph;75).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
APA also testified that regional differences in chain-saw operations also precludes a specification standard for

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
leg protection: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
I would also say in general our feeling is that logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is so different obviously in every part of the country 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that often we've got to have lead-way for the types of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
leg protection that might be appropriate for a person 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
working in the swamps of Louisiana as opposed to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mountains of Montana. Not that we know what those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
differences might be, but that in general we feel like 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the loggers in those areas should be able to have the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity to design or approve a leg protection that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be appropriate for their situation (Tr. OR 207&hyph;08).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The record shows that leg protection for chain-saw 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operators is essential to prevent injuries. According to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the WIR survey, 64 percent of injuries to chain-saw 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operators were due to kickback, an accident that usually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results in injury to the leg (Ex. 2&hyph;1). The WIR survey also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicates that 22 percent of all injuries reported were to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the leg. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that leg protection made of ballistic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nylon or equivalent material is effective in preventing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injuries to the leg. A study by the French Farmers' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mutuality indicates that ballistic leg protection was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective in preventing 12 leg injuries in 91 loggers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies over an eight-month period (Ex. 37). Testimony and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments show, however, that there is no accepted testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurements standard in this country on leg protection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance. In addition, the foreign standards that do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exist have not been generally accepted or used in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
country. Nonetheless, OSHA believes that a performance-based requirement for leg protection to provide protection

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
against contact with a moving saw chain will provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flexibility for employers while encouraging technological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
innovation, such as the work by APA.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For these reasons, in the final rule OSHA has adopted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed provision requiring that leg protection be worn 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on each leg by all chain-saw operators. However, OSHA has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revised the final rule to require that where the employer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides leg protection made of material other than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ballistic nylon, the employer is responsible for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrating that it provides protection which is at least 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalent to ballistic nylon, such as KEVLAR. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement ensures that employees are protected against 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
moving saw chains, while at the same time providing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flexibility for the employer.

b. Area to be protected and disadvantages of leg 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The other issues raised regarding leg 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection concerned the parts of the chain-saw operator's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
body that should be covered and its effect on mobility and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other potential safety disadvantages of wearing leg 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule specified that leg protection extend 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the upper thigh to the boot or shoe top. Many 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters supported the proposed rule (Ex. 9&hyph;2, 9&hyph;3, 9&hyph;4, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9&hyph;5, 9&hyph;11, 9&hyph;13, 9&hyph;15, 9&hyph;16, 9&hyph;20). One commenter said that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed rule followed the requirements of the European 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
draft standard (Ex. 9&hyph;11B). Some commenters said the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule was not protective enough and said the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment for protecting chain-saw operators should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expanded (Ex. 5&hyph;14, 5&hyph;68). One of these commenters said: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
[W]e would recommend that a standard be developed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defining the minimum coverage these garments should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have, for example from crotch to ankle bone with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum width measured at the knee of 9.5 (Ex. 5&hyph;68). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The other commenter recommended leg protection be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extended to also provide foot protection that is cut 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resistance to a chain saw (Ex. 5&hyph;14). This commenter said 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the additional foot covering protection would also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assure that the entire leg and ankle were covered if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chaps were not long enough to cover the boot top. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters, however, said leg protection should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be limited in the final rule (Ex. 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;45, 5&hyph;56, 5&hyph;65, 9&hyph;1; Tr. OR 227, 633&hyph;34).
Most of these commenters said that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA should not require leg protection to extend from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upper thigh to the boot or shoe top. First, these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters said that extending leg protection from the thigh 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the boot or shoe top was not necessary because most of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the injuries occur to the area around the knee. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
example, one commenter stated: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A person using a chain saw would have to do some pretty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spectacular gymnastics to receive a chain saw cut more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 4
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; below the knee. Once again, we have no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recordable injuries for the last 7 years involving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chain saw cuts more than 4
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; below the knee (Ex. 5&hyph;45).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another commenter stated that leg protection was not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary for climbers and bucket truck operators: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The major hazards for these individuals are cuts to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upper body from saw kick-backs and falling material. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Leg protection should not be required, however the use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of some of the new lighter and more pliable pads sewn 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into pants should be encouraged whenever feasible (Ex. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5&hyph;19).

Second, commenters stated that the small risk of injury 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the lower leg was outweighed by the risks due to lack of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mobility caused by full-length leg protection. For example, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one said:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
We have received numerous comments from our membership 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
throughout the country who use leg protection (or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chaps) suggesting that chaps only extend to just below 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the knee. Chaps that extend to the boot top, or shoe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
top, as required in proposed Section (e)(1)(ii), impede 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mobility and cause a greater safety hazard than the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard works to protect against. Our members believe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the highest risk for chain saw cuts occurs from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the knee to the thigh. Thus, chaps that cover the leg 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the upper thigh to just below the knee are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient (Ex. 5&hyph;56). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Third, one commenter testified that leg protection to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the boot or shoe top would pose an unreasonable financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burden on employers (Tr. OR 633&hyph;34). According to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participant, different loggers use the employer-provided leg 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection each day. Because all loggers are not the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
height, the leg protection provided may not reach to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
boot or shoe top or may be too long for other loggers to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wear safely. This participant suggested that the only way 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an employer could guarantee compliance with the required fit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the leg protection would be to provide fitted leg 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection to each individual logger. The participant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended the following: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
We suggest [leg protection extend] to below the knee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because these come in various lengths. And certainly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in those times you can't always stretch a pair of chaps 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that somebody maybe having to put on to operate a chain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
saw all of a sudden to get it down to the boot top (Tr. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OR 633&hyph;34).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Fourth, some commenters stated that leg protection that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extends to the boot or shoe top might cause mobility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
problems, and would therefore be hazardous for chain-saw 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operators (Ex. 5&hyph;19, 5&hyph;20, 5&hyph;55). For example, one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter stated: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Rigging crews will occasionally use a power saw. If 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they are required to wear leggings, it could be more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dangerous than not having anything. This is one of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasons rigging crews prefer suspenders rather than a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
belt because you don't get ``hung up'' so often. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Anything that is going to hinder mobility is a problem 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ex. 5&hyph;20). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another commenter recommended that OSHA limit leg 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection to just one leg for cutters (i.e., the leg in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
front that is used to maintain balance during cutting) (Ex. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5&hyph;65). However, this commenter also admitted that any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chain-saw operator who is clearing brush needs to wear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection on both legs because the saw is continuously and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
perilously close to either leg at all times. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters said leg protection should be limited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because heat and humidity could increase worker fatigue or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cause problems that might exceed the benefits of leg 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection (Ex. 5&hyph;25, 5&hyph;26, 5&hyph;59, Tr. W2 206&hyph;07). For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
example, one commenter stated: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA proposes that employees are assigned duties that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require an operator of a chain saw to wear ballistic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nylon or equivalent protection that must cover each leg 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the upper thigh to the boot top. This does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
take into consideration the various temperature factors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which could increase fatigue. Fatigue is a major cause 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of injuries. As stated, on Page 11802 [of the preamble 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the proposed standard], Alabama and Georgia are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
states that are among the leaders in logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities. Due to the high heat and humidity of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
states, the requirement to wear ballistic nylon chaps 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could possibly increase injuries as a result of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fatigue caused by hot, humid summer weather (Tr. W2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
206&hyph;07).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Clause (e)(1)(ii) should allow exceptions to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wearing of leg protectors for all circumstances (not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
just climbers) in which there is a greater hazard than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
working without them (for instance, fatigue from heat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and humidity or loss of mobility in heavy undergrowth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
etc.). It would be even more appropriate if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wearing of ``leg protectors'' were made optional, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
depending on the individual work circumstances. One 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
study, (The Role of Personal Protection in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prevention of Accidental Injuries in Logging Work, T. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Klen and S. Vayrynen, Journal of Occupational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accidents, 1984) concluded that personal protectors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have not been very effective and that this was a result 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a phenomena known as ``risk compensation'', the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tendency of workers to be more careless when they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believe that personal protectors will prevent injury 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ex. 5&hyph;59). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA has carefully reviewed the record on this issue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and, for several reasons, has decided in the final rule to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retain the requirement that leg protection cover the upper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thigh to the boot top. The record clearly shows that chain-saw operators face a significant risk of injury due to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
kickback. The WIR survey indicates that 64 percent of all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chain-saw injuries reported were the result of kickback (Ex. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2&hyph;1). Further, the WIR survey shows that almost 30 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of all injured employees were not wearing leg protection at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the time. Also, almost one-fourth of all injuries reported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were to the leg. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the Maine BLS survey, chain-saw accidents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accounted for 26 percent of all reported injuries and more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than half of those accidents involved chain-saw kickback. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA does not believe the record supports the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters' claims that chain-saw injuries only occur to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area around the knee. Injuries to the lower leg as well as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the knee are significant. The WIR survey indicated that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nine percent of all employees reporting injuries were hurt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the lower leg or ankle, while 11 percent were injured in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the knee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The available accident and injury data also do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
support the commenters' argument that lack of mobility is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greater hazard to chain-saw operators than lack of leg 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection. To the contrary, the data clearly show that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk of chain-saw kickback is far more serious than any of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the potential dangers that have been suggested with regard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to leg protection (Ex. 2&hyph;1). For example, according to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
WIR survey, none of the chain-saw operators said they had 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been injured because they did not have enough time to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retreat from the falling tree. On the other hand, almost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two-thirds of the chain-saw operators were injured because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the chain saw kicked back. In any event, OSHA believes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other provisions in the proposed and final rule will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequately address concerns about mobility. For example, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the requirement to plan and clear retreat paths before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commencing cutting will protect employees who would be at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk from decreased mobility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, OSHA believes the new innovations in leg 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection technology address the commenters' concerns about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs, mobility, fatigue and heat stress. First, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
record shows that full-leg protection now being manufactured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is light-weight and relatively cool (Ex. 5&hyph;68, 9&hyph;4). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
record also shows that light-weight leg protection that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inserted or sewn into logging pants is now available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to one commenter, these new innovations make leg 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection tolerable even in the hot and humid southern 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logging regions. OSHA believes these innovations will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduce fatigue and heat stress and will prevent mobility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from being impeded. Second, the record shows that foot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coverings are available that can supplement protection in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those instances where leg protection may not fully cover the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logger's lower leg. These devices will provide adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection in those isolated instances where leg protection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may not be long enough without requiring the employer to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purchase leg protection in many different sizes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

4. First aid.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The hearing notice raised two issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about first aid: the number of employees who must have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first-aid training, and the elements required as part of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that training, such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).

 The proposed standard

specified that all supervisors and all fellers be adequately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trained in first aid methods as prescribed by the American 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Red Cross, the Mine Safety and Health Administration or an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalent training program. In addition, the proposed rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included a provision that at least one person in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA received many comments regarding the number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees who should be trained in first aid in order to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide adequate protection. There was no consensus among 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those commenters on the appropriate number of employees who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be trained. Their recommendations about the number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees who should be required to receive first-aid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training covered a wide range of options, including the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. All employees (Ex. 5&hyph;7, 5&hyph;17, 9&hyph;15, 9&hyph;20; Tr. W1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
175, W2 209, OR 100, 375, 393, 681); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. All supervisors and fellers (Ex. 9&hyph;3, 9&hyph;13); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. All supervisors and enough additional personnel so 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each work site would have a trained employee (Tr. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OR 21); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. All supervisors and fellers, plus two additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees on a logging job (Ex. 5&hyph;54; Tr. OR 647); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. All supervisors, fellers, and one-fifth of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remaining crew members (Ex. 9&hyph;19, Tr. OR 282); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. All supervisors, fellers and one-fourth of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remaining crew members (Tr. OR 206); and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. All supervisors and some fellers (Ex. 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;53, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5&hyph;55, 5&hyph;63). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters who recommended first aid training for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited number of employees, said that training all fellers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or all other employees was excessive since the proposed rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would also require employees to work within visual or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
audible contact of another employee (Ex. 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;55). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter said that requiring all fellers to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trained would be duplicative since more than one feller may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
work at a work site (Ex. 5&hyph;63). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters said they already provide first-aid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training for each employee:

Everyone_all the people on our crew are trained [in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first aid] on a rotating basis. Now, the fellow that's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been with us six months, he has not been to the first-aid class yet. Also, one of the_I believe it's in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the Nortim Corporation, the Nortim self insured, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it is one of the regulations that we do have people on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the job that are versed in first aid (Tr. OR 174). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another hearing participant stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Along with overall safety training, I feel that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required first aid training for all employees is simply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
common sense (Tr. OR 393).

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Other commenters indicated that they are providing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first aid training to a substantial portion of employees, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part because the company's logging operations are in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Mr. Lesser: Does your training program include first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aid training? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Bell: We provide first aid training to just about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whoever wants it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Lesser: Who do you require to have first aid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Bell: We require all supervisors, leadmen, hook

tenders, leaders of crews. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Lesser: Using the voluntary nature offering the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first aid, do you get a lot of volunteers? What 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percentage of the work force is trained in first aid? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Bell: I'd say 35 percent (Tr. OR 375).

As discussed above, there is no dispute that logging is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a hazardous industry. All data sources in the record show 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a significant number of accidents occur in the logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry and that the severity of injuries sustained by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loggers is greater than that suffered by employees in other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industries. Loggers often work in isolated locations that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are far from hospitals or health care providers that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sometimes are accessible only by helicopters or vehicles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designed to operate on the most rugged terrain (Ex. 9&hyph;20; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tr. OR 21). Accordingly, loggers need to be trained and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipped to handle the significant number of severe injuries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that might arise. In many instances these trained employees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be the only persons available to render assistance at a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical time.

OSHA believes that first aid training for only a select 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
few individuals, such as supervisors and fellers, is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequate to ensure that injured loggers receive first aid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that is timely and appropriate. First, when only a few 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selected employees are trained, they may not be close enough 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the site of the accident to render assistance in time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The WIR survey indicates that more than one-half of all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injuries reported occurred at cutting sites, that in most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cases are remote from landings and from medical facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ex. 2&hyph;1). The WIR survey is consistent with the OSHA FCI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
study, that indicated that more than 70 percent of logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees killed were working at cutting sites (Ex. 4&hyph;61). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One hearing participant reinforced this problem: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The rigging crew is often 1,000 feet and sometimes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5,000 feet from the landing. The work site is usually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on rough, steep ground, and these workers often use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazardous cutting implements such as axes and chain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
saws. If the first aid trained person and the first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aid kit are in the yarder, that can be 15 minutes or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more from where the worst exposure is (Tr. OR 21). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, since the final rule allows employees to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintain contact with another employee by visual or audible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contact, an employee may be miles from the contact person 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when radio communication is used. In such cases, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contact person may not be able to provide immediate first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aid assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Second, limiting first aid training to all supervisors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and some additional personnel may not be adequate when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supervisors are not at the work site when an accident 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occurs. According to the State of Washington, logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supervisors usually have two or more logging crews working 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directly for them (Ex. 5&hyph;34). These logging crews are often 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dispersed over five square miles or more. In addition, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
larger operations, foremen usually see each crew only once a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
day and rarely for more than one hour of the workshift. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenters said in his experience it was not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uncommon to find a group of employees working in a location 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without a supervisor and no other employee in the group has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a current first aid certificate (Ex. 91&hyph;5). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, a logger's injuries may be of such severity that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
several persons trained in first aid may be needed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stabilize the injured employee and treat the injury. If 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only one employee is trained, the first aid assistance may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not be sufficient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fourth, when only one employee in a work site is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trained, as the proposed rule contemplates, first aid will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obviously be inadequate if the trained person is the one who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is injured. (Although first-aid training does include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instruction in self-aid, the injuries may be severe enough 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to incapacitate the trained employee.) For example, in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small working crew that has no supervisor, the feller may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the only employee who is trained in first-aid. If the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
feller is injured, there may be no other logger in that work 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
crew who is trained to provide first aid. The WIR survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicates that one-half of all loggers who were injured were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performing felling tasks (i.e., felling, limbing, bucking) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fifth, when only a few employees receive first-aid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training, there is a greater likelihood that there could be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
crucial gaps in coverage due to sickness, vacations, other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
leave, or employee turnover of those few who have received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training. In addition, an employer may not know from day to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
day if an employee will be present that is holding a current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first aid certificate (Ex. 5&hyph;7). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA notes that some commenters opposed requiring every 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employee to have first-aid training because of the transient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nature of the logging industry. OSHA finds that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters' argument does not support the position that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fewer employees should be trained. If there is high 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employee turnover, it may be the trained employee who is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employed any longer. If work continues without a fully-trained person while a first-aid replacement is being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trained, employees may be at great risk. By contrast, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
work has to be stopped until a replacement can be trained, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the employer could incur costs which could be prevented by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
having adequate first aid coverage in advance. If all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees working in the logging industry are required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have first-aid training, a pool of trained employees will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
always be available to employers for hiring. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fifth, requiring that each employee be trained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eliminates confusion and may be less administratively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burdensome than making a daily check and rescheduling of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
work assignments to assure that supervisors, fellers and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some additional number of employees in each operating area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hold current first aid training certificates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ease the training burden for employers, the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule does not require that the first-aid training be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided by the employer. Rather, the final rule requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the employer assure that each employee performing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logging operations receives or has received first-aid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training and that the first-aid training/certificate is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current. For example, as one means of complying with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rule, the employer could make first-aid training a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition of hiring or continued employment. The employer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be free to hire only those persons who had previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtained first-aid training and kept their certificate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current. In addition, when there is employee turnover, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trained employees will be able to bring their first-aid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
skills from one workplace to another and thus relieve the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training burden for the new employer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA is aware that some employers currently provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first-aid training and most likely will continue to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such training. OSHA is also aware that a number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organizations and schools provide first-aid training that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would meet the requirements of Appendix B. For example, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
American Red Cross, the Mine Safety and Health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administration, State extension services, community 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
colleges, and adult education programs all provide first-aid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training that includes CPR. As such, OSHA does not believe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the requirement of assuring that all employees have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received first-aid training that remains current will pose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an unreasonable burden on any employer or employee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

b. Elements of first-aid training.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice, OSHA requested comment on the specific elements, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such as CPR, that should be included in first-aid training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the proposed rule OSHA did not specify the basic elements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in which supervisors and fellers must be trained. Rather, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA proposed that first-aid training meet the requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of courses provided by the American Red Cross, MSHA or an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalent training program.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters recommended that OSHA require CPR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training as part of required first-aid training (Ex. 5&hyph;42, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5&hyph;49, 5&hyph;50, 9&hyph;2, 9&hyph;19). Both NIOSH and the U.S. Dept. of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interior supported the CPR training requirement. Because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loggers, especially those deep in the woods are not close to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
medical facilities during the ``golden hour'' where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resuscitation may save a person's life, OSHA agrees with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters that it is essential that all loggers be able to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
perform CPR. Therefore, in the final rule OSHA has included 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a requirement for annual CPR training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, OSHA has specified other basic skills and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
knowledge in Appendix B (mandatory) that are important for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providing aid to injured loggers in isolated settings. OSHA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is aware that there are many well-recognized first-aid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs that have broad-based curricula which already 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfy OSHA requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
5. Visual and audible contact.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the hearing notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA requested comment on the maximum time and/or distance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separation between employees. In the proposed rule, OSHA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included a requirement that employees work within visual or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
audible contact of another employee, so that someone would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be able to respond quickly in case of an accident or other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emergency. The proposed rule prohibited the use of engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noise, such as from chain saws, as a means of contact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Various State logging standards also prohibit the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chain-saw noise as a means of signaling (Ex. 2&hyph;17, 2&hyph;18, 2&hyph;19, 2&hyph;21, 2&hyph;22, 38J, 38K).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA received many comments on the contact and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
signaling provisions. Many commenters testified that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed contact requirement is necessary (Ex. 5&hyph;14, 5&hyph;17, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5&hyph;27, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92, 9&hyph;2, 9&hyph;3, 9&hyph;5, 9&hyph;13; Tr. W2 197&hyph;98). One commenter
said: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
We think that visual or audible contact is important 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and will save lives. There are also electronic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
devices, some sophisticated and some like citizen band 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
radios, that can be used by forest workers to maintain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
audible contact by electronic means. We recommend that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the existing proposed language be retained but modified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
perhaps to allow audible contact by electronic means 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Tr. W2 197&hyph;98).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Certain commenters urged OSHA to make the contact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement stricter than that proposed. One commenter said 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees in solitary jobs also need to remain in contact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and, therefore, should be provided with two-way radios (Ex. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9&hyph;15). Another commenter said OSHA should require employees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to remain within visual contact of another crew members (Ex. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9&hyph;20). Finally, two commenters recommended that OSHA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require employees to work within normal hearing or calling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distance of another employee (Ex. 9&hyph;19; Tr. OR 679&hyph;81). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, several commenters expressed various concerns 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about the contact provision, and particularly the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prohibition against chain-saw noise as a means of contact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, some participants said the requirements would have an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse impact on small employers, especially employers with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
work crews consisting of three or fewer loggers (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5&hyph;28, 5&hyph;35, 5&hyph;49, 5&hyph;53, 5&hyph;54, 5&hyph;70). For example, one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter said:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This requirement may adversely affect the livelihood of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
many small-scale loggers in the South who may work 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alone in the woods, or operate a single mobile ground 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
skidder or felling machine and are frequently out of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contact with other phases of the logging operation (Ex. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5&hyph;28). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This requirement would not be practical for several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasons: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) there are a number of logging contractors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that work alone, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) log crews with two or three members are often 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
out of contact because the great distance between the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
faller and log header, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) even at close range, visual and audible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
signals are attenuated by thick brush and loud 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
machinery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
My experience has been loggers will keep track of their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fellow workers the best they can but, due to the nature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the job, individuals will be separated for certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lengths of time. To require loggers to be within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
signaling distance of one another will preclude the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existence of one and two man log crews, working in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thick brush, working in hilly topography, skidding long 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distances, the use of ear plugs or working with loud 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
machines (Ex. 5&hyph;70).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Second, some commenters believed the contact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement conflicted with the proposed requirement to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintain a distance of two tree lengths between work areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ex. 5&hyph;12, 5&hyph;29, 5&hyph;4, 5&hyph;67, 5&hyph;70). These commenters said 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a separation of two tree lengths between work areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
might make it impossible to maintain contact due to saw 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noise and obstructions such as hills or vegetation. One 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter explained:

If this code goes through and is enacted, it would change the timber falling industry in Alaska. Southeast Alaska is
a relatively new geological area. We work on steep ground that is broken up by draws, gullies, cliffs. We have our timber
fallers work together as partners. One works in one strip or one area of the hillside and the other one works in another
area of the hillside. For safety reasons, our company requires that they work at least three tree lengths apart. And
often with the broken up terrain, that precludes visual contact (Tr. OR 353).

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Third, comments were received on the prohibition of chain-saw noise as a signaling device. Some participants supported
the prohibition (Ex. 5&hyph;27, 5&hyph;34, 5&hyph;42). Other commenters argued that chain-saw noise is currently
being used as a means of contact in the logging industry and should be allowed in the final rule (Tr. W1 65; OR 86, 353&hyph;55,
356&hyph;58, 384&hyph;85, 694&hyph;96). For example, one commenter said the sound of chain saws is an indicator
that someone is working at a specific location (Tr. W1 65). Another commenter stated: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
[W]e have been counting on chain saw noise for years. Chain saw noise is possible, and by the way, that's my most dangerous
part of my job is to do a safety inspection or to go up and check on cutters in a strip, to approach cutters. And I listen
to the saw. And I can tell when they are putting a cut into a standing tree or bucking a log with the chain saw noise. If we
are not allowed to use chain saw noise as audible contact, that means we may have to go back to double jacking which is
a faller and a bucker working in tandem (Tr. OR 353&hyph;55). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This participant also said that chain-saw noise should also be permitted because 103-decibel chain-saw engines
render 92-decibel personal alarm systems inadequate as means of audible contact (Tr. OR 355). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fourth, several commenters urged OSHA to adopt various alternatives and modifications to the proposed contact requirement
(Ex. 5&hyph;54, 5&hyph;55; Tr. OR 670&hyph;81). For example, commenters suggested that OSHA replace the contact
provision with a ``check-in'' requirement: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In West Virginia, a cutting crew often consists of a worker who fells and limbs the trees and a worker who operates a skidder.
Consequently, it is often necessary that the feller be left alone in the woods, without audible or visual contact with
another worker, for short periods of time while the skidder operator is making the trip to the log landing. Also, it
is common practice for workers to be constantly checking on one another. Upon his return from the landing, the skidder
operator immediately checks on the feller; and, the feller, if the skidder operator does not return in the normal time
span, will check on the skidder operator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Considering the common small cutting crew size, the practice of constantly checking on one another, and the difficulties
involved in using an audible signal capable of being heard over distances, over machine noise, and through hearing
protection devices, it is our recommendation that this aspect of the Standard be changed to allow a worker to be out
of ``visual or audible signal contact with another person'' for short periods of time. Due to the normal time involved
for transporting a skidder load to the landing, unhooking, and returning, we recommend that this short time period
be established at 20 minutes (Ex. 5&hyph;54).

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Other commenters also suggested that OSHA allow employees to be out of contact from other employees for short periods
of time (e.g., 15 to 20 minutes, the time to take a load to the landing and return) (Ex. 5&hyph;54; Tr. OR 670&hyph;81).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has decided in the final rule to retain the requirement that employees work within visual or audible contact of
another employee. As discussed above, most commenters indicated that remaining in contact is important to the safety
of loggers. Several commenters said that supervisors use chain-saw noise to identify where and whether an employee
is working. However, they did not provide evidence that chain-saw noise provides an effective means of communicating
information from the employee or from the supervisor. For example, data and information available to OSHA indicates
that even though chain-saw noise is currently used as a means of maintaining contact, there are still reports from
OSHA case file investigations of loggers being injured and not being discovered until after the shift has ended (Ex.
1). In addition, chain-saw noise does not provide the cutter with an adequate means of communicating with others in
the event they have become injured or are in other trouble. Since all chain-saw noise indicates is whether an employee
is working, the cutter must wait until another employee recognizes that the lack of noise means the cutter needs assistance.
This may delay rendering that assistance. OSHA believes the cutter, not just the supervisor, needs to have a method
for communicating when necessary. Radios and telephones are modern communication methods that are increasingly
used in this logging industry. These methods, unlike chain-saw noise, provide immediate two-way communication.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although OSHA has decided to retain in the final rule the prohibition against use of chain-saw noise alone as a means
of contact, the final rule does provide employers with a great deal of flexibility in maintaining contact with employees.
First, permitting radio communication to be used as a means of contact allows contact to be maintained while at the
same time maintaining a two tree-length distance between adjacent occupied work areas. Second, permitting contact
to be maintained by radio or whistles allows employees to work alone rather than limiting employees to working in teams
that are within visual distance of each other. Allowing radio contact will also provide flexibility for small radio
crew operations when visual or voice contact may not be possible. Third, OSHA also believes that permitting radio
contact will not be unduly burdensome for the industry since many companies already are utilizing electronic communications
(Ex. 5&hyph;27; Tr. W2 227). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the issue of equipment noise preventing radio communication, OSHA notes that radios are available
with ear phones that fit inside hearing protection muffs. Where such ear phones and hearing protectors are provided,
equipment noise will neither interfere with communication nor should result in occupational hearing loss. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because contact may be maintained by radio, OSHA has removed the exception to the contact requirement for ``single
employee assignments.'' OSHA believes that radio communication already is necessary in order for many of those single
employee jobs to be performed (e.g., watchman). As such, OSHA does not believe that extending the radio contact requirement
to all logging operations will unduly burden employers, while at the same time it will provide important protection
for all loggers.

6. Chain-saw protective devices. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the proposed standard, OSHA did not include a provision requiring chain saws to be equipped with chain brakes or
other devices that prevent kickback. The proposed standard also did not require chain saws to meet any performance
criteria of any standards-setting organizations. Rather, OSHA proposed only to require employers to inspect and
maintain chain-saw safety devices when chain saws were so equipped. The hearing notice requested further comment
on the adequacy of various chain-saw safety devices and what regulatory action OSHA should take in the final standard
regarding chain saws. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There was no dispute among commenters that chain-saw protective devices are necessary to prevent operators from
being injured. The record shows that the chain-saw bar can kick back in less than 0.3 seconds (Ex. 4&hyph;172). The
record also shows that average human reaction time, however, is only 0.75 seconds (Ex. 4&hyph;172). That means in
many cases the operator cannot take action quickly enough to avoid being struck by the chain saw. The record also shows
that many injuries in the logging industry are the result of chain-saw kickback. According to the WIR survey, 20 percent
of all logging injuries reported involved chain saws and almost two-thirds of those injuries were the result of chain-saw
kickback (Ex. 2&hyph;1). The Maine BLS survey also shows that chain-saw injuries account for a significant number
of logging injuries (26%) in that State (Ex. 4&hyph;175). Similar to the WIR survey, the Maine BLS survey indicated
that over half of all chain-saw accidents resulted from kickback.

a. Devices to prevent chain-saw kickback. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Information submitted to the docket indicates that there are four devices that exist to reduce or minimize the risk
of injury due to chain-saw kickback. These devices are chain brakes, bar tip guards, reduced-kickback guide bars,
and low- or reduced-kickback saw chains. Information about these devices was taken from a 1983 report prepared for
the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) (Ex. 5&hyph;13) as well as comments to the proposed rule. The discussion
that follows explains the different devices and their advantages and disadvantages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
chain brake
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is a device for stopping the saw chain when kickback occurs before the chain can contact the operator. The most common
type of chain brake is actuated when the operator's hand or arm hits the brake lever that is located immediately ahead
of the front handle. When kickback occurs, the chain brake may either be actuated by the operator's hand pivoting forward
on the handle, or by the hand being dislodged from the handle, striking the brake lever. According to the CPSC report,
chain brakes, unlike new technology chains and safety guide bars, do not have any adverse effect on the cutting effectiveness
of chain saws. The record also indicates that one of the advantages of chain brakes is that, unlike other protective
devices that can be removed, the chain brake is an integral part of the saw and is difficult to remove (Ex. 4&hyph;174).
As such, chain brakes deter the disabling of the kickback prevention system by the operator (Ex. 5&hyph;19).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
bar tip guard 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(or nose tip guard) is a device that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is bolted or screwed onto the tip of the bar. Its primary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
function is to prevent contact with the tip of the bar from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which kickback is generated. Commenters identified three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
problems with bar tip guards. First, one commenter said bar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tip guards are not usable in felling and bucking of some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trees (Ex. 9&hyph;16). This commenter said forward leaning trees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
usually require the bar tip to fell the tree safely. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, two commenters said the hazards associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bar tip guards outweigh their protective value (Ex. 5&hyph;42, 9&hyph;20). According to NIOSH bar tip guards reduce
kickback 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
danger only under certain conditions, that is, when the log 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or limb is elevated and does not have any off-angle to cause 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pinching of the bar (Ex. 5&hyph;42). NIOSH concluded that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bar tip guard may pose greater hazards than saws without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tips because they require the bucker to maintain working 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stances that are less stable. The other commenter said that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the bar tip can get caught on limbs. Third, the major 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
problem with bar tip guards is that they are removable (Ex. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5&hyph;13, 5&hyph;13H). According to the CPSC report, the bar tip 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guard is removed by operators because it reduces the utility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the saw by preventing boring and the cutting of any logs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are wider than the guide bar. Evidence in the record 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicates that bar tip guards are being removed by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant number of operators: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Only about half of the operators of saws so equipped 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
always use such guards. About 36 percent never use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
them, and about 12 percent sometimes take them off the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guide bar. Thus, while nose tip guards are effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anti-kickback devices, many operators remove them from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their saws (Ex. 5&hyph;13). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

The Portable Power Equipment Manufacturers Association 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(PPEMA) submitted testimony from CPSC's own proceedings, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which also acknowledged the extent to which bar tip guards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are removed from chain saws:

[T]he Commission received the benefit of a survey that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was done on the part of the NESDA, National Equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Servicing Dealers Association. They on their own 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveyed hundreds of their dealers. *&blank;*&blank;* [T]heir 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey corroborated my own personal observations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
namely, that in real life practice users of chain saws 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the droves are simply not using that nose tip, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
while if it were used or if it were permanently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established on the saw, it would be a complete barrier 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to kickback, the fact of the matter is because it's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temporary and because it is removed, because in my view 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it affects in the case of the dealers, as you'll see 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from their comments, it affects the efficacy of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
saw, it is taken off, and as a result provides no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection, zero. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Just to cite from the survey, 73.5 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responding dealers to the NESDA survey reported that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only zero to five percent of the chain saws brought 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into their shops for repair, of the ones that were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
originally equipped with the nose guards, that 73.5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of the dealers responded that only zero to five 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent had nose guards in place. Another 9.3 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reported that six to ten percent of such saws had nose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guards in place, leaving only 17.1 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dealers who put the figure of nose guards in place at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
something more than ten percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The unmistakable conclusion is that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overwhelming majority of consumers are removing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nose guards from their saws and not putting them on in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the first place. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The survey also revealed that almost no consumers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are interested in replacing nose guards that are not in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
place. Eighty-eight percent of the dealers, 88 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent, stated that zero percent of their customers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wanted replacements, and an additional 8.9 percent put 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the replacement request at a mere one to five percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ex. 5&hyph;13H). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are two different types of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
reduced-kickback guide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bars.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One is designed and manufactured with a taper from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the back of the bar and has a correspondingly small radius 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of curvature at the tip of the bar. This type of bar is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commonly referred to as a narrow nose bar. The other type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of reduced kickback guide bar has a reduced radius nose but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieves its taper from the fact that the top and bottom 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
edges of the bar a asymmetrical (the top and bottom edges 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are curved and have a different radius of curvature). This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
type bar is commonly called a banana bar because of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
peculiar shape. According to the CPSC report, both the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
narrow nose bar and the banana bar have significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drawbacks, primarily in the useful life of the bar and chain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the efficiency of the chain saw. The narrow nose bar, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because of its reduced radius of curvature at the tip, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receives more stress at the tip, thereby requiring more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequent replacement. Because of its asymmetrical design, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the banana bar cannot be merely turned over when the bottom 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
edge of the bar becomes worn, but must be replaced. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
type of bar also reduces the ability of the operator to use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the saw for boring. This disadvantage is compounded if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
saw also is equipped with a low- or reduced-kickback chain.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
[T]he use of low-kickback guide bars results in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tradeoff of some reduction in utility for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improvement in safety. Industry sources have suggested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that this may be an acceptable tradeoff for the less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
powerful saws which are probably purchased by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumers. Since the tradeoff involves a marginal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improvement in safety, however, manufacturers are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
probably less willing to equip the more powerful, more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance oriented saws with the low-kickback guide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bars (Ex. 5&hyph;13). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, the potential for kickback can be reduced by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
low- or reduced-kickback chain. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This chain is commonly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
referred to as new generation chain. Low kickback chain can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be identified by an idler or spacer link between each of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cutting links. In other words, the chain has a left hand 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cutter link on the right side of the chain, followed by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spacer link, followed by a right hand cutter link on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
left side of the chain followed by another spacer link 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before the sequence begins again. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the low-kickback chain can reduce kickback 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
energy by 40 to 90 percent, there are drawbacks to its use, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
according to the CPSC report. These drawbacks include: (1) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New technology chains generally exhibit some loss in cutting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiency (speed and ease of cutting), (2) these chains 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
make cutting more tiring for the operator thereby causing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more operator fatigue, and (3) the loss of cutting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiency may adversely affect the life of the chain. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loss of cutting efficiency has been estimated to be anywhere 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from a 10 to 25 percent. OSHA has no estimates of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase in operator fatigue and the degradation in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service life of the chain. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the four protective devices, most commenters said 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA should require chain saws to be equipped with a chain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brake because it is the most used and most effective for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professional logging operations (Ex. 4&hyph;175, 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;19, 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;27, 5&hyph;34, 5&hyph;42,
5&hyph;46, 9&hyph;3, 9&hyph;4, 9&hyph;13, 9&hyph;15, 9&hyph;18, 9&hyph;20; Tr. OR 536&hyph;37). Several of these
commenters said that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all chain saws used at their establishments are equipped 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with chain brakes. These commenters also said that almost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all manufacturers now produce chain saws with some kind of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chain brake and that almost all chain saws manufactured for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial logging operations now have chain brakes (Ex. 5&hyph;19; Tr. OR 185&hyph;87, 536). In addition, one commenter
said 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that manufacturers have improved earlier mechanical problems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with chain brakes so that they are reliable in preventing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
kickback (Ex. 9&hyph;4). With regard to the effectiveness of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chain brakes, one commenter said: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The chain brake is, I'd say, one of the most important 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chain saw protective devices developed in modern 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
history. In Montana all of our current professional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
saws are equipped with chain brakes. Most of our saws 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are in the four to six cubic inch range, primarily, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Stihl and Husqvarna with a few other minor brands and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seldom on job visitations do I find anyone who has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disconnected the chain brake. It's so uncommon that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it's startling when I find that any more.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The other protective device that I see that's had 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial improvement is the throttle lock mechanism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where it has to be held down with your palm in order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the trigger to operate. For years it was common 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the first thing a logger did was he got a roll of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
black tape and he would tape that down so you didn't 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have to operate that. Through our progressive Montana 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sawyer Safety Program and other efforts I brag to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
people that we now have developed a genetically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
superior timber faller in Montana that can now squeeze 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with his palm and pull with his trigger finger at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These two chain saw protective devices combined with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
leg protection have had a significant impact on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction of accidents in Montana relative to timber 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
falling. In fact, it's been so significant that I 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
don't even consider the other options of even any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application to logging when we talk about the low 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
kickback bar, the low kick-back chains and even the bar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tipped guards. They may have individual special 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application but I'm thoroughly convinced with the chain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brake, the throttle lock and the leg protection we've 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
so significantly reduced chain saw injuries that any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further attention is maybe some wasted effort and just 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further develops additional conflict (Tr. OR 536).

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Mr. David Kludt, Logging Safety Program Supervisor for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State of Idaho, testified that 10 percent of all logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accidents each month are the result of chain-saw kickback 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and that these accidents could be drastically reduced by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of chain brakes (Ex. 9&hyph;4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, Maine BLS says that chain brakes have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
played a significant role in lessening the effects of chain-saw injuries in that State (Ex. 5&hyph;174). They reported
that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only 13 percent of chain-saw accidents where chain brakes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were present resulted in hospitalization, while nearly half 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of all other accidents required hospitalization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters, however, disputed the effectiveness of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chain brakes for preventing kickback (Ex. 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;59, 5&hyph;66). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of these commenters said chain brakes were not reliable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and required frequent maintenance, however, no evidence or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data were presented to support the contention (ex. 5&hyph;59). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter said that a study showed that while chain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brakes reduced kickback by 80 percent, non-kickback 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accidents showed a 400 percent increase (Ex. 5&hyph;66). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the commenter also admitted that the study was from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1972 and that chain brakes had undergone significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improvement since that time. Another commenter said chain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brakes, depending on their design, could become entangled in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the brush the saw is clearing and create a safety hazard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ex. 5&hyph;39). The WIR survey, however, does not support the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter's argument. None of the chain-saw operators 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting injuries said their chain brake had become caught 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ex. 2&hyph;1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
OSHA regulatory action. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters said that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the final rule should include requirements for chain-saw 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protective devices (Ex. 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;19, 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;27, 5&hyph;34, 5&hyph;42, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5&hyph;46, 9&hyph;3, 9&hyph;4, 9&hyph;13, 9&hyph;15, 9&hyph;18, 9&hyph;20; Tr. OR 536&hyph;37). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, some commenters, including chain-saw and chain-saw 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accessory manufacturers, said OSHA should include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance requirements for chain saws in the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard rather than specification requirements (Ex. 5&hyph;4, 5&hyph;8, 5&hyph;13, 5&hyph;15, 5&hyph;26, 5&hyph;37,
5&hyph;59). Many of these commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supported incorporating by reference the American National 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standards Institute (ANSI) B175.1&hyph;1985 standard on ``Safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requirements for Gasoline Powered Chain Saws'' (Ex. 5&hyph;4, 5&hyph;8, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5&hyph;13, 5&hyph;15, 5&hyph;26, 5&hyph;37, 5&hyph;59). The ANSI standard specifies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a performance criteria for manufacture and testing of chain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
saw safety features, such as protection from chain-saw 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
kickback. One commenter summed up their rationale:

[T]he Status Report on Chain Saw Related Hazards since 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 1985 Revision to The Voluntary Standard ANSI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B175.1, which was prepared for the Consumer Product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Safety Commission in March of this year, is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testimonial to the fact that the reduction in chain saw 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injuries is the result of adherence by manufacturers to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the voluntary standard. There truly is little to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
said in defense of OSHA when it chooses to knowingly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ignore the demonstrated success of the chain saw 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
voluntary standard, which equates compliance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of a combination of devices, in favor of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
arbitrary and inexpert agency decision to the effect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that one specific device, in and of itself, is superior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to any other device or combination of devices permitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the standard (Ex. 5&hyph;4).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These commenters stated that OSHA would create 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``confusion in the marketplace'' if OSHA adopted requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that were significantly different from the ANSI chain-saw 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard that all manufacturers have been voluntarily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following (Ex. 5&hyph;4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters, however, opposed incorporating the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ANSI standard in the final rule (Ex. 5&hyph;27, 5&hyph;48; Tr. OR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
118). These commenters said the ANSI standard was developed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to protect consumer chain-saw users, not professional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loggers:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The ANSI B175.1 Standard was developed from an injury 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data base that was consumer based and therefore its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
direct application to pro-logging may not be justified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ex. 5&hyph;27).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two commenters said that ANSI standards were not known 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to most loggers, were not readily available, and were not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
written in language that the average logger would comprehend 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ex. 5&hyph;27; Tr. OR 118). One of these commenters said OSHA, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore, should put its requirements in the standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rather than requiring logging employers to obtain and read 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
another document (Tr. OR 118). He added that placing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements in the regulatory text would increase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, many commenters supported a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement that all chain saws be equipped with chain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brakes rather than just referencing the ANSI standard. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general, these commenters said chain brakes were the most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective device to protect operators from kickback and to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide extra protection when the saws are carried between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cutting jobs. In addition, one commenter supported a chain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brake requirement for the following reason:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. should follow the lead of other countries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(European) and require that all saws have an operating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chain brake if purchased after the adoption of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. The cost would be minimal since the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
majority of saws now come equipped with these devices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This would also help deter the disabling of the brake 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system by operating personnel (Ex. 5&hyph;19).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA agrees with commenters that the final standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should include requirements on chain-saw protective devices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule does incorporate by reference the ANSI B175.1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consensus standard, but the Agency believes that the ANSI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard alone does not provide the necessary degree of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety for logging employees. Accordingly, for several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasons, the final rule also requires that chain saws placed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into initial service after the effective date of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard be equipped with chain brakes. First, there is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considerable evidence in the record that chain brakes are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective and the most used device to prevent kickback. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, they have strong acceptance by logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professionals, and as a result, already are standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment on almost all chain saws currently manufactured. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, chain brakes do not have the disadvantages of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other protective devices. For example, unlike bar tip 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guards, chain brakes are not removed by operators. Unlike 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduced-kickback guide bars and low- or reduced-kickback 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chains, chain brakes do not affect production efficiency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fourth, other countries also have adopted provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requiring chain saws to be equipped with chain brakes (Ex. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5&hyph;19). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fifth, OSHA agrees with commenters who are concerned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that, in order to maximize compliance, the standard be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comprehensible to the average loggers. This is especially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
important for chain-saw safety, since many employees provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their own chain saws. These employees and their employers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
need plain and simple direction about what protection must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be provided for each chain-saw operator. OSHA does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believe that the ANSI standard contains the type of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information needed by those operating the chain saw. It 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires the use of sophisticated equipment and exacting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures that are beyond the expertise of the average 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logging employer. Much of the ANSI standard deals with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
computer program for simulating chain-saw kickbacks and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tests to determine the accuracy of the computer program. As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such, the ANSI standard is primarily directed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers of chain saws, rather than employers and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees in the logging industry. For example, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard states:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this standard is to establish minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety requirements with respect to the manufacture of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portable, hand-held, gasoline-powered chain saws (Ex. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4&hyph;66).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The requirements of the ANSI standard are primarily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the unique purview of manufacturers, such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for the throttle control system, handles, pull-type starters, fuel tanks and oil tanks, exhaust systems,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sound levels, and vibration. Only the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements are directed at the employer:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
It shall be the responsibility of the owner to maintain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the chain saw in accordance with the instructions in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the owner's manual. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chain saws shall be used in accordance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operating instructions and safety precautions listed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the owner's manual. It shall be the responsibility of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the owner to see that such instructions and precautions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are given to every operator who uses the saw (Ex. 4&hyph;66).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the ANSI standard does not require the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employer to ensure that each chain saw used in their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
workplace is equipped with kickback protection. That is, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ANSI standard does not require the employer to ensure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
kickback prevention devices are not removed or disabled by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operators. By specifying that chain saws used by logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees be equipped with chain brakes, OSHA emphasizes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that responsibility for compliance with OSHA standards rests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the employer, not the manufacturer or the employee.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to retain flexibility in the final rule, OSHA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is requiring chain saws placed in service after the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective date of this standard to be equipped with chain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brakes or other protective device that prevents or minimizes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
kickback. OSHA notes that whatever kickback device is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present, the final rule requires that it not be removed or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
otherwise disabled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
7. Operator manuals or instructions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing notice OSHA raised two issues regarding operator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manuals or instructions (referred to collectively as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructions) for machines: the location of instructions, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the experience of employers in obtaining manuals from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a. Location of operator manuals or instructions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the existing pulpwood standard and the proposed standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contained provisions requiring either an operator's manual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or set of instructions be kept with each machine. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, both stated that the instructions, at a minimum, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must describe the operation, maintenance and safe practices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the machine. The proposed standard added a provision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requiring each operator and maintenance employee to comply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the manual. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All commenters generally agreed with the need to have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructions available to operators and maintenance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personnel. Several hearing participants supported OSHA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal to require instructions to be kept with machines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Tr. W1 201, OR 168, 194). For example, one participant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stated: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
We urge OSHA to require that operator manuals be kept 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the machine. Operator manuals contain important 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personal safety and machine operational information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which must be utilized during training and must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available for reference to assure safety for all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different operating conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Efficient and productive logging operations go hand in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hand with safe work practices and proper machine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintenance and operation. Ready and immediate access 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to safety and operational information is essential to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimize downtime caused by accidents (Tr. OR 168). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another commenter added that once instructions are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
placed back at the office, they are not used: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Ms. Schuster: I just have one question. Do you 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have any idea of the percentage of equipment out there 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the woods that does not currently have operator's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manuals available? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Carr: I'm afraid I'd have to agree, most of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
them probably do not. This is our concern as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers that most of them do not. Most of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time they have taken them and put them in the office 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and that's the last they see of them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Schuster: You say most of them would have put 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
them in the office. Would you say that many of them do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have them available though somewhere, if not on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Carr: If somebody can find it (Tr. OR 194).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters, however, stated that for several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasons instructions should not be kept with machines or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instead should be distributed as part of the training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program (Ex. 5&hyph;12, 5&hyph;34, 5&hyph;35, 5&hyph;67, 9&hyph;2, 9&hyph;3, 9&hyph;4, 9&hyph;5, 9&hyph;19,
9&hyph;22; Tr. W1 66, 134, 185, 235, W2 225, OR 31, 59, 263, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
378, 629). First, these commenters said instructions kept 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with machines would be damaged or destroyed. They stated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that instructions would be subject to vandalism or would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disappear if kept with machines or vehicles. They also said 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructions would become dirty or be destroyed due to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse weather in which machines and vehicles are operated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result, these commenters stated that they store 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator instructions at the company office, in the crew 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transport vehicles or at the work site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, several commenters said that it was not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to keep instructions with machines because they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have limited utility (Ex. 9&hyph;4; Tr. W1 134, 186, OR 80, 117, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
378, 430, 629). Some of these commenters said instructions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pertain primarily to maintenance of machines and scheduling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of maintenance and, therefore, should be kept where the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintenance will be conducted. Other commenters said that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructions contain such general information about machine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation that their only utility is for someone who is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unfamiliar with the operation of the machine. Instead, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these and other participants said the manuals should be used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in operator training sessions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, some participants said that instructions are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently given to new employees to read as part of their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
orientation sessions (Tr. W1 66; OR 31, 263, 629). These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participants also said that if operators need to refer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
routinely to instructions at the work site, they should not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be allowed to operate the machine and should receive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional training rather than being allowed to rely on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After reviewing the comments and testimony received, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has decided in the final rule to require that operating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and maintenance instructions be available on the machine or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the area where the machine is being operated, such as at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the landing or in a crew transport vehicle located in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area where the machine is being operated. OSHA believes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ready access to instructions is important for several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasons. As OSHA explained in the preamble to the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule, instructions are necessary not only for maintenance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personnel but also for operators who are unsure or unaware 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of safe operating procedures pose hazards to themselves and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
co-workers. Maintaining these materials in the immediate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
work area of the machine assures their availability and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increases the likelihood of their use when needed by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA also believes that instructions have utility for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operators in specific circumstances. Instructions give the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator a ready reference source when a new or unique 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
situation is encountered (e.g., operations on terrain where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a combination of hazards are present, such as swampy, rocky 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or loose ground). If unusual problems or emergencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requiring prompt correction arise during operation, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructions provide the operator with correct information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to resolve the problem rather than guessing about a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solution. In addition, some machine operators perform their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
own maintenance. By keeping instructions on the machine or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the immediate work area, these operators can quickly deal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with maintenance issues as they arise. Therefore, OSHA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that instructions are useful for the operator only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when they can be immediately accessed rather than being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housed at an office that may be miles from the work area or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintenance area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA also agrees with commenters who said that if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructions are not kept in the work area of the machine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they will not be used. OSHA is concerned that if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructions are not in the area where the machine is being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operated, operators will be discouraged from stopping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production to go get the instructions. Instead, employees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will decide to ``take their chances'' in dealing with unusual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
problems or emergencies, which could result in serious 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injury. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the issue of weather damage to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructions which are kept on the machine or in the machine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
work area, OSHA notes that a hearing participant pointed out 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that in recent years, manufacturers have been providing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weather-resistant instructions which may be kept with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
machines (Tr. OR 205). Moreover, it should not be overly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difficult for an employer to place the instructions in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weather-proof bag to keep them with the machine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA does agree with commenters' position that if an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator must 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
routinely
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refer to instructions in order to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operate a machine or vehicle, additional training or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supervision is necessary. The final rule does provide such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional training for that operator. However, there may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
well be instances in which the employee may need to consult 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the manual in order to deal with a problem that arises 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the use of the equipment. For that reason, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructions should be immediately available to employees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, OSHA is requiring in this final rule that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructions be maintained in the immediate work area of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
machine so they will be available both to the machine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator and to maintenance personnel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b. Obtaining operator manuals or instructions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing notice OSHA also requested employers to discuss 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their experience with trying to obtain operating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructions or replacement instructions from dealers and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers. OSHA wanted to gather information on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of machines that come with instructions and on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
degree of ease in obtaining replacement instructions. Very 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
few participants commented in this issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One hearing participant said that manufacturers do provide instructions with new equipment, but used machines that
are sold may have no instructions (Tr. OR 31). However, two hearing participants said that replacement instructions
are available either from the manufacturer or the dealer, and therefore, they have had no more difficulty in obtaining
instructions than in acquiring any machine replacement part (Tr. W1 201, OR 197). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA therefore believes that the requirement that instructions for machine be maintained will not be burdensome
for employers, even where employers must obtain replacement copies from the manufacturer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
8. Riders. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the hearing notice OSHA requested comment on whether trainers should be permitted to ride on machines to observe
operator performance. The pulpwood logging standard prohibited riders or observers from riding on machines unless
seating and other protection were provided. The proposed standard continued that prohibition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters supported the current and proposed prohibition of riders on machines (Ex. 5&hyph;7, 5&hyph;22,
5&hyph;42, 9&hyph;3, 9&hyph;13, 9&hyph;18; Tr. W1 202, 205, 235, W2 227, OR 155, 169). These commenters said riders
should be prohibited, unless protection is provided since they are exposed to the same hazards as machine operators,
for whom seating, seat belts and other protection is required. NIOSH, for example, supported the prohibition for
the following reasons: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Many logging operations occur on rough terrain which would expose any rider to a high risk of injury or death. Serious
errors made by a trainer or trainee under these conditions endangers both people; it must be recognized that logging
equipment is not designed for training purposes (i.e., the trainer cannot take control of the equipment from the trainee
in a safe, orderly fashion) (Ex. 5&hyph;42). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NIOSH therefore recommended that training be conducted and completed in pre-worksite training where the environment
can be ``controlled'' instead of the employer conducting ``on- the-job'' training with machines that are not designed
to carry passengers safely. Another commenter agreed that the necessary operator training should be given, and the
operator should be afforded the opportunity to practice on level ground, before the operator moves into work areas.
This training and practice would allow operators to become proficient without requiring trainers to ride on the machines
(Tr. OR 155). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters, including one who supported the exemption for trainers, stated that it was not absolutely necessary
to have the trainer riding on the machine in order to maintain communication with the machine operator (Ex. 5&hyph;27;
Tr. W2 227). They said communication could be accomplished through radio contact (one-way or two-way radios), thus
allowing the trainer to remain in a safe location on the ground. One of the commenters pointed out that this method is
currently used in logging operations in Scandinavian countries (Tr. W2 227).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters supported an exception permitting trainers to ride on machines (Ex. 5&hyph;12, 5&hyph;22, 5&hyph;28,
5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;45, 5&hyph;49, 5&hyph;53, 5&hyph;54, 5&hyph;55, 5&hyph;63, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92,
9&hyph;2, 9&hyph;5, 9&hyph;10, 9&hyph;13, 9&hyph;19; Tr. OR 32, 201, 206, 337). These commenters said that an exemption
be allowed because trainers were not as great since they ride for only short periods and, therefore, they are not exposed
to hazards to the same extent as machine operators. However, several commenters said that if instructors were permitted
to ride on machines that at least seat belts should be required and training should be conducted on level terrain (Ex.
5&hyph;27, 9&hyph;3, 9&hyph;13; Tr. OR 169). Another commenter said that trainers should not be permitted to ride
on machines during actual production because ``such conditions may not be conducive to rider safety'' (Ex. 5&hyph;54).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters said the exemption should include other employees in addition to training (Ex. 5&hyph;27, 9&hyph;2;
Tr. OR 206). One commenter supported expanding the exception to allow mechanics to ride on machines (Tr. OR 206). Another
commenter said that the exception should be permitted for large multi-purpose logging equipment where there is sufficient
room in the enclosed operator cab to permit another person to ride safely, even though there is not a second seat (Ex.
5&hyph;27). One commenter said fellers should be permitted to ride back to the landing at the end of the workshift (Ex.
9&hyph;2). However, none of these commenters provided any evidence that these riders were not exposed to the same
hazards as the machine operator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has carefully considered all comments and data in the record. OSHA agrees with the commenters that riders face
the same hazards as machine operators on moving equipment and that they need protection equivalent to that of the operator.
According to logging fatalities reported to OSHA between 1985&hyph;90, there were reports of riders killed when
machines roll over (Ex. 4&hyph;65). The OSHA FCI report also indicated that loggers have been killed riding on unauthorized
parts of machines (Ex. 4&hyph;61). Even those who opposed the prohibition on riders recognized that such an activity
is hazardous due to conditions of the work environment, such as unlevel terrain. In addition, the record indicates
that an exemption for trainers is unnecessary because other methods of communication between the trainee and trainer
are available and in use in the logging industry. As such, OSHA has retained the requirement in the final standard that
machines must have passenger protection equivalent to operator protection if the employer allows riders on machines.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
9. Equipment protective devices. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the hearing notice OSHA raised two issues regarding protective devices for machines: the need and cost of retrofitting
machines with rollover protective structures (ROPS) and falling object protective structures (FOPS), and the appropriateness
of incorporating various consensus standards covering ROPS and FOPS into the logging standard by reference. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a. Retrofitting. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the hearing notice OSHA requested comment on whether the final standard should require machines without ROPS and
FOPS to be retrofitted with those devices. The proposed standard would not have required retrofitting. In the proposed
standard, OSHA specified that certain machines placed in service after the effective date of the final standard to
be equipped with ROPS and/or FOPS meeting Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) minimum performance criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There was no opposition from commenters on the general requirement that certain machines used in logging operations
be equipped with ROPS
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
and/or FOPS. NIOSH stated that 80 deaths occurred due to logging machine rollovers from 1980&hyph;85 (Ex. 5&hyph;42).
This is approximately 13 deaths each year due to rollover accidents. Another commenter cited a study where 12 loggers
were killed in rollover accidents in the State of Washington from 1977&hyph;83 (Tr. W1 27). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters said that machines without ROPS and FOPS should be retrofitted (Ex. 5&hyph;42, 5&hyph;54, 9&hyph;3,
9&hyph;13; Tr. W1 22). The West Virginia Forestry Association safety committee said that retrofitting was necessary
because operators were exposed to ``extreme danger'' if machines were used in the woods without such protective devices
(Ex. 5&hyph;54). In addition to the safety necessity of retrofitting, the committee said that retrofitting was economically
feasible for the industry as whole.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters, on the other hand, while supporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ROPS and FOPS requirements for new machines, opposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retrofitting older machinery (Ex. 5&hyph;19, 5&hyph;22, 5&hyph;25, 5&hyph;27, 5&hyph;33, 5&hyph;53, 5&hyph;57,
5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92, 9&hyph;5, 9&hyph;17; Tr. W1 203, OR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
170). Their opposition was based on several reasons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, commenters said that machines should not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to be retrofitted to meet current standards when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the installed ROPS and/or FOPS met industry standards in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect at the time of manufacture (Ex. 5&hyph;22; Tr. W1 203, OR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
170). One commenter said that older machines in the logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry were equipped with rollover protection, but those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
machine structures still in service do not meet the revised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry standards (Ex. 5&hyph;22). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, some commenters said that retrofitting machines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be very burdensome and costly, especially given the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited useful life of such machines (Ex. 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9&hyph;5). They said retrofitting would be expensive because it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would require complete rebuilding and testing of the frame 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
structure. These commenters also said that employers would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have to hire outside contractors to test the retrofitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment since most employers did not have the personnel, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expertise or equipment to install and test protective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
structures (Ex. 5&hyph;35). In addition, other commenters said 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the retrofitting requirement would be too burdensome 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for small employers, both in terms of absorbing the cost in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small operations and in finding persons who could do the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retrofitting (Tr. OR 119, 263, 307). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, commenters indicated that the retrofitting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement was not essential since most of the machines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified in the proposed standard already are manufactured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with ROPS and FOPS as standard equipment (Tr. W1 184, 203, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OR 170). For example, most log-skidders manufactured after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1974 have ROPS and FOPS meeting the performance criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most mobile equipment used in the Southeastern United States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
already has ROPS or FOPS (Ex. 5&hyph;19). Other commenters said 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that skidders now come with fully enclosed cabs (Tr. W1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
184). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all the comments and information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received in the rulemaking record, OSHA has decided for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
several reasons not to require machines placed into service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before the effective date of this standard to be retrofit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with ROPS and FOPS, provided that ROPS and FOPS have not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been removed from machines so equipped at the time of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacture. First, OSHA has determined that many of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
machines currently in use already have protective structures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meeting various performance criteria. The final standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires that these protective structures continue to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintained throughout the useful life of the machine, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that they be replaced where they have been removed (e.g., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removed after machine accident). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, many machines currently in use and virtually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all machines recently manufactured meet the performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria specified in the proposed standard (Ex. 9&hyph;2; Tr. OR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
185&hyph;87). OSHA believes that older machines, that either do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not have protective structures or have ROPS and FOPS meeting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
earlier standards, are few in number and are rapidly nearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the end of their useful life. As such, OSHA believes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most employers are substantially in compliance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement for machine protective structures and will reach 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
full compliance in short period of time. Therefore, OSHA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determines that compliance with the protective structure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement can be achieved without requiring retrofitting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Incorporation of standards by reference. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing notice, OSHA requested comment on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriateness of incorporating by reference updated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consensus standards governing machine protective devices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the proposed standard OSHA required ROPS and FOPS to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
installed, tested and maintained in accordance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following SAE national consensus standards: SAE 1040c June 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1979 ``Performance Criteria or Rollover Protective Structures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ROPS) for Construction, Earthmoving, Forestry, and Mining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Machines'' and J231 Jan 1981 ``Minimum Performance Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for Falling Object Protective Structures (FOPS).'' The SAE 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ROPS standard was updated in 1988 as was the SAE standard on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Deflection Limiting Volume-ROPS/FOPS Laboratory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Evaluation.''

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters discussed incorporation of updated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards (Ex. 5&hyph;10, 5&hyph;22, 5&hyph;57, 9&hyph;3, 9&hyph;13; Tr. W1 203). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most emphasized the need to reference the most up-to-date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards in the final rule. In addition, two commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
said OSHA should allow the use of standards from other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards producing bodies, such as the International 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Organization for Standardization (ISO) (Ex. 5&hyph;22, 5&hyph;57). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters also recommended that OSHA harmonize its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory language with ISO and Mine Safety and Health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administration protective structure standards (Ex. 5&hyph;10, 5&hyph;22). However, two commenters opposed incorporation
by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reference because they contend that other standards may not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have followed the same notice and public comment rules as do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA standards (Ex. 9&hyph;3, 9&hyph;13). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has considered the comments and in the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard the Agency has decided to incorporate by reference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the current SAE standards on ROPS and FOPS. While there was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some comment about whether technical publications should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
referenced in standards, OSHA believes it is better in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
case to reference technical documents rather than spell out 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all of the many specifications the documents contain. Since 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the final standard is not requiring employers to retrofit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
machines, it is more important for employers to know that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new machines they purchase meet the SAE standards. It is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the manufacturer and not the employer who will have the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expertise, personnel and equipment to do the necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
installation and testing of the protective structures as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part of the manufacturing process, and it is the label of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conformance placed on the equipment by the manufacturer that

10. Manual felling. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The hearing notice raised two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issues regarding manual felling: should exceptions to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undercut requirement be allowed, and where should the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
backcut be required to be made? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a. Undercut requirement. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included a provision requiring each manually felled tree to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be undercut. This provision also required that undercuts be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a size to guide the tree fall in the intended direction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and to minimize the possibility of splitting. The purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this provision was to prevent trees from splitting, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
kicking back, or falling in an unintended direction, thereby 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injuring an employee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters supported the proposed requirement (Ex. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5&hyph;42, 9&hyph;15; Tr. OR 485&hyph;88). One commenter said: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
[Undercutting] helps protect the feller from the butt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the tree riding back up the sawn notch and springing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
backwards over the stump towards him if the tree is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
felled uphill, or strikes something during its fall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that pushes [the tree] backwards (Ex. 9&hyph;15)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
However, other commenters said OSHA should revise the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undercut requirement in the final rule (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;39, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5&hyph;46, 5&hyph;52, 5&hyph;63, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92, 9&hyph;1, 9&hyph;5; Tr. OR 265, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
284&hyph;88, 324&hyph;26). One commenter said OSHA should make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undercutting a recommended practice in the final rule to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allow for innovations in cutting techniques and to allow for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration of various production requirements for cutting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain types of wood (e.g., veneer). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters stated that OSHA should permit an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exception to the undercut requirement for manual felling of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
saplings or unmerchantable trees, that is, of trees with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small diameter at breast height (DBH) (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;46, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5&hyph;63, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92, 9&hyph;1, 9&hyph;5; Tr. OR 265, 284&hyph;88, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
324&hyph;26). These commenters said that the hazards OSHA was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attempting to protect against do not exist for saplings, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore, undercuts are not necessary. For example, Mr. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alex Hanson, of AOL, stated: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
On the smaller, nonmerchantable timber that's two, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
three, four, five, six inches, generally not very tall, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20 foot or less or maybe taller, and when you slash it, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
you push it over. It doesn't need a face to control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the direction of fall.

[W]hen trees start getting to be merchantable size, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
then you have safety problems. You get a seven inch or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
over tree, you want to know where it's going. You 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
don't want to have it just fall anywhere.

[Y]ou have to buck those merchantable trees. You have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to cut the top out so you just don't want them going 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
everywhere. You want things in line. And if they're 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
everywhere, then it increases the risk for the buckers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Generally it's the same guy who is falling it, but you 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
want to have things in an orderly fashion so that he's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not having to go everywhere to buck the top. If 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they're just slashing it, it doesn't really matter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where it goes because you're not having to go out there 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and limb and cut the tops out and create another hazard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for yourself (Tr. OR 265, 284&hyph;88).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
However, other commenters disagreed with AOL about what 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
size tree requires an undercut. One commenter said that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undercuts are necessary for any tree that has more than a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
three-inch base (Ex. 9&hyph;16), while another commenter said 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undercuts were not necessary for trees with a seven-inch DBH 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Tr. OR 421&hyph;22). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The APA, however, said that even trees with a small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DBH should be undercut: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
You heard from one of the associations who is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommending that with regard to what I call undercuts, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they're also called face cuts, that they not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required on very small trees, and there was a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussion and possibly a recommendation of an 8-inch 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or 7-inch size limit. Unfortunately, I don't have any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data. But we do know and I will watch to see if I can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
find any and submit it post hearing. I went through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
our files and could not find anything. But it is our 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
perception, after studying these operations, that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tree that's 8 inches in diameter at breast height is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
probably about 12 inches in diameter at the stump, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether it's an oak tree or a Douglas fir tree that's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
60 feet tall and 8 inches and 12, it's a significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mass of wood that is difficult to control to get on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ground and could cause and probably has caused injuries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and maybe even deaths. There's enough mass there with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a 60-foot tree ripping down, uncontrolled in its fall, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to cause a death. And you heard from the Montana 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
folks, that they have a little bit of a problem with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that too (Tr. OR 485&hyph;88). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Moreover, some commenters opposing the undercut 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement also admitted that undercuts were necessary for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any merchantable tree, regardless of its size. They said 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that whenever a tree has a merchantable stem for a sawlog 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product, it must be undercut to protect the fiber recovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Tr. OR 422, 487&hyph;88). They said undercutting was essential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both for production reasons and safety considerations for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees bucking the felled tree. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After considering the evidence in the record, OSHA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes a provision requiring that each tree manually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
felled be undercut is necessary to protect employees from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injury. According to the WIR survey, four percent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees injured said they had been using the wrong cutting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
method at the time of their accident (Ex. 2&hyph;1). The OSHA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FCI report indicated that 10 fellers were injured because of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
misjudgments in cutting the tree (Ex. 4&hyph;61). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, undercutting helps protect the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
feller from injury by reducing the potential for the tree 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
splitting and falling in an unintended direction or kicking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
back towards the feller. In the final rule, OSHA is also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowing an exception to the undercutting requirement when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the employer demonstrates that felling the particular tree 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without an undercut will not create a hazard for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employee. OSHA believes that when the hazards of splitting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trees, tree kickback and misdirected falls are not present, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it may be appropriate to manually fell a tree without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undercutting. OSHA notes that the employer bears the burden 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of demonstrating that the hazards discussed in this section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are not present. OSHA also notes that the employers cannot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
make a blanket determination that trees of a particular size 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
never pose the hazards discussed above if manually felled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without an undercut. The condition of the tree and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surrounding area may make manually felling even a small a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tree hazardous if it is not first undercut. The tree and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those conditions must be assessed on a case by case basis to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine whether felling the tree without making an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undercut would create a hazard for an employee.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For two reasons, however, OSHA has decided against 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifying an undercut exception for trees of a certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
size. First, there is no agreement among the commenters on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
what size tree could be safely exempted from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undercutting requirement. There is evidence in the record, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that manually felling trees of the size that some commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
say should be exempted from the requirement can pose a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
serious hazard to fellers (Tr. OR 265&hyph;69, 485&hyph;88). Also, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
while commenters agreed that unmerchantable trees did not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require undercutting, none agreed on what size tree 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constituted an unmerchantable tree. The estimates of what 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sizes were considered to be merchantable trees varied 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greatly, from 3 to 10 inches DBH, depending on the type of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wood being harvested (Ex. 5&hyph;46; Tr. OR 265, 485&hyph;88). And, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as some commenters have pointed out, trees included in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
range of sizes can pose hazards to fellers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, some commenters said that any tree that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered merchantable is undercut, even if it is within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the range of sizes that commenters say should be exempted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to commenters the undercut is also made in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
merchantable trees to prevent splitting of the product (Tr. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OR 284&hyph;88). As such, undercutting may be done on small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trees in any event. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA does note that in many cases when trees are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined to be unmerchantable they are not manually felled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but rather slashed by mechanical means (Tr. OR 265, 268&hyph;69, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
285&hyph;87, 421&hyph;22). This provision on undercutting does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply to trees felled by mechanical means. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b. Backcut requirement.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The second issue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding manual felling on which OSHA requested comment was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where backcuts should be required to be made. In the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed standard, OSHA required that backcuts be made above 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the horizontal cut of the undercut. The 1978 ANSI logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and various State logging standards contain similar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements (e.g., Ex. 38K). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters supported the proposed requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ex. 5&hyph;42, 9&hyph;15). These commenters said a backcut above the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
horizontal cut is necessary to assure that the tree does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fall in an unintended direction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, other commenters said OSHA should permit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
backcuts to be at the same level or below the level of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undercut (Ex. 5&hyph;28, 5&hyph;29, 5&hyph;42, 5&hyph;52, 9&hyph;1; Tr. W2 229&hyph;31, OR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
395&hyph;96, 421&hyph;24, 499&hyph;500). Some said that a same level 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
backcut was more effective:

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Backcuts should be made on the same level as the point 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the notch of the undercut. The hinge is what keeps 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the tree from kicking back, not the fact that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
backcut is higher than the undercut. High backcuts run 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the risk of cutting off the hinge, actually increasing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the danger of kickback (Ex. 5&hyph;52).

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Other commenters said that backcuts above the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
horizontal cut were not as critical when using the Humboldt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undercutting method (Ex. 5&hyph;42, 9&hyph;15). They said that when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the slanting cut of the undercut is angled downward, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tree is more likely to fall in the intended direction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without kicking back. However, one of these commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
admitted that placing the backcut at the same level as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
horizontal cut when using the Humboldt undercut method 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sacrificed safety for quality control: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Quality control concerns with several companies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dictate that only Humboldt undercuts are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permissible with sawlog grade timber, so that wood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loss is minimized by taking the notch wood out of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the stump. Quality control often dictates that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there must be a flush surface on the end of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
log. To avoid having to make another cut to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
square up a log butt, fallers will attempt to make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their backcuts meet the horizontal face cut as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
closely as possible. By doing this, they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sacrifice the safety of the step that would have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been left on the stump to catch a possible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
backwards-moving tree butt, and depend only on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
downward-slanting face on the stump to hold the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tree (Ex. 9&hyph;15).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two commenters said the backcut requirement should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited to those situations when tree kickback is a problem, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which they contended was only on steep terrain, when felling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uphill or through trees (Ex. 9&hyph;1, 9&hyph;4). Other commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
said that believed that the standard should provide more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flexibility because variations frequently found on logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sites, such as lean of the tree and type of terrain, would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
make strict adherence to the regulation difficult (Ex. 5&hyph;19, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9&hyph;9, 9&hyph;22; Tr. OR 206&hyph;7, 395&hyph;96). These commenters said 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the cutting decisions should be left to the judgment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the experienced feller. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After reviewing the evidence in the record, OSHA has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decided that the proposed backcut provisions are necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to protect fellers from being hit or crushed by the tree 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they are felling. As discussed above, the record shows that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injuries and fatalities have occurred because of improper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cutting methods. The purpose of undercutting and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
backcutting trees is to prevent the tree from splitting, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
felling an unintended direction or kicking back into the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
feller. OSHA agrees with ANSI and the various State plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States that the proposed backcut provisions are necessary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protect employees against these hazards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA does not agree that backcutting should be limited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only to those situations when tree kickback can occur. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
record shows that hazards other than tree kickback 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessitate the backcut requirement. Without appropriately-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
placed backcuts, trees are more likely to split and/or fall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in an unintended direction. While OSHA agrees that it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more likely that this could happen when trees are felled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uphill, OSHA also believes the record shows that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possibility exists regardless of the terrain. According to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the WIR survey, the single largest cause of injuries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reported was being hit by a falling tree (Ex. 2&hyph;1). Almost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one-half of all injuries reported were due to employees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being hit or crushed by a falling tree. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the final rule OSHA has provided an exception to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
backcut requirement. The final rule allows the backcut to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be placed at or below the horizontal cut in tree pulling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations. Various State logging standards also provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this exception to the backcut requirement (e.g., Ex. 38K). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes this exception covers those situations in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which a special cutting technique may be required, such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by Federal agencies.

V. Summary and Explanation of the Final Standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The revision of the pulpwood logging standard was undertaken in response to the concern on the part of OSHA to the number
of fatalities and injuries that occur each year in the logging industry. The industry itself admits that logging is
a high hazard industry. As discussed above, the injury and fatality incidence rates in the logging industry are among
the highest industry incidence rates in the country. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OSHA pulpwood logging standard, 1910.266, addressed only the hazards that exist in the pulpwood logging industry.
However, examination of the descriptions of accidents and other information available to the Agency indicates that
the same hazards exist for employees performing logging operations regardless of the end use of the harvested trees.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters supported the need for a comprehensive logging standard (Ex. 5&hyph;6, 5&hyph;10, 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;18,
5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;22, 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;41, 5&hyph;42, 5&hyph;46, 5&hyph;49, 5&hyph;59, 5&hyph;61, 5&hyph;65,
5&hyph;69; Tr. W1 pg 21, 73, 202). For example, one commenter said that in Maine it has generally been acknowledged
that both products (pulpwood logs and logs used for other purposes) come off the same job (Ex. 5&hyph;46). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule provides protection for all loggers involved in timber harvesting, including loggers employed as
part of a mill operation, regardless of the end use of the forest products (saw logs, veneer bolts, pulpwood, chips,
etc.). This standard fills the current gap in coverage by providing a basic level of protection for all loggers. OSHA
has changed the title of 1910.266 from ``Pulpwood Logging'' to ``Logging Operations'' in order to reflect the wider
coverage of this revised standard. In addition, OSHA has added and/or modified various provisions of the pulpwood
logging standard to address more adequately the hazards faced in different aspects of logging operations. OSHA also
has updated equipment specification requirements in the revised standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Throughout the development of the revised standard, the Agency strove to promulgate a final rule that is effective,
and that is simple, concise, enforceable, and sustainable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Paragraph (a) Table of Contents
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA has added a table of contents to aid employers and other persons in using the revised standard. The table of contents
identifies the provisions that are included in the final standard and where specific requirements can be found. The
table of contents also is included because the final standard represents a significant reorganization of the elements
of the pulpwood logging standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The identification of the major paragraphs will, hopefully, aid persons in reading and understanding the requirements
of this final rule. In order to add the table of contents, each of the subsequent paragraphs had to be renumbered. The
paragraph references in the following discussion of the individual provisions of the standard are to the paragraphs
of the final rule, unless otherwise noted.

Paragraph (b) Scope and Application
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This paragraph defines the scope and application of this standard. The existing standard applied only to pulpwood
logging operations. That standard adopted, pursuant to section 6(a) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the
American National Standards Institute, ANSI 03.1&hyph;1971 Safety Standard for Pulpwood Logging (hereafter 1971
ANSI standard) (Ex 2&hyph;13). Included in the 1971 ANSI standard were requirements for important safety practices
along with provisions pertaining to personal protective equipment, first aid and stationary and mobile equipment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When ANSI revised the 1971 consensus standard in 1978, they expanded the scope of the standard to include all logging
operations. The revised ANSI standard adopted, virtually unchanged, many of the requirements of the 1971 pulpwood
logging standard, and applied those provisions to all logging operations throughout the nation. OSHA has taken a
similar approach in this rulemaking. In paragraph (b)(1), the Agency has expanded the scope of the pulpwood logging
standard, 1910.266, and to cover all logging operations regardless of the end use of the timber products.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of the final rule, OSHA makes clear that the standard applies to all types of logging
operations, regardless of the end use of the wood. Logging operations, as defined in paragraph (c) of the final rule,
include, but are not limited to, marking, felling, bucking, limbing, debarking, chipping, yarding, loading, unloading,
storing, transporting machines and equipment from one site to another, and other operations associated with felling
and moving trees and logs from the stump to the point of delivery. Many commenters supported the application of the
standard to all types of logging and all logging operations (Ex. 5&hyph;6, 5&hyph;10, 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;18, 5&hyph;21,
5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;42, 5&hyph;46, 5&hyph;48, 5&hyph;49, 5&hyph;54, 5&hyph;61, 5&hyph;65). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter said OSHA should exclude felling operations from the logging standard and cover only the movement of
felled trees from the stump to the mill (Ex. 17). This commenter said that felling activity is not the most hazardous
part of logging operations. OSHA believes the record does not support the commenters' recommendation. The record
clearly shows that felling activities are the most hazardous activities of the logging operation. According to the
WIR survey, more than one-half of all reported injuries involved various felling activities (Ex. 2&hyph;1). OSHA
believes that if the standard did not include hazards associated with felling the trees, that the majority of employees
in the logging industry would still be exposed to significant risk of injury and death. Therefore, in the final OSHA
has retained coverage of tree felling operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter raised the issue about whether establishments that hire independent contractors to perform various
logging activities are considered employers covered by this standard (Ex. 5&hyph;23). The courts have held in various
OSHA cases that when the contractor exercises control over the means and methods by which the independent contractor
performs the work, that the contractor is regarded as an employer for purposes of this rule.

job is performed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (b)(1) of the final rule, the Agency has excluded from coverage the construction or use of cable yarding
systems. Cable yarding, as defined in the final standard, is the movement of felled trees or logs from the area where
they are felled to the landing on a system composed of a cable suspended from spars and/or towers. The definition further
states that the trees or logs may be either dragged across the ground by the cable or carried while suspended from the
cable. One of the end towers is located in the area where the trees or logs are attached to the cable yarding system and
the other end is at the landing. Cable yarding systems are used primarily when the terrain is extremely rugged and the
felled trees and logs are otherwise inaccessible. Important elements of the safe use of a cable yarding system include
the selection and use of climbing devices to install the system, preparation of head and tail spars and intermediate
trees or towers, component sizing, system rigging and system usage. There are generally three types of cable yarding
systems, namely, high lead, skyline and slackline. In a high lead system, the mainline is threaded through the mainline
block (pulley) that is attached near the top of the spar to obtain a lift of the logs being yarded. A skyline system is
one in which the line (cable) is hung between two or more supports on which a carriage or block travels. A slackline system
is a form of skyline system where the skyline is spooled on a drum so that the line can be raised or lowered. In all three
systems, the spars are usually held in part and restrained against movement by the use of guylines that are anchored
to the ground or another tree. Trees and logs may be moved by a cable yarding system by dragging them along the ground
or while they are suspended from the system.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the preamble of the proposed rule, OSHA explained that this exemption was included due to the regional nature of
the use of cable logging systems. State plan States in the far west that have the most significant cable logging activity
have developed very detailed cable logging standards. Many commenters testified that the hazards of cable yarding
in those states have been adequately covered by the specific state standards (Ex. 2&hyph;18, 2&hyph;19, 2&hyph;20,
2&hyph;21, 2&hyph;23, 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;27, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;45, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92, 38J, 38K). However,
some commenters discussed the need for increased regulation of cable yarding operations on the national level because
they assert there is increasing use of cable yarding in non-western regions of the country where no State standards
exist (Ex 5&hyph;19, 5&hyph;20, 5&hyph;36). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful consideration of the comments, OSHA has decided to retain the exclusion for cable yarding operations
in this final rule for several reasons. First, the State logging standards that address cable yarding are detailed
specification standards that adequately address the unique hazards associated with the construction and use of
cable yarding in those particular States, that are all western States. For example, those standards deal with construction
of cable yarding systems on steep slopes that are predominently in those western States. Those State cable yarding
standards will not be affected by the Federal logging standard. Second, there is no evidence in this rulemaking record
that those standards are not addressing particular hazards associated with cable yarding in those States. Third,
OSHA agrees with the APA that the prevalent use of cable yarding is in those States that have their own standards that
include requirements for cable yarding. None of the commenters representing non-western logging establishments
indicated that cable yarding is being performed in their area or by their member companies. Fourth, OSHA believes
there is not sufficient information and data in the record regarding cable yarding activities in non-western States
to determine at this point whether the various cable yarding regulations of the western States would be appropriate
to apply nationwide. For example, logging in western States is usually clear cut logging while selective cutting
is more prominent in non-western states (Ex. 2&hyph;1). Other logging conditions vary across regions, such as tree
size and type, weather, and terrain. For example, logging operations in western States are three times more likely
to be on steep slopes, where skidding may be impossible (Ex. 2&hyph;1). OSHA believes that these differences might
affect what would constitute appropriate cable yarding rules for non-western States. Therefore, OSHA believes
this issue requires further study before the Agency promulgates a national cable yarding standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, OSHA emphasizes that the exclusion of cable yarding is only for the construction and use of the cable yarding
system itself. Other parts of the logging operation taking place where cable yarding systems are present will be covered
by this standard. Just as this standard extends the pulpwood logging standard to cover the same hazards experienced
elsewhere in the logging industry, OSHA believes that these same hazards need to be covered by this standard when cable
yarding operations are being performed. For example, the hazards for loggers felling trees exist regardless of how
the trees or logs are moved about the work site. To this end, the Agency has included in the final standard the felling
of the trees and the other operations that are conducted in conjunction with the use of a cable yarding system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should also be noted that the use of yarding machines with winches for playing out and retrieving cable is not considered
cable yarding for the purposes of this standard. Therefore, this operation is covered by this final logging standard.
In this type of log retrieval, a yarding machine plays out cable, to which is attached a choker sling that is secured
to a tree or log. Once the sling is attached to the log, the cable is wound onto the drum and the tree or log is then yarded
by skidding while attached to and supported by the cable on the winch. This system of yarding is oftentimes used when
logging is being conducted along a roadway or other area where access to the area where the tree is felled is not practical
and the area where the yarder (skidder) is operating is on the roadway or in an accessible area.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At paragraph (b)(3) of the final rule OSHA emphasizes that this standard is not a totally ``vertical'' standard for
logging operations. That is, the requirements of this final rule are to be supplemented by other applicable requirements
found elsewhere in part 1910. When there is a corresponding provision elsewhere in part 1910 that addresses the same
hazard or condition of work as a provision of the logging standard, the more specific logging provision takes precedence
for logging operations. By contrast, when hazardous working conditions are not addressed or covered by the logging
standard, the other requirements of part 1910 apply. For example, employers in the logging industry must provide
employees protection against occupational noise exposure by meeting the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.95. Employers
in this industry must also comply with the permissible exposure limit for wood dust specified in 29 CFR 1910.1000 and
meet the field sanitation requirements of 29 CFR 1910.28. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters raised the issue about what standards apply to the construction of roads and trails (Ex. 5&hyph;16,
5&hyph;44, and 5&hyph;63). These commenters said there was confusion about whether the entire part 1926 would be
applied to logging operations. Construction activities such as the building of roads and trails are not logging operations,
therefore they are covered by applicable construction standards and not the logging standard. As such, the use and
maintenance of the equipment to perform the construction of those roads and trails, such as graders, scrapers, front-end
loaders, and bulldozers, are covered by the construction standards. In addition, the building of roads and trails
to reach logging sites is not a logging operation, but is a construction activity that is carried out preparatory to
the logging activity. Therefore, in this final standard OSHA has removed references to road building construction
activities. Road building in conjunction with the establishment of a logging activity is no different than road building
to gain access to any other operation and is covered in the general construction standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the felling of trees in preparation for the construction activities, such as the building of roads, is considered
to be a logging operation. To the extent that any employee is performing a logging operation in preparation for construction
activities, the employee is performing general industry work, and the requirements of this standard as well as other
applicable sections of part 1910, apply in order to safely fell those trees. For example, if trees are felled to prepare
for road construction, the requirements in this final rule and other sections of part 1910 apply. This reasoning also
applies to felling of trees in preparation for agricultural activities (e.g., felling trees to prepare land for crops).
Felling of those trees is general industry work and the requirements of this standard as well as other applicable sections
of part 1910 apply. To this end, OSHA has specifically referenced the applicability of the final logging standard
in 29 CFR Part 1928 to felling of trees in preparation of agricultural activities.

Paragraph (c) Definitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In paragraph (c), OSHA is adopting a number of definitions to clarify the meaning, intent and purpose of certain terms
contained in this standard. Several definitions contained in the pulpwood logging rule were deleted from the proposed
rule because the terms were no longer used in the regulatory text. In addition, 17 new definitions were added to the
proposal. In the final rule OSHA has added and changed several definitions to better reflect the intent of the Agency
and to aid interested persons in understanding the requirements of this standard. In addition, in the final rule OSHA
has deleted several proposed definitions. Many of these terms involved cable yarding and road construction activities,
that are not covered by this final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Cable yarding'' is defined in this final rule as the movement of felled trees or logs from the area where they are felled
to a landing by attaching them to a suspended cable system. The supports for the cable that carries or supports the trees
or logs are called head and tail spars. Spars may be fashioned from standing trees or from metal towers (commonly called
metal spars). There may be additional intermediate spars if the cable run is of sufficient length to require intermediate
support. OSHA has specifically defined ``cable yarding'' in the final rule to aid persons in understanding the scope
of the exclusion from the standard for this particular type of logging operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Danger tree'' is defined in the final rule as any standing tree that presents a hazard to an employee due to conditions
such as, but not limited to, deterioration or physical damage to the root system, trunk, stem or limbs, and the direction
and lean of the tree. The tree may be dead or alive. This term was not contained in the proposed standard. Instead, the
related term ``snag'' was included and defined as any dead tree or portion thereof remaining standing. Also, the term
``widow maker'' was included in the proposed rule and defined as an overhanging limb or section of tree that could become
dislodged and drop to the ground. Several commenters said this term should replace the use of ``snag'' in the proposed
rule because the definition of snag implies that all dead trees are dangerous (Ex. 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;50, 5&hyph;64,
17). Rep. Jolene Unsoeld, from the State of Washington, said that not all snags were dangerous to employees and many
were essential to the health of the wildlife community (Ex. 17). In this final rule, OSHA has decided to use the term
``danger tree,'' a term that is used in the State of Washington logging standard that is more inclusive of the various
conditions that could cause a tree to be dangerous (Ex. 2&hyph;22). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Designated person'' is defined in the final rule as an employee who has the requisite knowledge, training and experience
to perform specific duties. This definition is a close parallel to the definition of the term used in consensus standards
dealing with material handling equipment, such as the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, ASME B30.5&hyph;1989
with Addenda, ``Safety Standard for Mobile Cranes'' (Ex. 38DD and EE). In the ASME standard, a designated person is
defined as an employee who is selected or assigned by the employer as being competent to perform specific duties. In
this final rule, the Agency has amended that definition to indicate that the employee needs to have the knowledge,
training and experience to perform that job or duty for which he/she is designated. The possession of those attributes
is not a discretionary decision on the part of the employer but a mandatory prerequisite that the employee must possess.
Knowledge and competency are normally achieved through training or experience or a combination of those activities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this final rule a signal person, an explosive handler and user, a machine operator, a trainer, and a supervisor of
new and newly-trained employees must be designated persons. In these cases, the Agency recognizes that each of those
individuals must have knowledge, experience, and training to competently perform those tasks. For example, a signal
person needs to know the various signals to use when indicating that a particular operation or movement is to be made.
The signal person also must know and understand how the task is to be performed and the role of his signals in completing
the task safely.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
``Domino felling'' is defined in the final rule as the partial cutting of several trees that are left standing and then
pushed over with a pusher tree. Domino felling is a dangerous practice that is prohibited by the final standard. When
one tree falls into or against another tree, the direction of fall of each tree may be altered to the point that either
tree may fall in an unexpected, and oftentimes, dangerous location. Whenever one tree is being felled and it strikes
another tree, the base of the tree being felled can kick back, striking the feller who has not moved away sufficiently
from the tree being felled. Additionally, one tree falling into another tree can result in the initial tree becoming
lodged in the second tree, thereby making it necessary for an employee to remove the lodged tree. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Health care provider'' is defined in this final rule as a health care practitioner operating within the scope of
his/her license, certificate, registration or legally authorized practice. As used in this standard, health care
providers are practitioners whose authorization qualifies them to approve first-aid kits that are to be used in the
logging industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Log'' has been defined in the final rule as a segment sawed or split from a felled tree. This term replaces the terms
section, log, bolt and tree length, that were all used in the pulpwood logging standard and the proposed standard.
The usual practice in the harvesting of large and/or tall trees is to cut them into shorter, more manageable lengths
before they are yarded so that they may be more easily handled and transported. In some cases, extremely large diameter
trees may be split lengthwise so that they can be handled and transported to the mill for further processing. Although
the practice of splitting a very large tree is not as common, the Agency has included a log as any section of tree, whether
that section has been cut or split from a tree. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Logging operations'' is defined in the final standard as operations associated with felling and moving trees and
logs from the stump to the point of delivery, such as, but not limited to, marking, felling, bucking, limbing, debarking,
chipping, yarding, loading, unloading, storing, and transporting machines, equipment and personnel from one site
to another. The proposed rule did not define logging operations. OSHA has included this definition in the final rule
to emphasize that this standard covers those operations involving the felling and moving of felled trees, as opposed
to other operations, such as road building that are preparatory to rather than part of logging operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Machine'' is defined in the final standard as a piece of equipment having a self contained powerplant that is operated
off-road and is used for the movement of materials. Machines include tractors, skidders, front-end loaders, scrapers,
graders, bulldozers, swing yarders, log stackers and mechanical felling devices, such as tree shears and feller-bunchers.
In the pulpwood logging and proposed standards, terms such as ``machine'' and ``equipment'' were used interchangeably
to describe a piece of equipment that is intended to be operated off-road and is used primarily for the movement of material.
Some commenters said they were confused about whether ``vehicles'' were included within the term ``mobile equipment,''
that had been broadly defined as the kind of equipment which includes mobility as part of its work function. Because
of the potential for confusion regarding the intention of the Agency in proposing requirements for off-road versus
on-road equipment, the Agency has defined both the terms ``machine'' and ``vehicle.'' The intent of the Agency in
including these terms is to distinguish between machines, whose primary area of operation is off-road and are primarily
material movers, and vehicles that include personnel and material conveyances operated on highways as well as off-road.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The operators of many vehicles (primarily trucks, tractor/trailers and buses) require special licenses or endorsements
to qualify as an operator of that type vehicle. In contrast, machine operators usually do not have to possess a special
license. Therefore, OSHA is defining and imposing different logging-related requirements for the operation of
machines and vehicles. The use of the term ``machine'' as used in this standard should not be confused with the use of
that term elsewhere in these general industry standards.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
``Rated capacity'' is defined in the final rule as the maximum load that a piece of material handling equipment can
safely lift and move. This is a term that is commonly used when describing the capability of a piece of material handling
equipment. The rated capacity of a piece of material handling equipment is initially determined by the manufacturer
and documented in the operators manual and on the equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Serviceable condition'' is defined in this final rule as that quality of a tool, machine, vehicle, or other device
to operate as it was intended by the manufacturer to operate. OSHA believes that there are many conditions that can
exist with a piece of equipment that would make it unserviceable, as well as other conditions that would not similarly
qualify. For example, seat covering material on a tractor that has become cracked, although uncomfortable, would
not normally qualify as a condition that would make the machine unserviceable. On the other hand, worn brakes or a leak
in the brake system would definitely make a machine or vehicle unserviceable. Additionally, cracked or broken gauges
and defective or leaking fuel systems are other conditions that would render a machine or vehicle unserviceable.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of personal protective equipment, head protection that has a crack that would compromise the ability of
the hard hat to absorb further impact without injuring the employee is an example of an unserviceable condition. On
the other hand, a small dent in a hard hat would not necessarily render the head protection unserviceable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Tie down'' is defined in the final rule as an assemblage of binder and strapping (either chain, cable, steel strips
or fiber webbing) that is used to secure a load to the bed of a transport vehicle. In the proposed rule, OSHA used the term
``binder'' to indicate the assembly that is used to secure a load to a vehicle during transport of that load. As pointed
out by two commenters (Ex. 5&hyph;7; Tr. OR 20), a binder is a component of a tie down and is the ratchet assembly that
is used to secure and tighten the strapping of the tie down. In this final rule, the Agency has corrected the definition.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Vehicle'' is defined as a personnel conveyance and/or material handling equipment. Included are cars, buses,
trucks, trailers and semi-trailers. Although vehicles normally operate on public roads, their use is not limited
to that environment. Any of these pieces of equipment may operate not only on public roads, but may also be used to transport
personnel or materials off-road. For example, when a logging truck or tractor/trailer is moving a load of trees or
logs, the vehicle may have to traverse not only the logging trails or roads, but may have to operate on the public thoroughfares
to deliver its load to the mill or other off-loading point. This final rule covers the logging operation from the site
of the felling of the trees to the point of delivery of the trees or logs.

Paragraph (d) General Requirements

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Included in the general requirements paragraph of the final rule are requirements for personal protective equipment,
seat belts, first aid, fire extinguishers, environmental conditions, work areas, signaling and signal equipment,
overhead electric lines, flammable and combustible liquids and explosives and blasting agents.

Personal Protective Equipment

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (d)(1) contain requirements for personal protective equipment (PPE), including its use and maintenance,
and the inspection of PPE before its use during a workshift. Paragraph (d)(1) also specifies when employees must use
gloves, leg protection, logging boots, head protection, and eye and face protection. This final rule, however, does
not contain requirements for other types of personal protective equipment that are covered by other general industry
requirements contained elsewhere in part 1910 (i.e., hearing protection and respiratory protection). Paragraph
(b)(3) already makes clear that other requirements contained in part 1910 automatically apply when the logging standard
has not addressed a particular hazard or working condition. Therefore, since part 1910 already require the use and
maintenance of PPE, OSHA has included in paragraph (d)(1) only those items of personal protective equipment that
are not contained elsewhere in that part or that are in some way different from the requirements contained in elsewhere
in part 1910. As such, references to respiratory protection in subpart I of part 1910 and hearing protection at &sect;1910.95
have been deleted from this final rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (d)(1)(i) of the final rule requires that the employer assure that all PPE is maintained in a serviceable
condition. This employer responsibility applies whether the PPE is provided by the employer or provided by the employee.
One commenter recommended that OSHA include this provision in the final rule (Tr. W2 195). This provision parallels
the maintenance requirements of the general industry PPE standards. Specifically, 1910.132(b) also requires that
when employees are allowed to provide their own PPE, the employer is still responsible for assuring its proper maintenance.
OSHA has recognized that whether or not the employer pays for particular types of PPE that must be worn in the workplace,
the employer is responsible for assuring that required PPE is adequately protecting employees from workplace hazards.
The only way for the employer to assure that PPE adequately protects employees from workplace hazards is to inspect
the PPE and maintain it in the condition that it was intended by the manufacturer. The final rule, in paragraphs (d)(1)(i)
(PPE maintenance) and (ii) (PPE inspection), imposes such responsibilities directly on the employer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to assure that all PPE is maintained in a serviceable condition, paragraph (d)(1)(ii) requires that the employer
assure that all PPE be inspected before initial use during each workshift. This inspection will assist employers
in identifying whether any PPE is not functioning properly so that unserviceable equipment can be repaired or replaced.
This paragraph also requires that before work is commenced, the employer must repair defects or damage, or replace
the PPE. The Agency considers defects and damage to be conditions that detract from the ability of the product to perform
its intended function. For example, worn cuffs on leg protection that do not compromise the ability of the leg protection
to resist chain-saw cuts, is not a defect or damage within the meaning of this standard. However, a cut of the leg protection
and loss of the fibrous material that is used to resist the chain saw would definitely be a defect or damage. When there
is a defect or damage, the PPE must be repaired so that the condition no longer affects the serviceability of the item
or the item must be replaced before work commences.

Discussed below are the specific PPE requirements of the final rule. OSHA notes that each of the requirements of paragraphs
(d)(1)(iv) through (vii) require that the employer assures that the employee wears PPE meeting the requirement of
the final rule. It is the responsibility of the employer to assure that serviceable PPE is available and worn by employees
when required by the final rule. As discussed above in the Major Issues section, with the exception of logging boots,
these specific PPE requirements impose on the employer the obligation to provide such PPE at no cost to the employee.

Gloves

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this final rule requires that the employer provide, at no cost to the employee, and assure
that each employee handling wire rope wears cotton gloves or other equivalent hand protection. In the proposed rule,
OSHA specified that the employer provide hand protection consisting of suitable heavy-duty puncture-resistant
gloves when employees were working with wire rope. Several State logging standards also require the use of gloves
for employees working with wire rope (Ex. 2&hyph;18, 2&hyph;19, 2&hyph;20, 2&hyph;22, 2&hyph;23, 38K). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA received many comments regarding the proposed requirement (Ex. 5&hyph;7, 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;20, 5&hyph;27,
5&hyph;29, 5&hyph;30, 5&hyph;32, 5&hyph;35, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;43, 5&hyph;44, 5&hyph;45, 5&hyph;51, 5&hyph;54,
5&hyph;55, 5&hyph;62, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92; Tr. OR 104). Many commenters objected to the requiring the use
of puncture resistant gloves, such as leather gloves, for logging operations. First, commenters argued that there
are no gloves that are puncture resistant in all circumstances (Ex. 5&hyph;54; Tr. OR 104). They argued that wire rope
can puncture even leather gloves. Second, several commenters indicated that cotton gloves have become the industry
standard and that their experience had shown that medium weight cotton gloves are considered safer than leather gloves
in logging operations when punctures can occur. According to these commenters, cotton gloves give the logger a better
feel of jaggers (broken wires in a wire rope) when they penetrate so the logger is able to quickly let go of the wire rope
(Ex. 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92). They added that break-away gloves are imperative when the wire rope
travels at high speed and reaction time is critical (Ex. 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92). They said that cotton gloves,
but not leather gloves, will tear away from the hand when caught by a jagger rather than forcibly pulling the hand along
with the jagger, causing the employee to fall and possibly into the path of the log (Ex. 5&hyph;7, 5&hyph;74 through
5&hyph;92). These commenters argued that pulling of the hand and glove could make a minor hand injury more serious
such as making a small puncture wound a tear or laceration of the skin (Ex. 5&hyph;29). Third, one commenter indicated
that cotton gloves provide adequate protection because a review of their recordable accidents since 1982 indicated
that no employee wearing cotton gloves while handling wire rope had suffered an injury requiring medical attention
(Ex. 5&hyph;45). Fourth, these commenters said leather gloves are generally considered hazardous for logging operations
because they do not have good gripping ability on cable when wet (Ex. 5&hyph;7, 5&hyph;20, 5&hyph;43, 5&hyph;46).
These commenters asserted that cotton gloves provided better gripping ability in the same circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fifth, commenters argued that the required gloves must be applicable and efficient for a wide range of logging activities.
One commenter pointed out that employees who use saws also work with wire rope, and very few will take the time to change
gloves between each operation (Ex. 5&hyph;35). For these reasons, OSHA has, in this final rule, changed the requirement
for the use of hand protection to specify that cotton gloves or other equivalent hand protection must be worn when handling
wire rope. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Leg protection.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 At paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the employer provide, at no cost to the employee,
and assure that each employee who operates a chain saw wears leg protection. This paragraph requires that the leg protection
be comprised of ballistic nylon or other material that the employer demonstrates provides equivalent protection.
In addition, this paragraph requires that the leg protection cover the full length of the thigh to the top of the boot
on each leg. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The pulpwood logging standard did not have a requirement for the use of chaps or other leg protection. The proposed
rule would have required that chain-saw operators wear ballistic nylon or equivalent protection covering each leg
from upper thigh to boot top or shoe top. Both the State of Washington and the State of Oregon logging standards require
the use of leg protection by chain-saw operators (Ex. 2&hyph;22, 38K).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The need for and the use of leg protection was one of the issues raised in the hearing notice and has been discussed above
in the Major Issues section. The evidence in the record, as discussed above, strongly supports the need for a requirement
for leg protection for each chain saw operator in order to protect that operator against being injured by contact with
a moving saw chain. OSHA points out that the requirement for using leg protection applies to each employee who operates
any chain saw at any time on the job. This requirement includes the employee who is a regular chain saw operator as well
as the employee who occasionally uses a chain saw. Some commenters emphasized the need for any employee who uses a chain
saw, even occasionally, to wear leg protection (Tr. W1 193, W2 61, 115). Other commenters said OSHA should provide
an exception for employees who operate chains saws only occasionally (Ex. 5&hyph;20, 5&hyph;59). The Agency believes
that an employee who operates a chain saw for any duration needs leg protection. OSHA also notes that there were no comments
received saying leg protection was too burdensome for infrequent operators or for short duration use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this paragraph, OSHA also has included an exception to the leg protection requirement for employees working from
bucket trucks and, in some instances, for climbers. OSHA has allowed the exception for those working in bucket trucks,
because the bucket work platform provides the necessary protection for these chain saw operators. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to climbers, OSHA has retained an exception in the final rule for certain situations. Climbers are not
required to wear leg protection when the employer demonstrates that a greater hazard is posed by wearing leg protection
in the particular situation. As the final rule makes clear, this is not a blanket exception for climbers. The employer
must evaluate the particular situation to determine whether there is a greater risk to the climber by wearing leg protection.
OSHA points out that the employer will bear the burden of demonstrating that leg protection poses a greater hazard
for the climber. OSHA received one comment that said leg protection should not be required because it was a hindrance
during tree climbing (Ex. 5&hyph;7). The fact that leg protection may be a ``hindrance'' is not in itself a showing
that leg protection poses a greater danger. When the hindrance is just that climbing goes more slowly when leg protection
is worn, the employer has not made the requisite showing that leg protection poses greater safety hazards. However,
when the employer shows that in wet conditions leg protection would substantially increase the likelihood of falling,
it may be appropriate in that case for the climber to refrain from using leg protection. In such cases, OSHA believes
that alternative methods for protecting the legs, such as light and pliable pads sewn into work pants, should be used
whenever feasible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Foot protection. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At paragraph (d)(1)(v) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the employer assure that each employee wear foot protection,
such as heavy duty logging boots. This provision requires that the foot protection be waterproof or water repellant,
cover and provide support for the ankle, and protect the employee against chain-saw penetration. This paragraph
allows employees to wear sharp, calk-soled boots, or other slip-resistant boots, when the employer demonstrates
that they are necessary for the job, terrain, timber type, or weather conditions. However, this alternative foot
protection must otherwise meet the requirements of this paragraph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA notes that when the logging boot itself does not provide protection from penetration by a chain saw, the employee
must use some additional foot protection, such as a foot cover, to provide that necessary protection. Information
in the record indicates such devices are commercially available in the logging industry, therefore, this provision
should not prove burdensome (Ex. 5&hyph;14).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Both the proposed and pulpwood logging standards contained provisions requiring that safety boots or shoes (excluding
low cut shoes) meet ANSI Safety Standards for Men's Safety-Toe Footwear. The proposal also would have allowed heavy
duty logging style boots with lug or calk soles to be worn when they are appropriate for the job, the terrain, the timber
type and weather conditions. Several State logging standards also require that employees wear logging boots (Ex.
2&hyph;17, 2&hyph;19, 2&hyph;20, 2&hyph;22, 2&hyph;23, 38K). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While there was considerable comment on the proposed safety boot requirement, commenters generally supported the
need for a safety boot provision (Ex. 5&hyph;11, 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;19, 5&hyph;24, 5&hyph;27, 5&hyph;28, 5&hyph;29,
5&hyph;33, 5&hyph;43, 5&hyph;50, 5&hyph;51, 5&hyph;54, 5&hyph;55, 5&hyph;63, 5&hyph;67, Tr. W1 63, 110, W2 115,
139). OSHA received the most comment on the issue of who must provide and pay for the safety boots. That issue has been
discussed at length above in the Major Issues section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA also received considerable comment opposing the incorporation of the ANSI Z41.1 standard on safety shoes (Tr.
W1 147&hyph;148). Commenters from cold climate areas, such as Alaska, northern Washington, Idaho and Montana, opposed
the proposed requirement because they contended that the steel toes transmit the warmth produced by their feet, thereby
encouraging the onset of frostbite. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For several reasons, OSHA has used performance criteria rather than incorporating by reference any foot protection
standard. First, the ANSI standard permits low-cut shoes that do not cover the ankle or provide ankle support. Second,
the ANSI foot protection standard is a testing rule for steel toes of safety shoes. While falling objects may pose a
hazard for logging employees, the greater hazard is penetration of the boot by a chain saw. The ANSI standard does not
address this hazard and it does not provide adequate protection to the entire foot, which is necessary. In addition,
as discussed above, steel-toed boots may cause problems for loggers working in extreme cold. OSHA received comment
about efforts to develop, manufacture and market protective footwear with fiberglass rather than steel toes, but
there is no accepted standard yet. Third, the ANSI standard does not address hazards that are unique to the logging
industry, such as wet conditions and penetration of the boot by a chain saw. Fourth, there is no evidence in the record
of any other consensus standard regarding logging boots. OSHA is aware of efforts by various organizations and associations,
in conjunction with the American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM), to develop test standards for personal
protective equipment that is intended to apply directly to loggers and the logging industry. These standards would
be similar to the various Canadian PPE standards developed by the Safety and Engineering Program Laboratory Services
(IRRST) (Ex. 5&hyph;72). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Instead, the Agency has specified that logging boots that meet certain performance criteria must be worn by each employee.
OSHA has reviewed the rulemaking record and determined some of the most important performance characteristics that
are needed in order to deal with particular hazards that are present in logging operations (e.g., steep and uneven
terrain, wet and cold weather, chain-saw kickback). For example, two hearing participants testified that logging
boots must provide ankle support for the employee (Tr. W1 147, OR 222). Coverage and support of the ankle is necessary
to protect against lacerations and to prevent ankle injury when navigating the rugged terrain that characterizes
much of the logging environment. One commenter also said that logging boots must be waterproof or water repellent
so that the logger would not be exposed to getting trench foot or immersion foot (Tr. W1 147). Finally, commenters said
logging boots must provide protection against penetration by a chain saw if contact is made with the boot (Tr. W1 148,
195, W2 139). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters also supported the proposed provision allowing lug or calk-soled boots to be used (Ex. 5&hyph;19,
5&hyph;28, 5&hyph;29). These commenters said that working conditions varied too greatly to require the use of one
type of boot sole for all logging regions. For example, one commenter said that calk boots are considered essential
for safe and secure walking on steep western forest terrain (Ex. 5&hyph;28). Another commenter stated that there
are situations in the south where smooth soled boots are adequate (Ex. 5&hyph;29). In addition, this commenter said
that there are conditions when calk boots might pose a greater danger, such as a machine operator who is continuously
mounting and dismounting a machine via steel platform steps where the calk boots could result in slipping or falling.
As a result, this commenter said that calk and sharp-soled boots should be limited to those situations when the type
of logging operation, terrain, timber size or weather conditions make their use appropriate. The U.S. Department
of the Interior also commented that calk-soled boots may contribute to certain types of logging injuries, such as
knee injuries (Ex. 5&hyph;50). Based on these comments, OSHA specifically allows sharp, calk-soled boots or other
slip-resistant type boots to be worn, provided the employer can demonstrate such boots are needed for the employee's
job, the terrain, the timber type or the weather conditions.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order for the employer to demonstrate that such footwear is necessary, the employer must prove that three conditions
are met: (1) that the footwear is appropriate for use in the work environment; (2) the employee's duties require him/her
to work where the footwear is needed; and (3) that the use of the alternative footwear does not make the work less safe.
For example, if the area where the logging is being done is moist to wet and has a dense leaf cover, the use of calk-soled
boots (boots with spiked soles) would provide the logger with additional traction when walking and working on that
ground cover. On the other hand, such footwear is not appropriate when a machine operator spends little time working
on the ground (even if the same conditions as described above prevail) since spikes make frequent mounting and demounting
of the machine more hazardous. OSHA recognizes that slips, trips and falls are a major source of injury in the logging
industry, accounting for one third of the injuries to loggers (Ex. 2&hyph;1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA is also requiring that when an employee wears calk-soled logging boots, the other foot protection requirements
of this paragraph must also be met. OSHA is aware that most calk-soled boots do not have steel-toes or other devices
that prevent penetration by a chain saw. However, OSHA is also aware that calk-soled boots are worn primarily by fellers
and buckers operating chain saws on steep terrain. Evidence in the record indicates that a vast majority of loggers
in western States, where the terrain is steep, wear calk-soled boots (Ex. 2&hyph;1). However, even in those States,
almost 20 percent of all injuries reported in the WIR survey involved chain saws. The vast majority of these injuries
happened when the logger was struck by the chain saw. Therefore, OSHA believes that it is necessary that even when an
employee wears calk-soled boots, he must also have foot protection providing protection against chain-saw penetration.
As stated above, when the boot itself does not provide that protection, the employee must wear some other device that
will provide the needed protection. The record shows there are such devices currently available on the market, therefore,
OSHA does not believe this additional requirement will be unduly burdensome (Ex. 5&hyph;14). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Head protection. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At paragraph (d)(1)(vi) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring each employee who is at risk of injury from falling or flying
objects to wear head protection. The head protection must meet the requirements of newly-revised subpart I of part
1910. Both the pulpwood logging standard and the proposed standard contained head protection requirements. The
pulpwood logging standard had identified the performance criteria that head protection was required to meet, but
did not specifically require employees to wear it. The proposed standard added that requirement and updated the performance
criteria for the required head protection. Several State logging standards also require that employees wear head
protection (Ex. 2&hyph;18, 2&hyph;19, 2&hyph;20, 2&hyph;22, 2&hyph;23, 38K). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA did not receive any comments opposing the required use of head protection and has retained the proposed provision
in the final standard. OSHA believes it is important to stress that in the logging industry head protection is necessary
to protect employees not only from falling objects, but also from flying objects. According to the WIR survey, 14 percent
of all injuries reported were to the head (Ex. 2&hyph;1). OSHA believes this hazard is present especially for fellers,
chain saw operators and persons performing chipping operations, however, there are other logging operations where
the potential for head injury also exists. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Eye and face protection. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (d)(1)(vii) of the final rule requires that each employee who works in an area where there is a potential
for injury due to falling or flying object shall wear eye and face protection meeting the requirements of subpart I
of part 1910. This provision permits logger-type mesh screen to be worn when the employer demonstrates it provides
equivalent protection. The proposed rule also contained these provisions. The 1978 ANSI standard contained a similar
requirement. Eye and face protection is also required by several State logging standards (Ex. 2&hyph;18, 2&hyph;19,
2&hyph;22, 2&hyph;23, 38K). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters said OSHA should require eye protection to be worn only in certain situations (Ex. 5&hyph;43 and 5&hyph;64).
One commenter stated:

This is a good rule for some logging activities, such as felling, bucking, splicing, etc.; however, we do not feel that
this is necessary for choker setting and many machine operators, such as yarder, loader, feller-bunchers (Ex. 5&hyph;64).

After reviewing the evidence in the record, OSHA believes that a requirement mandating eye and face protection is
necessary. According to the WIR survey, 13 percent of all injuries reported involved the eyes and face (Ex. 2&hyph;1).
In the final rule, OSHA is requiring only that such protection be worn whenever there is the potential for head injury
due to falling or flying objects. OSHA agrees with the commenters that the potential for eye and face injury is present
especially for fellers, buckers and chippers, however, there are other logging operations in which the potential
for this type of injury also exists. In any logging operations when there is no danger of being struck by falling or flying
objects, eye protection is not required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Employers, under the PPE standard, will have to conduct a hazard assessment to determine when and where those hazards
may exist in the logging workplace. In some cases, the presence of the hazard will be obvious (e.g., fellers and buckers).
In other cases, working conditions may be such that there is no potential for injury (e.g., yarder operator working
inside an enclosed cab). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As with the head protection provision, OSHA has retained the eye and face protection provision to alert the industry
that falling objects, in addition to flying objects, are a hazard for employees in the logging industry.

First-Aid Kits

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At paragraph (d)(2) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that employers provide first-aid kits. The proposed standard
contained this provision. First aid kits are also required by every State Plan State logging standard. OSHA did not
receive any comments opposing this requirement in general. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(2)(i) of the final rule requires that first-aid kits be at each work site when felling is being conducted,
at each landing and on each employee transport vehicle. The proposed rule stated that first-aid kits be provided ``at
the work site.'' Several commenters said that OSHA should define the term ``work site'' (Ex. 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;53,
5&hyph;55, 5&hyph;63) in the final rule. They also said that having kits available at the landing should provide adequate
protection. However, another commenter said chain-saw operators working away from the landing need first-aid kits
and should each be required to carry a small first-aid kit that contains supplies to stop bleeding (Ex. 5&hyph;28).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the final rule, OSHA has clarified its intention regarding having first-aid kits at each work site. First, the records
shows that first-aid kits are necessary at each work site when felling is being conducted and not just at landings.
According to the WIR survey, more than one-half of all injuries occurred at the cutting site, while only one-fifth
of the injuries were at landings (Ex. 2&hyph;1). OSHA believes that immediate assistance must be provided for injured
cutters. As discussed above in the Major Issues section, many logging establishments have central offices, but their
crews are performing operations miles from that central location. OSHA has received testimony that cutting crews
are often spread out and in remote locations (Ex. 5&hyph;34; Tr. OR 21). These commenters said crews are often located
more than one-half hour away from a central office or spread across five square miles. First-aid kits that require
that much time to access are of limited value to an injured employee. When an injury is severe, the lack of immediately
accessible first-aid materials and trained personnel could result in permanent disability or death. Therefore,
OSHA is requiring that first-aid kits be provided at each work site where trees are being felled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, OSHA is also requiring first-aid kits to be provided at each landing. As discussed above, one-fifth of all
injuries reported in the WIR survey occurred at landings (Ex. 2&hyph;1). First-aid kits at landings are also necessary
to provide assistance to other injured employees, such as those on skid trails. According to the WIR survey, nearly
one-fifth of employees injured were on skid trails. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, OSHA is retaining the requirement from the proposed rule that first-aid kits be provided on each crew vehicle.
The WIR survey indicates that employees are injured on employer-built roads while enroute to and from work sites (Ex.
2&hyph;1). One commenter stated that requiring first-aid kits on each employee transport vehicle could result in
several kits being at each work site (Ex. 5&hyph;35). Nothing in the standard prohibits an employer from using the
employee transport vehicle kits by a felling crew during the workshift, provided they are returned to the crew vehicle
when it is moved at the end of the workshift.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (d)(2)(i) of the final rule also requires that the employer, in determining the appropriate number and
contents of first-aid kits, to consider the degree of isolation of the work site, the number of employees at the work
site and the hazards reasonably anticipated at that work site. The further a crew is from a central landing, the more
crucial a first-aid kit is for that remote crew. For example, large and well-supplied first-aid kits are needed where
crews are so remotely located that rescue units (either vehicles or helicopters) cannot get to the injured person
or not get there quickly. When crews are very small and located close to central landings smaller kits may be adequate,
when supplemented by kits at central landing areas that contain a more comprehensive supply of first-aid materials.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraphs (d)(2) (ii), (iii) and (iv) all deal with the adequacy of the contents of first-aid kits. At paragraph (d)(2)(ii)
of the final rule, OSHA has specified that each first-aid kit must meet certain minimum content requirements. Those
minimum content requirements are delineated in mandatory Appendix A. OSHA received comments urging OSHA to specify
the contents needed for an ``adequately supplied'' first-aid kit (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;28, 5&hyph;50, 30). These
commenters also pointed out that several State logging standards specify minimum first-aid content requirements
(Ex. 2&hyph;18, 2&hyph;21, 2&hyph;22, 2&hyph;23, 38J, 38K). In addition, one commenter also provided a list of minimum
contents needed for logging first-aid kits. Based on these comments and OSHA's expert judgment, the items listed
in Appendix A are the type necessary for dealing with injured persons in remote areas of varying climatic conditions.
OSHA points out that the specified contents are minimally adequate for a small logging crew of two to three employees.
Where crews are larger, additional kits or kits with more supplies may be needed. In formulating this final rule, OSHA
included Appendix A (First-aid supplies) and Appendix B (First-aid training) to provide the employer with a definitive
means of determining the adequacy of the first-aid kits and the training that employees must receive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has deleted from the final paragraph the proposed requirement that first-aid kits include snake bite kits. OSHA
received several comments about this provision (Ex. 5&hyph;7, 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;29, 5&hyph;35, 5&hyph;42, 5&hyph;50,
5&hyph;51, 5&hyph;55, 5&hyph;67). One commenter said this requirement should be deleted since there were no poisonous
snakes in his area (Ex. 5&hyph;7). Other commenters said that some snake bite kits were not effective in treating bites
or that they are outmoded and can do more damage than good (Ex. 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;29, 5&hyph;35, 5&hyph;42, 5&hyph;50,
5&hyph;51, 5&hyph;55, 5&hyph;67). For example, NIOSH said that it is possible more serious injury will occur to a
person by improper use of a snake bite kit (Ex. 5&hyph;42). According to the Regional Snake Bite Control Center at the
University Medical Center in Cincinnati, OH, snake bite kits should not be used when medical treatment is available
within one hour of the bite (Ex. 5&hyph;42). OSHA has determined that, given the regional differences in the logging
industry, employers should be allowed to work with their health care provider to determine whether a snake bite kit
is necessary and what kind of kit would be of most assistance for loggers working in that area. One of the factors the
health care provider should consider is how far particular loggers are from medical facilities and trained medical
personnel.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (d)(2)(iii) requires a health care provider to review and approve annually the first-aid kits the employer
provides, both as to the adequacy of the kit's contents and the number of kits provided. OSHA has added this requirement
in the final rule for several reasons. First, 1910.151(b) already requires that first-aid kits be approved by consulting
physicians. OSHA is aware that health care providers in addition to physicians are qualified to approve first-aid
kits and OSHA wants to provide flexibility for employers in meeting this requirement. Second, 1910.151(b) only requires
initial approval of first-aid kits rather than periodic approval. However, OSHA believes that a periodic review
of first-aid kits is necessary and appropriate in the logging industry. This industry is one in which the workplace
is often not near medical personnel, infirmaries, clinics, or hospitals that are best able to treat logging injuries.
Therefore, it is important for a health care provider to assess the contents of first-aid kits to see that they contain
those supplies that will provide effective assistance for an injured worker. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Once the kits are reviewed and approved, paragraph (d)(2)(iv) requires the employer to maintain the first-aid kits
in accordance with the approval conditions. Employers have the duty to ensure that first-aid kits are adequately
supplied and replenished as necessary. In addition, the employer is responsible for assuring that kit contents are
usable, that is, there is no spoilage or damage due to weather conditions. For example, employers need to periodically
check first-aid supplies to ensure that materials are still in clean and sterile condition.

Seat Belts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At paragraph (d)(3) of the final standard, OSHA is requiring the provision of seat belts for the operator of any vehicle
or any machine equipped with ROPS or FOPS and the use of seat belts by the vehicle and machine operator and passengers.
The pulpwood logging standard required the provision of seat belts on mobile equipment, but did not require the use
of seat belts by operators and passengers. The proposed rule required both the provision and use of seat belts by tractor,
equipment and personnel transport operators. In addition, the proposed rule allowed an exception to using seat belts
when the employer had ``reasonable cause to believe that safety of the operator is jeopardized by wearing a seat belt.''
The 1978 ANSI logging standard required logging machines to be equipped with seat belts. All State logging standards
also require the use of seat belts by operators and passengers of machines and vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA received many comments on the use of seat belts (Ex. 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;19, 5&hyph;22, 5&hyph;35, 5&hyph;39,
5&hyph;45, 5&hyph;51, 5&hyph;54, Tr. W1 79, 113, 183, 213). The West Virginia Forestry Association recommended
expanding the seat belt requirement to require seat belts be installed and used in all personnel transport vehicles
because West Virginia did not have a state seat belt law (Ex. 5&hyph;4). Other commenters also recommended that OSHA
not permit any exceptions to the use of seat belts (Ex. 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;22, 5&hyph;27, Tr. W1 183, 213). One commenter
reasoned that any exception would invite widespread abuse and seriously weaken OSHA's field enforcement capability
(Ex. 5&hyph;22). However, other commenters said that seat belts should not be required because they would unduly
restrict operators, would result in greater injury if an object entered the operator area (i.e., ``jillpoke''),
and would be hazardous for employees operating machines on steep terrain (Ex. 5&hyph;35, 5&hyph;45; Tr. W1 79, 113,
OR 31&hyph;2, 83, 120, 181). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After reviewing the comments in the record and the available accident data, OSHA has decided in the final rule to eliminate
the seat belt exception for several reasons. First, the record shows that use of seat belts would save lives in the logging
industry (Ex. 4&hyph;129). A State of Washington study also reported 12 loggers killed in rollover accidents from
1977&hyph;83 (Ex. 4&hyph;129). All 12 of those employees were crushed by the machine when they were thrown from the
cab. This study concluded that all of those deaths might have been prevented if the employees involved had been wearing
seat belts because the ROPS and FOPS were still intact when the machine came to a rest. This study also concluded that
eliminating exemptions on seat belt use would save lives in the logging industry.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Second, the record does not support the view that the operator's risk of being injured by a jillpoke entering the cab
is greater than the risk of injury from not wearing seat belts. Of the 105 logging fatalities reported to OSHA between
1985 and 1990, only one was caused by a jillpoke (Ex. 4&hyph;65). On the other hand, 7 fatalities occurred during machine
rollover accidents when either the machine operator or a rider was thrown from the machine and crushed because he was
not wearing a seat belt. NIOSH said that 80 deaths occurred due to logging machine rollovers from 1980&hyph;85 (Ex.
5&hyph;42). The State of Washington study indicated that 12 loggers were killed in machine rollover accidents and
no machine operators were killed during that period because of jillpokes (Ex. 4&hyph;129). California OSHA also
testified that their experience has been that the jillpoke hazard is far outweighed by the hazard of rollovers (Ex.
9&hyph;12). They provided examples of logging accidents in which the employee would not have died or been injured
if he had been wearing a seat belt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, OSHA has dealt directly with the hazard of jillpokes in the final rule. The final rule requires that all operator
cabs be equipped with screening or other material that will prevent objects from penetrating the cab. This requirement
is expected to prevent jillpoke injuries, therefore the seat belt exception is not necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fourth, OSHA agrees with commenters that there should be no exception to the seat belt requirement for mobile machine
operators, especially those who operate on steep terrain. Mobile logging machines are operated on unlevel ground
and steep terrain where it is well-recognized that machine rollover and tipover is a primary danger. Seat belts will
restrain the operator in the cab and its protective structure rather than allowing the operator to try to jump free.
In most instances, when the operator tries to jump free he is pinned, crushed or hit by the machine, ROPS/FOPS or overhead
guard. Finally, OSHA notes that seat belts have been designed that keep operators restrained within the cab in the
event of a rollover or tipover, while at the same time providing them with maximum movement within the cab. One commenter
said these seat belts, which resemble carnival harnesses, have been designed by the Forest Engineering Research
Institute of Canada (Ex. 32). These seat belts would meet the requirements of this section while addressing the concerns
raised by the commenters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of the final rule requires that each employee fasten the seat belt securely and tightly so that
the employee is restrained in the vehicle or machine cab in the event of an accident. Evidence in this record (Ex. 5&hyph;35;
Tr. W2 190) indicates that employees frequently keep their seat belts loose in order to move in the cab more easily.
However, if the machine rolls over, the loose seat belt may not be effective in keeping the operator in the cab. In such
cases, the operator may be thrown from the cab and pinned or crushed by the machine because the seat belt was too loose
to keep the operator fully contained in the cab. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(3)(iv) of the final rule requires that machine seat belts meet the requirements of the Society of Automotive
Engineers standard (SAE J386 June 1985) for seat belts for construction machines. This incorporation by reference
of SAE J386 June 1985, has been approved by the Office of the Federal Register, in accordance with the requirements
of 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR Part 51. The final rule has been revised to reflect this approval and provides the requisite
information regarding access to the text of SAE J386, June 1985. This provision updates the proposed standard to incorporate
the latest SAE seat belt standard. There were no comments opposing this provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(3)(v) of the final rule requires employers to assure that seat belts are not removed from any vehicle
or machine. This paragraph also requires the employer to replace the missing seat belts if seat belts were installed
in the vehicle or machine at the time of manufacture and have subsequently been removed. OSHA is aware that seat belts
are removed from machines because operators do not like to wear them. OSHA is requiring the replacement of seat belts
because the Agency believes they are essential in protecting machine and vehicle operators from being killed or seriously
injured in accidents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(3)(vi) of the final standard requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employers to assure that seat belts are maintained in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
serviceable condition. Employers have the duty to ensure that seat belts are functioning properly and are not damaged.
The standard also requires inspection of seat belts as part of the general machine and vehicle inspection required
at the start of each workshift. (See discussion of maintenance in paragraphs (f) and (g)).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At paragraph (d)(4) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring employers to provide and maintain a portable fire extinguisher
on each machine and vehicle. The extinguisher must meet the requirements of subpart L of part 1910. The pulpwood logging
and proposed standards required a fire extinguisher at locations where machines and vehicles are being operated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters urged OSHA to limit this requirement (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;39). Two of these commenters
said that fire extinguishers should only be required on heavy equipment and at refueling stations (Ex. 5&hyph;21,
5&hyph;36). The other commenter said fire extinguishers should only be required during forest fire seasons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has decided in the final rule to require extinguishers on each machine and vehicle for several reasons. First,
repeatedly in this rulemaking commenters have requested that OSHA more clearly define what constitutes a ``work
site,'' an ``operating area,'' or a ``work area.'' OSHA's intention in the proposed rule was that a fire extinguisher
be located where 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
each 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
machine and vehicle is operated, including areas where they are refueled. OSHA believes that requiring the fire extinguisher
be located on each machine most clearly conveys the Agency's intention that the fire extinguisher move with the machine
or vehicle as it is operated and refueled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the potential for fire is a major concern in this industry (Ex. 5&hyph;20). It is important that extinguishers
be immediately available so that a fire can be extinguished before it goes out of control and endangers employees and
the forest. A fire extinguisher that is located at a landing where the machine begins its operation, may be of no use
when the machine is miles away from the landing picking up a load. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, one of the areas where the potential for fire is great is during refueling of the machine. However, the proposed
standard only required the extinguisher to be located where machines and vehicles were being operated and did not
address refueling directly. If the extinguisher remains with the machine or vehicle, it will be there to protect against
fire hazards during refueling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fourth, OSHA is aware that in many industrial settings, the extinguisher is already mounted on the machine or vehicle
so that it is immediately accessible when a fire occurs. Therefore, OSHA does not believe complying with this requirement
will pose a significant burden on the employer.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At paragraph (d)(5) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that all work be stopped and that each employee move to a place
of safety when environmental conditions may endanger an employee in the performance of their job. This provision
also specifies that hazardous environmental conditions include, but are not limited to, electrical storms, high
winds, heavy rain or snow, extreme cold, dense fog, fires, mudslides, and darkness. The pulpwood logging and proposed
rules contained a similar provision, however, it only specifically identified electrical storms and high winds.
The 1978 ANSI logging standard also contained a similar requirement and, in addition, required logging operations
to cease when visibility is inadequate, unless artificial lighting is provided. All State logging standards, except
the State of Alaska, have provisions requiring work to cease when environmental conditions are hazardous to employees.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA received several comments on this provision (Ex. 5&hyph;50, 5&hyph;51, 5&hyph;55, 5&hyph;66; Tr. W1 139).
Some of these commenters recommended expanding the conditions listed in this provision. These commenters also said
logging should be stopped when darkness impairs visual ability, unless artificial light is provided. One commenter
said they do not allow their employees to work in blowing snow, extreme cold or winds (Ex. 5&hyph;51). Another commenter
said OSHA should specify that the work stoppage requirement should be limited to only that work that is affected by
the environmental conditions (Ex. 5&hyph;55; Tr. W1 139). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA does not believe it is possible to delineate each and every environmental condition that would necessitate termination
of work and moving employees to a place of safety. OSHA is aware that the employer's judgment will be essential in carrying
out this provision in the various environmental conditions that affect different regions of this industry. However,
the criteria that must form the basis of the employer's assessment is uniform_when a reasonable employer would believe
that environmental conditions may endanger employees performing a specific job or operating a specific piece of
equipment, work must stop and the employees must move to a place of safety. For example, darkness may prevent a feller
from accurately assessing the distance between occupied work areas or the condition of the tree to be cut (e.g., loose
bark, damaged trunk or limbs). If the feller is not able to properly assess these conditions, he may endanger himself
and others in the area. Therefore, work would have to stop unless artificial light were available to alleviate the
danger. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another element of the determination as to whether an environmental condition may endanger an employee is the particular
job being performed and the tools of that job. For example, dense fog may endanger a feller because they may not be able
to see the top of the tree and accurately judge its lean. If such conditions exist, felling must be stopped. However,
fog may not necessarily endanger employees who are loading transport vehicles at a landing. In that case, the employees
might still be able to perform their job under such conditions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At paragraph (d)(6) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that work areas be so organized and spaced that the actions
of one employee will not create a hazard for any other employee. This paragraph also requires that each employee work
in a position or location that is within visual or audible contact with another employee. These provisions were adopted
from the proposed standard. The pulpwood logging and 1978 ANSI logging standards also recommended a two tree-length
distance between work areas. Requirements similar to the final rule exist in various State logging standards (Ex.
2&hyph;17, 2&hyph;18, 2&hyph;19, 2&hyph;20, 2&hyph;21, 2&hyph;22, 2&hyph;23, 38J, 38K). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (d)(6)(ii) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that work areas be assigned so that trees cannot fall into
adjacent occupied work areas. This provision also requires that the distance between adjacent occupied work areas
be at least two tree lengths of the trees being felled. The proposed rule and the 1978 ANSI logging standard contained
similar requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA received comments supporting this provision (Ex. 5&hyph;29, 5&hyph;41, 5&hyph;67, 5&hyph;70; Tr. W2 163).
These commenters said that two tree lengths is already used in the industry to ensure safe spacing of work areas. Some
commenters, however, said that the provision should be limited (Ex. 5&hyph;28, 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;44,
5&hyph;49, 5&hyph;53, 5&hyph;54, 5&hyph;63, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92). One commenter said OSHA should require
minimum spacing requirements only when physical control of the timber was unpredictable, such as felling and skidding
(Ex. 5&hyph;28). Other commenters recommended that the requirement be limited to slopes that are greater than 25
or 35 percent (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;63). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of these requirements is to protect employees in adjacent occupied work areas from being hit by misdirected
trees. One of the major causes of injury in the logging industry is being hit by a tree. According to the WIR survey, almost
one-quarter of all those injured were hit by a tree (Ex. 2&hyph;1). The State of Washington study showed that more than
65 percent of all employees were killed when they were hit by a tree or log (Ex. 4&hyph;129). In addition, the study showed
that almost nine percent of that reported fatalities resulted from an employee being hit by a tree being felled by another
employee (Ex. 4&hyph;129). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Employees can be hit by a tree that falls in the wrong direction or by one that rolls or slides down sloping terrain. There
is no dispute that there is increased difficulty in directional felling on unlevel terrain. OSHA believes that these
work spacing requirements in the final rule will help to prevent these types of accidents. Moreover, adopting any
of the limitations that the commenters proposed would still leave employees exposed to other foreseeable hazards.
Since the two tree-length distance has become accepted practice in the industry, it appears that industry itself
recognizes the need for a minimum work spacing requirement and that the provision should not prove overly burdensome
for any establishments in the industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In paragraph (d)(6)(ii) of the final rule OSHA is also requiring that employers assess conditions to determine whether
additional spacing between adjacent occupied work areas is necessary. Some of the conditions that employers must
examine include the degree of slope, the density of the growth, the height of trees, the soil structure, and other hazards
reasonably anticipated at that work site. This paragraph also requires that additional distance be maintained between
adjacent occupied work areas on any slope where rolling or sliding of logs is reasonably foreseeable. These provisions
were also contained in the proposed rule and in various State logging standards (Ex. 2&hyph;17, 2&hyph;18, 2&hyph;19,
2&hyph;20, 2&hyph;22, 38J, 38K). The 1978 ANSI logging standard also contained a similar requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters said greater distance should only be required when the slope is greater than 25 or 35 percent (Ex. 5&hyph;21,
5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;63). These commenters, however, did not provide any information on why such a limitation
would provide adequate protection for employees. OSHA does not agree that greater distance may only be necessary
on such steep slopes. OSHA believes there is a potential for trees and logs to roll and slide on lesser slopes when conditions
such as snow and ice accumulation or wet soil are present. Therefore, OSHA does not believe that adequate protection
would be provided if the commenters' recommendation were adopted.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Other commenters said that a greater distance on slopes should not be required when employees are working to the side
of each other, pointing out that the Alaska logging standard allows this (Ex. 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92). OSHA
believes that the final standard is consistent with the Alaska logging standard. The final rule only requires that
a greater distance is required on any slope where rolling or sliding of trees or logs is reasonably foreseeable. Nothing
in the final rule requires a greater distance on slopes when there is no danger that an employee could be hit by a rolling
or sliding log. For example, when employees work side by side on a slope, rather than uphill and downhill from each other,
there is no danger that the employee will be injured by a rolling log. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (d)(6)(iii), OSHA is requiring that each employee, without exception, be located within visual or audible
contact of another worker. This provision must be read in conjunction with the requirements in paragraph (d)(7) specifying
what methods of audible contact may be used (i.e., not chain-saw engine noise). This requirement parallels the proposed
standard, however the proposed rule did not apply this requirement to motor vehicle operators, watchmen and other
single employee assignment jobs. The pulpwood logging standard required that employees work within the vocal range
of other loggers but also allowed employers to use an alternative procedure that provided for periodic checks of employee
welfare. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Much of the comment on this requirement has already been discussed in the Major Issues section above. Some commenters
opposed various aspects of this provision (Ex. 5&hyph;29, 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;49, 5&hyph;53, 5&hyph;54,
5&hyph;67, 5&hyph;70, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92; Tr. W1 65). One commenter recommended allowing manual fellers
to be out of contact with other employees, such as skidder operators, for up to 20 minutes (Ex. 5&hyph;54). This commenter
said that was the amount of time necessary to transport a load to the landing and return to the cutting area. However,
the commenter has not provided any information or data to support why such an exception would still allow for adequate
protection for fellers. OSHA does not believe that permitting periods of time in which contact is not maintained will
provide adequate protection for employees. A chain-saw operator who severely cuts himself could bleed to death within
20 minutes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters opposed this provision because it would be difficult to comply with this requirement and maintain
the required two tree-length separation between adjacent work areas (Ex. 5&hyph;29, Tr. W1 pg 65). For several reasons,
OSHA believes employers will be able to comply with both requirements. First, this paragraph requires each employee
to be within visual or audible contact with ``another'' employee. It does not require that the person with whom contact
is maintained be in an adjacent work area. Second, the provision requiring at least two tree-length spacing between
adjacent occupied work areas is intended to prevent trees from falling from one work area into another. The purposes
of a visual or audible contact is to provide a method for employees to remain in contact in case of an emergency (e.g.,
a chain-saw operator requesting first aid after being cut by the saw, an employee alerting others of severe weather
approaching). Therefore, if employees are provided with radio communication, it would be possible for employees
whose work areas are spaced far apart to maintain contact with each other. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, as discussed above in the issues section, the final rule does not require that visual contact be maintained.
Instead, audible contact may be maintained by the use of horns, whistles or radio communication. As such, employees
can be great distances from each other and still remain in contact satisfying the requirements of this provision.
Fourth, OSHA is also aware that many logging establishments are currently using radio communication to maintain
contact, that is the best evidence of its effectiveness.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated above, in this paragraph OSHA has eliminated all proposed exceptions to the requirement of maintaining
contact with another employee. As discussed above in the Major Issues section, OSHA has eliminated the proposed exceptions
for several reasons. First, various State standards do not include an exception to the contact requirement (Ex. 2&hyph;17,
2&hyph;18, 2&hyph;19, 2&hyph;20, 2&hyph;21, 2&hyph;22, 38J, 38K). Second, several commenters supported the proposal
that all employees remain in contact and indicated that they do maintain contact with all employees, including employees
in single employee assignments, via radio and telephone (Ex. 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92). As a result, these commenters
suggested the exceptions may no longer be necessary (See also, Ex. 5&hyph;33). These commenters also reasoned that
all employees, including mobile machine operators performing single employee assignments, need a method of summoning
help in an emergency. OSHA agrees with these commenters. The Agency believes that the contact requirement will help
to provide prompt assistance to all employees who are injured or are otherwise in emergency situations. As discussed
above in the Major Issues section, with the advent of radio communication, it is feasible to maintain contact with
workers performing single employee assignments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA notes that it is implied in this provision that not only will means for contact be provided, but also that contact
will be maintained with each employee. All but one State logging standard require check-in systems to assure that
contact is maintained (Ex. 2&hyph;17, 2&hyph;18, 2&hyph;19, 2&hyph;20, 2&hyph;21, 38J, 38K). In addition, several
commenters say they have initiated check-in systems to assure that employees working in remote locations are all
right. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (d)(6)(iv) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring the employer to account for each employee at the end of
the workshift. OSHA has adopted this provision from the pulpwood logging and the proposed standards. The 1978 ANSI
logging standard also contained a similar requirement. Several State logging standards also require check-in systems
at the end of the workshift to ensure no employees are left in the woods (Ex. 2&hyph;17, 2&hyph;18, 2&hyph;19, 2&hyph;20,
38K). Several commenters said that it was not necessary for small felling and bucking crews to be accounted for by anyone
other than the crew members (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;53, 5&hyph;63). In response, OSHA points
out that nothing in the final rule would prevent the employer from allowing a crew supervisor, for example, to account
for the rest of the crew at the end of the workshift. In such cases, the employer is responsible for establishing and
enforcing a regular system whereby there is a check on each employee at the end of the workshift. The most important
thing is that no employee is unaccounted for at the close of the shift. As with the contact requirement, OSHA believes
that this provision will help to assure timely assistance to employees in emergencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, end of shift accounting offers several other benefits to the employer and employee. First, the employer
can remain appraised of the progress made on the job during the last workshift. Second, any hazardous conditions that
were not contemplated during pre-shift meetings with employees can be relayed to the employer for dissemination
to other employees. Third, unserviceable tools and machines can be reported to the employer so that replacements
can be obtained or repairs can made before the next workshift. Therefore, OSHA has retained this provision in the final
standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters said this provision would interfere with contracting situations when the logger is an independent
contractor (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;23, 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;53, 5&hyph;55, 5&hyph;63). However, they did not provide
any evidence as to how this provision might conflict with contracting agreements.

Signaling and Signal Equipment

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At paragraph (d)(7)(i) of this final rule, OSHA is requiring that hand or audible signals such as whistles, horns,
or radios, be utilized whenever noise, distance or other factors prevent clear understanding of normal voice communications
between employees. Paragraph (d)(7)(ii) prohibits the use of engine noise, such as from chains saws, as a means of
maintaining contact. These provisions supplement and support the requirement for the maintenance of audible or
visual contact contained in paragraph (d)(6)(iii). The proposed rule also contained a contact requirement. However,
it would not have prohibited the use of chain-saw noise as a means of signaling. The 1978 ANSI logging standard also
contained a requirement similar to the proposed rule. Several State logging standards also prohibit the use of chain-saw
noise as a signaling device (Ex. 2&hyph;22, 2&hyph;23, 38K). The Washington State logging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard requires fellers to carry whistles, which are to be used for no other purpose than to summon help (Ex. 2&hyph;22,
5&hyph;7).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA received many comments on this provision opposing the prohibition of chain-saw noise as a signaling device,
that have been discussed above in the Major Issues section. Other commenters supported the provision, focusing their
comments on allowing communication devices such as telephones and radios in the final rule (Ex. 5&hyph;54, 5&hyph;70,
7&hyph;74; Tr. W2 197). One of these commenters supported the provision because the use of electronic communication,
such as citizen band radios, makes controlling trainees easier (Tr. W2 197). Another commenter supported the use
of whistles for signalling because they produce a very unusual sound in the woods that can be heard for a great distance
(Ex. 5&hyph;7). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, there are two principal safety-related needs for a signalling system in logging operations. The first
is for the maintenance of communication between employees working in adjacent occupied work areas, both to warn other
employees of potential hazardous situations and to summon help in an emergency. The second need for a signaling system
is to provide guidance to the operators of machines and vehicles, such as cranes and other material handling machines,
when work site conditions prevent operators from seeing and controlling the operation. For example, if a crane is
used to move a load from below an overhang such as a cliff, a signal person might be needed to observe the load and to signal
the crane operator when and how to move the load. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above in the Major Issues section, paragraph (d)(7)(ii) of the final rule prohibits the use of engine
noise as a signaling device. This paragraph does permit other locally and regionally recognized signals to be used.
This provision has been adopted from the proposed rule and the 1978 ANSI logging standard. OSHA did not receive any
comments opposing the use of locally or regionally recognized signals, therefore, the Agency has retained this provision
in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (d)(7)(iii) of the final rule, OSHA has added a provision requiring that only designated persons give
signals except in an emergency. The proposed rule and the 1978 ANSI logging standard also contained this requirement.
Several State standards also require that only designated persons give signals (Ex. 2&hyph;18, 2&hyph;21, 2&hyph;22,
38K). As defined in this standard, a designated person is one who has the necessary knowledge, training and experience
to perform specific job tasks. OSHA did not receive any comments opposing this provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has included this provision in the final rule for several reasons. First, OSHA believes that the signaling system
should be included in the employer's training-program so that employees who are called upon to act as signal persons
will know how to signal appropriately. This is especially important when an employee performs signaling to assist
with the safe operation or movement of a machine or load. It is also important that employees know the appropriate signals
in the event that help must be summoned. The employee requiring help needs to know what means are to be used to communicate
the necessary information and how to use those means of communication properly. In addition, other employees must
be trained in what they should listen for so they can avoid potential hazards or provide assistance. Second, OSHA believes
that employees without the necessary training should not be permitted to act as a signal person for assisting with
the operation and movement of machines and loads. When the signal person has not been adequately trained, the risk
of harm to the signal person, the machine operator and other employees in the vicinity is great. Third, the use of trained
signal persons should reduce the potential for conflicting signals that could create a hazard.

Overhead Electric Lines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At paragraph (d)(8)(i) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that logging operations near overhead electric lines
be done in accordance with the requirements of 1910.333(c)(3). The proposed rule repeated some of the requirements
of 1910.333(c)(3). The pulpwood logging standard did not contain any provision regarding overhead electric wires.
All State logging standards contain restrictions regarding felling near power lines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment was received addressing minimum clearance from overhead lines (Ex. 5&hyph;34). This commenter suggested
that when the line voltage is unknown and other information indicates that the line is obviously high voltage, a minimum
clearance of 20 feet must be maintained from the line until the line voltage is established by the electrical system
operator. The separation distance recommended by the commenter would provide clearance that would only be warranted
by a 350 KV line. OSHA believes that maintenance of that great a separation distance is unnecessary in this rule. High
voltage lines of this order of magnitude are usually on tall transmission towers, therefore it is highly unlikely
any employee would come in contact with the line or have any means of getting near the line. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that 1910.333(c)(3) adequately spells out the precautions and clearances that must be taken when working
near overhead lines. OSHA finds nothing indicating that logging is different from the rest of general industry, therefore,
the Agency does not believe a special provision is necessary to address the logging industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (d)(8)(ii) OSHA is requiring the employer to immediately notify the power company when any felled tree
comes into contact with a power line. This provision also requires each employee to remain clear of the area until the
power company advises there are no electrical hazards. OSHA has adopted this provision from the proposed standard.
OSHA did not receive any comments on this provision.

Flammable and Combustible Liquids 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At paragraph (d)(9) of the final rule, OSHA is including requirements for the safe handling and use of flammable and
combustible liquids. As was proposed, the final rule requires such liquids to be stored, handled, transported and
used in accordance with subpart H of Part 1910. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters opposed this provision (Ex. 5&hyph;7, 5&hyph;34). One commenter stated: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
After carrying a 40 pound saw, lunch, water, wedges and wrenches, the last thing the timber faller wants to add is more
weight. So when he goes to carry fuel and oil it's normally carried in labeled plastic containers, generally in sizes
not exceeding two quarts. To carry fuel in approved containers would do nothing more than add back injuries to the statistics
(Ex. 5&hyph;7). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response, OSHA points out that there are approved plastic storage containers available in small sizes, such as
two quart containers. Nothing in the final rule or subpart H of part 1910 prohibits employers from using small plastic
storage containers, provided they meet the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.106. Further under 29 CFR 1910.106, the maximum
allowable size of approved plastic fuel container is one gallon. OSHA does not believe that carrying one gallon or
less of fuel in a plastic container will substantially increase back injuries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (d)(9)(ii) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that flammable and combustible liquids not be transported
in the driver's compartment or in any passenger-occupied area of a machine or vehicle. OSHA is aware that pick-up trucks
are often used to transport employees to a logging work site. Transportation of flammable and combustible liquids
in the passenger compartment of these vehicles exposes the driver and passenger to fire and explosion hazards and
is not a safe practice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (d)(9)(iii) of the final rule, OSHA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requiring that each machine, vehicle and portable powered tool, such as chain saw, be shut off during refueling. OSHA
has added this requirement because it believes that when handling flammable and combustible liquids, it is essential
to eliminate sources of ignition. The requirement to shut off the engines of motor vehicles when they are refueled
is mandatory in most states and is clearly posted in service stations. Because OSHA believes that it is essential to
minimize the sources of ignition when refueling vehicles, the Agency has retained the requirement as proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (d)(9)(iv) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that flammable or combustible liquids not be used to start
fires. The proposed rule contained a requirement that chain saw fuel not be used to start fires. While several commenters
supported this requirement (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92), other commenters, including
the State of Washington, opposed the provision (Ex. 5&hyph;34, 5&hyph;66). They said that loggers would use whatever
material they have to start a fire rather than losing production time to return to a vehicle to obtain materials. In
addition, the State of Washington said they were not aware of any injuries occurring as a result of this practice.

OSHA has carefully considered these comments. OSHA understands that in cold weather employees must be able to warm
their hands and feet to prevent frostbite and to maintain proper grip of tools. However, OSHA believes that the use
of a flammable liquid, such as gasoline, to start a fire can quickly result in an uncontrolled fire that endangers the
loggers and others in the vicinity. Other commenters have told OSHA about the dangers of fires, especially during
the dry season (Ex. 5&hyph;7, 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;39). In particular, when an area is cold and wet, gasoline will not
volatilize or burn rapidly. However, as the fire gains intensity, the gasoline will evaporate more rapidly, causing
the fire to suddenly flame up and can rapidly get out of control. Instead of using gasoline or a gasoline mixture, there
are products available that are not combustible to start fires, such as fire starters comprised of sawdust and wax.
These products are small, light weight and will not suddenly accelerate their combustion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has deleted from the final rule the proposed requirement that chain-saw fuel not be used as a solvent. Two commenters
said that chain-saw fuel is recommended by manufacturer's as a cleaning solvent for chain-saws (Ex. 5&hyph;7, 5&hyph;34).
For example, manufacturers' specifications indicate that chain-saw fuel is the most effective solvent for cleaning
chain-saw air filters. OSHA agrees with the commenters and has eliminated the prohibition from the final rule.

Explosives and Blasting Agents

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At paragraph (d)(10) of the final standard, OSHA is including requirements on the safe use of explosives and blasting
agents. Paragraph (d)(10)(i) of the final requires that explosives and blasting agents be stored, handled, transported
and used in accordance with the requirements of subpart H of this part. This provision has been adopted from the proposed
rule. The 1978 ANSI logging standard contained a similar requirement. All State logging standards contain requirements
on the use of explosives and blasting agents. There were no comments opposing this provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(10)(ii) of the final rule requires that only designated persons handle or use such materials. As discussed
above, a designated person is one who possesses the requisite training, knowledge and experience to perform the specific
duties. The proposed rule and the 1978 ANSI logging standard also required that explosives only be handled by trained
and experienced personnel. All State logging standards also require that only trained employees handle explosives.
OSHA did not receive any comments on these provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (d)(10)(iii) of the final standard, OSHA is requiring that explosives and blasting agents not be transported
in the driver compartment or any passenger-occupied area of a machine or vehicle. The proposed rule did not contain
a similar requirement. OSHA has added this provision in the final rule for the same reason that it included a similar
provision regarding flammable and combustible liquids. OSHA believes that employees may be gravely endangered
by riding over rough terrain and trails in close proximity to explosives.

Paragraph (e) of this final rule contains requirements for the safe use of hand and portable powered tools, including
chain saws. For the most part, these requirements were derived from corresponding provisions in the pulpwood logging
standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the final rule OSHA has combined provisions regarding both hand tools and chain saws. This was done to provide uniformity
in how tools are addressed in the logging standard. In addition, OSHA has combined these provisions to reduce duplicative
provisions, such as those dealing with maintenance and inspection of tools.

of the final rule, OSHA is requiring employers to assure that each hand and portable powered tool is maintained in serviceable
condition. This employer responsibility applies whether the tool is provided by the employer or employee. This paragraph
adopts the proposed provision. All State logging standards contain similar requirements about the maintenance
of logging tools.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA received several comments on this provision (Ex. 5&hyph;35, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;53, 5&hyph;54, 5&hyph;62,
5&hyph;63, 5&hyph;66). These commenters supported the need for tools to be properly maintained. One commenter said
that lack of proper maintenance of chain saws contributes to a number of accidents (Ex. 5&hyph;35). However, most
of the commenters stated that the maintenance of tools that are supplied by employees should be the employees' responsibility
(Ex. 5&hyph;35, 5&hyph;53, 5&hyph;54, 5&hyph;62, 5&hyph;63, 5&hyph;66).

employee's own tools.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 We feel very strongly that there should be a recognition of one's individual responsibility in this area. A more general
statement might be appropriate in this item simply stating that ``tools shall be properly maintained so as to assure
safe operation and shall be used only for their intended purpose and design'' (Ex. 5&hyph;39).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA does not agree with these commenters. OSHA believes that the Agency's reasoning in including a maintenance provision
in the PPE section applies here as well (See summary and explanation of paragraph (d)(1)(i)). The requirement for
employers to assure that tools are maintained in a serviceable condition does not prohibit the employer from allowing
an employee to inspect, maintain and repair tools he provides. The employer's responsibilities for compliance with
standards and for safe working conditions that the OSH Act imposes, applies even if the employee provides the tools.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This paragraph is meant to be viewed in conjunction with paragraph (e)(1)(ii), that requires inspection of tools
before they are used in each workshift. As discussed above, ``serviceable condition'' is the state or ability of a
tool to operate as it was intended by the manufacturer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (e)(1)(ii), OSHA is requiring that the employer assure that each tool is inspected before initial use
during each work shift. This paragraph also specifies the minimum elements to be inspected, such as chain brakes,
handles, guards, and controls, to assure that the tools are functioning properly. In the proposed standard, OSHA
specified that hand tools be checked during use to ensure continued serviceability. The proposed rule also required
chain saws to be ``frequently'' inspected. The proposed rule also contained elements that must be included in hand
tool inspections. The 1978 ANSI logging standard also required periodic inspection of tools. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA received comments on these provisions. Some commenters recommended that OSHA establish the frequency that
tools, such as chain saws, should be inspected (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;53). One commenter
objected to inspection of chain saws:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The need for chain saws to be ``frequently inspected'' should be clarified further. How often is frequently and who
would be responsible for the inspections? (Ex. 5&hyph;39).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that the final rule adequately addresses the commenter's concerns. First, OSHA explicitly identifies
the required frequency for inspection of tools. Second, nothing in the final rule prohibits the employer from allowing
the tool user or operator to conduct the workshift inspection, provided that such inspection and the required content
of the inspection are accomplished in the manner and time frame specified by OSHA. Finally, the standard specifies
the minimum elements that must be covered by the inspection.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the employer assure that each tool is used only for
purposes for which it has been designed. OSHA has adopted the provision from the proposed rule. The 1978 ANSI logging
standard also contained this requirement. OSHA received only one comment on this provision that supported its inclusion
(Ex. 5&hyph;39).

At paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that when the head of any shock, impact-driven or driving
tool begins to chip, it shall be repaired or removed from service. The proposed rule would have required that tools
be repaired when ``any mushrooming'' occurs. A similar requirement was contained in the 1978 ANSI logging standard.

The State of Washington opposed the proposed provision, stating that the language was too restrictive (Ex. 5&hyph;34,
9&hyph;10). The State said that as soon as a plastic wedge if firmly struck there will be some small amount of mushrooming.
In the final rule, OSHA has clarified this provision by requiring that the tool be repaired or removed from service
when it begins to chip. OSHA believes that this language more accurately describes the hazard that arises over time
with these tools. Over time there is a tendency for the steel in these tools to become brittle and chip. When a tool has
reached that point, continued use of the tool can cause metal fragments to chip off the tool and fly into the air, thereby
endangering employees. The metal fragments could be small enough to strike the eye or large enough to cause a sizeable
laceration.

At paragraph (e)(1)(v) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the cutting edges of each tool be sharpened in accordance
with manufacturer's specifications whenever they become dull during a workshift. OSHA received little comment
on this provision. One commenter stated:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the sharpness of cutting tools, we have had some interpretive problem in California where fire suppression
agencies who have been requiring various tools to be razor sharp rather than sharp enough to do the task for which they
are intended. The result has been unnecessary cuts to employees who have inadvertently had incidental contact with
such tools. We would suggest that the word ``adequately'' be inserted between the words ``kept'' and ``sharp'' to
provide a more ``moderate'' meaning to this requirement. (Ex. 5&hyph;55).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The need for tools to be inspected and sharpened as necessary is well-recognized and has been a part of OSHA's and ANSI's
logging standards from the start. OSHA believes that the final rule adequately addresses the commenter's concerns.
OSHA has added to the final rule the requirement that tools be sharpened according to the manufacturer's specifications.
This addition has also been supported by other commenters (Ex. 5&hyph;51, 5&hyph;53, 5&hyph;55). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraphs (e)(1) (vi) and (vii) OSHA is requiring that each tool be stored and transported so it is not damaged and
will not create a hazard for an employee. These provisions require that racks, boxes, holsters or other means shall
be provided and used for transporting tools. These provisions parallel requirements contained in the proposed and
pulpwood logging standards. The proposed rule specified that tools be secured during transport but did not require
that storage containers be provided. In addition, these provisions as proposed were included in the 1978 ANSI logging
standard. OSHA received only limited comments on these provisions. Two commenters stated that the storage provision
was unnecessary and, at most, should be limited to cutting tools (Ex. 3&hyph;53 and 5&hyph;55). The other commenter
said that the proposed transportation provision was not protective enough (Ex. 5&hyph;7). This commenter stated
that outside boxes or storage units should be utilized especially for crew vehicles, because tools can bounce around
when transported in such a vehicle, particularly when the vehicle is operated on off highway roads or trails, and could
injure employees who are riding with the tools. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that provisions for proper tool storage and transportation are necessary to protect employees from
injuries. Such provisions have been in OSHA and ANSI standards for many years. In this regard, however, OSHA also believes
that it is not necessary to require that tools be stored outside of passenger areas during transport if there are appropriate
containers or other means to adequately secure the tools. Therefore, in the final rule OSHA has clarified that employers
must provide and use some means, such as racks, boxes or holsters, of securing tools during transport.

At paragraph (e)(2) of this final rule, OSHA specifies various requirements for the proper use of chain saws in the
logging industry. OSHA believes these requirements are necessary to protect loggers from injury when using chain
saws. Several commenters also supported the proposed chain saw requirements as reasonable practices (Ex. 5&hyph;21,
5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92). As discussed earlier, the WIR survey indicates that chain saw accidents
accounted for 20 percent of the reported accidents (Ex. 2&hyph;1). According to a Maine BLS, from 1980&hyph;87 there
were an average of 362 disabling chain-saw injuries each year (Ex. 4&hyph;176). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In recent years there have been many improvements in chain saw safety due to the introduction of devices such as chain
brakes, bar tip guards, and reduced kickback bars and chains. Also, the availability of protective chaps and pads
of ballistic nylon or other lightweight protective materials have provided further protection for chain-saw operators.
OSHA believes that proper use of improved chain saws and personal protective equipment, and compliance with the work
practices will greatly improve the safety record of chain saw operations. OSHA also believes that proper training
in these requirements will result in better understanding of how these safety devices and work practices can work
to reduce chain-saw related injuries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (e)(2)(i), OSHA is requiring each chain saw placed into initial service after the effective date of this
section be equipped with a chain brake. In addition, this paragraph requires that chain saws meet all other requirements
of the ANSI standard B175.1&hyph;1991 ``Safety Requirements on Gasoline-Powered Chain Saws.'' This incorporation
by reference of ANSI B175.1&hyph;1991, has been approved by the Office of the Federal Register, in accordance with
the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. The final rule has been revised to reflect this approval and provides
the requisite information regarding access to the text of ANSI B175.1&hyph;1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (e)(2)(i) also requires that each chain saw placed into service before the effective date of this section
be equipped with a protective device that minimizes chain-saw kickback. Finally, this provision also requires that
chain-saw kickback devices not be removed or otherwise disabled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule did not require installation of chain brakes or other devices. The proposed rule did, however, require
that when such devices were present they should be inspected frequently and maintained. The need for devices to prevent
kickback was specifically raised as an issue in the notice of hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA received many comments on whether chain-saw protective devices should be required in the final rule. These comments
have been discussed above in the Major Issues section. One commenter suggested that loggers be allowed to remove chain
brakes when, in the judgment of the operator the presence of the chain brake creates a hazard greater than the hazard
the brake was designed to avoid (Ex. 5&hyph;55). This commenter suggested that it is more hazardous to have a chain
brake when the saw is operated on its side and at other unspecified times. However, the commenter did not provide any
data or other evidence to support his contention. There is no other data or evidence in the record that chain brakes
may create additional hazards at any time during the cutting process. Additionally, OSHA believes that once the chain
brake is removed it is likely the operator will leave it off and remain exposed to injury from chain saw kickback. As
noted in the earlier discussion, commenters stated that removal of devices is occurring, thereby exposing the operator
to the risk of injury due to kickback. Therefore, OSHA is requiring that chain-saw kickback devices not be removed
or otherwise disabled.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that each gasoline-powered chain saw be equipped with
a continuous throttle system which stops the running chain when pressure on the throttle is released. This provision
has been adopted from the proposed rule. OSHA received one comment that stated that if the safety equipment that came
with the chain saw were in place, the accidents listed in the preamble would not have occurred (Tr. W1 66). Therefore,
this requirement has been retained in the final rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NIOSH recommended that OSHA require chain saws be equipped or retrofitted with mufflers meeting the chain-saw manufacturer's
specifications (Ex. 5&hyph;42). NIOSH said mufflers would be effective for noise reduction. OSHA has not adopted
NIOSH's recommendation. First, retrofit mufflers may cause operational difficulties. Second, retrofit mufflers
may also contribute to an increase in back pressure for the operator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraphs (e)(2)(iii) through (e)(2)(xiv) specify various requirements for safe operation of chain saws. OSHA
believes these work practices are essential in reducing the number of injuries that occur to chain-saw operators.
According to the WIR survey, the vast majority of chain-saw injuries reported indicates that unsafe work practices
were involved (Ex. 2&hyph;1). In contrast, only four percent of chain-saw injuries were the result of equipment failure.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the chain saw be operated and adjusted in accordance
with the manufacturer's instructions. This provision adopts the requirement contained in the proposed rule. OSHA
did not receive any comments opposing this requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (e)(2)(iv) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the chain saw be refueled at least 20 feet from any
open flame or other source of ignition. This provision adopts the requirements contained in the proposed rule. This
requirement was also contained in the 1978 ANSI logging standard. The OSHA pulpwood logging standard required only
that chain saw operators be instructed to refuel the saw only in safe areas and not in areas conducive to fire. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that a separation between a fueling area and any source of ignition, such as a cigarette, is necessary
to prevent ignition of vapors from spills or from overfilled chain-saw tanks. The final rule clarifies what constitutes
at least a minimal safe fueling area. OSHA did not receive any comments opposing this requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (e)(2)(v) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the chain saw be started at least 10 feet from any fueling
area. This provision also adopts the requirement contained in the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Only one commenter opposed this provision, saying that in some instances it would be impossible to move 10 feet from
a fueling area to start the chain saw (Ex. 5&hyph;7). However, no substantive evidence was presented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that when a chain saw is started, there is a potential that spilled fuel in the area could also become ignited.
For example, a faulty spark plug wire can cause an arc between the wire and metal casing, resulting in the igniting of
spilled fuel. In addition, the record shows that the danger of fire is a major concern in the logging industry (Ex. 5&hyph;20).
OSHA believes that this provision will help to reduce the potential for fires. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (e)(2)(vi) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the chain saw be started on the ground or where otherwise
firmly supported. The provision is the same as the requirement contained in the proposal and the pulpwood logging
standard. Two commenters opposed the requirement (Ex. 5&hyph;34, 5&hyph;35). One commenter stated: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In many instances, there is not any way to comply, i.e., when a cutter is felling while standing on springboard jacks,
it would be a greater hazard for him to climb up carrying a running saw. This means that the chain saw must be started on
the springboard with no place left to rest the saw. The same situation occurs when limbing and bucking large trees after
they are on the ground. The cutter/bucker would have to climb up on the trunk while carrying a running saw. The proposed
standard should be amended to read ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
whenever possible
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
'' chain saws should be started [on the ground] (Ex. 5&hyph;34). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The other commenter said starting the chain saw on the ground was not necessarily the safest way to start it, and, in
any event, saws equipped with chain brakes could be drop started when the chain brake is engaged (5&hyph;35). Another
commenter said that they had had no injuries resulting from starting chains saws when standing in an upright position
(Ex. 5&hyph;45). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For several reasons, OSHA believes that this provision is necessary to protect chain saw operators. First, the record
supports the need for chain saws to be firmly supported when they are started. The WIR survey indicates that a significant
portion of chain saw injuries were related to the operator not having firm control or grip of the saw (e.g., didn't have
tight grip on saw, hand slipped into chain, operator fell on saw). While the survey does not indicate whether these
injuries occurred while the operator was starting the saw, the presence of these injuries does reinforce the need
for appropriate work practices that require proper support for equipment so the operator is able to maintain a firm
grip and control of the saw.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Second, OSHA believes that there is a potential for injury when operators attempt to drop-start chain saws. There
is a potential for the operator to lose his grip when starting the saw. In addition, especially when the saw is not properly
adjusted, the engine can flood. This can cause the saw to fly upward and hit the operator. When the chain saw starts there
is potential for sudden movement of the chain because of the increase in rpm. Third, while OSHA believes that starting
the chain saw on the ground will provide the best control and support, OSHA is aware that there may be some circumstances
in which a chain saw cannot be started in this manner. Nonetheless, even in those circumstances, OSHA believes that
it is necessary for operator safety that the saw be firmly supported. Fourth, even when the chain brake is on, the saw
needs to be firmly supported when it is started. When the chain saw is started, the chain will move until the engine returns
to idle. If the chain saw is not firmly supported when the operator starts the engine, he could lose control of the saw
and the moving chain could strike and injure him. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (e)(2)(vii) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that chain brakes be engaged when the saw is started.
Although this requirement was not contained in the proposed rule, OSHA believes it is necessary for chain brakes to
be engaged when the engine is started. As discussed above, when chain saws are started, the chain will run momentarily.
When a chain brake is present, it will hold the chain when the engine returns to idle. However, when the chain brake is
not engaged, the chain may continue to run at idle, further exposing the operator to the hazard. OSHA believes that
the many comments recommending that the final rule require chain saws to be equipped with chain brakes, also imply
that the chain brakes should be properly engaged during use of the chain saw. In addition, none of those commenters
supporting a chain brake provision indicated that there were situations in which it would be safe to allow the chain
brake not to be engaged during operation of the saw. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (e)(2)(viii) of the final standard, OSHA is requiring that the operator hold the chain saw with both hands
during operation. This requirement does not apply when the employer can demonstrate that a greater hazard is posed
by keeping both hands on the saw in that particular situation. This provision is the same as the provision contained
in the proposed rule. The 1978 ANSI logging standard also recognized the occasional need for momentary release of
one hand from the saw in some situations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters urged OSHA to require that a chain saw must never be operated with only one hand (Ex. 5&hyph;34, 5&hyph;50,
5&hyph;66). One commenter said: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Regardless of what organization recognizes and sanctions momentary one-handed chain saw use, it is extremely dangerous.
I do not agree it is necessary to operate a saw with one hand and place a wedge with the other. By so doing, the right hand
is on the pistol grip controlling the throttle, the left handling the wedge. If, during this one-handed process a kick
back should occur, the left hand which has the primary responsibility for maintaining a distance between the operator
and the saw chain is absent. Sufficient time exists between the initiation of the backcut and its completion for the
cutter to momentarily halt his sawing to insert a wedge (Ex. 5&hyph;66). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Dept. of Interior also said that chains saws should be held with both hands unless the motor is at idle (Ex. 5&hyph;50).
It is not difficult for chain-saw operators to put the saw in idle before removing one hand from the saw. Before placing
a wedge the feller can stop the chain by simply removing his finger from the throttle, that will idle the chain saw, thereby
reducing the possibility of injury resulting from operating the saw with only one hand. OSHA agrees that in this situation
as well as most other operating situations, the greater hazard is posed by removing the hand from the chain saw. According
to the WIR survey, 13 percent of chain-saw operators injured reported that their hand slipped into the chain or they
did not have a tight grip on the saw. However, OSHA believes there are other situations in which the hazard may be greater
if the operator attempts to hold the saw with two hands. For example, when an operator has climbed a tree to top the tree,
the operator may not be able to keep his balance if he tries to operate the saw with both hands. In that case, the safest
method may be to use one hand to control the saw and the other hand to steady himself.

OSHA notes that the employer bears the burden of demonstrating that a greater hazard exists by keeping both hands on
the saw in a particular situation. OSHA also notes that the limited exception involves a case-by-case determination
by the employer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (e)(2)(ix) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the chain saw operator be certain of his footing before
starting to cut. This provision also requires that the chain saw not be operated in a position or at a distance that could
cause the operator to become off-balance, to have insecure footing, or to relinquish a firm grip on the saw. This provision
adopts requirements contained in the proposed rule. Commenters supported this provision (Ex. 5&hyph;7, 5&hyph;21,
5&hyph;34, 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;55), and there were no comments opposing this requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes this work practice will help to reduce the number of slip and fall injuries occurring in the logging industry.
According to the WIR survey, slips and falls account for 24 percent of all injuries and 13 percent of all chain saw injuries
reported resulting from operators falling on the saw. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (e)(2)(x) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that prior to felling a tree the chain saw operator clear
away brush or other potential obstacles that might interfere with cutting or using the retreat path. This provision
adopts the requirement contained in the proposed rule. There were no comments opposing this requirement. OSHA believes
this provision will help to reduce the number of injuries that result from loggers being hit by trees. According to
the WIR survey, 24 percent of all injured loggers were hit by trees (Ex. 2&hyph;1). In addition, of employees reporting
injuries, over one-fourth said that heavy brush, ground cover and hidden wood on the ground had contributed to their
accident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (e)(2)(xi) of the final rule, OSHA is prohibiting cutting directly overhead with a chain saw. This provision
was contained in the proposed rule. Several commenters supported the proposed provision (Ex. 5&hyph;34, 5&hyph;42,
9&hyph;10) and no comments were received opposing it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (e)(2)(xii) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the chain saw be carried in a manner that will prevent
operator contact with the chain and muffler. The proposed rule contained the same requirement. Evidence in the record
suggests that this work practice already is being used extensively in the logging industry (Ex. 5&hyph;66). Some
commenters said that for many years chain saw operators have carried the saw on their shoulder and used a felt and/or
leather pad to protect their neck and shoulder from being cut by the chain or burned by the hot engine (Ex. 5&hyph;21,
5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;63). OSHA notes that any other method of carrying the chain saw that prevents these hazards would
also meet this requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In paragraphs (e)(2)(xiii) and (xiv) of the final rule, OSHA is specifying requirements for carrying a chain saw.
In paragraph (e)(2)(xiii), OSHA is requiring that the chain saw be shut off or at idle before the operator starts a retreat
after cutting a tree. This provision also clarifies OSHA's intent that these work practices apply not only to carrying
the saw between cuts but also to retreating after a cut has been made. This provision has been adopted from the proposed
rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NIOSH supported this provision, and further recommended that OSHA should require the chain brake to be engaged when
an operator is moving from one location to another, except while working on the same tree or log, regardless of distance
traveled (Ex. 5&hyph;42). Another commenter also supported the NIOSH recommendation (Ex. 5&hyph;52). However,
three other commenters opposed requiring saws to be at idle or shut off before starting a retreat (Ex. 5&hyph;7, 5&hyph;50,
5&hyph;66). One commenter said: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The cutter may lose precious seconds worrying about compliance with the proposed standard, meanwhile a life could
be in danger. Better to immediately remove the cutter from the base of the tree than worry about the saw (Ex. 5&hyph;50).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA believes that the requirement that chain saws be shut off or at idle before starting a retreat is necessary and
can be accomplished without creating additional hazards for the operator. First, OSHA believes that carrying a chain
saw with the chain moving may present a great hazard for the operator. The WIR survey indicates that a significant portion
of chain saw injuries result from the operator falling on the saw, the saw chain contacting the employee, or the operator's
hand slipping into the chain (Ex. 2&hyph;1).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Second, as OSHA explained in the preamble to the proposed rule, the saw can be at idle rather than shut off, provided
that the chain brake is engaged. OSHA is allowing operators to comply by either method because it recognizes that idling
the saw with the chain brake engaged is as effective as shutting off the engine in terms of preventing serious lacerations
due to coming into contact with the moving chain. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, OSHA does not think that idling the saw will add a significant amount of time to the operator's retreat. All the
operator must do to idle the chain saw and safely carry it is to release pressure on the throttle and grasp the front handle.
Fourth, in any event, chain saws are designed to be carried by the front handle rather than by the rear throttle. Carrying
the saw by the front handle is easier and there is no risk of the bar tip contacting the operator's leg or toe. Carrying
the saw by the rear throttle guard can cause the bar tip to swing downward and possibly strike the operator. Therefore,
OSHA believes that the operator should grasp the front handle thereby idling the saw. That way the operator will both
protect himself from a falling tree and from saw lacerations without undue difficulty. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (e)(2)(xiv) of the final rule requires that when the operator must carry the chain saw further than 50 feet
that the chain brake be engaged or, if there is no chain brake, that the saw be shut off. This provision also requires
that the chain brake be engaged or the saw shut off when carrying a saw for a lesser distance if conditions, such as but
not limited to, the terrain, underbrush and slippery surfaces, may create a hazard for an employee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule also contained these provisions. The 1978 ANSI logging standard required that chain saws be shut
off when carried for a distance greater than from tree to tree. In addition the ANSI standard also required that when
the terrain and other physical factors, such as underbrush and slippery surfaces, make the carrying of a running saw
for such short distances, the saw shall be shut off for carrying. Some State logging standards also require the chain
saw to be shut off or at idle when moving from tree to tree (Ex. 2&hyph;18, 2&hyph;22). For example, the State of Washington
logging standard requires that after the chain-saw operator has felled the tree, the saw must be shut off or at idle
while moving to another tree (Ex. 2&hyph;22). This standard also requires the chain saw to be shut off when moving to
the next tree when hazardous conditions are present. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters supported this provision (Ex. 5&hyph;27, 5&hyph;42, 5&hyph;66). One of these commenter said that
their experience had been that a chain-saw operator could carry a chain saw any distance without being injured, provided
the chain brake was engaged (Ex. 5&hyph;27). Another commenter supported the provision because carrying a running
chain saw any distance promotes additional fatigue that can also contribute to accidents and errors (Ex. 5&hyph;66).
The reasoning and explanation for shutting off chain saws before beginning retreat also applies to carrying chain
saws for longer distances. According to the WIR survey, 13 percent of all chain-saw operators were injured when they
fell on their saws (Ex. 2&hyph;1). OSHA believes this provision is necessary to reduce exposure to the hazard of a running
chain-saw chain.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At paragraph (f) of this final rule, OSHA is promulgating requirements for stationary and mobile machines. These
provisions include requirements for machine operation, protective structures, overhead guards, machine access,
stability and reliability, exhaust systems and brakes. As previously defined, a machine is a piece of equipment having
a self-contained powerplant that is operated off-road and used for the movement of material.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA believes these machine requirements are necessary to protect operators and other employees who are in the area
where machines are being operated. According to the FRSI, 20 percent of all serious logging injuries involved machines
(Ex. 4&hyph;65). Of all serious injuries reported, almost eight percent of employees injured were struck by a logging
machine or vehicle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The record also shows that a significant number of logging employees are killed in machine accidents. The OSHA FCI
report indicates that 17 percent of all employees were killed in machine accidents. The State of Washington fatality
study in consistent with the FCI report. According to that study, almost 20 percent of the employee deaths resulted
from machine rollover or being struck by a machine (Ex. 4&hyph;129). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
General Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At paragraphs (f)(1)(i) and (ii) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring the employer to assure that each machine used
by an employee is maintained and inspected so that the machine remains in serviceable condition. The employer must
assure that any machine is inspected before initial use during a workshift, and that defects or damage be repaired
or the unserviceable machine be replaced before work is commenced. Maintenance and inspection requirements were
also contained in the proposed standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters supported the general maintenance and inspection requirement for each machine (Ex. 5&hyph;10,
5&hyph;16). For example, one commenter said that daily cleaning and inspection of machines was a necessary element
of fire prevention as well as other workplace protection (Ex. 5&hyph;10). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that the reasoning and explanation for the maintenance and inspection requirements for PPE and hand
and portable powered tools also applies to machines. (See discussion above of paragraphs (d)(1)(i), d(1)(ii), (e)(1)(i),
and (e)(1)(ii).) As with tools and PPE, OSHA is imposing on the employer the obligation of assuring that machines are
in serviceable condition. This obligation applies regardless of whether the employer or employee provides the machine.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA notes that because a general machine maintenance and inspection requirement has been included in the final rule,
the Agency has deleted from the final rule proposed maintenance and/or inspection requirements for any particular
machine safety feature. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the employer assure that operating and maintenance
instructions are available on the machine or in the area where the machine is being operated. This paragraph also requires
that each machine operator and maintenance employee comply with the instructions. The pulpwood logging standard
and the proposal both specified that instructions be kept with each machine. The proposed rule also contained a provision
requiring operators and maintenance personnel to comply with the instructions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters supported the proposed provision, however, other commenters opposed requiring that instructions
be kept on machines. These comments have been discussed above in the Major Issues section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Machine Operation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At (f)(2)(i) of this final rule, OSHA is requiring that machines be operated only by designated persons. As explained
above, a designated person is an employee who has the requisite knowledge, training and experience to perform specific
duties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has included this provision in the final rule for two reasons. First, this provision must be read in conjunction
with the training requirements in the final rule. The training provisions require that each machine operator be trained
and demonstrate the ability to safely operate a machine before he/she is allowed to work independently. This provision
reinforces the requirement that the employer not allow untrained personnel to operate machines. Second, training
and skill are particularly necessary in an industry when machines are being operated in adverse weather conditions
and on steep or unlevel terrain. Employees who have not been trained to safely operate a logging machine under such
conditions could injure themselves or others. As noted earlier, over one-third of all employees reporting injuries
in the WIR survey had never received any kind of training (Ex. 2&hyph;1).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In paragraphs (f)(2)(ii), (iii) and (iv) of the final rule, OSHA is specifying various requirements regarding stability
limitations for machines. Stability limitations of machines used in logging are determined by three factors: (1)
load size; (2) what is done with the load when it is being handled; and (3) the physical environment in which the machine
is being operated. These requirements address each of those factors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In paragraph (f)(2)(ii), OSHA is requiring that stationary logging machines and their components be anchored or
otherwise stabilized to prevent movement during operation. The proposed standard contained a provision requiring
that stability limitations of machines not be exceeded. The proposed standard also contained a provision specifying
that truck and crawler mounted rigid boom cranes and other yarders meet the stability requirements of the ANSI B30.2&hyph;1983
``Safety Code for Cranes, Derricks and Hoists_Overhead and Gantry Cranes'' or the ANSI B30.5&hyph;1982 ``Safety
Code for Cranes, Derricks and Hoists_Crawler, Locomotive and Truck Cranes.'' The pulpwood logging standard required
only that the operator be advised as to the stability limitations of the machine. Several commenters pointed out that
machines referenced in those standards were not used for logging operations (Ex. 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;25, 5&hyph;29,
5&hyph;34, 5&hyph;51, 5&hyph;67). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the final rule OSHA has deleted reference to the ANSI standards because those machines are covered elsewhere in
part 1910. Overhead cranes are covered in 29 CFR 1910.179 and mobile cranes are covered in 29 CFR 1910.180. OSHA believes
that these standards adequately spell out the requirements for safe operation when operating cranes. OSHA finds
nothing indicating that the use of cranes is different from the rest of general industry, therefore, the Agency does
not believe a special provision is necessary to address the logging industry. In addition, most of the machines referenced
in the ANSI standards, overhead and gantry cranes, crawlers locomotive cranes and truck cranes; either are not used
or are infrequently used in logging operations covered by this standard. OSHA also has deleted the proposed provisions
on reliability and stability of cranes for the same reasons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the rated capacity of any machine not be exceeded.
As discussed above, OSHA has defined rated capacity as the maximum load a system, vehicle, machine or piece of equipment
was designed to handle. This provision was not explicitly contained in the proposed standard. Rather, it was implied
as part of the requirement that machine operators comply with the operating manuals or instructions. The pulpwood
logging standard, however, did require that operators at least be advised about the load capacity of machines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that it is necessary to explicitly state this requirement in the final standard. When the rated capacity
of the machine is exceeded, rollover and tipover accidents occur. As discussed above, many logging injuries and deaths
are the result of machine rollover accidents. The State of Washington study showed that nine percent of the reported
logging fatalities resulted from machine rollover accidents (Ex. 4&hyph;129). The OSHA FCI report also showed that
10 percent of fatalities were due to machine rollover accidents (Ex. 4&hyph;61). The Agency believes that it is not
sufficient to merely inform operators of the machine's capacity, rather operators must be instructed that load capacities
shall not be exceeded. As part of the training of machine operators, the operator also needs to be instructed on how
to keep the load within the rated capacity and what foreseeable conditions or actions can affect the machine's rated
capacity.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At paragraph (f)(2)(iv) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that no machine be operated on any slope that is greater
than the maximum slope recommended by the manufacturer. In the proposed standard, this requirement was implied in
the provision that operators comply with operating manuals or instructions. The pulpwood logging standard had specified
that operators be advised of the stability limitations of the machine. As with the requirement on rated capacity,
OSHA believes this provision is necessary to reduce the potential for machine rollover and tipover accidents. Therefore,
the Agency has explicitly stated this requirement in the final standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (f)(2)(v) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring the operator to determine that no employee is in the path
of the machine before starting or moving the machine. This provision parallels the proposed rule. In the pulpwood
logging standard, the operator was required to walk completely around the machine before start up to ensure no employee
was in the area. There were no comments on the proposed requirement. OSHA believes this provision is necessary to reduce
the number of accidents when employees are struck by machines. According to the State of Washington study, 10 percent
of all logging fatalities occurred when employees were struck by machines (Ex. 4&hyph;129). The OSHA FCI report indicated
similar results. Eight percent of the employees killed were struck by a logging machine (Ex. 4&hyph;61). Therefore,
this requirement has been retained in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (f)(2)(vi) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the machine be started and operated only from the
operator's station or as otherwise recommended by the manufacturer. This requirement adopts the provision contained
in the proposed rule. Again, there were no comments opposing this provision. Under normal conditions, the only safe
place for an operator to be during the use of a machine is at the operator's station. However, some types of material
handling equipment have more than one operator's station. In those situations, the operator may choose which available
operator's station to use when operating the machine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (f)(2)(vii) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the machine be operated at such a distance from other
employees and machines that a hazard is not created for any employee. This requirement parallels provisions contained
in both the proposed standard and the pulpwood logging standard. OSHA did not receive any comment on the proposed requirement.
The reasoning and explanation for checking the area before starting or moving a machine applies to this provision
as well. The record shows that many employees are injured and killed when they are hit by logging machines (Ex. 2&hyph;1,
4&hyph;61, 4&hyph;129). Therefore, OSHA has adopted the provision as proposed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At paragraphs (f)(2)(viii) and (ix) of the final rule, OSHA is prohibiting riders on machines and loads. At paragraph
(f)(2)(viii), OSHA is specifying that no employee, other than the operator, be allowed to ride on the machine unless
seating, seat belts and other protection equivalent to that provided for the operator is available for the rider.
There were no comments opposing this provision. In paragraph (f)(2)(ix), OSHA is prohibiting riding on any load.
These requirements parallel the provisions contained in the proposed rule. Several comments were received on these
provisions and have been discussed above in the Major Issues section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (f)(2)(x) of the final rule requires that before any machine is shut down, the machine brake locks or parking
brakes shall be applied. This provision also requires that each moving element, such as but not limited to, blades,
buckets and shears, shall be grounded. As defined in the final rule, grounded means the placement of a component of
a machine on the ground or on a device where it is firmly supported. This requirement was also contained in the pulpwood
logging and the 1978 ANSI logging standards. The proposed rule would have required that the moving elements of any
machine be lowered to the ground. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters said employers should be viewed in compliance with this provision if the moving element is placed
in on a device on the equipment designed to hold moving elements in a stationary, secure position (Ex. 5&hyph;74 through
5&hyph;92). This is the method used to ground moving elements on certain machines, such as knuckleboom loaders. OSHA
agrees with these commenters that it may be appropriate for the moving elements of a machine to be grounded if the moving
elements can be placed on a device that can hold it in a stationary and secure position. However, in those situations
when the machine does not have a device to place the moving element, the moving element must be lowered to the ground.
OSHA believes this provision is necessary because the record shows that logging employees are injured and killed
when they are crushed between equipment and equipment parts or struck by falling and swinging equipment components
(Ex. 4&hyph;61). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (f)(2)(xi) of the final rule requires that after each machine is shut down, pressure or stored energy from
hydraulic and pneumatic storage devices shall be discharged. This provision has been adopted from the proposed rule.
The 1978 ANSI logging standard also contained a similar requirement. OSHA believes this provision is necessary because
if pressure or stored energy is not discharged water will accumulate in the storage device thereby decreasing the
amount of fluid to carry out the function of the system. For example, many machines use air brake systems. If the compressed
air reservoir fills up with water and displaces the air, there may not be enough air to stop the machine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraphs (f)(2)(xii) and (xiii) of this final rule, OSHA is adopting provisions for transporting machines.
Paragraph (f)(2)(xii) requires that the rated capacity of any vehicle transporting a machine not be exceeded. Paragraph
(f)(2)(xiii) requires that the machine be loaded, secured and unloaded so that it will not create a hazard for any employee.
These provisions parallel requirements contained in the proposed rule. OSHA did not receive any comments opposing
these requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that the reasoning and explanation on machine rated capacity (paragraph (f)(2)(iii)) applies as well
to transporting machines on trailers. Machines, as defined in this standard, are material handling equipment that
are not operated on the public highways. Therefore, they must be transported on trailers across public roads from
work site to work site. The loading and unloading of a machine on a trailer can be a hazardous event. The principal hazards
occur due to rollover of the machine as it is driven up or down the trailer ramp or the ramp failing under the weight of
the machine. Rollover can occur when a machine is not properly aligned when being driven onto or off a trailer or when
the machine operator unsuccessfully attempts to make minor corrections in the direction of travel of the machine
on the ramp. The latter case is particularly likely when the machine runs on tracks rather than wheels, and directional
corrections are much more difficult to achieve. OSHA believes these machine transport provisions are necessary
to prevent injury to machine operators and other employees in the area.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At paragraph (f)(3)(i) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the specified logging machines that are placed into
initial service after the effective date of the final standard be equipped with falling object protective structures
(FOPS) and/or rollover protective structures (ROPS). This provision applies to each tractor, skidder, swing yarder,
log stacker, and mechanical felling device, such as a tree shear or feller-buncher. This provision combines the FOPS
and ROPS requirements contained in the proposed standard. ROPS requirements are also contained in several State
logging standards (Ex. 2&hyph;18, 2&hyph;19, 2&hyph;20, 2&hyph;21, 2&hyph;22, 2&hyph;23, 38J, 38K). In addition,
FOPS and ROPS requirements are contained in OSHA Construction Safety Standards, 29 CFR Part 1926, and Agriculture
Safety Standards, 29 CFR Part 1928. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA received many comments supporting the FOPS and ROPS requirement (Ex. 5&hyph;6, 5&hyph;7, 5&hyph;10, 5&hyph;19,
5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;22, 5&hyph;35, 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;54, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92) and did not receive any comments
opposing this provision in general. Many of the commenters addressed the issues of retrofitting machines with ROPS
and FOPS and incorporation by reference of SAE standards have been discussed above in the Major Issues section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter said that the ROPS requirement should also apply to loaders on self-loading logging trucks (Ex. 5&hyph;7).
However, three other commenters said this machine should be excluded from the requirement because the machine would
not meet most state highway height restrictions if FOPS and/or ROPS were added to the operator station (Ex. 5&hyph;21,
5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;49). OSHA agrees with these three commenters and has not expanded the FOPS and ROPS requirements
to cover loaders on self-loading logging trucks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The necessity of ROPS and FOPS on logging machines is not disputed. Steep terrain, slippery or uneven ground, large
loads, top-heavy equipment with loads, and other environmental conditions and unsafe work practices increase the
potential for logging machine rollover. ROPS reduce the likelihood that operators will be crushed in the event their
machine rolls over. FOPS prevent falling objects such as trees, limbs and winch lines from penetrating the cab and
injuring the operator. As OSHA noted in the preamble to the proposed rule, ROPS and FOPS are standard features on all
currently manufactured logging machines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on other comments in the record, OSHA has made the following changes to the ROPS and FOPS provision in the final
rule: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The ROPS and FOPS requirements have been incorporated in one provision because the SAE FOPS standard (J231, January
1981) specifies that only machines equipped with ROPS can also be equipped with FOPS. The ROPS-FOPS requirement of
the SAE standard was pointed out by three commenters (Ex. 5&hyph;16, 5&hyph;22, 5&hyph;57). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Machines only used in construction activities, such as road building, rather than logging operations have been
deleted from this provision (e.g., graders, scrapers, bulldozers, front-end loaders). Construction machines
and activities continue to be covered under 29 CFR Part 1926. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Forklift trucks have been deleted from this provision and included in a separate provision in the final standard
(see paragraph (f)(4)). One commenter pointed out that forklift trucks were manufactured with overhead guards rather
than ROPS and FOPS and, therefore, were not included in the SAE standards (Ex. 5&hyph;16, 5&hyph;47; Tr. W1 224)).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
4. An exception to the ROPS and FOPS requirement has been added for machines capable of 360-degree rotation. Two commenters
pointed out that the mast assembly of these machines, usually converted excavators, protects against machine rollover
(Ex. 5&hyph;16, 5&hyph;22, 5&hyph;27, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;40, 5&hyph;49, 5&hyph;53, 5&hyph;63). In addition,
the boom structure provides crush protection during rollover or tipover (Ex. 5&hyph;16). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraphs (f)(3) (ii) and (iii) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that ROPS and FOPS be tested, installed and
maintained in accordance with the following Society of Automotive Engineers standards: ``Performance Criteria
for Rollover Protective Structures (ROPS) for Construction, Earthmoving, Forestry, and Mining Machines'' SAE
J1040, April 1988; ``Minimum Performance Criteria for Falling Object Protective Structures (FOPS)'' SAE J231,
Jan 1981; and ``Deflection Limiting Volume-ROPS/FOPS Laboratory Evaluation'' SAE J397, April 1988. This incorporation
by reference of SAE J1040; April 1988, SAE J231, Jan 1981, and SAE J397; April 1988, have been approved by the Office
of the Federal Register, in accordance with the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR Part 51. The final rule has
been revised to reflect this approval and provides the requisite information regarding access to the text of SAE J1040,
April 1988, SAE J231, 1981, and SAE J397, April 1988. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These provisions update the requirements contained in the proposed rule. OSHA received various comments on incorporating
consensus standards by reference, and this issue has been discussed above in the Major Issues section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In paragraph (f)(3)(v) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the protective structure on each machine be of a size
that does not impede the operator's normal movements in the cab. This provision parallels the provision contained
in the proposed rule and the 1978 ANSI logging standard. OSHA did not receive any comments opposing this provision.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In paragraphs (f)(3)(vi) through (xii) specify requirements for enclosing the operator's cab. OSHA did not receive
any comments opposing these provisions in general. One commenter did recommend that OSHA replace these provisions
with a reference to the Society of Automotive Engineers J1084, April 1980, standard on force requirements for tractors
and skidders (Ex. 5&hyph;16). However, since the SAE standard does not cover all of the machines referenced in paragraph
(f)(3), OSHA has specified in the final rule the cab force requirements which are applicable to machines used in logging
operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (f)(3)(vi) of the final rule requires that the overhead covering of each cab be of solid material extending
over the entire canopy. This provision parallels the requirement contained in the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (f)(3)(vii) requires that the lower portion of the cab (up to the top of the instrument panel or 24 inches
(60.9 cm) if there is no instrument panel) be completely enclosed, except at entrances, with solid material to prevent
objects from entering the cab. The proposed rule stated generally that the lower portion of the cab be fully enclosed.
One commenter said that what constitutes the ``lower portion'' of the cab should be specifically defined (Ex. 5&hyph;16).
OSHA has incorporated the commenter's recommendation that the lower portion be defined as below the top of the instrument
panel or at 24 inches. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (f)(3)(viii) of the final rule requires that the upper portion of the cab be fully enclosed. The enclosure
must be made of mesh material with openings no greater than 2 inches (5.08 cm) at its least dimension or other material
that the employer demonstrates provides equivalent protection and visibility. This provision combines two requirements
contained in the proposed rule: full enclosure of the upper rear portion of the cab and enclosure extending forward
as far as possible from the rear corners of the cab sides. The proposed rule also required that the mesh material openings
be no greater than 13/4 inches. The 1978 ANSI logging standard also required metal mesh when glass alone is not sufficient
to provide operator protection. In the final rule, OSHA has combined these provisions because one commenter said
that ``upper rear portion'' and ``as far as possible'' were not adequately defined (Ex. 5&hyph;16). In addition,
OSHA has changed the final rule to allow mesh material with openings no greater than two inches, that one commenter
pointed out is the accepted standard in the western States (See Ex. 2&hyph;22, 5&hyph;71, 38K).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters said that OSHA should limit the types of vehicles requiring mesh material (Ex. 5&hyph;74 through
5&hyph;92). They said mesh should not be required on front-end loaders, log stackers, forklifts, scrapers and graders.
They contend some of these machines are used in log stacking areas where there is no danger of branches entering the
cab. In the final rule, OSHA has deleted front-end loaders, trucks, graders, and scrapers from paragraph (f)(3) because
they are used in performing construction activities rather than logging operations. With regard to log-stackers,
OSHA believes it is necessary for these machines to be equipped with mesh material or equivalent protection. Log-stackers
are used to raise and move trees as well as logs. In some cases trees are not topped until they are taken to the landing.
When trees still contain branches, they could enter the cab and injure the operator if no cab protection is provided.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (f)(3)(viii) of the final rule also specifies that the cab may be enclosed with a material other than mesh,
provided the employer demonstrate that it provides equivalent protection and visibility. The proposed rule implied
that transparent material could be used but did not specify what level of protection it must provide. The 1978 ANSI
logging standard specified that when glass enclosures were used, they must be safety glass or its equivalent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA did not receive any comments opposing this provision. One commenter stated that many machines are already enclosed
with other material, such as safety glass, that offers equivalent protection and visibility (Ex. 5&hyph;16). In
addition, the Society of Automotive Engineers SAE J1084, April 1980, ``Operator Protective Structure Performance
Criteria for Certain Forestry Equipment, Recommended Practice'' allows cabs to be enclosed with safety glass. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA notes that the employer bears the burden of demonstrating that when transparent material, other than safety
glass is used, that it provides both equivalent protection and visibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (f)(3)(ix) of the final rule requires that the upper cab enclosure allow maximum visibility. The proposed
rule required that the upper cab enclosure allow maximum visibility to the rear. OSHA believes that it is necessary
that the enclosure allow maximum visibility in all directions so that the operator and other employees in the area
are not injured. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (f)(3)(x) of the final rule requires that if transparent material, rather than mesh, is used to enclose
the upper cab, it shall be of safety glass or other material that the employer demonstrates provides equivalent protection
and visibility. This provision parallels the provision contained in the proposed rule. The proposed standard also
specified that a metal screen must also be used where transparent material alone does not provide adequate protection.
In the final rule, OSHA specifies the preferred transparent material (i.e. safety glass). OSHA agrees with various
commenters that when safety glass is used, additional metal mesh screens are not necessary. The final rule does allow
alternative material to be used, and makes clear OSHA's intent that it is the employer who bears the burden of proving
that the alternative material provides protection and visibility that is equivalent to safety glass. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraphs (f)(3) (xi) and (xii) of the final rule require that transparent material be kept clean and be replaced
when it is cracked, broken, scratched or damaged in any other way that may create a hazard for the operator. These requirements
parallel the provisions contained in the proposed rule and the 1978 ANSI logging standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (f)(3)(xiii) of the final rule requires that deflectors be installed in front of each cab to deflect whipping
saplings and branches. This provision also requires that deflectors be located so they do not impede visibility or
access to the cab. This provision adopts the requirement contained in the proposed rule. OSHA did not receive any comments
opposing the provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (f)(3)(xiv) of the final rule requires that the height of each cab entrance be at least 52 inches, or 1.3 meters,
from the floor of the cab. This provision has been adopted from the proposed rule. No commenters opposed this requirement.

Paragraph (f)(3)(xv) of the final rule requires that each machine operated near yarding systems (high lead and skyline)

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At paragraph (f)(4) of the final rule, OSHA is specifying that each forklift truck used in logging operations be equipped
with an overhead guard. The overhead guard must meet the requirements of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers
(ASME) B56.6&hyph;1987 (with addenda), ``Safety Standard for Rough Terrain Forklift Trucks.'' This incorporation
by reference of ASME B56.6&hyph;1987, has been approved by the Office of the Federal Register, in accordance with
the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR Part 51. The final rule has been revised to reflect this approval and provides
the requisite information regarding access to the text of ASME B56.6&hyph;1987. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the proposed rule, OSHA had included forklift trucks in the provisions requiring installation of ROPS and FOPS.
However, commenters informed OSHA that the manufacture of forklift trucks used in rough terrain conditions such
as the logging industry are covered by the ASME standard (Ex. 5&hyph;22, 5&hyph;47, Tr. W1 224), and that forklift
trucks are manufactured with overhead protection, rather than ROPS and FOPS (Ex. 5&hyph;47). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that this overhead protection requirement is necessary and will adequately protect logging forklift
operators from falling objects. Since the mast assembly of the forklift truck prevents it from rolling onto its top,
ROPS protection is not necessary. When accidents do occur, forklift trucks are more likely to tip over on their sides.
OSHA believes that, in the event of a tipover, the seat belt requirement contained in this standard will prevent operators
from being pinned or crushed by the truck or overhead guard by safely restraining them within the cab. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In paragraph (f)(4) OSHA has not included a provision excepting fork lift trucks placed into service before the final
rule from being equipped with overhead guards. The manufacturing requirements for rough terrain forklift trucks
have been in place since 1978. Since the useful life of these machines is approximately 10 years, OSHA is confident
that almost all forklift trucks currently used in the logging industry do contain overhead guards meeting the ASME
standard.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (f)(5) of the final rule specifies various requirements regarding machine access. Paragraph (f)(5)(i)
of the final rule requires that machine access be provided for each machine when the operator or another employee must
climb onto the machine to enter the cab or an operating element to perform maintenance. This provision also requires
that the machine access system meet the requirement of the SAE J185 June 1988, standard on ``Recommended Practice
for Access systems for Off-Road Machines.'' This incorporation by reference of SAE J185, June 1988, has been approved
by the Office of the Federal Register, in accordance with the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR Part 51. The final
rule has been revised to reflect this approval and provides the requisite information regarding access to the text
of SAE J185, June 1988. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule and the 1978 ANSI logging standard also contained machine access provisions. The proposed rule
specified that steps, ladders, handhold, catwalks, or railings installed after the effective date of this standard
comply with the SAE J185, June 1981, or be in accordance with a design by a professional engineer which offers equivalent
employee protection. There were no comments opposing the proposed provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes this provision is necessary to prevent logging injuries due to slips and falls. The WIR survey indicated
that these types of injuries accounted for almost one-fourth of all logging injuries reported, and that 28 percent
of all injuries resulting from falls involved machines and vehicles (Ex. 2&hyph;1). OSHA believes that compliance
with the SAE standard, in conjunction with work practices and training, will prevent these types of accidents. OSHA
notes that in the final rule, the reference to the SAE standard has been updated from the 1981 to the 1988 edition.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (f)(5)(ii) of the final rule requires that each machine cab have a second means of egress. This provision
has been adopted from the proposed rule. The 1978 ANSI logging standard also contained this requirement. According
to one commenter, nearly all logging machines currently in use have a second means of egress (Ex. 5&hyph;29). Therefore,
OSHA does not believe compliance with this provision will be burdensome. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraphs (f)(5) (iii) and (iv) of the final rule require that walking and working surfaces of each machine have slip
resistant surfaces and be kept free of waste, debris and other material which might result in slipping, falling or
fire. These requirements parallel provisions contained in the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA received three comments opposing these provisions (Ex. 5&hyph;7, 5&hyph;22, 5&hyph;55). These commenters
stated that the debris must be hazardous (Ex. 5&hyph;7) and that the requirement should be changed to indicate that
the walkways of machines should be ``substantially free'' of debris (Ex. 5&hyph;55). As discussed above, slips,
trips and falls account for a significant number of injuries in the logging industry. The Agency's primary intent
in this provision is to minimize the potential for employees to slip, trip or fall when mounting or dismounting a machine.
OSHA believes these provisions will reduce the hazards that result in those types of injuries. OSHA does not agree
with the characterization implied by the commenters that this provision requires employers to keep every machine
walking and working surface ``spotless'' at all times. OSHA is aware that in outdoors environments material may accumulate
on machine surfaces. OSHA is only requiring that when such accumulated material might result in a fire or in an employee
slipping or falling that it must be removed.

Exhaust Systems

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (f)(6) of the final rule contains various requirements regarding exhaust pipes and mufflers. Paragraphs
(f)(6) (i) and (ii) of the final rule require that exhaust pipes on each machine be so located that exhaust is directed
away from the operator, and be mounted or guarded to protect the employee from accidental contact. These provisions
have been adopted from the proposed rule. The 1978 ANSI logging standard also contained a similar requirement. OSHA
did not receive any comments opposing these provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (f)(6) (iii) of the final rule requires that exhaust pipes be equipped with spark arresters. This provision
also provides that when an engine is equipped with a turbocharger, spark arresters are not required. The proposed
rule also required a spark arrester for each machine, but did not make an exception for machines equipped with turbochargers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters said that spark arresters were not needed when engines are turbocharged (Ex. 5&hyph;10, 5&hyph;16,
5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;22, 5&hyph;25, 5&hyph;27, 5&hyph;55, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92). These commenters said
that the flow of exhaust gases through the turbocharger requires sufficient time for any sparks to be extinguished
and unburned fuel and particulate matter to be burned. One commenter said that functional turbocharged engines do
not produce exhaust sparks like normally aspirated engines (Ex. 5&hyph;27). For this reason, these commenters said
turbochargers were an acceptable substitute for spark arresters (Ex. 5&hyph;16). In addition, the U.S. Forest Service
allows turbochargers in lieu of spark arresters (Ex. 5&hyph;16). Based on this evidence, OSHA has incorporated an
exception to the use of spark arresters when the machine engine is turbocharged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (f)(6)(iv) of the final rule requires that the muffler provided by the manufacturer, or the equivalent,
be in place at all times the machine is in operation. This provision is the same as the corresponding provisions of the
proposal and the pulpwood logging standard. OSHA did not receive any comments opposing this requirement.

Brakes

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (f)(7) of the final rule specifies provisions regarding machine brakes. Paragraph (f)(7)(i) of the final
rule requires that the brakes must be sufficient to hold each machine and its maximum load on the slopes on which the
machine is being operated. As discussed above, rated capacity is the maximum load a machine was designed by the manufacturer
to handle. This provision was adopted from the proposed rule. Machine brake provisions are also included in various
State logging standards (Ex. 2&hyph;17, 2&hyph;18, 2&hyph;19, 2&hyph;22, 38J, 38K), and in the 1978 ANSI logging
standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters supported this provision (Ex. 5&hyph;10, 5&hyph;16, 5&hyph;22). These commenters also said
that OSHA should include provisions requiring brakes to meet certain criteria in respective SAE and ANSI standards.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The variety of terrain encountered in logging operations makes the adequacy of brakes a critical safety issue. For
example, information presented in the preamble to the proposed rule indicated that an operator was unable to stop
the machine he was operating on a slope and the machine rolled over (54 FR 18799&hyph;80). The injured operator was
trapped in a cab for 45 minutes until he could be rescued. This provision requires that the braking system, that consists
of the service and emergency brakes, must be adequate to hold the machine and its maximum allowable load on the slope.
For certain machines (tractors and rubber tired skidders), employers can look to national consensus standards for
guidance on brake system performance (See SAE J1041, October 1991, ``Breaking System Test Procedure and Braking
Performance Criteria for Agricultural Tractors'' and SAE J1178, June 1987, ``Braking Performance_Rubber Tired
Skidders''). However, these standards do not cover all machines used in logging operations. Therefore, OSHA is specifying
certain minimum brake system requirements for all machines used in logging operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (f)(7)(ii) requires that each machine be equipped with a secondary braking system, such as an emergency
brake or parking brake. This provision also requires that the secondary system be effective in stopping the machine
and maintaining parking performance, regardless of the direction of travel or of whether the engine is running. These
requirements parallel the provisions contained in the proposed rule. These provisions are also contained in the
1978 ANSI logging standard. There were no comments opposing these provisions.

Guarding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraphs (f)(8) (i) and (ii) of the final standard requires that each machine be equipped with guarding to protect
employees from exposed moving elements and flying objects. These provisions also require that guarding must meet
the requirements specified in subpart O of part 1910. These provisions clarify that guarding requirement also applies
to each machine used in debarking, limbing and chipping. The proposed standard also contained a provision requiring
machine guarding. The 1978 ANSI logging standard contained a similar requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three commenters stated that the provision should be applied only to stationary equipment to prevent misapplication
to mobile equipment (Ex. 5&hyph;10, 5&hyph;22, 5&hyph;57). OSHA believes the record does not support the commenters'
recommendation. The Agency believes that both mobile and stationary machines pose a risk of injury due to exposure
to moving parts. According to the WIR survey, a significant number of employee injuries involved mobile equipment
(Ex. 2&hyph;1). OSHA believes that employees working with or near both types of machine need to be protected. Additionally,
requiring all machines to be guarded eliminates the ambiguity as to whether a machine is stationary or mobile (e.g.
mobile machines that are used in place, such as a trailer mounted chipper). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA notes that guarding satisfies the requirements of subpart O when it is in the form of a specially constructed and
installed barrier or when the structure of the machine itself prevents employee contact with the moving element of
the machine. Each machine shall be equipped with guarding to protect employees from exposure to moving elements,
such as but not limited to, shafts, pulleys, belts on conveyors, and gears, in accordance with the requirements of
subpart O of part 1910.

Paragraph (f)(8)(iii) of the final rule requires that the guarding on each machine be in place at all times the machine
is in operation. This provision was contained in the 1978 ANSI logging standard. This provision makes explicit OSHA's
intent in the proposed rule that machines be equipped with guarding and that such guarding not be removed or otherwise
disabled while the machine is in operation. If machine guarding is removed or disabled, employees still remain exposed
to the danger of moving elements and flying objects when they are near or using the machine. OSHA believes the reasoning
and explanation for requiring that chain-saw chain brakes be engaged when starting the machine and not be removed
is also applicable to this provision.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At paragraph (g) of the final rule, OSHA has included various requirements regarding vehicles when used off public
roads in logging operations. OSHA has decided to include a separate paragraph on vehicles in this final rule because
of the confusion commenters said existed in the definition and requirements regarding ``mobile equipment'' verses
``motor vehicles'' in the proposed rule (Ex. 5&hyph;16, 5&hyph;18, 5&hyph;19, 5&hyph;22). Certain of the proposed
provisions on vehicles were limited to personnel transport vehicles. In the final rule, OSHA has defined vehicles
to include trucks and trailers used to transport logs and machines, as well as personnel transport vehicles. Therefore,
the provisions covering vehicles apply to all vehicles used in any logging operation. OSHA believes that the reasoning
and explanation supporting the need for protection for those in personnel transport vehicles also apply to operators
and passengers of other vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA received some comment that employee-provided vehicles should be excepted from the standard's vehicle requirements
(Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;39). OSHA has not distinguished between employer-provided and employee-provided
equipment anywhere in this standard. OSHA believes that when any equipment is used in logging operations, the employer
is responsible for assuring that it is in proper working condition. However, this final standard does not address
the personal vehicle an employee drives on public roads. By contrast, when the employer allows employees to use their
own vehicles to transport themselves and other employees off public roads to and from logging work sites rather than
providing such transportation, those vehicles are exposed to the unique hazards of logging operations. Such vehicles
must be adequately equipped and properly running, just as employer provided vehicles must be, in order to cross what
may be difficult terrain and other hazardous conditions encountered enroute to and from the logging site. The OSH
Act imposes on the employer the responsibility for compliance with standards and for assuring safe conditions in
the workplace, even if the employee provides the vehicle for the logging operation.

OSHA believes it is necessary in the final rule to specify requirements for vehicles used to transport employees off
public roads and vehicles used to perform logging operations. The record shows that a number of injuries and fatalities
have occurred in the logging industry that involve vehicles (Ex. 2&hyph;1, 4&hyph;61, 4&hyph;129). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2), OSHA is requiring the employer to assure that each vehicle used to transport employees
off public roads or to perform any logging operation, including vehicles provided by employees, is maintained, and
is inspected before initial use during a workshift. These provisions also require that defects or damage be repaired
or the vehicle be replaced before work is started. These are the same general maintenance and inspection as required
for machine and tools. OSHA believes that the explanation and reasoning for including these provisions in the paragraphs
covering PPE, tools and machine apply here as well. (See discussion above of paragraphs (d)(1)(i), (d)(1)(ii), (e)(1)(i),
(e)(1)(ii), (f)(1)(i), and (f)(1)(ii).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has included paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) in the final rule in an effort to clarify its proposed intention. As
stated above, commenters said it was not clear in the proposed rule whether the definition of ``mobile equipment''
included both machines and vehicles, and therefore, whether the general maintenance and inspection requirements
applied to both types of equipment. ``Mobile equipment'' was defined in the proposal as that kind of equipment that
includes mobility as a part of its work function. In the final rule, OSHA is defining machines and vehicles separately,
and placing the requirements governing each in different paragraphs. In making these clarifications, however,
the Agency emphasizes that all mobile equipment used in logging operations, whether vehicles or machines, must operate
properly, and that maintenance and inspections are needed to assure that only properly functioning mobile equipment
is used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (g)(3) of the final rule requires that the employer assure that operating and maintenance instructions
are available in each vehicle. This provision also requires that each vehicle operator and maintenance employee
comply with the instructions. These are the same provisions as required for machines. OSHA believes that the explanation
and reasoning for including these provisions in the paragraph covering machines applies to vehicles as well. (See
discussion above of paragraph (f)(1)(iii).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (g)(4) of the final rule requires that the employer assure that each vehicle operator has a valid operator's
license for the class of vehicle being operated. This provision applies to all vehicle operators, not just employees
who operate personnel transport vehicles. The proposal applied the licensing requirement only to personnel transport
vehicle operators and no comments opposing the requirement were received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that it is also essential that an employee operating any type of vehicle possess a current license for
that vehicle. Any employee operating a vehicle for logging operations needs to have met the necessary qualifications
and shown that they have operated the vehicle in a manner responsible enough to maintain a current license. This provision
ensures that the employee has the proper kind of license for the type of vehicle being operated and the load being carried.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (g)(5) of the final rule requires that mounting steps and handholds be provided on each vehicle whenever
it is necessary to prevent an employee from being injured while entering or leaving the vehicle. The proposed rule
specified that mounting steps and handholds be provided for every personnel transport vehicle. The 1978 ANSI logging
standard also contained a similar provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter opposed applying this provision to pickup trucks (Ex. 5&hyph;51). This commenter said steps would
rip off of high center pickup trucks during the ride. In addition this commenter said that steps would prevent access
of fire fighting vehicles to roads that have water barriers or speed bumps. OSHA does not believe the record supports
the exceptions recommended by the commenter. First, according to the WIR survey, 13 percent of all injuries resulted
from falls from vehicles (Ex. 2&hyph;1). Second, there are mounting steps for vehicles used in logging operations
that can be retractable or high enough to prevent contact with the ground while the vehicle is moving. In addition,
the record does not indicate that there are many speed bumps on logging roads. OSHA is aware that mounting steps and
handholds may not be necessary for every vehicle. OSHA is only requiring mounting steps when there is a danger that
an employee could be injured while entering or leaving the vehicle without being provided with such assistance.

Paragraph (g)(6) of the final rule requires that each seat be securely fastened to the vehicle. The final rule adopts
the proposed requirement and applies it to all vehicles used in logging operations. The 1978 ANSI logging standard
also contained this requirement. OSHA did not receive any comments opposing this provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (g)(7) of the final rule requires applies the requirements of paragraphs (f)(2)(iii), (f)(2)(v), (f)(2)(vii),
(f)(2)(x), (f)(2)(xiii) and paragraph (f)(7) to each vehicle used to transport any employee off public roads or to
perform any logging operation, including any vehicle provided by an employee. OSHA believes these general work practices
and brake requirements are necessary to prevent accidents involving vehicles as well as machines. OSHA believes
the reasoning and explanation for including these general provisions in the paragraph covering machines applies
here as well.

Paragraph (h)&blank;Tree Harvesting
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At paragraph (h) of the final rule, OSHA establishes various general and specific work practice requirements regarding
tree harvesting. OSHA believes these work practice requirements are necessary, especially given the high injury
rate in the logging industry. According to the WIR survey, in more than two-thirds of all reported injuries unsafe
working practices contributed to the accident (Ex. 2&hyph;1). The work practices specified in this paragraph address
those work practices that when not used contributed to accidents such as those reported in the WIR survey (e.g., co-worker
activity, working too fast, misjudging time or distance to avoid injury, using wrong cutting method). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA notes that those provisions in the proposed rule that specified requirements other than work practices (e.g.,
equipment specifications) have been moved to the applicable equipment specification paragraphs of the final rule.

General Requirements

Paragraph (h)(1)(i) requires that trees not be felled in a manner that may create a hazard for an employee, such as,
but not limited to, falling on an employee, or striking a rope, cable, power line or machine. The proposed rule and the
1978 ANSI logging standard contained similar provisions. The proposed rule required that trees not be felled in a
manner that could endanger an employee.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Three commenters said that the proposed provision was too broad to be useful since they believed all felling activities
are dangerous (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;63). While OSHA agrees that it may not be possible to eliminate all
hazards in a workplace, the employer does have the responsibility to prevent or minimize hazards the employer can
reasonably anticipate. To comply with this provision, it is incumbent on the employer to train employees in proper
felling work practices and to point out when employee actions or workplace conditions could create hazards for employees.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (h)(1)(ii) requires that the immediate supervisor be consulted before felling is commenced, whenever
unfamiliar or unusually hazardous conditions necessitate the supervisor's approval. The final rule adopts the
provision contained in the proposed rule. One commenter supported the proposed requirement (Tr. W1 85). He said that
consulting supervisors when heavy accumulations of snow are present would prevent injuries. OSHA believes that
unusual, hazardous situations may arise during felling operations and the supervisor should be involved in making
decisions about the safest way to fell a tree. These situations may include, but are not limited to, felling very large
or tall trees; cutting trees whose lean, location or structure make it difficult to fell in the desired or a safe direction.
Adding the supervisor's knowledge, training and experience to the decision-making process should help to minimize
the hazards to loggers. In addition, this consultation process is especially important when logging crews are relatively
new and may not have dealt with such situations before. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (h)(1)(iii) of the final rule requires that no yarding machine be operated within two tree lengths of any
tree being manually felled. This provision has been adopted from the proposed rule. The 1978 ANSI logging standard
also contained a similar requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters raised questions about or discussed this provision (Ex. 5&hyph;12, 5&hyph;43, 5&hyph;67; Tr.
W1 104, W2 197). None of the commenters denied that yarding machine operators may be endangered when they operate too
close to manual felling activities. However, two commenters stated that the provision should be revised because,
in some circumstances, the assistance of a yarding machine is necessary to assure that the tree is felled in the desired
direction or to keep the area clear (Ex. 5&hyph;12, 5&hyph;67). For example, one commenter said that failure of yarders
to clear an area of a build up of felled trees or logs can result in timber breakage or can pose problems for fellers working
on slopes (Ex. 5&hyph;67). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, OSHA believes that allowing yarding machines within two tree lengths of trees being manually felled would
pose a risk of harm to both the machine operator and the feller. First, a manual feller who is cutting a tree is concentrating
on that work activity and not on other logging activities in the area. If that tree were to fall on a yarding machine that
is too close to a manual felling operation, the machine operator could be injured by the tree. Second, it also is important
for their own safety that manual fellers work at a safe distance from yarding activities. Yarder operators and chasers
and choker setters concentrating on slinging and moving logs could cause injury to the feller if a tree or log were to
shift, roll or slide suddenly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, yarding machine operators are often working downhill from manual fellers. It may be dangerous for the operator
to approach the feller because the falling tree could roll or slide into the machine. Fourth, the requirements of this
paragraph can still be met even where the feller and yarder work as a team. After the feller has cut a tree and is moving
on to size up another tree for cutting, the yarder can remove the felled tree before the feller begins cutting the next
tree. The feller should check to make sure the yarder has removed the tree out of the work area before he starts cutting.
Therefore, OSHA believes that its general rule that each work area be separated by at least two tree lengths should
also apply to yarding and manual felling operations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter, who said that ``cat skidding crews'' in the northwest work in close proximity of tree fellers, suggested
that this provision should allow skidding directly away from a timber feller as long as the feller is not actively trying
to fell a tree (Ex. 5&hyph;43). OSHA notes that the final rule does not prohibit what the commenter suggests. The final
rule only says that yarding machines shall not be within a two-tree length distance while manual felling is in progress.
The final rule does not prohibit the yarding operator from clearing logs when the feller is not engaged in cutting trees.
While the feller is moving onto the next tree and assessing its condition, this provision allows yarder operators
to remove the trees that have been felled, provided that the other requirements or this paragraph have been met (e.g.,
the feller acknowledging that it is safe for the yarder to enter the work area). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (h)(1)(iv) of the final standard requires that no employee approach a felling operation closer than two
tree lengths of the tree being felled until the feller acknowledges it is safe to do so. This provision includes an exception
to the two-tree length requirement when the employer demonstrates that a team of employees is necessary to manually
fell a particular tree. The proposed rule and the 1978 ANSI logging standard also contained provisions specifying
that employees remain two tree lengths from the feller. The proposed rule did not contain the felling team exception.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters urged OSHA to permit exceptions to the two tree-length requirement (Tr. W1 152, 183&hyph;86,
W2 163, OR 126). These commenters discussed, for example, the need for shovelers to work in conjunction with fellers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes the two tree-length distance requirement is necessary for several reasons. First, a feller may not
be aware of approaching employees due to noise or the feller's concentration on the work. It is therefore possible
that employees may inadvertently enter an area where a tree is falling. This could result in injury to the approaching
employee, and even to the feller if he attempts to take corrective action. According to the WIR survey, six percent
of employees injured reported that co-worker activity had contributed to the accident (Ex. 2&hyph;1). The State
of Washington study indicated that eight percent of employees who were killed were hit by a tree being felled by another
employee (Ex. 4&hyph;129). According to the OSHA FCI report, nine logging employees were killed when they were struck
by a tree that was being cut by another logger (Ex. 4&hyph;61). Second, an approaching employee could be injured if
he is unaware of or misjudges the falling direction of a tree. The feller is the best judge of the direction that a tree
is likely to fall and, therefore, should be the one to signal when a work area is safe. Third, approaching employees
could be injured if a tree were to inadvertently fall in the wrong direction. The best way for employees to prevent such
injury is to remain clear of the work area while the felling operation is being conducted. Once the felling of the tree
is completed, the feller can signal that it is safe for other employees to approach. Therefore, OSHA believes the safer
approach for both the feller and other employees is to wait until the feller has acknowledged it is safe to enter the
felling area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has included an exception to this rule for particular situations when more than one employee is needed to manually
fell a particular tree. However, OSHA notes that this exception covers only manual fellers and those whom the employer
demonstrates are needed to assist in manually felling a tree (e.g., shovelers). It does not include mechanical felling
operations and it does permit machines to enter the manual felling area. In those situations, paragraphs (h)(1)(iii)
and (h)(1)(v) apply. If a machine is necessary to push or pull over a tree, the manual feller must move at least two tree
lengths away and must not enter the area until the machine operator acknowledges that it is safe. OSHA notes that this
is not a blanket exception for all team felling activities. The general rule is that no person is to approach a feller
until the feller has indicated it is safe to do so. The exception is meant to be applied on a case-by-case basis. That
is, the employer bears the burden of demonstrating that a particular tree or a particular felling situation requires
a team. Only then is more than one person allowed within the immediate work area. In addition, the employer bears the
burden of showing that a team is necessary to manually fell the tree in that particular situation.

Paragraph (h)(1)(v) of the final rule requires that no employee approach a mechanical felling operation closer than
two tree lengths of the tree being felled until the machine operator has acknowledged that it is safe to do so. The proposed
rule required that employees remain clear of any mechanical felling operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA received many comments recommending that OSHA apply the two tree-length minimum work distance to mechanical
felling operations as well (Ex. 5&hyph;18, 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;34, 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;63, 5&hyph;74
through 5&hyph;92; Tr. W2 163, 197). These commenters said that such distance was needed, for example, to protect
other employees from flying metal fragments from broken mechanical disc saw blades. In addition, the reasoning and
explanation supporting the distance requirement for approaching fellers also applies to this provision. For example,
a feller-buncher operator who is not expecting an employee to enter the work area may move in reverse and not see the
employee in time to prevent an accident. OSHA has therefore added the two tree-length distance requirement to this
provision of the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (h)(1)(vi) of the final rule requires that each danger tree, including lodged trees and snags, be felled,
removed or avoided. When the danger tree is felled or removed, it must be felled or removed using mechanical or other
techniques that minimize employee exposure before felling is commenced in the area of the danger tree. When the danger
tree is avoided, it must be marked and no work be conducted within two tree lengths of the danger tree, unless the employer
demonstrates that a shorter distance will not create a hazard for an employee. As defined in the final rule, a danger
tree includes any standing tree that presents a hazard to employees due to conditions such as, but not limited to, deterioration
or damage to the tree, and direction or lean of the tree. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule required that lodged trees be marked and lowered to the ground using mechanical or other safe techniques
before any work is continued within two tree lengths of the lodged tree. The proposed rule did not allow any exceptions
to the two tree-length distance. Many State logging standards include requirements to fell danger trees or not to
commence work within a two tree-length distance of the danger tree (Ex. 2&hyph;19, 2&hyph;20, 2&hyph;22, 38J, 38K).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The record shows that danger trees pose many hazards for employees. According to the WIR survey, 15 percent of those
injured said that the dangerous conditions of the tree had contributed to their accident (Ex. 2&hyph;1). The OSHA
FCI report indicated that 23 logging employees were killed by danger trees (Ex. 4&hyph;61). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA received several comments on this proposed provision (Ex. 5&hyph;7, 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;34, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;43,
5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92, 17; Tr. W1 187, W2 6&hyph;7). Some commenters supported the provision (Ex. 5&hyph;39,
5&hyph;34). Some commenters suggested that this provision conflicts with other federal regulations requiring
retention of some ``snags'' to preserve wildlife habitats in the area (Ex. 5&hyph;7, 5&hyph;27, 5&hyph;39, Tr. W2
6) and Rep. Jolene Unsoeld commented that OSHA should attempt to harmonize the final rule with various environmental
regulations (Ex. 17, 31). Other commenters said that OSHA's provision was excessive in those situations when a tree
is securely lodged a few feet above the ground (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92; Tr. W1 187, W2 6&hyph;7).
Another commenter said that prohibiting any felling within two tree-lengths of a danger tree would take a large volume
of timber out of production, especially strips of trees on steep slopes (Ex. 5&hyph;43). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has addressed the commenters' concerns in the final rule. First, OSHA is more explicitly stating in the final
rule that dangers trees may be avoided, when necessary, rather than being felled or removed. OSHA believes that this
requirement harmonizes with and does not conflict with the rules and regulations of other Federal agencies. The U.S.
Department of the Interior participated in this rulemaking and did not indicate that this provision was in conflict
with their regulations (Ex. 5&hyph;50). The change to the final rule further clarifies OSHA's proposed intent that
danger trees do not have to be felled or removed. This provision of the final rule only requires two actions of the employer.
One, when the employer wishes to fell a danger tree, it must be removed or felled before other trees in the area are felled.
Two, when the employer elects not to fell or remove a danger tree, the employer must not conduct any other felling in
that area. Therefore, when other regulations require the preservation of a particular snag, this final standard
requires only that fellers be protected from potential injury from the snag. This is accomplished by keeping all other
felling activity out of the immediate area of that snag.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Second, in the final rule OSHA has addressed the concerns of other commenters by allowing work to commence within two
tree lengths of a marked danger tree, provided that the employer demonstrates that a shorter distance will not create
a hazard for an employee. This change will assure the safety of logging employees without removing significant timber
from production. OSHA notes that the employer bears the burden of demonstrating that a distance of less than two tree
lengths will not create a hazard for an employee. Supervisors should actively participate in identifying and training
employees about providing safe distances. Whether a shorter distance does create a hazard is a case-by-case determination.
What constitutes a safe distance for other work to be conducted will require an evaluation of various factors such
as, but not limited to, the size of the danger tree, how secure it is, its condition, the slope of the work area, and the
presence of other employees in the area. For example, excessive root deterioration or damage might indicate that
the danger tree is unstable and that there is a possibility it could fall. In such case, a two tree-length distance would
be required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters recommended that OSHA designate dislodging a tree by felling another one into it as a safe technique
``in certain situations'' (Ex. 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92). However, these commenters did not identify any situations
in which it would be safe to dislodge a tree in this manner. There is no information in the record that identifies any
situation in which it is safe to use domino felling to fell a danger tree. In fact, other commenters have indicated they
know of no situation when felling another tree into a danger tree is considered safe practice (Ex. 5&hyph;42, 5&hyph;46).
OSHA also believes that it is not safe to dislodge a tree in this manner. First, there are already hazards associated
with domino felling trees that are not danger trees. Trying to domino fell danger trees such as lodged trees can only
increase the seriousness of the hazard. One of the factors that makes a tree a danger tree is that the physical damage
to the tree may cause it to fall in an unintended direction. Felling another tree into the danger tree increases the
potential for a misdirected fall. Second, the possibility exists that danger trees being domino felled also will
become lodged, thereby increasing the number of trees to be avoided or removed and, consequently, increasing the
risk to employees when those lodged trees are removed. The safest way to remove a lodged tree, first is remove all unnecessary
employees from the area and then to hook the tree to a skidder, and pull the tree down (Ex. 5&hyph;43). Therefore, OSHA
is not permitting removal of any tree, including a danger tree, by domino felling (See discussion of paragraph (h)(1)(ix).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (h)(1)(vii) of the final rule requires that each danger tree be carefully checked for signs of loose bark,
broken branches and limbs or other damage before it is felled or removed. This provision also requires that loose bark
and other damage that may create a hazard be removed before felling or removing the tree. This requirement has been
adopted from the proposed rule. In the proposed rule, OSHA specified that snags be carefully checked for dangerous
bark before they are felled and that accessible loose bark be removed before felling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter opposed this provision (Ex. 5&hyph;65). This commenter said that removing loose bark increases dangers
from above since upper bark will slough off if lower bark is no longer supporting it. As such, this commenter recommended
that OSHA require loose bark to be pinned to the tree. OSHA has changed the final rule to include removing loose bark
or holding it in place.

Paragraph (h)(1)(viii) of the final rule requires that felling activity on any slope when rolling or sliding of trees
or logs is reasonably foreseeable be kept uphill from, or on the same level as, previously felled trees. This provision
has been adopted from the proposed standard and the pulpwood logging rules. Various State standards contain similar
requirements (Ex. 2&hyph;19, 2&hyph;22, 38K). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA received various comments on this provision (Ex. 5&hyph;7, 5&hyph;12, 5&hyph;16, 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;53, 5&hyph;74
through 5&hyph;92). Several commenters said that OSHA should more clearly define what constitutes sloping terrain
(Ex. 5&hyph;16, 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;53, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92). These commenters suggested that the provision
be limited to slopes exceeding 25 or 35 percent. They also indicated that mechanical felling in southern states should
be excluded because slopes are gentler and shorter than in other regions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The record shows that this provision is necessary to protect employees from being injured by rolling or sliding trees.
The WIR survey supports the need for this work practice requirement. According to the WIR survey, nearly three-fifths
of the workers who reported injuries said that their accidents occurred on moderately or steeply sloped terrain,
and 10 percent of all injured workers blamed the steep terrain for their accident (Ex. 2&hyph;1). The OSHA FCI report
indicated that 20 employees were killed when they were struck by rolling trees or logs (Ex. 4&hyph;61). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has not adopted a precise minimum slope that would trigger this requirement or excempt any region from the requirement,
however, the final rule does address the commenters' concerns by limiting this provision to those sloping terrains
where rolling or sliding of felled trees is reasonably foreseeable. OSHA is aware that logging work sites are often
not completely level, and that many logging sites could be considered to be sloping terrain. Elements other than the
mere slope of the terrain also must be considered in determining whether there is a reasonable possibility that the
trees could roll or slide. When a given slope does not present the reasonable possibility that felled trees will slide
or roll, OSHA agrees that this requirement should not apply. However, when the terrain slopes to the degree that a reasonable
employer would believe that sliding or rolling is foreseeable, then this work practice requirement is necessary
to protect loggers from being injured. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whether a particular terrain slope poses a possibility that trees or logs may slide or roll requires an assessment
of the condition of the terrain. All conditions that might contribute to a hazard must be considered (e.g., tree size,
weather conditions). For example, when the terrain is either wet or covered with snow or ice, the possibility of trees
sliding and rolling is greater and these conditions must be considered in determining whether uphill felling is required.
As long as the hazard of sliding or rolling trees exists, felling must be done on the uphill side even if industry practice
has been downhill felling, or even if roads have generally been located on the tops of ridges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter said that this provision of the final rule may be counter to some environmental considerations in timber
harvest plans which require opposite felling schemes (Ex. 5&hyph;7). However, the commenter has not provided substantive
information to support his assertion. OSHA has previously discussed the danger of manual felling operations being
conducted in adjacent work areas due to the potential for a felled tree falling into another work area. In light of that
the fact that most trees fall down hill when felled, the hazard to employees working below another felling activity
exposes those employees to an unacceptable risk of injury or death. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, one commenter said downhill felling should be permitted because it can reduce the feller's fatigue (Ex.
5&hyph;12). While NIOSH suggests that worker fatigue may be a factor in logging accidents, NIOSH did not recommend
downhill felling as being a method to reduce worker fatigue (Ex. 5&hyph;42). Rather, NIOSH said that the employer
should reduce worker fatigue and the potential for accidents that results from such fatigue by planning appropriate
work schedules. NIOSH suggested that the employer's planning of work schedules should include an evaluation of the
amount of heat stress, physical exertion and other factors contributing to fatigue in planning those work schedules.
OSHA agrees with NIOSH that planning appropriate work schedules rather than downhill felling would be the appropriate
way to reduce worker fatigue without exposing the employee to further hazards and to assure that jobs fit the capabilities
of the person. (OSHA is addressing these factors in its rulemaking on ergonomic safety and health management.)

Paragraph (h)(1)(ix) of the final rule prohibits the practice of domino felling. As previously discussed, domino
felling involves cutting wedges and making partial backcuts in a series of trees that form a continuous line. The last
tree is then felled into the line thus pushing the line of trees to the ground in a chain reaction fashion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 This requirement was not included in the proposed rule, however, several commenters urged OSHA to prohibit domino
felling in the final rule (Ex. 5&hyph;42, 5&hyph;46; Tr. W2 231, OR 659). NIOSH said that domino felling was a hazardous
practice because there was a loss of stability in the standing tree when it had been backcut (Ex. 5&hyph;42). Therefore,
NIOSH recommended that OSHA include a requirement in the final rule allowing only one tree to be felled at a time. There
are also other hazards associated with domino felling. First, when trees are used to knock down other trees, the likelihood
that the trees will not fall in the expected direction is greatly increased. A small miscalculation in the falling
direction can be significantly magnified down the line and result in serious injury to the feller or other employees
in the area. In addition, a falling tree could hit another object and either fall in another direction or become lodged.
This would require an employee to fell the lodged tree, which is a hazardous operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Second, the hazards can be magnified when domino felling is not successful in knocking down the entire line of trees.
The feller may be placed in an extremely hazardous situation if he must try to fell any of the line of trees that may remain
standing. For example, part of the line of trees may have fallen over and lodged against the standing tree. A feller
who attempts to fell the final standing tree(s) could be injured when the lodged line of trees and the final tree finally
do fall. The risk of injury is greater because it is more likely that the lodged trees may fall in an unexpected direction,
and the combined weight of the lodged trees further increases the risk. In this sense, the prohibition against domino
felling is similar to the requirement in the final rule that trees be felled in a manner that prevents them from striking
things such as ropes, cables, or power lines. For these reasons, OSHA is requiring that trees be felled one at a time
rather than allowing trees to be used to knock down other trees.

Manual Felling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (h)(2) of the final rule specifies various work practices for manual felling. OSHA believes these provisions
are essential to reduce the number of injuries that occur during felling activities. According to the WIR survey,
tree felling is the most dangerous activity in the logging industry. Of those who reported injuries in the WIR survey,
23 percent were engaged in felling trees at the time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 OSHA's FCI report also indicates that felling operations are the most hazardous operation in the logging industry
(Ex. 4&hyph;61). The report indicated that 43 percent of all employees who died did so when they were felling trees.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The State of Washington study indicated that more than 40 percent of employees killed from 1977&hyph;83 were performing
felling operations (Ex. 4&hyph;129). This study concluded that many of the deaths would have been prevented had logging
employees been following safe work practices and had remained out of hazardous areas (e.g., adjacent occupied work
areas). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 One commenter said that certain of the work practices proposed by OSHA should not be required of each feller (Ex. 5&hyph;54).
This commenter said the work practices did not take into account the variation in feller experience, production requirements,
and the trees themselves. This commenter also said the work practice requirements did not allow for innovations in
felling technology and for recognition of other safe ways to perform felling tasks. OSHA points out that these work
practice requirements have been widely recognized and accepted in the logging industry. Most of the State logging
standards contain most of these work practices (Ex. 2&hyph;17, 2&hyph;18, 2&hyph;19, 2&hyph;20, 2&hyph;23, 38J,
38K). These requirements were included in OSHA's pulpwood logging standard, that adopted the 1971 ANSI logging standard.
In addition, these requirements were contained in the 1978 ANSI logging standard. The ANSI standards are national
consensus standards which were developed, approved and followed by the logging industry itself. Presumably, they
represent what the industry has viewed to be necessary and reasonable to prevent injuries and deaths in this high hazard
industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 In paragraph (h)(2)(i) of the final rule, OSHA requires that before a feller even begins felling a tree, a retreat path
must be planned and cleared. This provision also requires that the retreat path extend diagonally away from the expected
felling line. This provision also includes an exception to the diagonal retreat path when the employer demonstrates
that in the particular situation such a retreat path is not feasible or poses a greater hazard than an alternative retreat
path. The proposed rule contained a requirement for planning and clearing a retreat path before commencing cutting.
However, the proposed rule required that the retreat path ``extend back and diagonally to the rear'' of the expected
felling line. This language also was contained in the 1978 ANSI logging standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 One commenter contended that a diagonal retreat path may not lead to the safest location in the felling area, therefore,
it would be inappropriate for OSHA to designate a required retreat direction in the standard (Ex. 5&hyph;35). The
record shows that the clearance of a retreat path so the feller is able to move rapidly and safely away from a falling
tree is essential to prevent injuries. According to the WIR survey, 24 percent of all reported injuries resulted from
being hit by a tree and half of these injuries involved falling trees. OSHA believes there are many kinds of hazards
that necessitate a quick and clear retreat path. For example, the tree being felled can split and part of the tree may
then fall in an unexpected direction. In heavily wooded areas, the tree being felled can strike another tree that can
cause the first tree or parts of either tree to fall or fly in an unexpected direction. In addition, planning and clearing
a path prior to cutting a tree is especially important when the terrain is covered with obstructions such as snow, water
or heavy undergrowth. These obstructions could cause the feller to be injured if they impede the feller's ability
to rapidly retreat or cause him to trip or fall. For these reasons, OSHA has retained the requirement to plan and clear
a retreat path before felling the tree.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA has addressed in the final rule the concerns raised by the commenter. As a general rule, OSHA believes that a diagonal
retreat path is the safest location in the felling area. The ANSI standard, developed by persons experienced in the
logging industry, recognized that same general safe work practice. OSHA recognizes that when the retreat path is
planned prior to cutting, the employer may find that a diagonal retreat path poses greater hazards than an alternative
path. For example, excessive slopes, rocks or other trees in the path of a diagonal retreat may create hazards that
are not present in an alternative retreat path. In such cases, the final rule permits the employee to use an alternate
retreat path. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 OSHA notes that the employer bears the burden of demonstrating that the diagonal retreat path poses a greater hazard.
OSHA also notes that the exception is a case-by-case determination. That is, the general rule requiring a diagonal
retreat path is to be applied in all manual felling activities. The exception only applies when the feller, in planning
a particular retreat path, determines that a diagonal retreat poses a greater hazard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of the final rule requires that before each tree is felled, conditions shall be evaluated in
the work area and precautions taken so a hazard is not created for an employee. Conditions that must be evaluated include,
but are not limited to, snow and ice accumulation, wind, lean of the tree, dead limbs and location of other trees. This
provision parallels the requirement contained in the proposed rule and the 1978 ANSI logging standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 OSHA did not receive any comments opposing this provision. Many commenters discussed the hazardous nature of working
conditions in the logging industry, and noted that these conditions are constantly changing (Ex. 5&hyph;12, Tr.
W1 76, 88). Because conditions can change with each tree that is being felled, it is important that the feller assess
in advance the conditions and hazards that may be present. In order for fellers to understand what conditions and hazards
may be present and must be appraised, it is important that the employer should include this discussion in training
sessions and monthly safety and health meetings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Paragraph (h)(2)(iii) of the final rule requires that each tree be checked for accumulations of snow or ice. This provision
also requires that accumulations of snow and ice that may create a hazard for an employee must be removed before felling
is started in the area or the area must be avoided. This provision parallels the requirement contained in the proposed
rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 One commenter said that this provision would require logging establishments to cease felling operations during
winter months (Ex. 5&hyph;51). OSHA does not agree with the characterization that the commenters draw about the proposed
rule. OSHA is aware that logging operations are carried out in many types of weather conditions. OSHA does not believe
that this provision requires logging operations to close down during the winter. However, when accumulations of
snow and ice may create a hazard for an employee, that hazard must be removed or avoided. The record shows that removing
or avoiding hazardous accumulations of snow and ice is necessary to protect logging employees from injury. According
to the WIR survey, six percent of employees injured said that weather conditions such as snow and ice had contributed
to their accident (Ex. 2&hyph;1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Paragraph (h)(2)(iv) of the final rule requires that when a spring pole or other tree is under stress, no employee other
than the feller may be closer than two tree lengths when the stress is released. This provision was included in the proposed
rule, however, the proposed rule did not require that employees be at least two tree lengths away. Rather, it required
that employees be in the clear when the stress is released. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Various commenters recommended that OSHA establish a uniform minimum safe distance for all work areas (Ex. 5&hyph;18,
5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;34, 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;63, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92; Tr. W2 163, 197). OSHA agrees
with these commenters and has included a minimum two tree-length distance in this provision. The record shows that
this distance is necessary to protect employees from being injured or killed by trees under stress. According to the
WIR survey, 11 percent of employees who reported injuries said that wood being under tension had contributed to their
accident (Ex. 2&hyph;1). The OSHA FCI report indicated that four employees were killed when they were struck by propelled
or whiplashing tree limbs (Ex. 4&hyph;61).

Paragraphs (h)(2) (v), (vi) and (vii) require undercutting and backcutting of each tree being felled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In paragraph (h)(2)(v) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that each tree being felled be undercut unless the employer
demonstrates that felling the particular tree without an undercut will not create a hazard for an employee. This paragraph
also requires that the undercut be of a size so the tree will not split and will fall in the intended direction. The proposed
rule contained a provision requiring undercutting of each tree being felled, however, the proposed provision did
not provide for any exceptions. OSHA received many comments on this provision, which have been discussed above in
the Major Issues section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraphs (h)(2) (vi) and (vii) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that each tree be backcut. OSHA is also requiring
that the backcut allow for sufficient hinge wood to guide the tree and prevent it from prematurely slipping or twisting
off the trunk. OSHA is requiring that the backcut be above the horizontal cut of the undercut. In the final rule, OSHA
is allowing one exception to the backcut requirements. In tree pulling operations, the backcut may be at or below the
horizontal cut of the undercut. The proposed rule also contained provision requiring backcutting of each tree being
felled. The proposed rule did not allow any exceptions to the backcut requirement. OSHA received many comments on
these provisions, which have been discussed above in the Major Issues section.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (h)(3) of the final rule establishes various necessary work practices for bucking and limbing activities.
According to the WIR survey, 12 percent of the reported logging injuries occurred when the employee was bucking or
limbing (Ex. 2&hyph;1). The OSHA FCI report showed that 16 employees were killed during bucking and limbing operations
(Ex. 4&hyph;61). The work practice requirements contained in this paragraph address the hazards presented by log
movement on slopes, by wind-thrown timber and by trees that are yarded for bucking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (h)(3)(i) of the final rule requires that bucking and limbing that are done on any slope where rolling or
sliding of trees or logs is reasonably foreseeable must be done on the uphill side of the tree, unless the employer demonstrates
that it is not feasible for bucking or limbing to be done on the uphill side. This paragraph also requires that whenever
bucking or limbing is done on the downhill side, the tree must be secured against movement to prevent rolling or sliding.
The proposed rule also contained a provision requiring bucking and limbing to be done from the uphill side. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This provision was supported by one commenter (Ex. 5&hyph;17). The record shows that bucking and limbing from the
uphill side is necessary to protect employees from being hit or crushed by rolling or sliding trees or logs. As discussed
above, according to the WIR survey, nearly three-fifths of workers who reported injuries were working on moderate
to steep terrain at the time of their accident, and 10 percent of all injured workers said steep terrain had been a factor
in their accident (Ex. 2&hyph;1). Bucking or limbing can cause loss of support for the tree and cause it to shift, roll
or slide unexpectedly. Blocking or chocking a tree on a slope can never provide as much protection as avoiding the hazard
in the first place. The record shows that the only work method in which it can be assured that an employee will not be hurt
by a rolling or sliding tree is by performing bucking and limbing on the uphill side. As such, bucking and limbing from
the downhill side is permitted only in those cases when the employer is able to demonstrate that it is not feasible to
work from the uphill side. In those particular cases, the tree must be restrained to reduce as much as possible the possibility
of the tree rolling or sliding. OSHA notes that the burden of demonstrating infeasibility is on the employer. In addition,
the issue of the infeasibility of bucking and limbing from the uphill side must be determined on a case-by-case basis
when the tree and the conditions in the area are carefully assessed.

Paragraph (h)(3)(ii) requires that when bucking or limbing wind-thrown trees, precautions must be taken to prevent
the root wad, tree butt, or logs from striking an employee. These precautions include, but are not limited to, chocking
or moving the tree to a stable position before bucking or limbing. The proposed rule also contained a requirement for
bucking or limbing wind-thrown trees. However, the proposed rule did not specify what precautions should be taken.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters said that the proposed provision was too general to be useful (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;74
through 5&hyph;92). These commenters said that this was one of a series of proposed work practice requirements which
should be deleted from the final rule and included in topics that must be covered in training sessions. OSHA believes
that this work practice requirement is necessary to address the significant risk of injury during these activities.
According to the WIR survey, 12 percent of reported injuries occurred during bucking and limbing. OSHA does agree
with the commenters that these work practice requirements should also be addressed in training sessions.

Chipping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At paragraph (h)(4) of the final rule, OSHA has specified various work practices regarding chipping that is performed
at in-woods locations. Paragraph (h)(4)(i) of the final rule requires that access covers or doors not be opened until
the drum and disc is at a complete stop. The access covers and doors are the means by which employees are safeguarded
from the risk of contacting these parts while they are moving. This provision is adopted from the proposed rule. The
1978 ANSI logging standard also contains a similar provision. OSHA did not receive any comment opposing this provision.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that this requirement is necessary to keep employees away from the dangerous moving drums, discs, knives
and blower blades of a chipper. OSHA's FCI reported indicated that two employees have been killed while operating
a chipper or trying to free jammed logs (Ex. 4&hyph;61). The moving chipper mechanism presents significant hazards,
and employees need protection from contact with those mechanisms when they are moving. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (h)(4)(ii) of the final rule requires that infeed and discharge ports be guarded to prevent contact with
the disc, knives, or blower blades. This provision has been adopted from the proposed rule. There were no comments
opposing this provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (h)(4)(iii) of the final rule requires that the chipper be shut down and locked out in accordance with 29
CFR 1910.147 when an employee performs any servicing of maintenance on the chipper. The proposed rule required that
the chipper be shut down and locked out before an employee works in the infeed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA did not receive any comments opposing lockout of the chipper while working on the infeed. OSHA received one comment
stating that lockout should be expanded to apply when an employee is working on the drive mechanism or chipping disc
(Ex. 5&hyph;28). The lockout/tagout standard, 29 CFR 1910.147, applies to servicing and maintenance of all machines
and equipment in which the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
unexpected
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 energization or start up of the machine or equipment, or release of stored energy could cause injury to employees.
This includes machines and equipment used in logging operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The lockout-tagout standard permits employers to either place a lock or tag on any machine before beginning servicing.
However, OSHA believes that the environmental conditions involved in logging operations necessitates the use of
locks rather than tags when servicing chippers. As OSHA stated in the preamble of the lockout/tagout standard, it
is intended to interact with any new or revised standard to address the use of specific control measures on an individual
basis (54 FR 36644, 36665, Sept. 1, 1989). Selection of the specific method of control, at that time, will reflect a
thorough evaluation of the extent of exposure to the hazard, the risk of injury involving the particular machine or
industry, and the feasibility of applying a particular method of control. OSHA also pointed in the preamble of the
lockout/tagout standard that damage to or loss of tagout devices is a serious drawback to the use of tagout. Logging
operations are carried out in all kinds of weather, including rain, snow, ice and wind, and there is a significant possibility
that tags could be damaged or lost. In such circumstances, OSHA believes only locking machinery will provide adequate
protection for employees who are servicing it. Therefore, OSHA is requiring chippers to be shut down and lockout out
before an employee performs any servicing or maintenance activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (h)(4)(iv) of the final rule requires that detached chippers be chocked during usage on any slope when movement
of the chipper is reasonably foreseeable. As with other mobile equipment that is intended to be operated from a stationary
position, the unexpected movement of the equipment can endanger employees who are either operating the equipment
or in the path of the equipment when it moves. The vibration caused by the operation of the equipment can enhance the
potential for unintended equipment movement. Chocking of mobile equipment to prevent movement is recognized throughout
industry as a necessary and appropriate means to prevent unintended movement. For example, OSHA requires in 29 CFR
1910.178(k)(1) that trailers be chocked before being boarded by powered industrial trucks.

Paragraph (h)(5) specifies various work practice requirements covering yarding activities. Paragraph (h)(5)(i)
of the final rule requires that logs not be moved until each employee is in the clear. This provision has been adopted
from the proposed rule. Movement of logs when employees are in the immediate area can result in an injury to those employees.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the WIR survey, almost 20 percent of employees injured were involved in yarding operations at the time
of their accident (Ex. 2&hyph;1). When a log is moved on uneven, unimproved terrain, the exact path that the log will
follow is impossible to predict. When they are being moved, logs may roll over, or the loose end of a log may flip back
and forth (fishtail). Movement in an unanticipated direction can cause the log to strike an employee, causing serious
injury. OSHA has included this requirement in the final rule to ensure that when logs are moved, all personnel must
be safely positioned and not exposed to a hazard. OSHA did not receive any comments opposing this provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (h)(5)(ii) of the final rule requires that each choker be hooked and unhooked from the uphill side or end
of the tree or log when rolling or sliding is reasonably foreseeable, unless the employer demonstrates that it is not
feasible in the particular situation to hook or unhook the choker from the uphill side. This provision also requires
that when the choker is hooked or unhooked from the downhill side, the log shall be securely blocked or chocked to prevent
rolling or swinging. The proposed rule also specified that chokers be hooked and unhooked from the uphill side when
feasible unless the log is securely blocked to prevent rolling or swinging. The 1978 ANSI logging standard also contained
a similar requirement. There were no comments opposing this provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Employees who hook and unhook chokers on sloping terrains face the same hazard of rolling or sliding logs as do fellers,
buckers, limbers and other employees. According to the WIR survey, 19 percent of the injuries reported occurred during
choker setting, hooking and unhooking (Ex. 2&hyph;1). In addition, the WIR survey indicates that nearly three-fifths
of all workers injured were working on moderate to steep terrain at the time of their accidents. The final rule makes
clear OSHA's intention that all hooking and unhooking of chokers must be from the uphill side or end when rolling or
sliding is reasonably foreseeable. This is the only work location in which it can be assured that an employee will not
be hurt by a rolling or sliding tree. For this reason, hooking or unhooking chokers from the downhill side is not permitted
simply because the tree has been secured with a chock. Rather, the employer must evaluate on a case-by-case basis whether
it is possible to hook or unhook from the uphill side. Only when the employer has demonstrated that hooking or unhooking
the choker from the uphill side or end is not feasible in the particular situation is hooking or unhooking the choker
from the down hill side permitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (h)(5)(iii) of the final rule requires that each choker be positioned near the end of the log or tree length.
This provision was adopted from the proposed rule. There were no comments opposing this provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Positioning a choker at the end of the log ensures that the log is moved along its longitudinal axis. Hooking up and skidding
a tree or log requires much less energy than trying to move the tree or log sideways. If an employee were to try to move
a tree or log by dragging it sideways (perpendicular to its longitudinal axis) the tree or log could become wedged behind
another tree, a rock, or a stump, causing the premature failure of the haulage equipment and the possibility of employee
injury if the restraint were to suddenly break or release the tree or log. Because of these hazards, the usual practice
in non-cable yarding is to skid or drag a tree or log when moving it. When trees or logs are skidded, the choker is hooked
to the end of the tree or log and it is pulled along the ground. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (h)(5)(iv) of the final rule requires that each machine be positioned during winching so the machine and
winch are operated within their design limits. The proposed rule required that the machine be positioned so that the
winch line is as near in alignment as possible with the long axis of the machine, unless the machine is designed to be
used under different conditions of alignment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter opposed the proposed provision for several reasons (Ex. 5&hyph;34). First, the commenter said that
some machines, such as cats and skidders, are designed to sustain winching strain from a much broader angle than straight
behind the machine, therefore, the proposed provision was needlessly restrictive if the machine is being operated
within its rated capacity. Second, the commenter said it was not possible to comply with the provision in many situations.
For example, the commenter said arches are normally equipped with fairleads and grapples that swing sideways out
of alignment with the long axis of the machine. Third, the commenter said the provision would create a greater hazard
when winching is conducted on very steep terrain. In such cases, the commenter said, it is more important that the machine
be positioned to assure maximum stability rather than positioning the machine relative to the log being winched.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA recognizes that exact alignment is not always possible in the woods. OSHA also recognizes that a machine may have
a winch mounted on it that may work off the side or front of the machine, and that aligning the winch line with the long
axis of the machine may not be the safest manner to operate the winch.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA agrees with this commenter that what is most important is that the design limits of the machine and winch not be
exceeded. Therefore, OSHA has revised the wording of this provision to ensure that winching operations conducted
with machines are performed within the design limitations of the machines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (h)(5)(v) of the final rule requires that no line be moved unless the yarder operator has clearly received
and understood the signal to do so. This provision also requires that when the yarder operator is in doubt, the operator
must repeat the signal and wait for a confirming signal before moving any line. This provision has been adopted from
the proposed rule. A similar provision also was contained in the 1978 ANSI logging standard and in various State logging
standards (Ex. 2&hyph;14, 2&hyph;18, 2&hyph;20, 38J). OSHA did not receive any comments opposing this provision.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that adequate communication is necessary for the safe movement of trees and logs. If the yarder operator
begins moving the tree or log before the choker setter or chaser has moved to a safe location, the choker setter or chaser
could be injured if struck or caught by a yarding line, carriage, or choker, or by the tree or log. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (h)(5)(vi) of the final rule requires that the load shall not exceed the rated capacity of the pallet or other
carrier. This provision has been adopted from the proposed rule. OSHA did not receive any comments opposing this provision.
This provision is an outgrowth of the requirement that the rated capacity of machines shall not be exceeded. In order
to prevent machines from rollovers and tipovers, it is also essential that loads on trailers not exceed the maximum
capacity the trailer was designed to carry and the machine was designed to transport. If loads exceed the maximum capacity,
the machine operator will be at greater risk of rollover or tipover. As discussed above, a significant number of fatalities
have occurred in the logging industry due to rollover accidents. NIOSH reported that 80 logging employees were killed
in machine rollover accidents from 1980&hyph;85 (Ex. 5&hyph;42). The State of Washington reported that 12 logging
employees were killed in rollover accidents from 1977&hyph;83 (Ex. 4&hyph;129). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (h)(5)(vii) of the final rule requires that towed equipment must be attached to the machine or vehicle in
such a manner as to allow a 90 degree turn, to prevent overrunning of the towing machine or vehicle and to assure that
the operator is always in control of the towed equipment. Towed equipment includes but is not limited to skid pans,
pallets, arches and trailers. This provision parallels the proposed requirement. There were no comments opposing
this provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA's intention in this provision is two-fold. First, OSHA believes this provision is necessary to help reduce the
potential for rollover of vehicles or machines that are moving equipment to various work sites. For example, a trailer
carrying a maximum load could tip over or roll over and cause the towing machine or vehicle to roll over if the loaded
trailer cannot make a full 90 degree turn. Second, this provision is necessary to help assure that material handling
equipment is not overloaded. This provision must be viewed in conjunction with the requirement that loads must not
exceed the rated capacity of the trailer or other carrier on which it is being towed. For example, when towed equipment
exceeds the rated capacity of the towing trailer, it may overrun the towing machine or vehicle. When the rate capacity
of the trailer is exceeded there is an increased likelihood that the operator may lose control over the towed equipment
and an accident could result. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (h)(5)(viii) of the final rule requires that each yarding machine or vehicle, including its load, must
be operated with safe clearance from all obstructions. This provision has been adopted from the proposed rule. There
were no comments opposing this requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (h)(5)(ix) of the final rule requires that each yarded tree must be placed in a location that does not create
a hazard for an employee and be placed in an orderly manner so that the trees are stable before other work, such as bucking
or limbing, is commenced. The proposed rule required that trees yarded for bucking shall be safely located and stable
before bucking is commenced. There were no comments opposing this provision.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the final rule, OSHA has expanded this provision to provide that no work is commenced until yarded trees are stabilized
and safely located. OSHA believes it is necessary to apply this provision to all work done in the area of yarded trees.
The WIR survey indicates that the single greatest cause of accidents in the logging industry is being injured by a tree,
log or limb and a significant number of employees were injured performing bucking and limbing (Ex. 2&hyph;1). If operations,
such as bucking or limbing, are located too close to other work operations, unsuspecting loggers could be injured
by a rolling log. Moreover, if yarded trees or stacks of trees are not stabilized, loggers performing work activities
involving these trees could be at substantial risk of injury if the unstabilized trees move, shift or roll. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the final rule, OSHA has not retained two proposed requirements from this paragraph. The first would have required
the examination of spar trees for defects before they are rigged. This provision has been deleted because it relates
to the construction of cable yarding systems that is not covered by the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second provision would have required unstable trees and spars to be guyed to ensure stability. Some commenters
said that requiring employees to climb on and rig unstable trees presents a greater hazard than does felling an unguyed
tree (Ex. 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;21). The weight of the climber and his rigging gear could cause the tree to break off and
fall over, resulting in serious injury or death to the climber. OSHA has addressed in other ways the hazards associated
with danger trees through other practice requirements. For example, the final rule requires danger trees to be felled
or removed before any work can be commenced in the area.

Loading and Unloading 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (h)(6) of the final rule specifies various work practice requirements regarding loading and unloading
trees onto transport machines or vehicles. These requirements were based on those in the 1978 logging standard and
various State logging standards (Ex. 2&hyph;17, 2&hyph;18, 2&hyph;19, 2&hyph;20, 2&hyph;22, 38J, 38K). OSHA believes
these work practices are necessary to protect employees from being hit by machines, vehicles, trees and logs during
loading and unloading. The WIR survey indicates that five percent of the injuries reported occurred during loading
or unloading (Ex. 2&hyph;1). The State of Washington study indicated that five percent of all deaths occurred during
loading and unloading operations (Ex. 4&hyph;129). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (h)(6)(i) of the final rule requires that the transport machine or vehicle be positioned to provide working
clearance between the vehicle and deck of trees or logs. This provision parallels the requirement contained in the
proposed rule. The 1978 ANSI logging standard contained a similar provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters supported the need for adequate room between transport equipment and trees or logs (Ex. 5&hyph;21,
5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92). These commenters pointed out that room needs to be provided on the landing for the transport
machine or vehicle and its counterweights, especially when landings are on sloped terrain. The record supports these
commenters' position. According to the State of Washington study, almost 10 percent of all deaths reported occurred
when an employee was struck by mobile equipment and five percent of all deaths involved employees performing loading
operations (Ex. 4&hyph;129). OSHA believes that the employer must consider several factors in determining an adequate
work clearance for loading and unloading. These factors include, but are not limited to, the type of loading machine
and transport vehicle being used, the physical characteristics of the load being moved, and the layout of the area
where the operation is being conducted. For example, if the vehicle is a self-loading log truck, it will have to be positioned
close to the deck of logs to allow the truck to be loaded. On the other hand, if a crane or other material handling machine
is used to load and unload the transport vehicle, the machine must be positioned so that it can reach both the deck of
logs and the vehicle without exceeding the rated capacity of the machine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (h)(6)(ii) of the final rule requires that only the loading or unloading machine operator and other personnel
that the employer demonstrates are essential shall be allowed in the work area during loading and unloading. This
provision parallels the provision contained in the proposed rule and in the 1978 ANSI logging standard. There were
no comments opposing this provision. OSHA believes this provision is necessary because, as discussed above, many
injuries and fatalities in the logging industry involve loading operations. For example, the State of Washington
study reported that three employees were killed when they were struck by logs falling from the transport vehicle during
loading (Ex. 4&hyph;129).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the final rule, OSHA is clarifying its intention that the employer bears the burden of proving that personnel other
than the machine operator who are in the loading or unloading area are essential to that activity. OSHA notes that this
is a case-by-case determination that requires the employer to evaluate the needs and conditions present at the time.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (h)(6)(iii) of the final rule requires that no transport vehicle operator remain in the cab during loading
and unloading if logs are carried or moved over the cab, unless the employer demonstrates that it is essential for the
operator to be in the cab. This provision also requires that when the transport vehicle operator remains in the cab
during loading or unloading operations, the employer must provide operator protection such as, but not limited to,
reinforcement of the cab. The proposed rule specifies that no transport vehicle operator remain in the cab during
loading and unloading unless the employer demonstrates that it was necessary for the operator to be in the cab. The
1978 ANSI logging standard contained a similar requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA received many comments on this provision (Ex. 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;33, 5&hyph;34, 5&hyph;74 through
5&hyph;92). Several commenters stated that there were so many situations in which it is essential for transport vehicle
operators to be in the cab or on the vehicle during loading and unloading that the exceptions would overwhelm the rule
(Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;34, 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92). For example, commenters said that self-loading
logging trucks must be operated by the driver from an elevated seat above the cab (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;36). In other
loading operations the operator is required to move the transport vehicle back and forth in the loading chute to position
the log on the load (Ex. 5&hyph;34). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters said that the cab may be the safest place for the transport vehicle operator to be during loading
and unloading (Ex. 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;33, 5&hyph;34). One commenter said that greater hazards were posed for the
operator when not in the cab (Ex. 5&hyph;34). For example, the operator outside the cab can be struck by logs that fall
off the load or come out of the jaws of the loading machine, or by the loading machine itself. This commenter pointed
out that in the State of Washington there have been numerous fatalities and serious injuries reported when the operator
was outside the cab, but none reported when the operator was in the cab (Ex. 5&hyph;34). As such, this commenter said
that many logging establishments will only permit logs to be unloaded if the transport vehicle operator is in the cab
(Ex. 5&hyph;34). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes the record shows that in some situations the safest place for the transport vehicle operator will be
in the cab (e.g., Ex. 4&hyph;129). The WIR survey appears to support this position, in that only three percent of all
injuries reported involved mobile equipment (Ex. 2&hyph;1). By contrast, almost one-fourth of all injuries reported
resulted from being hit by a tree or falling in the work site. However, there are some hazards to operators who remain
in cabs during loading and unloading. Any time logs are carried or moved over the cab, it is possible due to equipment
failure or operator error that the log could fall on the cab and seriously injure the operator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In other standards OSHA has recognized the hazard of carrying loads over people. These standards include requirements
that material handling equipment operators avoid this practice (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 29 CFR 1910.179, 29 CFR 1910.180, 29 CFR 1910.181). In many new self-loading trucks, the hoist mechanism is behind
the cab, a location which prevents the movement of logs over the cab (Ex. 5&hyph;71). In other situations, however,
logs are still moved or carried over the cab. It is not safe for the operator to be in the cab in those situations. Therefore,
when logs are carried or moved over the cab, the final rule requires that the operator not remain in the cab if the employer
has not demonstrated that it is essential for the operator to do so. If it is essential for the operator to be in the cab
when logs are carried or moved over the cab, the employer must provide protection for the operator. The final rule states
that this protection includes but is not limited to reinforcement of the cab.

Paragraph (h)(6)(iv) of the final rule requires that each log be placed on the transport vehicle in an orderly manner
and tightly secured. This provision parallels the requirement contained in the proposed rule. There were no comments
opposing this provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that this provision is necessary to protect employees from the hazards that result from haphazard loading
and inadequately securing the load. For example, when the load is not properly stacked and/or tightly secured, logs
can swing in the tie downs and hit an employee. In addition, the load can shift and cause both the trailer and transport
machine or vehicle to rollover. Proper stowage of vehicle loads has the added advantage of providing, in most cases,
a more compact load with a lower center of gravity, one that is safer to move. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (h)(6)(v) of the final rule requires that the load be positioned to prevent slippage or loss during handling
and transport. This requirement parallels the provision contained in the proposed rule. OSHA did not receive any
comments opposing this provision. A load that is improperly positioned can roll or shift at any time, thereby potentially
endangering any employee who might be close at hand. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (h)(6)(vi) of the final rule requires that each stake and chock used to trip loads must be constructed so
the tripping mechanism is activated on the side opposite the release of the load. OSHA has adopted this provision from
the proposed rule. The 1978 ANSI logging standard also contained a similar provision. There were no comments opposing
this provision. OSHA believes this provision is necessary to protect employees from sudden or unexpected shifts
or movements of the logs when a load is released. Only by keeping employees out of the potential paths of the shifting
or moving logs can there be assurance that the employee will not be struck by a log. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (h)(6)(vii) of the final rule requires that each tie down be left in place over the peak log to secure the logs
until the unloading lines or other equivalent protection have been put in place. This provision also specifies that
a stake of sufficient strength to withstand forces of shifting logs shall be considered to provide protection equivalent
to a tie down, provided that the logs are not loaded higher than the stake. This provision parallels the requirement
contained in the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The West Virginia Forestry Association supported this provision (Ex. 5&hyph;54). They said that several recent
serious logging accidents had occurred in their state because logs loaded too high have fallen off the transport vehicle.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due to the vibration of the load during transport, the load can shift or move so that when the restraints are removed,
the load will roll or otherwise fall off the truck, thereby endangering the employee who must remove the restraints.
For this reason, OSHA has specified the necessary and appropriate work practices that must be followed to ensure the
safe unloading of transport vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (h)(6)(viii) of the final rule requires that each tie down be released only from the side on which the unloading
machine operates. This provision also permits two exceptions to this requirement in situations when the tie down
is released by a remote control device and when the employee making the release is protected by racks, stanchions or
other protection the employer demonstrates is capable of withstanding the force of moving and shifting logs. This
requirement parallels the provision contained in the proposed rule and the 1978 ANSI logging standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters suggested that the exceptions to the release requirement be eliminated (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;36,
5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92). However, these commenters did not provide any discussion to support their position.
OSHA believes that adequate protection is provided in the alternate releasing methods that are excepted from this
provision to protect the machine or vehicle operator from being hit by moving or shifting trees or logs.

Paragraph (h)(7) of the final rule requires the transport vehicle operator to assure that each tie down is tight before
transporting the load. In addition, this paragraph requires that while en route, the operator shall check and tighten
tie downs whenever there is reason to believe that the tie downs have loosened or the load has shifted. The proposed
rule also contained a provision requiring the transport operator to assure that tie downs have been tightened and
to check and tighten the tie downs as necessary while en route. The 1978 ANSI logging standard contained a provision
similar to the proposed rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter opposed the provision, believing that the provision required transport vehicle operators to implement
a regular schedule of stopping and checking on tie downs, regardless of whether there is reason to suspect they are
loose (Ex. 5&hyph;35). OSHA has more clearly stated its original intention in the final that the operator must check
tie downs whenever there is reason to believe they are loose or the load has shifted. For example, this would occur if
an operator can feel the load shift, or knows that the transport vehicle has hit an object or pothole which jarred the
load. OSHA believes this work practice is necessary to protect the transport vehicle operator from having an accident
due to logs shifting or breaking the tie downs. In addition, this provision is necessary to protect the transport vehicle
operator from being hit by shifting or moving trees when he unloads the vehicle.

Paragraph (h)(8) of the final rule requires that each deck of logs be stacked and located so it is stable and provides
each employee with enough room to safely move and work in the area. This provision has been adopted from the proposal.
The 1978 ANSI logging standard contained a similar requirement. There were no comments opposing this provision.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This provision combines two different requirements. First, this paragraph requires that decks and piles of logs
be constructed so they are stable. OSHA believes that decks must be carefully stacked so logs do not shift, roll or fall
off the deck and strike an employee who may be working or passing through the storage area. Second, this paragraph requires
that the work activities in the vicinity of the storage are well-planned so enough room is provided for those work activities
so that an employee is not harmed if the stacked logs shift, roll or fall. OSHA believes these work practices are necessary
to protect employees working in the landing area. According to the WIR survey, 20 percent of injuries reported involved
accidents at landing areas.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In paragraph (i) of the final rule OSHA has specified various training requirements. For several reasons OSHA believes
training is a critical element in a integrated control program to reduce the number of accidents, and consequently,
the number of fatalities and injuries in the logging industry. First, the logging industry is a high hazard industry.
Employees need to be made aware of the various hazards so they can actively participate in making the workplace safe.
According to the WIR survey, 10 percent of the workers who reported injuries said that being unaware of the hazard had
contributed to their accident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, training is also essential in achieving compliance with the substantive requirements of the standard, including
the use of personal protective equipment and safe work practices. Without effective training, employees may not
be aware of how to perform their job safely or how the integrated controls can reduce injuries and fatalities. Third,
training is especially important in complying with the logging standard because the standard relies heavily on safe
work practices to prevent accidents from occurring. Employees who are not trained in how to perform their job safely
can put themselves and other employees at risk of injury. Various studies of accidents in the logging industry indicate
that poor work practices are a major contributing factor (Ex. 2&hyph;1, 4&hyph;3, 4&hyph;14, 4&hyph;15, 4&hyph;61,
4&hyph;63, 4&hyph;121, 4&hyph;125, 4&hyph;129, 4&hyph;138, 4&hyph;172, 5&hyph;20). For example, according
to an accident study conducted by one commenter, 40 percent of accidents were due to poor planning, 40 percent were
due to poor technique, and 15 to 18 percent were due to carelessness (Ex. 5&hyph;20). Only 2 to 5 percent of the accidents
were due to equipment failure. The WIR survey indicated that poor work practices of employees or a co-worker were a
contributing factor in more than one-half of all accidents reported (Ex. 2&hyph;1). OSHA's FCI report indicated
that unsafe work practices and misjudgments accounted for 42 percent of logging employees who were killed (Ex. 4&hyph;61).

Fourth, training is necessary to correct unsafe behavior before it results in injury to the employee or others. In
the WIR survey, injured loggers reported that among the factors that contributed to the accident were coworker's
activity, misjudging time and distance needed to avoid injury, using wrong cutting methods and not paying full attention
to work. In addition, a State of Washington study of fatalities in the logging industry from 1977&hyph;83 concluded
that over 90 percent of the deaths had been preventable (Ex. 4&hyph;129). Therefore, when unsafe behavior is observed,
it is important that proper work practices be reinforced through additional training. Fifth, according to the WIR
survey, more than one third of all those injured had never received training. Moreover, more than one half of injured
loggers working in non-western States (i.e., States without logging standards and training requirements) had never
received training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sixth, the logging industry itself supports the value of training in reducing accidents (Ex. 4&hyph;181, 5&hyph;6,
5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;19, 5&hyph;20, 5&hyph;22, 5&hyph;29, 5&hyph;33, 5&hyph;42, 5&hyph;43, 5&hyph;44, 5&hyph;45,
5&hyph;47, 5&hyph;59, 9&hyph;5, 9&hyph;6; Tr. W2 125, OR 566). Many commenters said their accident rates decreased
after they implemented a training program (Ex. 5&hyph;33, 9&hyph;5, 9&hyph;6; Tr. W2 125, OR 566). One company achieved
a 63-percent reduction in lost workdays within a year of implementing training (Tr. W2 125). The Montana Logging Association
reported that member companies had decreased accidents by 52 percent after implementing training (Tr. OR 566). A
study for the International Woodworkers of America found a 71-percent reduction in accidents in establishments
in the Pacific Northwest region who had implemented training programs (Ex. 4&hyph;181). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (i)(1) requires that training be provided for each employee, including supervisors, at no cost to the employee.
The proposed rule also required each employee to be trained. This provision clarifies OSHA's intent that supervisors
also must receive training. OSHA believes that it is important that supervisors be trained since they are responsible
for making work assignments, determining work areas, providing consultation when hazardous situations arise,
determining when new employees can begin to work independently, and identifying and correcting unsafe job performance
of employees they supervise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters raised the issue of cost and availability of training programs, especially for small establishments
(Ex. 5&hyph;19, 5&hyph;32, 5&hyph;51). However, other commenters said there are training resources that are readily
available for logging establishments (Ex. 5&hyph;20, 5&hyph;27, 5&hyph;52, 5&hyph;69, 36, 9&hyph;1). These include
logging associations and companies which currently offer logging training programs and traveling training seminars,
and video tapes which are available to employers. For example, the Alaska Timber Insurance Exchange has established
a video library for policyholders to use as training supplements (Ex. 9&hyph;15). The American Pulpwood Association
said it was developing a logging training that was to be available by the end of 1989 (Ex. 5&hyph;27). The Associated
Oregon Loggers has also developed logging training programs for member companies (Ex. 36). One training company
indicated it was currently providing a variety of different logging training programs in six different States (Ex.
5&hyph;20). OSHA also notes that several commenters have expressed their willingness to work with OSHA to train loggers
(Ex. 5&hyph;18, 5&hyph;20, 5&hyph;27, 5&hyph;47, 5&hyph;52, 5&hyph;69). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (i)(2) requires that training be provided as follows: as soon as possible but not later than the effective
date of this section for initial training of each current employee who has not previously received training; prior
to initial assignment for each new employee who has not previously received training; whenever an employee is assigned
new work tasks, tools, equipment, machines or vehicles; and whenever an employee demonstrates unsafe job performance.
When the proposed rule did not require initial training for each current employee, the proposed rule would have required
training prior to initial assignment; annual retraining of each employee; and retraining whenever changes in job
assignment would expose the employee to new or additional hazards. OSHA received many comments on the training provisions,
some of which have already been discussed above in the Major Issues section.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters raised the issue of whether experienced and/or previously trained employees would be required to
be retrained (Ex. 5&hyph;19, 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;28, 5&hyph;29, 5&hyph;33, 5&hyph;35, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;43, 5&hyph;49,
5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92, 9&hyph;1; Tr. W1 63, OR 85). Some commenters favored training of all workers, regardless
of their previous employment experience (Ex. 5&hyph;19, 5&hyph;28, 5&hyph;29, 5&hyph;35). Other commenters said
that previously trained or experienced workers should be excepted from training requirements (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;36,
5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;43, 5&hyph;49, 5&hyph;52, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above in the Major Issues section, OSHA believes that employees who have never received training must
be trained, regardless of their level of experience. The need to provide training for experienced loggers who have
not previously received such training is supported by the WIR survey, that indicates that over one third of those injured
had never received training and 56 percent of those injured had worked in the logging industry for 5 years or more. By
contrast, only 22 percent of those injured had worked in the logging industry for one year or less. In addition, the
WIR survey indicates that the employees who were injured performed the activity in which they were injured on almost
a daily basis. (OSHA is allowing an exception to initial training for previously trained employees. See discussion
of paragraph (i)(5)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA also received several comments on annual retraining of employees. Some commenters said annual retraining is
necessary (Ex. 5&hyph;34, 5&hyph;43, 9&hyph;3, 9&hyph;9, 9&hyph;13, 9&hyph;20). One commenter said that machine
operators should be retrained at least annually (Ex. 5&hyph;34). However, other commenters questioned the need
for annual retraining of loggers and suggested that retraining could be handled in regular safety and health meetings
(Ex. 5&hyph;19, 5&hyph;29, 5&hyph;43). One commenter also said retraining should be limited to an ``as needed basis''
(Ex. 5&hyph;19). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has addressed these concerns in the final rule. Instead of an annual retraining provision, the final rule contains
provisions requiring employers to hold safety and health meetings at least once a month (paragraph (i)(11)), and
to retrain any employee who demonstrates unsafe job performance. OSHA agrees with the commenters that these new provisions
are more responsive to addressing new hazards and unsafe job performance than is an annual retraining requirement.
These provisions also require the employer to address unsafe job performance immediately. These provisions require
the employer to address new hazards as they appear in the workplace in monthly safety and health meetings. In addition
to being more responsive to hazards as they appear in the workplace, OSHA believes these provisions will be less burdensome
on employers, especially small employers with limited resources. OSHA anticipates that only a portion of employees
will need to be retrained due to unsafe job performance. Also OSHA believes that for many employers ongoing monthly
safety and health meetings will be incorporated into job planning meetings that are well-established in the logging
industry. (Safety and health meetings are addressed further in discussion of paragraph (i)(11)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA received comments supporting the need for training of new inexperienced employees and training employees assigned
to new job tasks, tools, equipment, machines or vehicles (Ex. 5&hyph;19, 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;28). There were no comments
opposing these provisions, therefore, OSHA has retained these requirements in the final rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA has added the requirement of retraining of employees demonstrating unsafe job performance based on practice
in the industry. OSHA received comment that some employers who are providing training do require retraining where
unsafe job performance is identified (Ex. 29). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule also contained minimum training elements that included recognition of safety hazards associated
with the employee's particular work tasks and the protective and preventive measures to deal with those hazards;
recognition and prevention of general safety hazards in the logging industry; and safe use and maintenance of any
machine, equipment or tool used by an employee. One commenter agreed that training should list the hazards of each
step of an employee's job and describe how these particular hazards could be controlled (Ex. 5&hyph;17). There were
no comments opposing this provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the final rule, OSHA has added the requirement that employees be trained in the procedures, practices and requirements
of the employer's work site in recognition of the number of comments who describe the logging industry as highly transient
(Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92). While new employees may be experienced and well-trained in the recognition
of hazards of the job and in the safe use of equipment of the trade, they may be unaware of the operating protocol of a particular
establishment, such as how work activities are organized, or what system of signals is being used. OSHA has also added
a provision in the final rule requiring that each employee be trained in the requirements of this section. OSHA believes
it is important that employees know the various provisions of this section so they can actively participate in contributing
to their own protection. This provision is included in other OSHA standards (e.g., 29 CFR 1910.132, 29 CFR 1910.146,
29 CFR 1910.1047). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (i)(4) of the final rule permits the employer to limit training of an employee due to unsafe job performance
and for any employee assigned to new work tasks, tools, equipment, machines or vehicles to those content elements
in paragraph (i)(3) that are relevant to the circumstances giving rise to the need for training. The proposed rule
did not contain a similar provision. OSHA has added this provision to reduce the burden of the training requirement
by allowing employers to focus the additional training on the elements necessary to prepare the employee to safely
perform the job or operate a new piece of equipment. For example, OSHA is aware that an employee who is assigned to operate
a new machine, may not need retraining in recognition of general hazards in the logging industry or the requirements
of the logging standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In paragraph (i)(5) of the final rule OSHA establishes certain exceptions to the training requirement. Current and
new employees who have received training previously do not need to be retrained in those elements of paragraph (i)(3)
for which they have received training. This paragraph also reinforces that each current and new employee must still
receive training in those elements for which they have not previously been trained. Even though certain limited exceptions
to the training requirements are allowed, this paragraph reinforces that the employer is responsible for ensuring
that each current and new employee can properly and safely perform the work tasks and operate the tools, equipment,
machines and vehicles used in their job. The proposed rule would have required new employees to be trained, regardless
of whether they were experienced or had been trained previously, before initial assignment. The proposed standard
also would have required each new and current employee to receive annual retraining. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters were confused about who was required to be trained under the proposed rule and many commenters
opposed retraining of previously trained workers (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;33, 5&hyph;35, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;43,
5&hyph;53; Tr. W1 63, OR 85). According to these commenters, employees move from employer to employer and requiring
retraining of each new employee would be both duplicative and costly. As discussed above in the Major Issues section,
OSHA has addressed the commenters' concerns by allowing previous training to be acceptable in lieu of new initial
training for both current and new employees. In order to determine whether the training exception is applicable to
a particular employee, the employer must first ascertain whether previous training has satisfied the training content
requirements of paragraph (i)(3). Determining whether previous training meets the requirements of this section
should not be difficult with regard to current employees. Employers can examine their training materials to ensure
that each of the training content requirements has already been covered in training sessions. OSHA notes that each
current and new employee will at least have to be trained in the requirements of this new standard. OSHA believes that
many employers will provide training on the new final rule in the monthly safety and health meetings

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It may, however, require additional effort for the employer to determine whether a new employee has received training
that meets the requirements of the final rule. An employer cannot merely ask the new employee whether he has been trained.
Rather, under the training certification requirements of this paragraph (see paragraph (i)(10)), the employer
must make a determination of whether and when the past training was adequate to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To determine whether past training was adequate, the employer will have to go through two steps. First, the employer
must inquire whether the new employee had training in each of the elements specified in paragraph (i)(3). When the
new employee indicates that he has not received training in a particular element, the employer will need to provide
training in that element. Second, when the employee indicates that he had received training in each of the required
elements, the employer must then determine whether the particular training was adequate. Most likely, the employer
will make that determination while the new employee is working under close supervision of a designated person, as
required by this paragraph. When the new employee, who has been previously trained, can demonstrate the ability to
safely perform the job independently, the employee can then determine and certify that previous training had been
adequate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At paragraph (i)(6) of the final rule, OSHA requires that each new employee and each employee who is required to be trained
by this paragraph, to work under the close supervision of a designated person until the employee is able to demonstrate
the ability to safely perform the new job independently. The proposed rule contained two provisions specifying initial
close supervision. One provision specified initial close supervision for all power tool and machine operators and
associated maintenance personnel. The second provided initial close supervision for each new employee, and each
newly trained employee. In addition, the State of Oregon logging standard requires initial close supervision for
new employees and requires experienced new employees to demonstrate their competence before being allowed to perform
the job independently (Ex. 38K). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters supported this provision (Ex. 5&hyph;22, 5&hyph;42, 5&hyph;33, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;53, 5&hyph;55,
5&hyph;63, 9&hyph;9; Tr. W1 91&hyph;92, 172&hyph;73, OR 151&hyph;52, 216, 373, 377, 410). NIOSH said it was important
in the logging industry to have an adequate balance of classroom and on-the-job training (Ex. 5&hyph;42). NIOSH said
working with a designated person would be especially effective for pointing out poisonous plants to inexperienced
workers (Ex. 5&hyph;42). Several commenters also supported limiting this provision to only inexperienced workers
(Ex. 5&hyph;33, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;53, 5&hyph;62, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has carefully considered the comments and has decided for several reasons that it is necessary in the final rule
to retain the requirement that each new and each newly-trained employee work under the close supervision of a designated
person initially. There are several reasons for this determination. First, this requirement acts as a final check
on the competency of a newly-trained employee by allowing the employer to measure in practical terms how well the employee
has absorbed the training. Second, this provision is also a measure of the general effectiveness and adequacy of the
employer's training program. When employees are not able to demonstrate the ability to perform the job safely, the
employer needs to review and correct the training program and retrain the workers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, OSHA believes this provision is essential given the inclusion of an initial training exception in the final
rule for previously trained workers. As discussed earlier, more than 60 percent of all loggers who reported injuries
in the WIR survey had been previously trained (Ex. 2&hyph;1). This data supports the need for safeguards to integrating
new employees into the workplace if initial training of each new employee is not required. Finally, this provision
is also a safeguard for integrating newly-trained employees and employees whose unsafe job performance has necessitated
retraining. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (i)(7) of the final rule specifies various requirements regarding first-aid training for each employee,
including supervisors. Paragraph (i)(7)(i) of the final rule requires that the employer assure that each employee
receives or has received first-aid and CPR training. This provision also requires that first-aid training meet at
least the requirements of Appendix B. The proposed rule would have required only supervisors, fellers and at least
one additional person in each operating area to have first-aid training. The proposed rule also would have required
that the first-aid training content meet the training programs of the American Red Cross, the Mine Safety and Health
Administration (MSHA) or other equivalent program.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed above in the Major Issues section, OSHA is expanding the requirement on first-aid training to all employees.
According to the WIR survey, more than one-half of all injuries occurred at cutting sites, that in most cases are remote
from medical facilities and personnel (Ex. 2&hyph;1). Also as discussed above in the Major Issues section, OSHA is
not requiring employers to provide the first-aid training. The employer can meet the requirements of the standard
by assuring that employees he hires already have taken first-aid training. The employer can also meet this requirement
by requiring any worker in his employ to take a first-aid training course from any organization in the community whose
program meets the requirements of this standard. In addition, the standard does not require repeat first-aid training
for workers who have received first-aid training previously, provided the training has met the content requirements
of this standard and their first-aid certificate is current. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to first-aid training content, Appendix B specifies the minimum content of required first-aid training.
This content list includes training in emergency situations that are most likely to arise in the logging industry,
such as control of bleeding and shock, immobilization of injured persons, treatment of sprains and fractures, and
treatment of contact with poisonous plants or animals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For several reasons, in the final rule, OSHA has specified the minimum first-aid training requirements rather than
simply referring to programs provided by various organizations. First, the content list is in keeping with OSHA's
goal of developing performance language standards. Second, the content list in Appendix B focuses on the types of
situations that are most likely to occur in the logging industry and in remote work sites. General first-aid training
programs may not thoroughly cover the kinds of situations found in the logging industry. Third, the content of training
programs offered by various organizations may change and an element crucial to first aid in remote outdoor locations
may be dropped. By specifying the minimum content, the standard places training organizations on notice as to what
elements their program must include in order to meet the requirements of this standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fourth, by expressing the first-aid training requirements in performance language, OSHA is providing employers
with maximum flexibility. Employers will not have to research the Red Cross and MSHA training programs to see if a training
program offered locally by another organization meets the requirements of this standard. In addition, by specifying
the content, the standard leaves employers free to develop their own first-aid training program or rely on outside
organizations to provide first aid training. Fifth, since the final standard permits employers to require their
employees to take first-aid training rather than providing the training, it is important to provide employees with
an understandable criteria for determining whether the training program they select meets the requirements of this
standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (i)(7)(ii) of the final rule requires that the employer assure that each employee receives first-aid training
at least every three years and receives CPR training at least annually. The proposed rule did not contain a similar
requirement. Most first-aid training organizations require retraining at the above frequency in order to maintain
a current certificate (Ex. 5&hyph;42). OSHA agrees with these organizations that it is necessary to refresh one's
first-aid skills on a regular basis. Since these skills are not usually used on a daily basis, trained persons may become
less able to render these skills over time without periodic refresher training. In addition, what constitutes the
best first-aid techniques and procedures changes over time. Employees need to be retrained so their skills include
the best and most current practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (i)(7)(iii) of the final rule requires that the employer assure that each employee's first aid and CPR training
and/or certificate of training remain current. The proposed rule did not contain a similar requirement. OSHA believes
this provision is essential given the inclusion of the exception in the final rule for previously trained workers.
In addition, it is essential because employers can comply with the first-aid training provisions without actually
providing the training themselves. In essence, this provision is similar to the provision in paragraph (i)(5) reinforcing
that the employer is responsible for assuring that the employee can safely perform the job, even if the employer has
not been required to actually provide the training. Regardless of whether the employer provides training or allows
employees to take a first-aid program offered by another organization, the employer is still responsible for assuring
that employees can render first aid properly if called upon.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At paragraph (i)(8) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that training be conducted by a designated person. As discussed
above, a designated person is an employee who has the requisite knowledge, training and experience to perform the
specific duties. The proposed rule did not contain a similar requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters said that it was important that training be conducted by a qualified or certified person (Ex. 9&hyph;3,
9&hyph;13, 9&hyph;16). OSHA has included this provision in the final rule because the Agency wants to assure that
regardless of whether employers rely on their own personnel to conduct training or utilize outside experts, the person
providing training must have the necessary qualifications and background in the subject matter being taught. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (i)(9) of the final rule requires that training required by this section be presented in a manner that the
employee is able to understand. This provision also requires that the employer assure that training materials are
appropriate in content and vocabulary to the educational level, literacy and language skills of the employees being
trained. A similar provision was not contained in the proposed rule. OSHA has added this provision in the final rule
as a way of ensuring that all employees, regardless of their cultural or educational background, will receive adequate
training on how to perform their job safely. OSHA notes that this requirement applies to both logging and first-aid
training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (i)(10) requires the certification of training. While this provision was not contained in the proposed
rule, several commenters stressed the need to document training (Ex. 9&hyph;16, 9&hyph;18; Tr. OR 137, 558&hyph;59,
643&hyph;44). OSHA agrees with these commenters that documenting training is necessary. First, in the final rule
OSHA has allowed prior training to be acceptable in lieu of initial training. In the proposed rule, OSHA had required
that each new employee, regardless of experience and prior training, receive training prior to initial assignment.
In order to accept prior training in lieu of new training, OSHA believes employers must establish a process for determining
whether the prior training was adequate. The certification procedure provides that process without imposing a significant
burden. Second, several commenters said that many establishments do not currently document training (Tr. W1 95,
OR 92). As such, employers do not have any records to indicate whether appropriate training has been provided. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, some commenters testified that all training programs should be written programs (Ex. 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;42).
While many large logging establishments already have implemented impressive written training programs, OSHA is
also aware that a written training and recordkeeping requirement would impose a paperwork burden and significant
burden on small employers in this industry (Ex. 5&hyph;44). OSHA believes that training certification is a less burdensome
way of documenting whether employees have been adequately trained. OSHA notes that the time and costs of training
certification have been included in the final regulatory impact analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (i)(10)(i) of the final rule requires that the employer verify compliance with paragraph (i) of this section
by preparing a written certification record. This provision also requires that the written certification record
contain the name or other identity of the employee trained, the date(s) of the training, and the signature of the person
who conducted the training or the signature of the employer. In addition, this provision requires that if the employer
relies on training conducted prior to the employee being hired or prior to the effective date of this section, the certification
record shall indicate the date the employer determined the prior training was adequate rather than the date of actual
training. The proposed rule did not contain a certification requirement.

The Agency is adding this new provision to the final rule in large part because it is allowing prior training to be accepted
in place of a new round of training. OSHA recognizes, given the transient nature of the workforce in this industry,
that in many cases an employer will be unable to identify the date on which previous training was provided by another
employer. In those cases, OSHA believes that knowing the date of the prior training is not as important as the employer's
determination as to whether the prior training is adequate. As such, OSHA is requiring employers to certify on what
date they determine the prior training to be adequate. In the final rule OSHA has included a measurable way to determine
when and whether prior training had been adequate. The final rule requires that each new employee work under close
supervision of a designated person until the employee demonstrates the ability to safely perform the job independently.
In most cases, therefore, this demonstration date will constitute the certification date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (i)(10)(ii) of the final rule requires that the most recent training certification be maintained. This
provision has been included to limit the number of records that the employer is required to maintain on training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (i)(11) of the final rule requires that the employer hold safety and health meetings as necessary and at
least each month for each employee. This provision allows safety and health meetings to be conducted individually,
in crew meetings, in larger groups, or as part of other staff meetings. The proposed rule did not contain a safety and
health meeting requirement. Many State logging standards also require regular safety and health meetings in the
logging industry (Ex. 2&hyph;17, 2&hyph;22, 2&hyph;23, 36, 38K). For example, the State of Washington logging standard
requires safety meetings to be held monthly and whenever work is started at a new work site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters supported the need for regular and ongoing safety and health meetings for both inexperienced and
experienced workers (Ex. 5&hyph;7, 5&hyph;19, 5&hyph;28; Tr. W1 93&hyph;95, 163, OR 92, 110, 137, 197, 204, 276,
335, 374, 643&hyph;44, 691&hyph;92). Several of these commenters indicated that many establishments in the industry
already hold safety and health meetings on a regular basis. Several commenters said safety and health meetings were
an effective way of informing employees about hazards and keeping their safety awareness high (Ex. 5&hyph;19, 5&hyph;28;
Tr. W1 93&hyph;95, 163, 189&hyph;90, OR 92, 110, 137, 204, 276, 374, 643&hyph;44). One commenter said that documented
monthly safety and health meetings were necessary on all logging operations ``to instill the necessary safe work
attitude in all logging employees'' (Ex. 5&hyph;28). Commenters also said safety and health meetings were good for
providing targeted information (Tr. W1 94, 164, 189, OR 110, 204&hyph;05, 373, 643). For example, they said safety
and health meetings were a way of informing employees about recent accidents and about lapses in safe work practices,
and to alert employees about conditions and hazards peculiar to the job to be performed or the site to be logged that
day. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters also said that safety and health meetings were necessary for both inexperienced and experienced loggers
(Ex. 5&hyph;19, 5&hyph;28, 5&hyph;45; Tr. OR 335). One of these commenters said: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
We don't feel that just new employees or green men ought to be sitting in safety and health meetings. Repetition increases
retention, and everyone can benefit if they've heard it a hundred times. Maybe they forgot it 99 [times] and it might
save their life or their buddy's life the next day (Tr. OR 335).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA agrees with these commenters that safety and health meetings are necessary to reinforce proper work practices
and to alert employees to particular hazards which are present in the workplace. OSHA believes that regular safety
and health meetings will provide adequate retraining for employees in the logging industry, and that these meetings
are necessary in lieu of requiring annual retraining of experienced workers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated in paragraph (j), this final rule becomes effective 120 days after publication of the revised rule and preamble
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Employers must be in compliance with all requirements of this section by the effective date. One commenter recommended
a three-year delay in the effective date of this final rule to allow for manufacturers' design and lead time and retrofitting
of old equipment (Ex. 5&hyph;22). OSHA believes that 120 days is a reasonable compliance time for this standard for
several reasons. First, the Agency is not requiring retrofitting ROPS and FOPS on old machines or chain brakes on chain
saws. Those equipment requirements apply only to machines and chain saws placed into initial service after the effective
date. OSHA believes that replacement of safety devices that have been removed, such as seat belts, should not require
additional compliance time. Second, in the final rule OSHA has not adopted any equipment requirements that are not
already standard safety features of equipment currently manufactured and readily available. Therefore, additional
compliance time is not warranted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, OSHA believes that allowing 120 days for employers to come into compliance will provide employers with adequate
time to familiarize themselves with the final rule, to purchase needed equipment, and to develop and conduct required
training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

A. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the revision of the existing pulpwood logging standard, 29 CFR 1910.266, is to protect all loggers from
the hazards encountered during timber harvesting regardless of the end use of the wood. Hazards are present, for example,
due to falling, rolling or sliding trees and logs, the use of hazardous equipment such as chain saws, and improper work
practices. According to BLS, these hazards resulted in an accident incidence rate of 15.6 injuries per 100 full-time
workers in 1991, which is nearly twice the incidence rate of 7.9 injuries per 100 full-time workers for overall private
sector. The number of lost workdays in logging in 1991 was 274.8 per 100 full-time workers, which is about three times
that of manufacturing and four times that of the overall private sector. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The existing logging standard applies only to the logging of wood that is used to make pulp for paper and paperboard.
Other logging operations are not covered by the existing standard. However, other general industry safety and health
standards in Part 1910, such as but not limited to, Occupational Noise Exposure (29 CFR 1910.95), Lockout/Tagout
(29 CFR 1910.147), and Personal Protective Equipment (29 CFR Subpart I), apply to non-pulpwood logging operations,
as well as the General Duty clause of the OSH Act (Section 5(a)(1)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule expands the coverage of the pulpwood logging standard to include 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
all
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 logging operations, regardless of the end use of the wood. Many of the provisions in the pulpwood logging standard
have been retained in this standard. Some provisions have been modified, such as those requiring safety and first-aid
training for all employees, and personal protective equipment. In certain cases, work practices have been made more
specific.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It should be noted that six State Plan States (Alaska, California, Hawaii, Michigan, Oregon, and Washington) have
developed logging standards that cover all logging operations and are not limited to just pulpwood logging. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) has been prepared by OSHA in compliance with Executive Order 12866 and the
Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.). The analysis was developed based on information and comments
in the OSHA logging docket and informal public hearings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Affected Industries and Workers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of analysis, logging operations in the United States were divided in four relevant geographical regions_the
North, the South, the Rocky Mountains, and the Pacific Coast. The leading States in logging employment in 1987 were
Oregon, Washington, Alabama and Georgia, which accounted for 40 percent of logging employment. The final rule will
affect approximately 72,100 employees engaged in logging operations covered by the final rule and 11,936 logging
establishments. Almost 94 percent of all logging establishments employ fewer than 20 employees and 60 percent of
all logging employees work in small establishments. These estimates do not include independent contractors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Affected workers include, but are not limited to, fellers and buckers, who cut the trees; skidder and yarder operators,
choker setters, and chasers, who are responsible for delivering a felled tree to the landing; and loader operators
and truck drivers, who load the trees onto trucks for transport to a mill. Although all stages of logging present hazards
to workers, the loggers most at risk are manual felling crews rather than those who operate mechanical harvesting
equipment and are protected by enclosed cabs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Technological Feasibility Determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The work practice and training provisions as well as the requirements regarding personal protective equipment and
equipment protective devices in the final rule are technologically feasible. The fact that the requirements of the
standard already are being achieved in the logging industry is the best evidence of feasibility. The record shows
that many logging establishments are currently providing the training, equipment protection devices and personal
protective equipment that would meet the requirements of the new standard. In addition, the record also shows they
are operating under the same work practices as those required by the standard. Based on the record, OSHA has determined
that numerous logging establishments of all sizes are already in compliance with most of the provisions of the final
standard. In addition, equipment protective devices and personal protective equipment which are required by the
final rule are all commercially available. Therefore, OSHA has determined that the final rule is technologically
feasible.

D. Costs of Compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA estimated compliance costs using data in the record on current practices and exposed population, including
a report prepared by Centaur Associates, Inc. (Ex. 3). Based on all the data and evidence in the record, OSHA estimates
that first-year costs associated with compliance will be $14.3 million. Total annualized cost of compliance with
the standard is estimated to be $12.5 million. Table 22 shows the summary of costs of compliance with the final rule.

Of the total annualized cost, 43 percent is attributable to inspection and maintenance of logging equipment. Training
costs, which include safety and first-aid training as well as monthly safety and health meetings, account for 32 percent.
Personal protective equipment accounts for about 21 percent of total annual costs. First-aid kits for 1.9 percent.
Replacement of operator manuals or instructions accounts for 1.5 percent and replacement of seat belts removed from
machines and vehicles accounts for about 0.6 percent of total costs.

D. Benefits of the Revised Standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The record shows that injury rates in the logging industry are high. In 1991, there were 15.6 injuries per 100 workers
in the logging industry as compared to an injury incidence rate of 7.9 and 11.2 per 100 workers in the private industry
and manufacturing sectors, respectively. Lost workday rates are especially high in the logging industry, indicating
that most logging accidents are serious. Based on the data in the record, OSHA estimates that there are approximately
158 fatalities, 6,798 lost workday injuries, and 3,770 nonlost workday injuries annually in the logging industry.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised standard mandates a variety of methods of control to reduce hazards in the logging industry. Included
in the standard are provisions for personal protective equipment, machine protective devices, equipment inspection
and maintenance, work practices, and training. The revised standard is expected to significantly reduce the number
of accidents, and, consequently, fatalities and injuries that occur in the logging industry. The ability of the revised
standard to reduce accidents, injuries and fatalities depends largely on this integrated program of controls to
deal with the range of hazards that exist in logging operations. For this reason, the effects of the overall standard
on workplace safety is expected to be greater than the effects of the elements of the standard when considered individually.
OSHA estimates that compliance with the final standard will prevent 111 fatalities, 4,759 lost workday cases, and
2,639 nonlost workday cases annually (Table 23). These estimates were developed based on the comprehensiveness
of the standard in dealing with the range of workplace hazards in logging.

F. Economic Feasibility Determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The projected economic impact of the final standard on the logging industry is small. The cost of full compliance with
the standard represents only 0.1 percent of the value of shipments for this industry as a whole. Although these annual
costs of compliance represent a relatively insignificant amount of total shipments, some firms will bear more costs
than others depending on their existing compliance with the various provisions of the standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The annual cost of compliance per logging establishment ranges from about $38 in California where firms are at a high
level of compliance with their own State logging standard, to an average of $1,300 per establishment in the South where
no comprehensive logging standards exists. These annual costs per establishment are insignificant when viewed
in terms of other costs incurred by logging employers. It is expected that the costs of compliance with the final rule
are too small to have a significant effect on price, employment, production, or profit rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The impact of compliance with the final rule is expected to fall primarily on small businesses, because the vast majority
of logging establishments employ fewer than 20 workers. The record shows that most large logging establishments
are already in compliance with many of the provisions of the final rule. However, many small firms are also located
in States that have comprehensive logging standards. These firms are currently in compliance with these standards
and are able to operate while incurring these costs. Even if it is assumed that small firms will bear all the costs of
compliance with the final rule, the economic impact is still small. OSHA estimates that the average cost per small
firm is substantially less than 0.5 percent of the average annual value of shipments per firm and will be more than offset
by the probable decrease in workers' compensation costs resulting from fewer injuries. Even small establishments
that operate on less than a full-time basis could incur the costs of compliance without experiencing an economic disruption
that would threaten the competitive structure of the industry or cause any dislocation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on these estimates developed from data and evidence in the record, OSHA has concluded that the economic impact
of the standard would not threaten the stability or profitability of the logging industry. In addition, neither the
Gross National Product (GNP), the level of international trade, the price of consumer goods, nor the level of employment
would be significantly affected.

G. Regulatory Flexibility Certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Assistant Secretary has made a preliminary assessment of
the impact of the rule on small entities. As discussed above, the estimated compliance costs for small firms (i.e,
those employing fewer than 20 workers) are estimated to be less than 0.5 percent of the average annual value of shipments
per firm and will be more than offset by the probable decrease in workers' compensation costs resulting from reduction
in logging accidents. As is the case for compliance costs for all firms covered under the standard, the costs of compliance
for small firms would be very small compared with net income. Therefore, OSHA does not anticipate the final rule will
have a significant impact on small firms.

H. Environmental Impact Assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The revisions to the standard have been reviewed in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental
Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.), the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) (40 CFR 1500), and the Department of Labor (DOL)
NEPA Procedures (29 CFR 11). As a result of this review, OSHA has determined that the rule will have no significant environmental
impact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions focus on training, work practices, personal protective equipment, and protective devices on equipment
in order to reduce worker fatalities and injuries. In general, these provisions do not impact on air, water, or soil
quality, plant or animal life, the use of land, or other aspects of the environment. The revisions are considered excluded
actions under Subpart B, Section 11.10 of the DOL NEPA regulations.

VIII. Statutory Considerations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA has described the hazards confronted by employees who work in the logging industry and the measures required
to protect affected employees from those hazards in Section I, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Background,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and Section III,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Summary and Explanation of the Standard, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
respectively, earlier in this preamble. The Agency is providing the following discussion of the statutory mandate
for OSHA rulemaking activity to explain the legal basis for its determination that the logging operations standard,
as promulgated, is reasonably necessary to protect affected employees from significant risks of injury and death.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 2(b)(3) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act authorizes ``the Secretary of Labor to set mandatory occupational
safety and health standards applicable to businesses affecting interstate commerce'', and section 5(a)(2) provides
that ``[e]ach employer shall comply with occupational safety and health standards promulgated under this Act''
(emphasis added). Section 3(8) of the OSH Act (29 U.S.C. 652(8)) provides that ``the term `occupational safety and
health standard' means a standard which requires conditions, or the adoption or use of one or more practices, means,
methods, operations, or processes, reasonably necessary or appropriate to provide safe or healthful employment
and places of employment.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In two recent cases, reviewing courts have expressed concern that OSHA's interpretation of these provisions of the
OSH Act, particularly of section 3(8) as it pertains to safety rulemaking, could lead to overly costly or under-protective
safety standards. In

938 F.2d 1310 (D.C. Cir. 1991), the District of Columbia Circuit rejected substantive challenges to OSHA's lockout/tagout
standard and denied a request that enforcement of that standard be stayed, but it also expressed concern that OSHA's
interpretation of the OSH Act could lead to safety standards that are very costly and only minimally protective. In

866 F.2d 717 (5th Cir. 1989), the Fifth Circuit concluded that Congress gave OSHA considerable discretion in structuring
the costs and benefits of safety standards but, concerned that the grain dust standard might be under-protective,
directed OSHA to consider adding a provision that might further reduce significant risk of fire and explosion.

OSHA rulemakings involve a significant degree of agency expertise and policy-making discretion to which reviewing
courts must defer. (See for example,

448 U.S. 607, 655 n. 62 (1980).) At the same time, the agency's technical expertise and policy-making authority must
be exercised within discernable parameters. The lockout/tagout and grain handling standard decisions sought from
OSHA more clarification on the agency's view of the scope of those parameters. In light of those decisions, OSHA believes
it would be useful to include in the preamble to this safety standard a statement of its view of the limits of its safety
rulemaking authority and to explain why it is confident that its interpretive views have in the past avoided regulatory
extremes and continue to do so in this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Stated briefly, the OSH Act requires that, before promulgating any occupational safety standard, OSHA demonstrate
based on substantial evidence in the record as a whole that: (1) The proposed standard will substantially reduce a
significant risk of material harm; (2) compliance is technologically feasible in the sense that the protective measures
being required already exist, can be brought into existence with available technology, or can be created with technology
that can reasonably be developed; (3) compliance is economically feasible in the sense that industry can absorb or
pass on the costs without major dislocation or threat of instability; and (4) the standard is cost effective in that
it employs the least expensive protective measures capable of reducing or eliminating significant risk. Additionally,
proposed safety standards must be compatible with prior agency action, must be responsive to significant comment
in the record, and, to the extent allowed by statute, must be consistent with applicable Executive Orders. These elements
limit OSHA's regulatory discretion for safety rulemaking and provide a decision-making framework for developing
a rule within their parameters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Congress Concluded That OSHA Regulations Are Necessary To Protect Workers From Occupational Hazards and That
Employers Should Be Required To Reduce or Eliminate Significant Workplace Health and Safety Threats 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At section 2(a) of the OSH Act (29 U.S.C. 651(a)), Congress announced its determination that occupational injury
and illness should be eliminated as much as possible: ``The Congress finds that occupational injury and illness arising
out of work situations impose a substantial burden upon, and are a hindrance to, interstate commerce in terms of lost
production, wage loss, medical expenses, and disability compensation payments.'' Congress therefore declared
``it to be its purpose and policy *&blank;*&blank;* to assure so far as possible every working man and woman in the Nation
safe *&blank;*&blank;* working conditions [29 U.S.C. 651(b)].'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To that end, Congress instructed the Secretary of Labor to adopt existing federal and consensus standards during
the first two years after the OSH Act became effective and, in the event of conflict among any such standards, to ``promulgate
the standard which assures the greatest protection of the safety or health of the affected employees [29 U.S.C. 655(a)].''
Congress also directed the Secretary to set mandatory occupational safety standards [29 U.S.C. 651(b)(3)], based
on a rulemaking record and substantial evidence [29 U.S.C. 655(b)(2)], that are ``reasonably necessary or appropriate
to provide safe *&blank;*&blank;* employment and places of employment.'' When promulgating permanent safety or
health standards that differ from existing national consensus standards, the Secretary must explain ``why the rule
as adopted will better effectuate the purposes of this Act than the national consensus standard [29 U.S.C. 655(b)(8)].''
Correspondingly, every employer must comply with OSHA standards and, in addition, ``furnish to each of his employees
employment and a place of employment which are free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause
death or serious physical harm to his employees [29 U.S.C. 654(a)].''

When one man is injured or disabled by an industrial accident or disease, it is he and his family who suffer the most immediate
and personal loss. However, that tragic loss also affects each of us. As a result of occupational accidents and disease,
over $1.5 billion in wages is lost each year [1970 dollars], and the annual loss to the gross national product is estimated
to be over $8 billion. Vast resources that could be available for productive use are siphoned off to pay workmen's compensation
and medical expenses. *&blank;*&blank;*

Congress considered uniform enforcement crucial because it would reduce or eliminate the disadvantage that a conscientious
employer might experience when inter-industry or intra-industry competition is present. Moreover, ``many employers_particularly
smaller ones_simply cannot make the necessary investment in health and safety, and survive competitively, unless
all are compelled to do so [Leg. Hist. at 144, 854, 1188, 1201].'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, the statutory text and legislative history make clear that Congress conclusively determined that OSHA regulation
is necessary to protect workers from occupational hazards and that employers should be required to reduce or eliminate
significant workplace health and safety threats.

); emphasis was supplied in original].'' When, as frequently happens in safety rulemaking, OSHA promulgates standards
that differ from existing national consensus standards, it must explain ``why the rule as adopted will better effectuate
the purposes of this Act than the national consensus standard [29 U.S.C. 655(b)(8)].'' Thus, national consensus
and existing federal standards that Congress instructed OSHA to adopt summarily within two years of the OSH Act's
inception provide reference points concerning the least an OSHA standard should achieve (29 U.S.C. 655(a)). As a
result, OSHA is precluded from regulating insignificant safety risks or from issuing safety standards that do not
at least lessen risk in a significant way. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OSH Act also limits OSHA's discretion to issue overly burdensome rules, as the agency also has long recognized

By stating the test in terms of ``threat'' and ``peril,'' the Supreme Court made clear in ATMI that economic infeasibility
begins short of industry-wide bankruptcy. OSHA itself has placed the line considerably below this level. (See for
example, ATMI, 452 U.S. at 527 n. 50; 43 FR 27,360 (June 23, 1978). Proposed 200 &mu;g/m3 PEL for cotton dust did not raise
serious possibility of industry-wide bankruptcy, but impact on weaving sector would be severe, possibly requiring
reconstruction of 90 percent of all weave rooms. OSHA concluded that the 200 &mu;g/m3 level was not feasible for weaving
and that 750 &mu;g/m3 was all that could reasonably be required). See also 54 FR 29,245&hyph;246 (July 11, 1989); American
Iron &amp; Steel Institute, 939 F.2d at 1003. OSHA raised the engineering control level for lead in small nonferrous
foundries to avoid the possibility of bankruptcy for about half of small foundries even though the industry as a whole
could have survived the loss of small firms. Although the cotton dust and lead rulemakings involved health standards,
the economic feasibility ceiling established therein applies equally to safety standards. Indeed, because feasibility
is a necessary element of a ``reasonably necessary or appropriate'' standard, this ceiling boundary is the same for
health and safety rulemaking since it comes from section 3(8), which governs all permanent OSHA standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All OSHA standards must also be cost-effective in the sense that the protective measures being required must be the
least expensive measures capable of achieving the desired end (ATMI, at 514 n. 32;

838 F.2d 1258, 1269 (D.C. Cir. 1988)). OSHA gives additional consideration to financial impact in setting the period
of time that should be allowed for compliance, allowing as much as ten years for compliance phase-in. (See

453 U.S. 913 (1981).) Additionally, OSHA's enforcement policy takes account of financial hardship on an individualized
basis. OSHA's Field Operations Manual provides that, based on an employer's economic situation, OSHA may extend
the period within which a violation must be corrected after issuance of a citation (CPL. 2.45B, Chapter III, paragraph
E6d(3)(a), Dec. 31, 1990). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To reach the necessary findings and conclusions that a safety standard substantially reduces a significant risk
of harm, is both technologically and economically feasible, and is cost effective, OSHA must conduct rulemaking
in accord with the requirements of section 6 of the OSH Act. The regulatory proceeding allows it to determine the qualitative
and, if possible, the quantitative nature of the risk with and without regulation, the technological feasibility
of compliance, the availability of capital to the industry and the extent to which that capital is required for other
purposes, the industry's profit history, the industry's ability to absorb costs or pass them on to the consumer, the
impact of higher costs on demand, and the impact on competition with substitutes and imports. (See

generally.) Section 6(f) of the OSH Act further provides that, if the validity of a standard is challenged, OSHA must
support its conclusions with ``substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole,'' a standard that courts
have determined requires fairly close scrutiny of agency action and the explanation of that action. (See

OSHA's powers are further circumscribed by the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, which

OSHA safety rulemaking is thus constrained first by the need to demonstrate that the standard will substantially
reduce a significant risk of material harm, and then by the requirement that compliance is technologically capable
of being done and not so expensive as to threaten economic instability or dislocation for the industry. Within these
parameters, further constraints such as the need to find cost-effective measures and to respond rationally to all
meaningful comment militate against regulatory extremes.

Standards which regulate hazards that are frequently undetectable because they are subtle or develop slowly or after
long latency periods, are frequently referred to as ``health'' standards. Standards that regulate hazards, like
explosions or electrocution, that cause immediately noticeable physical harm, are called ``safety'' standards.

all
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 OSHA standards must be ``reasonably necessary or appropriate.'' In addition, section 6(b)(5) requires that OSHA
set health standards which limit significant risk ``to the extent feasible.'' OSHA has determined that the revised
PPE standard is a safety standard, because the revised PPE standard addresses hazards, such as molten metal, falling
objects and electricity, that are immediately dangerous to life or health, not the longer term, less obvious hazards
subject to section 6(b)(5). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The OSH Act and its legislative history clearly indicate that Congress intended for OSHA to distinguish between safety
standards and health standards. For example in section 2(b)(6) of the OSH Act, Congress declared that the goal of assuring
safe and healthful working conditions and preserving human resources would be achieved, in part:

diseases and work in environmental conditions, and conducting other research relating to health problems, in recognition
of the fact that occupational health standards present problems often different from those involved in occupational
safety.

the risks are generally immediate and obvious, while in the former, the risks may not be evident until a worker has been

Challenges to the grain dust and lockout/tagout standards included assertions that grain dust in explosive quantities
and uncontrolled energy releases that could expose employees to crushing, cutting, burning or explosion hazards
were harmful physical agents so that OSHA was required to apply the criteria of section 6(b)(5) when determining how
to protect employees from those hazards. Reviewing courts have uniformly rejected such assertions. For example,

of uncontrolled energy, holding that such a ``reading would obliterate a distinction that Congress drew between
`health' and `safety' risks.'' The Court also noted that the language of the OSH Act and the legislative history supported

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As explained in Section III, Basis for Agency Action, and Section V, Summary and Explanation of the Standard, and Section
VI, Summary of the Final Regulatory Impact Analysis and Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, of this preamble, OSHA
has determined that logging operations pose significant risks to employees (158 fatalities, 6,798 lost workday
injuries, and 3,770 nonlost workday injuries each year). The Agency estimates that compliance with the logging operations
standard will cost $12.8 million annually and will reduce the risk of the hazards encountered during logging operations
(i.e., 111 fatalities, 4,759 lost workday injuries, and 2,639 nonlost workday injuries). This constitutes a substantial
reduction of significant risk of material harm to the 72,100 logging industry employees affected. The Agency believes
that compliance is technologically feasible because the rulemaking record indicates that the hazard control measures
required by the standard have already been implemented, to some extent, for all the logging operations covered by
the standard. Additionally, OSHA believes that compliance is economically feasible, because, as documented by
the Regulatory Impact Analysis, all regulated sectors can readily absorb or pass on compliance costs and economic
benefits will exceed compliance costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As detailed in Section V, Summary and Explanation of the Standard, and in Section VI, Summary of the Final Regulatory
Impact Analysis and Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, the standard's costs, benefits, and compliance requirements
are reasonable and consistent with those of other OSHA safety standards, such as PPE ($52.4 million annual cost of
compliance and will prevent 4 fatalities and 102,000 injuries annually) and Grain Handling ($5.9 to 33.4 million
annual cost of compliance and will prevent 18 fatalities and 394 injuries annually) (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This standard has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12612, 52 FR 41685 (October 30, 1987), regarding
Federalism. This Order requires that agencies, to the extent possible, refrain from limiting State policy options,
consult with States prior to taking any actions that would restrict State policy options, and take such actions only
when there is clear constitutional authority and the presence of a problem of national scope. The Order provides for
preemption of State law only if there is a clear Congressional intent for the agency to do so. Any such preemption is
to be limited to the extent possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 18 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act), expresses Congress' clear intent to preempt State
laws relating to issues with respect to which Federal OSHA has promulgated occupational safety or health standards.
Under the OSH Act a State can avoid preemption only if it submits, and obtains Federal approval of, a plan for the development
of such standards and their enforcement. Occupational safety and health standards developed by such Plan-States
must, among other things, be at least as effective in providing safe and healthful employment and places of employment
as the Federal standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The logging standard is drafted so that loggers in every State would be protected by general, performance-oriented
standards. To the extent that there are State or regional peculiarities caused by the types of timber to be logged,
the terrain, the climate or other factors, States with occupational safety and health plans approved under Section
18 of the OSH Act would be able to develop their own State standards to deal with any special problems. Moreover, the
performance nature of this proposed standard, of and by itself, allows for flexibility by States and loggers to provide
as much safety as possible using varying methods consonant with conditions in each State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In short, there is a clear national problem related to occupational safety and health in the logging industry. While
the individual States, if all acted, might be able collectively to deal with the safety problems involved, most have
not elected to do so in the twenty-four years since the enactment of the OSH Act. Those States which have elected to participate
under Section 18 of the OSH Act would not be preempted by this standard and would be able to deal with special, local conditions
within the framework provided by this performance-oriented standard while ensuring that their standards are at
least as effective as the Federal standard. State comments are invited on this proposal and will be fully considered
prior to promulgation of a final rule.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The FHWA is adopting regulations to implement subsections 105 (b) and (c) of the Hazardous Materials Transportation
Act of 1975 (HMTA) as amended by the Hazardous Materials Transportation Uniform Safety Act of 1990 (HMTUSA). The regulations
include Federal standards and procedures which the States and Indian tribes must follow if they establish, maintain,
or enforce routing designations that (1) specify highway routes over which placarded non-radioactive hazardous
materials (NRHM) may and may not be transported within their jurisdictions, and/or (2) impose limitations or requirements
with respect to highway routing of such hazardous materials. Included are amendments to the procedures in 49 CFR part
397, subpart E, relating to Federal preemption and waivers of preemption, and new procedures for the resolution of
disputes involving State or Indian tribe NRHM routing designations. States and Indian tribes are also required to
furnish updated NRHM route information for publication by the FHWA. The existing motor carrier regulations with
NRHM routing requirements have been incorporated into this regulation, along with the new requirements which require
motor carriers to comply with the NRHM routing designations of States and Indian tribes. The intent of these requirements
is to ensure that NRHM are moved safely and that commerce is not burdened by restrictive, uncoordinated, or conflicting
requirements of various jurisdictions.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 16, 1990, the Hazardous Materials Transportation Uniform Safety Act of 1990 (HMTUSA) (Pub. L. 101&hyph;615,
104 Stat. 3244) was enacted and amended the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act of 1975 (HMTA) (Pub. L. 93&hyph;633,
88 Stat. 2156). The FHWA was delegated the responsibility by the Secretary, as published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (56 FR 31343, July 10, 1991; 49 CFR 1.48), to implement subsections 105 (b) and (c) of the HMTA (now codified at 49 U.S.C.
&sect;&sect;5112 and 5125 (1994), Pub. L. 103&hyph;272, 108 Stat. 745). This included the rulemaking and program
responsibility for hazardous materials highway routing, with the exception of currently pending applications
for inconsistency rulings and non-preemption determinations which remain a responsibility of the Research and
Special Programs Administration (RSPA).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 5112(b) of title 49, United States Code, requires the Secretary to establish by regulation standards for
States and Indian tribes to use in establishing, maintaining, and enforcing these routing designations. These Federal
standards shall provide for enhancement of safety; public participation; transportation of hazardous materials
between adjacent areas; consultation with other States, Indian tribal and local governments; through highway routing;
reasonable time to reach agreement between affected States or Indian tribes; avoidance of unreasonable burden on
commerce; timely establishment of State and Indian tribe routing; reasonable routes to terminals and other facilities;
State responsibility for local compliance; and a number of ``factors'' for States and Indian tribes to consider.
Section 5112(b)(2) prohibits the Secretary from assigning specific weights to the ``factors to consider'' in the
Federal standards, but Sections 5125(c) and 5112(d) do provide for Federal preemption and dispute resolution of
State and Indian tribe routing designations to allow for consistent application of the Federal standards among adjacent
jurisdictions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 5112(c) also requires the Secretary, in coordination with the States, to periodically update and publish
a list of currently effective hazardous materials highway route designations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA recognizes that 49 CFR 177.810 exempts State and local regulations and ordinances regarding the kind, character,
or quantity of any hazardous material, except radioactive materials, transported through urban tunnels used for
mass transportation from parts 170 to 189 of the hazardous materials regulations. However, this section does not
exempt State, Indian tribes and local governments from having to comply with the routing regulations applicable
to the transportation of Class 7 (radioactive) materials (49 CFR 397, subpart D) or the routing regulations established
herein. Therefore, tunnel routing designations are now subject to the same Federal standards and procedures as are
other highway routing designations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assist the States and local governments in the development of routes, the DOT published ``Guidelines for Selecting
Preferred Highway Routes for Highway Route Controlled Quantity Shipments of Radioactive Materials'' (latest edition
DOT/RSPA/OHMT&hyph;89/01 dated August 1992) and ``Guidelines for Applying Criteria to Designate Routes for Transporting
Hazardous Materials'' (latest edition DOT/RSPA/OHMT&hyph;89&hyph;02 dated July 1989). The latter publication
is being updated to provide guidance on the Federal standards in this regulation. Both guides are useful in developing
highway routing requirements for hazardous materials. These documents are available to the public through the National
Technical Information Service, Springfield, Virginia 21661. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA published a notice of proposed rulemaking and a notice of public hearings entitled ``Transportation of Hazardous
Materials; Highway Routing'' in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on August 31, 1992 (57 FR 39522). The FHWA requested comments from any interested parties to be submitted to Docket
MC&hyph;92&hyph;6 by October 30, 1992. In addition, the FHWA held four public hearings to solicit comments from interested
parties in October at Washington, D.C.; Dallas, Texas; San Francisco, California; and Rosemont, Illinois.

Discussion of Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A total of fifty-six commenters responded to this proposed regulation by written submission to the docket and/or
presentation at the public hearings. The commenters represented a total of fifty-two organizations, including
twenty-seven commercial/trade affiliated organizations representing shippers and carriers, fourteen State
government organizations, five local governments, three Federal agencies, one Indian tribe, one citizens' group,
and one consulting firm. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nineteen commenters supported and eight opposed the overall format and/or intent of the proposed regulations. The
remaining commenters did not express overall opposition or support for the regulation but did comment on specific
parts of the regulation. Fifty-four commenters discussed details of the proposed rule, and many recommended changes
to various aspects of the rule. The following topics were of main concern.

Definitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Definitions were discussed by fifteen commenters who recommended clarification of some definitions and additional
definitions for some terms used in the regulation. These comments were submitted from eight members of the shipper-carrier
industry, four States, one local government, one Federal agency and a citizens' group. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nine commenters recommended clarification of the definition of ``routing designations.'' The main concern was
that routing designations broadly defined could include licenses, permits, bonds, and other restrictions or requirements
which might not be route-specific. In response to these concerns, the FHWA has clarified routing designations to
include route-specific features, such as: designations of routes, restrictions on routes, curfews/time-of-travel
restrictions on routes, lane restrictions, routing bans, port-of-entry requirements, and weight restrictions
on routes which are specifically related to NRHM. Common State, Indian tribal, or local regulatory requirements
are not ``routing designations'' when they are not route specific. These can include fee, bonding/insurance, notice,
escort, permit, registration, inspection, and communication requirements which are generally applied to entire
jurisdictions rather than specific highway routes. Such jurisdictional restrictions are not covered under this
regulation. Their possible preemption is determined by the RSPA, not the FHWA. Other restrictions on motor vehicles
that are not specific to the transportation of hazardous materials, such as height, weight, or width restrictions

by this regulation.

Motor Carrier Responsibilities for Routing

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Five commenters recommended clarifying the applicability of the rule to placarded and marked vehicles. These commenters
were concerned that the regulation would be applicable to placarded NRHM transport while other motor carrier regulations
are applicable to both placarded and marked NRHM transport. The FHWA has amended &sect;397.67(b), which deals with
the motor carriers responsibilities, to include motor vehicles that are marked or placarded.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One State recommended that reasonable deviation cover highway and law enforcement situations that require a driver
to take an alternative route. The FHWA agreed with this recommendation and amended &sect;397.67(b)(3) to provide
for highway agency detours, such as in work zones, and law enforcement situations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA also amended the terms ``Class A or Class B explosives'' to ``Explosives, in Class 1, Division 1.1, 1.2, 1.3''
so as to be consistent with the current terminology in the Hazardous Materials Regulations (49 CFR 171&hyph;180).

Quantities of NRHM 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Four commenters recommended limiting the placarded quantity and type of NRHM for which the regulation applied, such
as to bulk rather than to vehicles transporting small individual cylinders of hazardous materials. The FHWA did not
adopt this recommendation because 49 U.S.C. &sect;5112(a)(1) requires that the highway routing regulations apply
to a vehicle if such vehicle is transporting in commerce a hazardous material for which placarding of the vehicle is
required. This section authorized the Secretary of Transportation to extend application of the regulations to other
hazardous materials, but did not authorize limiting their application to only ``in bulk'' hazardous materials.

Factors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Twenty-four commenters discussed the factors which States and Indian tribes must consider in developing NRHM routing
designations. These commenters included twelve shippers and carriers, four States, three local governments, three
Federal agencies, one citizens' group and one consulting firm. Eleven commenters recommended clarification of
the factors and development of specific measures or benchmarks by which the factors could be evaluated. These commenters
were concerned that the factors can be applied differently by various jurisdictions, resulting in different routing
designations. Sixteen commenters indicated that specific risk criteria should be considered more important than
the other factors, while seven commenters recommended the Federal government establish minimum criteria for each
of the factors. The FHWA declined to adopt these recommendations because the HMTUSA specifically provided the States
and Indian tribes with the flexibility to determine how each standard should be applied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Five commenters mentioned the importance of providing updated Federal guidelines for analyzing the factors; five
commenters recommended additional factors, including accident histories, the use of tunnels, and hours of service
for drivers; and several commenters recommended clarification of the terms ``unreasonably burden commerce,''
``climatic conditions,'' and ``congestion factors.'' In response to these comments, the FHWA revised several of
the factors. The factor on ``terrain considerations'' was amended to include both accident severity and clean up
of spills; ``alternative routes'' was amended to specifically consider safety; ``climatic conditions'' was amended
to provide examples, such as snow, high winds, ice, and fog; and ``consideration of accident history'' was added to
the congestion factor. Additionally, the FHWA is in the process of updating the guidelines for analyzing routing
designations and intends to address each of the factors in the updated publication.

Grandfather Provision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The notice of proposed rulemaking contained a section incorporating the grandfather clauses included in the HMTA
as amended by the HMTUSA. One clause provides that routing designations established before November 16, 1990, are
not required to comply with the factors discussed in &sect;397.71 of the regulation. Another clause provides that
the routing designations established before the date of issuance of these regulations do not have to be in accordance
with the routing standards dealing with public participation, consultation with other jurisdictions, and timeliness.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA received numerous comments from the public expressing their concern that incorporation of these grandfather
clauses in the regulation resulted in unnecessary confusion. The FHWA agrees. A strict reading of the grandfather
clauses would make the factors established in this regulation retroactively applicable to routing designations
established after enactment of the HMTUSA on November 16, 1990. It would be impracticable and unduly burdensome on
the States and Indian tribes to interpret the statute in such a manner. The FHWA would be applying to these routing designations
factors that did not exist in Federal regulations at that time. As a result, the FHWA has decided to apply the factors
established in this final rule prospectively from 30 days after the date of publication in the

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action should not be interpreted to mean that the routing designations established prior to the publication
of the final rule are not subject to Federal preemption. These routing designations are still subject to Federal preemption
under 49 U.S.C. &sect;5125(a), if_

Jurisdictional Coordination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Twenty-two commenters addressed the issue of jurisdictional coordination between Federal, State, Indian tribal,
and local governments in the routing designation process. These commenters included ten members of the shipper-carrier
industry, eight States, two local governments, one Federal agency, and one consulting firm. Fourteen commenters
expressed concern about the role of the Federal government versus State and local governments. Many of the commenters
did not recommend changes to the regulation but expressed their concerns about the administration of this regulation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eleven commenters discussed the potential for conflicts between States, between local jurisdictions, and between
States and local jurisdictions. Eight commenters were concerned that the required communications between States,
Indian tribes, and local jurisdictions would not be adequately coordinated. The FHWA revised &sect;397.71(b)(3)(i),
dealing with consultation with others, to provide for better interagency coordination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments from shippers and carriers recommended increasing the State, Indian tribal, or local governments' burden
in establishing and administering a routing designation. For example, their recommendations included requiring
States to produce a risk analysis for each class of NRHM for a specific route designation and for each route designation
that transfers risk from one jurisdiction to another. They also recommended that States develop consistent standards
to be used by all local jurisdictions. State and local governments, on the other hand, expressed concerns about the
proposed requirements that would be imposed on them in establishing and maintaining routing designations. These
comments focused on the administrative burdens associated with the proposed requirements, such as those involving
records maintenance, public hearings, and those that would require a finding that any routing designation would
enhance public safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA believes that the increased requirements proposed by the shipper and carrier industries would unduly burden
State and local governments without producing a corresponding safety benefit. Similarly, the FHWA believes that
the requirements proposed in the NPRM are the minimum necessary to ensure that States or Indian tribes adopting routing
designations fully and fairly consider all of the factors required under the law. Accordingly, the FHWA is promulgating
this final rule without a change in the proposed coordination requirements for establishing and administering route
designations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters recommended that States or local governments be allowed to have varying standards which could differ
based on the type and quantity of material involved. The FHWA believes that no changes are necessary since States are
already provided the latitude to determine how the standards in this regulation or any additional standards a State
or Indian tribe select are to be applied.

Dispute Resolution, Preemption, and Waivers of Preemption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Preemption, waivers of preemption, and dispute resolution procedures were discussed by fourteen commenters. These
commenters included nine members of the shipper-carrier industry, three States, one Federal agency, and one citizens'
group. Four commenters addressed eligibility or standing to petition under the dispute resolution process, with
three commenters recommending the local jurisdiction be eligible to participate in the dispute resolution process.
The FHWA decided not to adopt these recommendations because the HMTUSA authorizes the FHWA only to resolve disputes
between States and between States and Indian tribes. The FHWA believes that States will consider the views and concerns
of local jurisdictions in formulating their positions on preemption and preemption waiver determinations. Additionally,
the dispute resolution procedures provide affected local jurisdictions with notice and the opportunity to participate,
through their State, in the process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eight commenters addressed waiver of preemptions. Two suggested that local governments could use this process to
circumvent State administration of routing designations, another recommended the FHWA prevent local governments
from seeking a waiver of preemption when the State has disapproved the designation, and one remarked that the waiver
of preemption process provides protection for jurisdictions where unique circumstances justify extraordinary
routing measures. The FHWA has decided not to adopt these recommendations because it believes that the finding required
by 49 CFR 397.219 (that the waived routing designation provide an equal or higher level of highway safety to the public
without unreasonably burdening commerce) is sufficient to ensure that the waiver process is not used arbitrarily.
Additionally, States are able to express their views as part of the process.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Four commenters discussed the status of a routing designation pending a preemption determination, with three recommending
the use of an administrative stay until the determination is issued. Another recommended the interim status of a routing
designation be decided by the FHWA. Two commenters recommended an administrative appeals process. The FHWA believes
no changes are necessary because the procedures in 49 CFR part 397, subpart E, maintain the status of a highway routing
pending a preemption determination and provide for administrative reconsideration and judicial review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA, in considering all the comments and the current provisions in subpart E of 49 CFR part 397, determined that
the proposed provisions should be incorporated into the existing procedures in subpart E rather than being included
as redundant procedures unique to this final rule. Consequently, &sect;397.79 Preemption determination procedure;
&sect;397.81 Waivers of preemption; &sect;397.85 Timeliness; and &sect;397.87 Judicial review of preemption
or waiver of preemption decision have been removed and this final rule has been amended to refer to the applicable sections
of subpart E, and subpart E is amended to refer to the provisions of this final rule.

Public Notification

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Public notification procedures were discussed by twenty-nine commenters. This included seventeen members of the
shipper-carrier industry, five States, three Federal agencies, two local governments, one citizens' group and
one consulting firm. Thirteen commenters discussed public participation. Highway users tended to recommend more
public notification through publications, such as newspapers or the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, while two government agencies recommended reducing the publication requirements because of costs. Additionally,
five commenters discussed public hearing requirements and recommended providing an opportunity for a public hearing
rather than requiring a public hearing. The FHWA has revised the regulation to grant States and Indian tribes discretion
to hold public hearings on proposed NRHM routing designations after providing the public with notice and an opportunity
to comment. The FHWA also believes publication of the notice for both the comment period and the public hearing, if
one is held, to be most appropriately administered at the State and Indian tribe level, through publications, such
as the official register of the State regulations, rather than through publication in the

Ten commenters discussed the requirement for State and Indian tribes to report routing designations to the FHWA.
The majority recommended the FHWA frequently publish new and existing route designations in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

to establish a route designation to the FHWA for publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Upon further review, the FHWA determined it would be more practical and appropriate to provide some form of current
information on established routing designations; consequently, the FHWA is considering alternative methods,
such as establishing an electronic bulletin board, to update and provide this information to the public in a timely
manner along with publishing annual lists of routing designations in the

Signs, Maps and Lists of Routing Designations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Ten commenters were concerned about the use and availability of road signs and maps. Highway users were generally
in favor of requiring the use of road signs. They recommended that routing designations be enforceable only to the
extent they are signed. Several States, notably California and Colorado, have successfully operated rather extensive
and efficient routing systems through the use of lists and maps rather than signs. The requirement to sign all routing
designations could also be a considerable administrative and economic burden for States which have or develop extensive
routing designations. Therefore, the FHWA declines to adopt this suggestion.

Reasonable Routes to Terminals and Other Facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Reasonable access to terminals and other facilities was discussed by fifteen commenters, including twelve shippers
and carriers, one State, one Federal entity, and one local agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nine commenters representing shippers and carriers of fuels and farm supplies recommended more flexibility be provided
for their products in designating route restrictions because many of their deliveries are local and unplanned. Seven
of these commenters, mostly representing short-haul, irregular route carriers, recommended they be exempted from
the proposed limits on reasonable access deviations, because they could impose a financial burden on them. The FHWA
declined to adopt these recommendations because the HMTUSA was specific on providing the States and Indian tribes
with the flexibility to accommodate local and special interests which may be unique to an area's geographic or commercial
situation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three government agencies recommended a larger maximum deviation distance, whereas three carriers recommended
a shorter maximum deviation. In response to these comments, the FHWA amended &sect;397.71(b)(7) by replacing the
proposed requirement that such routes or deviations not exceed twice the distance of the most direct route with a requirement
that States or Indian tribes which establish or provide for reasonable access to and from designated routes use the
shortest practicable route based upon consideration of 13 factors listed in paragraph (b)(9) of that section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters recommended clarification of the applicability of reasonable access and through routing provisions
to local deliveries. The FHWA revised the reasonable access provisions to also apply to pickup and deliveries.

Through Routing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Through routing issues were discussed by twenty-seven commenters, including nineteen shippers and carriers, three
Federal agencies, three States, one Indian tribe, and one citizens' action group. Fifteen commenters recommended
a decrease in the maximum deviation distance and two commenters favored an increase to as much as twice the distance
of the most direct route. Four commenters recommended elimination of percentage-based permissible routing deviations
and suggested that consideration of the factors would be adequate. Three commenters also indicated that it was inappropriate
to use an arbitrary percentage to determine the length of permissible deviations when such a percentage has no correlation
to safety. Four commenters recommended clarifying how the maximum deviation limitation would be applied to each
designated routing encountered during a trip or to the sum of all deviations contained in an entire trip. Seven commenters
recommended clarifying the difference between through routing and reasonable routes to terminals and other facilities,
and when the separate regulations are applicable. Several of the commenters recommended that deviations from through
routing should only be implemented when the deviation is safer than the through route or at least as safe and not an unreasonable
burden on commerce. The FHWA has revised the section on through routing to consider public safety and economic burden
(rather than use only percentages and mileage measurements). The revised section provides a relationship between
route deviations and public safety and requires that new routing designations have substantially lower relative
risk than the current routing. When the relative risk of the routing deviation is not substantially lower, the potential
economic effect becomes a significant factor.

Discussion of Final Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Purpose and Scope 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FHWA is implementing the requirements of the HMTUSA in a new subpart C, Routing, in Part 397 of Title 49, Code of Federal
Regulations. This regulation implements the requirements of the HMTUSA by establishing Federal standards and procedures
which States and Indian tribes are required to follow if they establish, maintain, or enforce routing designations
for the highway transportation of non-radioactive hazardous materials. The intent of these requirements is to ensure
that NRHM are moved safely and that commerce is not burdened by restrictive, uncoordinated, or conflicting requirements
of various jurisdictions. The standards and requirements of this regulation, however, allow for the flexibility
intended in the HMTUSA. The FHWA will not designate routes used for transporting NRHM. Any State or Indian tribe that
chooses to establish, maintain, or enforce NRHM routing designations is required to comply with the Federal standards
established in this regulation. The States and Indian tribes are also required to ensure that any NRHM routing designations
by political subdivisions under their jurisdiction are established, maintained, and enforced in accordance with
this regulation. Any NRHM routing designations that fail to comply with the standards can be preempted. Any State,
political subdivision thereof, Indian tribe, business, organization, or individual affected by a NRHM routing
designation can apply to the Federal Highway Administrator (Administrator) for a preemption determination pursuant
to 49 CFR 397, subpart E, which contains procedures for Federal preemption determinations, waivers of preemptions,
and petition for reconsideration. Procedures for dispute resolution are included in this final rule (49 CFR 397,
subpart C). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations require States and Indian tribes to report existing NRHM routing designations within their boundaries
to the FHWA and, thereafter, to report any additions or changes to these routing designations 60 days after the effective
date of designation.

Applicability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The provisions of this regulation are applicable to States, including any political subdivisions, and Indian tribes
that establish, maintain, or enforce any highway routing designations over which placarded NRHM may or may not be
transported. The regulation also contains several provisions which are applicable to motor carriers transporting
NRHM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This regulation requires States, including political subdivisions, and Indian tribes to comply with Federal standards
in establishing NRHM highway routing designations and to follow certain procedures. This regulation also requires
States and Indian tribes that establish, maintain, or enforce routing designations to report these routing designations
to the FHWA.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Motor carriers transporting NRHM as of the effective date of this regulation are required to comply with the NRHM routing
designations of States or Indian tribes. Where States and Indian tribes have not established NRHM routing designations,
motor carriers are required to operate in accordance with 49 CFR 397.67, previously set forth in 49 CFR 397.9(a), over
routes that avoid heavily populated areas, places where crowds are assembled, tunnels, narrow streets, or alleys.
The routing plan requirements previously set forth in 49 CFR 397.9(b) for transporting Class 1 explosives, divisions
1.1, 1.2, 1.3, as defined in 49 CFR 173.50 and 173.53, have also been incorporated into the same section.

State and Indian Tribe Jurisdiction Over Routing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
States and Indian tribes are required to comply with this regulation if they impose routing designations for NRHM.
If a political subdivision of a State wishes to impose NRHM routing designations, the State is required to ensure that
the political subdivision follows these regulations, including coordination with and approval by the routing agency
designated by the Governor. The State is responsible for all NRHM routing designations that local jurisdictions
establish, including resolving any disputes between local jurisdictions. The regulation requires the States and
Indian tribes to designate routing agencies who will be responsible for ensuring that all NRHM routing designations
are made in accordance, and substantively comply, with the procedural requirements of the Federal standards.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Federal Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This regulation establishes standards which closely follow the specific requirements of 49 U.S.C. &sect;5112(b)
and include procedures for States and Indian tribes to follow if they impose routing designations for NRHM transportation
by motor carriers. The Federal standards provide for enhancement of safety; public participation; consultation
with other State, local, and tribal governments; through routing; reasonable time to reach agreement between affected
States or Indian tribes; not unduly burdening commerce; timely establishment of State and Indian tribe routing;
reasonable routes to terminals; State responsibility for local compliance; and a number of ``factors to consider.''
The list of ``factors to consider'' which States (political subdivisions) and Indian tribes are required to use in
regulating routing is contained in &sect;397.71 of this final rule and includes the factors required by 49 U.S.C.
&sect;5112(b)(1)(I) and additional factors addressing climatic conditions, congestion, and accident analysis.
In accordance with 49 U.S.C. &sect;5112(b)(2), the FHWA will not assign any specific weight to be given by the States
or Indian tribes in considering the factors. Additionally, in analyzing these factors, the States or Indian tribes
shall use the most current version of ``Guidelines for Applying Criteria to Designate Routes for Transporting Hazardous
Materials'' or an equivalent routing analysis.

2. Public Information and Reporting Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 5112(c) of title 49, United States Code, requires the Secretary, in coordination with the States, to periodically
update and publish a list of current hazardous materials highway routing designations. Accordingly, the FHWA will
compile and publish annually in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a listing of all hazardous materials routing designations. The FHWA will also maintain a list of all current designations,
including additions and changes, and provide this information, upon request, to interested parties. To comply with
this requirement, the FHWA is, through this regulation, requiring States and Indian tribes to initially submit,

3. Dispute Resolution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Disputes involving highway routing agreements between political jurisdictions within a State are to be resolved
by the State's routing agency. Unresolved disputes involving through highway routing or routing designation agreements
between States or Indian tribes may be submitted to the Administrator for resolution. Details of the dispute shall
be furnished to the Administrator by the petitioner, together with a description of what was done to try to settle it,
plus a recommendation of the actions that should be taken by the Administrator to resolve the dispute. The FHWA has
revised &sect;397.75 of this regulation to clearly set forth the importance of public safety in any routing designation.
The State or Indian tribe filing the petition for dispute resolution shall be responsible for providing a comparative
risk analysis for the proposed routing designation and the current routing condition. Once a dispute is submitted
to the Administrator, no court action may be taken for one year or until after a decision by the Administrator, whichever
occurs first.

5. Preemption Determinations and Waivers of Preemption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 24, 1992, the FHWA published an interim final rule (57 FR 44132) amending 49 CFR 397 by adding a subpart
E which established procedures applicable to preemption determinations and waivers of preemption. This final rule
amends subpart E to make these procedures applicable to NRHM routing designations which are now included in subpart
C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any highway routing designation established, maintained or enforced by a State, a political subdivision thereof,
or an Indian tribe is preempted if: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Compliance with both the highway routing designation and any requirement of chapter 51 of title 49, United States
Code, or of a regulation prescribed thereunder is not possible; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The highway routing designation, as applied or enforced is an obstacle to accomplishing and carrying out chapter
51 of title 49, United States Code, or the regulations prescribed thereunder; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A State or Indian tribe establishes, maintains or enforces any routing designation that does not comply with the
procedural and substantive requirements of the Federal standards set forth in this regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person, including a State, political subdivision thereof, or Indian tribe, affected by a NRHM routing designation
can apply to the Administrator for a determination of whether such routing designation is preempted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A State, political subdivision, or Indian tribe may apply to the Administrator for a waiver of preemption. The Administrator
is authorized to waive preemption of a NRHM routing designation, based on a determination that it provides equal or
better protection to the public than these regulations would provide, and it does not unreasonably burden commerce.

Technical Amendments

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Public Law 103&hyph;272 (108 Stat. 745), enacted on July 5, 1994, codified certain U.S. transportation laws as title
49, United States Code. Like other transportation statutes, the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act was repealed
and its contents restated in title 49. This final rule changes the citations contained in the NPRM to conform to the
provisions of the new law.

Rulemaking Analyses and Notices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review) and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rulemaking document was reviewed under E.O. 12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review.'' The FHWA has determined
that this regulation is a significant regulatory action within the meaning of that Order. This rulemaking is considered
a significant regulation under Department of Transportation regulatory policies and procedures because of substantial
congressional and public interest. This interest involves minimizing risks while allowing reasonable highway
routing for the transportation of NRHM. The regulation does not require the establishment of NRHM routing designations
or the use of Federal preemption determinations, waivers of preemption, and dispute resolution, but does provide
standards and procedures which are required to be followed if these actions are taken. The FHWA believes that for those
States or Indian tribal governments which choose to adopt routing designations, the benefits from implementing
these regulations, such as NRHM routing designation continuity, public participation, uniform standards, and
preemption and dispute resolution procedures, will be greater than the costs, such as providing the required documentation,
coordination, and analysis which allow discretion in level of detail. The FHWA anticipates that the economic impact
of this regulation will be minimal based upon a regulatory evaluation.

Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Pub. L. 96&hyph;354; 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612), the FHWA has evaluated the effects of this regulation on small entities
such as Indian tribes, local governments, and small businesses. The HMTUSA requires the Secretary to adopt standards
which States and Indian tribes must follow if they establish, maintain, or enforce NRHM routing designations (specific
highway routes over which NRHM may or may not be transported within their jurisdictions, limitations or requirements
for highway routing). The regulation does not require the use of NRHM routing designations or Federal preemption
determinations, waivers of preemption, and dispute resolution, but provides standards and procedures which are
required to be followed if these actions are chosen to be used. The discretionary nature of the actions allows for cost
saving options to be used in balancing the needs in commerce and the risks in the transportation of NRHM. To date, relatively
few States and local jurisdictions have chosen to establish NRHM routing designations. The FHWA has concluded that
the regulation does not substantially affect the ability of, or cost to, local jurisdictions establishing needed
NRHM routing designations. The preemption and dispute resolution procedures provide all entities more effective
and efficient means of resolving routing issues. Based on this evaluation, the FHWA certifies that this regulation
does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Executive Order 12612 (Federalism Assessment) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The HMTUSA requires the Secretary to adopt standards which States and Indian tribes must follow if they establish,
maintain, or enforce NRHM routing designations (specific highway routes over which NRHM may or may not be transported
within their jurisdictions, limitations or requirements for highway routing). The regulation recognizes the State
and Indian tribal role in the designation of highway routes for NRHM while de-emphasizing the role of local governments.
The regulation provides for discretion by the States and Indian tribes as to whether they impose NRHM routing designations.
Each State and Indian tribe is free to establish NRHM routing designations tailored to its own needs in accordance
with the Federal standards, using the DOT ``Guidelines for Applying Criteria to Designate Routes for Transporting
Hazardous Materials,'' or an equivalent routing analysis which adequately considers overall risk to the public.
States and localities have a better understanding of the relative safety of the highways within their jurisdictions
than does the Federal government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulation limits the policymaking discretion of the States, their political subdivisions and Indian tribes.
The regulation is necessary, however, to achieve the purposes and implement the requirements of the HMTUSA. Accordingly,
it is certified that this action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles, criteria, and requirements
contained in Executive Order 12612 and, it has been determined that this action does not have sufficient federalism
implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) The State or Indian tribe shall provide the public with notice of any proposed NRHM routing designation and a 30-day
period in which to comment. At any time during this period or following review of the comments received, the State or
Indian tribe shall decide whether to hold a public hearing on the proposed NRHM route designation. The public shall
be given 30 days prior notice of the public hearing which shall be conducted as described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of
this section. Notice for both the comment period and the public hearing, if one is held, shall be given by publication
in at least two newspapers of general circulation in the affected area or areas and shall contain a complete description
of the proposed routing designation, together with the date, time, and location of any public hearings. Notice for
both the comment period and any public hearing may also be published in the official register of the State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If it is determined that a public hearing is necessary, the State or Indian tribe shall hold at least one public
hearing on the record during which the public will be afforded the opportunity to present their views and any information
or data related to the proposed NRHM routing designation. The State shall make available to the public, upon payment
of prescribed costs, copies of the transcript of the hearing, which shall include all exhibits and documents presented
during the hearing or submitted for the record. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Consultation with others. Prior to the establishment of any NRHM routing designation, the State or Indian tribe
shall provide notice to, and consult with, officials of affected political subdivisions, States and Indian tribes,
and any other affected parties. Such actions shall include the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) At least 60 days prior to establishing a routing designation, the State or Indian tribe shall provide notice, in
writing, of the proposed routing designation to officials responsible for highway routing in all other affected
States or Indian tribes. A copy of this notice may also be sent to all affected political subdivisions. This notice
shall request approval, in writing, by those States or Indian tribes, of the proposed routing designations. If no
response is received within 60 days from the day of receipt of the notification of the proposed routing designation,
the routing designation shall be considered approved by the affected State or Indian tribe. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The manner in which consultation under this paragraph is conducted is left to the discretion of the State or Indian
tribe. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The State or Indian tribe shall attempt to resolve any concern or disagreement expressed by any consulted official
related to the proposed routing designation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The State or Indian tribe shall keep a record of the names and addresses of the officials notified pursuant to this
section and of any consultation or meeting conducted with these officials or their representatives. Such record
shall describe any concern or disagreement expressed by the officials and any action undertaken to resolve such disagreement
or address any concern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Through routing. In establishing any NRHM routing designation, the State or Indian tribe shall ensure through
highway routing for the transportation of NRHM between adjacent areas. The term ``through highway routing'' as used
in this paragraph means that the routing designation must ensure continuity of movement so as to not impede or unnecessarily
delay the transportation of NRHM. The State or Indian tribe shall utilize the procedures established in paragraphs
(b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section in meeting these requirements. In addition, the State or Indian tribe shall make
a finding, supported by a risk analysis conducted in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, that the routing
designation enhances public safety. If the risk analysis shows_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) That the current routing presents at least 50 percent more risk to the public than the deviation under the proposed
routing designation, then the proposed routing designation may go into effect.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(ii) That the current routing presents a greater risk but less than 50 percent more risk to the public than the deviation
under the proposed routing restriction, then the proposed routing restriction made by a State or Indian tribe shall
only go into effect if it does not force a deviation of more than 25 miles or result in an increase of more than 25 percent
of that part of a trip affected by the deviation, whichever is shorter, from the most direct route through a jurisdiction
as compared to the intended deviation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) That the current route has the same or less risk to the public than the deviation resulting from the proposed routing
designation, then the routing designation shall not be allowed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Agreement of other States; burden on commerce. Any NRHM routing designation which affects another State or Indian
tribe shall be established, maintained, or enforced only if: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) It does not unreasonably burden commerce, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) It is agreed to by the affected State or Indian tribe within 60 days of receipt of the notice sent pursuant to paragraph
(b)(3)(i) of this section, or it is approved by the Administrator pursuant to &sect;397.75. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Timeliness. The establishment of a NRHM routing designation by any State or Indian tribe shall be completed within
18 months of the notice given in either paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section, whichever occurs first. (7) Reasonable
routes to terminals and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities. In establishing or providing for reasonable access to and from designated routes, the State or Indian
tribe shall use the shortest practicable route considering the factors listed in paragraph (b)(9) of this section.
In establishing any NRHM routing designation, the State or Indian tribe shall provide reasonable access for motor
vehicles transporting NRHM to reach: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Terminals, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Points of loading, unloading, pickup and delivery, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Facilities for food, fuel, repairs, rest, and safe havens. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Responsibility for local compliance. The States shall be responsible for ensuring that all of their political
subdivisions comply with the provisions of this subpart. The States shall be responsible for resolving all disputes
between such political subdivisions within their jurisdictions. If a State or any political subdivision thereof,
or an Indian tribe chooses to establish, maintain, or enforce any NRHM routing designation, the Governor, or Indian
tribe, shall designate a routing agency for the State or Indian tribe, respectively. The routing agency shall ensure
that all NRHM routing designations within its jurisdiction comply with the Federal standards in this section. The
State or Indian tribe shall comply with the public information and reporting requirements contained in &sect;397.73.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) Factors to consider. In establishing any NRHM routing designation, the State or Indian tribe shall consider the
following factors: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Population density. The population potentially exposed to a NRHM release shall be estimated from the density
of the residents, employees, motorists, and other persons in the area, using United States census tract maps or other
reasonable means for determining the population within a potential impact zone along a designated highway route.
The impact zone is the potential range of effects in the event of a release. Special populations such as schools, hospitals,
prisons, and senior citizen homes shall, among other things, be considered when determining the potential risk to
the populations along a highway routing. Consideration shall be given to the amount of time during which an area will
experience a heavy population density.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Type of highway. The characteristics of each alternative NRHM highway routing designation shall be compared.
Vehicle weight and size limits, underpass and bridge clearances, roadway geometrics, number of lanes, degree of
access control, and median and shoulder structures are examples of characteristics which a State or Indian tribe
shall consider.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(iii) Types and quantities of NRHM. An examination shall be made of the type and quantity of NRHM normally transported
along highway routes which are included in a proposed NRHM routing designation, and consideration shall be given
to the relative impact zone and risks of each type and quantity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Emergency response capabilities. In consultation with the proper fire, law enforcement, and highway safety
agencies, consideration shall be given to the emergency response capabilities which may be needed as a result of a
NRHM routing designation. The analysis of the emergency response capabilities shall be based upon the proximity
of the emergency response facilities and their capabilities to contain and suppress NRHM releases within the impact
zones. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Results of consultation with affected persons. Consideration shall be given to the comments and concerns of all
affected persons and entities provided during public hearings and consultations conducted in accordance with this
section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Exposure and other risk factors. States and Indian tribes shall define the exposure and risk factors associated
with any NRHM routing designations. The distance to sensitive areas shall be considered. Sensitive areas include,
but are not limited to, homes and commercial buildings; special populations in hospitals, schools, handicapped
facilities, prisons and stadiums; water sources such as streams and lakes; and natural areas such as parks, wetlands,
and wildlife reserves. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) Terrain considerations. Topography along and adjacent to the proposed NRHM routing designation that may affect
the potential severity of an accident, the dispersion of the NRHM upon release and the control and clean up of NRHM if
released shall be considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) Continuity of routes. Adjacent jurisdictions shall be consulted to ensure routing continuity for NRHM across
common borders. Deviations from the most direct route shall be minimized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ix) Alternative routes. Consideration shall be given to the alternative routes to, or resulting from, any NRHM route
designation. Alternative routes shall be examined, reviewed, or evaluated to the extent necessary to demonstrate
that the most probable alternative routing resulting from a routing designation is safer than the current routing.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(x) Effects on commerce. Any NRHM routing designation made in accordance with this subpart shall not create an unreasonable
burden upon interstate or intrastate commerce. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(xi) Delays in transportation. No NRHM routing designations may create unnecessary delays in the transportation
of NRHM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(xii) Climatic conditions. Weather conditions unique to a highway route such as snow, wind, ice, fog, or other climatic
conditions that could affect the safety of a route, the dispersion of the NRHM upon release, or increase the difficulty
of controlling it and cleaning it up shall be given appropriate consideration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(xiii) Congestion and accident history. Traffic conditions unique to a highway routing such as: traffic congestion;
accident experience with motor vehicles, traffic considerations that could affect the potential for an accident,
exposure of the public to any release, ability to perform emergency response operations, or the temporary closing
of a highway for cleaning up any release shall be given appropriate consideration.
