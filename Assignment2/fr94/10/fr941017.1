SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is proposing to amend its regulations to update the criteria used in decisions
regarding power reactor siting, including geologic, seismic, and earthquake engineering considerations for future
nuclear power plants. The proposed rule would allow NRC to benefit from experience gained in the application of the
procedures and methods set forth in the current regulation and to incorporate the rapid advancements in the earth
sciences and earthquake engineering. In addition, this proposed rule benefits from the public comments received
on the first proposed revision of the regulations. This proposed rule primarily consists of two separate changes,
namely, the source term and dose considerations, and the seismic and earthquake engineering considerations of reactor
siting. The Commission is also proposing to deny the remaining issue in petition (PRM&hyph;50&hyph;20) filed by
Free Environment, Inc. et al.

The present regulation regarding reactor site criteria (10 CFR part 100) was promulgated April 12, 1962 (27 FR 3509).
NRC staff guidance on exclusion area and low population zone sizes as well as population density was issued in Regulatory
Guide 4.7, ``General Site Suitability Criteria for Nuclear Power Stations,'' published for comment in September
1974. Revision 1 to this guide was issued in November 1975. On June 1, 1976, the Public Interest Research Group (PIRG)
filed a petition for rulemaking (PRM&hyph;100&hyph;2) requesting that the NRC incorporate minimum exclusion area
and low population zone distances and population density limits into the regulations. On April 28, 1977, Free Environment,
Inc. et al., filed a petition for rulemaking (PRM&hyph;50&hyph;20). The remaining issue of this petition requests
that the central Iowa nuclear project and other reactors be sited at least 40 miles from major population centers.
In August 1978, the Commission directed the NRC staff to develop a general policy statement on nuclear power reactor
siting. The ``Report of the Siting Policy Task Force'' (NUREG&hyph;0625) was issued in August 1979 and provided recommendations
regarding siting of future nuclear power reactors. In the 1980 Authorization Act for the NRC, the Congress directed
the NRC to decouple siting from design and to specify demographic criteria for siting. On July 29, 1980 (45 FR 50350),
the NRC issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) regarding revision of the reactor site criteria,
which discussed the recommendations of the Siting Policy Task Force and sought public comments. The proposed rulemaking
was deferred by the Commission in December 1981 to await development of a Safety Goal and improved research on accident
source terms. On August 4, 1986 (51 FR 23044), the NRC issued its Policy Statement on Safety Goals that stated quantitative
health objectives with regard to both prompt and latent cancer fatality risks. On December 14, 1988 (53 FR 50232),
the NRC denied PRM&hyph;100&hyph;2 on the basis that it would unnecessarily restrict NRC's regulatory siting policies
and would not result in a substantial increase in the overall protection of the public health and safety. Because of
possible renewed interest in power reactor siting, the NRC is proceeding with a rulemaking in this area. The Commission
proposes to address the remaining issue in PRM&hyph;50&hyph;20 as part of this rulemaking action.

Appendix A to 10 CFR part 100, ``Seismic and Geologic Siting Criteria for Nuclear Power Plants,'' was originally issued
as a proposed regulation on November 25, 1971 (36 FR 22601), published as a final regulation on November 13, 1973 (38
FR 31279), and became effective on December 13, 1973. There have been two amendments to 10 CFR part 100, appendix A.
The first amendment, issued November 27, 1973 (38 FR 32575), corrected the final regulation by adding the legend under
the diagram. The second amendment resulted from a petition for rulemaking (PRM&hyph;100&hyph;1) requesting that
an opinion be issued that would interpret and clarify Appendix A with respect to the determination of the Safe Shutdown
Earthquake. A notice of filing of the petition was published on May 14, 1975 (40 FR 20983). The substance of the petitioner's
proposal was accepted and published as an immediately effective final regulation on January 10, 1977 (42 FR 2052).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first proposed revision to these regulations was published for public comment on October 20, 1992 (57 FR 47802).
The availability of the five draft regulatory guides and the standard review plan section that were developed to provide
guidance on meeting the proposed regulations was published on November 25, 1992 (57 FR 55601). The comment period
for the proposed regulations was extended two times. First, the NRC staff initiated an extension (58 FR 271) from February
17, 1993 to March 24, 1993, to be consistent with the comment period on the draft regulatory guides and standard review
plan section. Second, in response to a request from the public, the comment period was extended to June 1, 1993 (58 FR
16377). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations published on October 20, 1992 (57 FR 47802) and draft guidance documents cited in the availability
notice published on November 25, 1992 (57 FR 55601) are withdrawn because of the substantive nature of the changes
to be made in response to public comments and are replaced with the second proposed revision of the regulations presented
in this document.

II. Objectives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The objectives of this proposed regulatory action are to_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. State basic site criteria for future sites that, based upon experience and importance to risk, have been shown as
key to protecting public health and safety; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Provide a stable regulatory basis for seismic and geologic siting and applicable earthquake engineering design
of future nuclear power plants that will update and clarify regulatory requirements and provide a flexible structure
to permit consideration of new technical understandings; and

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->

III. Genesis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The proposed regulatory action reflects changes that are intended to (1) benefit from the experience gained in applying
the existing regulation and from research; (2) resolve interpretive questions; (3) provide needed regulatory flexibility
to incorporate state-of-the-art improvements in the geosciences and earthquake engineering; and (4) simplify
the language to a more ``plain English'' text. In addition, the proposed regulatory action will benefit from public
comments received on the first proposed revision of the regulations and guidance documents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulatory action would apply to applicants who apply for a construction permit, operating license,
preliminary design approval, final design approval, manufacturing license, early site permit, design certification,
or combined license on or after the effective date of the final regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Criteria not associated with the selection of the site or establishment of the Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motion
(SSE) have been placed into 10 CFR part 50. This action is consistent with the location of other design requirements
in 10 CFR part 50. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the revised criteria presented in the proposed regulation would not be applied to existing plants, the licensing
bases for existing nuclear power plants must remain part of the regulations. Therefore, the non-seismic and seismic
reactor site criteria for current plants would be retained as subpart A and appendix A to 10 CFR part 100, respectively.
The proposed revised reactor site criteria would be added as subpart B in 10 CFR part 100 and would apply to site applications
received on or after the effective date of the final regulations. Non-seismic site criteria would be added as a new
&sect;100.21 to subpart B in 10 CFR part 100. The criteria on seismic and geologic siting would be added as a new &sect;100.23
to subpart B in 10 CFR part 100. The dose calculations and the earthquake engineering criteria would be located in 10
CFR part 50 (&sect;50.34(a) and Appendix S, respectively). Because Appendix S is not self executing, applicable
sections of part 50 (&sect;50.34 and &sect;50.54) are revised to reference appendix S. The proposed regulation would
also make conforming amendments to 10 CFR part 52. Section 52.17(a)(1) would be amended to reflect changes in 50.34(a)(1)
and 10 CFR Part 100.

IV. Alternatives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The first alternative considered by the Commission was to continue using current regulations for site suitability
determinations. This is not considered an acceptable alternative. Accident source terms and dose calculations
currently primarily influence plant design requirements rather than siting. It is desirable to state basic site
criteria which, through importance to risk, have been shown to be key to assuring public health and safety. Further,
significant advances in understanding severe accident behavior, including fission product release and transport,
as well as in the earth sciences and in earthquake engineering have taken place since the promulgation of the present
regulation and deserve to be reflected in the regulations.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The second alternative considered was replacement of the existing regulation with an entirely new regulation. This
is not an acceptable alternative because the provisions of the existing regulations form part of the licensing bases
for many of the operating nuclear power plants and others that are in various stages of obtaining operating licenses.
Therefore, these provisions should remain in force and effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The approach of establishing the revised requirements in new sections to 10 CFR part 100 and relocating plant design
requirements to 10 CFR part 50 while retaining the existing regulation was chosen as the best alternative. The public
will benefit from a clearer, more uniform, and more consistent licensing process that incorporates updated information
and is subject to fewer interpretations. The NRC staff will benefit from improved regulatory implementation (both
technical and legal), fewer interpretive debates, and increased regulatory flexibility. Applicants will derive
the same benefits in addition to avoiding licensing delays caused by unclear regulatory requirements.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
A. Reactor Siting Criteria (Nonseismic) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Since promulgation of the reactor site criteria in 1962, the Commission has approved more than 75 sites for nuclear
power reactors and has had an opportunity to review a number of others. In addition, light-water commercial power
reactors have accumulated about 1800 reactor-years of operating experience in the United States. As a result of these
site reviews and operational experience, a great deal of insight has been gained regarding the design and operation
of nuclear power plants as well as the site factors that influence risk. In addition, an extensive research effort
has been conducted to understand accident phenomena, including fission product release and transport. This extensive
operational experience together with the insights gained from recent severe accident research as well as numerous
risk studies on radioactive material releases to the environment under severe accident conditions have all confirmed
that present commercial power reactor design, construction, operation and siting is expected to effectively limit
risk to the public to very low levels. These risk studies include the early ``Reactor Safety Study'' (WASH&hyph;1400),
published in 1975, many Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) studies conducted on individual plants as well as several
specialized studies, and the recent ``Severe Accident Risks: An Assessment for Five U.S. Nuclear Power Plants,''
(NUREG&hyph;1150), issued in 1990. Advanced reactor designs currently under review are expected to result in even
lower risk and improved safety compared to existing plants. Hence, the substantial base of knowledge regarding power
reactor siting, design, construction and operation reflects that the primary factors that determine public health
and safety are the reactor design, construction and operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Siting factors and criteria, however, are important in assuring that radiological doses from normal operation and
postulated accidents will be acceptably low, that natural phenomena and potential man-made hazards will be appropriately
accounted for in the design of the plant, and that site characteristics are amenable to the development of adequate
emergency plans to protect the public and adequate security measures to protect the plant. The Commission has also
had a long standing policy of siting reactors away from densely populated centers, and is continuing this policy in
the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is proposing to incorporate basic reactor site criteria in the proposed rule to accomplish the above
purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission proposes to retain source term and dose calculations to verify the adequacy of a site for a specific
plant, but source term and dose calculations will be relocated to part 50, since experience has shown that these calculations
have tended to influence plant design aspects such as containment leak rate or filter performance rather than siting.
No specific source term would be referenced in part 50. Rather, the source term would be required to be one that is ``*&blank;*&blank;*
assumed to result in substantial meltdown of the core with subsequent release into the containment of appreciable
quantities of fission products.'' Hence, this guidance could be utilized with the source term currently used for
light-water reactors, or used in conjunction with revised accident source terms, currently under development within
the NRC staff as well as in the industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed relocation of source term and dose calculations to part 50 represent a partial decoupling of siting from
accident source term and dose calculations. The siting criteria are envisioned to be utilized together with standardized
plant designs whose features will be certified in a separate design certification rulemaking procedure. Each of
the standardized designs would specify an atmospheric dilution factor that would be required to be met, in order to
meet the dose criteria at the exclusion area boundary. For a given standardized design, a site having relatively poor
dispersion characteristics would require a larger exclusion area distance than one having good dispersion characteristics.
Additional design features would be discouraged in a standardized design to compensate for otherwise poor site conditions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although individual plant tradeoffs would be discouraged for a given standardized design, a different standardized
design could require a different atmospheric dilution factor. For custom plants that do not involve a standardized
design, the source term and dose criteria will continue to provide assurance that the site is acceptable for the proposed
design.

Rationale for Individual Criteria

A. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Exclusion Area.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 An exclusion area surrounding the immediate vicinity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the plant has been a requirement for siting power reactors from the very 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beginning. This area provides a high degree of protection to the public from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a variety of potential plant accidents and also affords protection to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plant from potential man-related hazards. The Commission considers an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclusion area to be an essential feature of a reactor site and is proposing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to retain this requirement for future reactors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule issued for comment in October 1992 proposed a minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distance to the exclusion area boundary of 0.4 miles (640 meters), based upon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the suggested value given in Regulatory Guide 4.7, without utilizing source 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
term and dose calculations. This was based upon a conservative evaluation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the performance of fission product cleanup systems such as containment sprays 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or filter systems. Numerous comments were received stating that source term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and dose calculations should be retained, and that the exclusion area distance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should also be based upon a more realistic evaluation of actual fission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product cleanup systems. In response to these comments, the Commission is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing, in the present rule, to retain the use of source term and dose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculations, in part 50, to verify that an applicant's proposed exclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area distance is adequate to assure that the radiological dose to an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual will be acceptably low in the event of a postulated accident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, as noted above, if source term and dose calculations are used in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conjunction with standardized designs, unlimited plant tradeoffs to compensate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for poor site conditions would not be permitted. For plants that do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involve standardized designs, the source term and dose calculations would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continue to provide assurance that the site is acceptable for the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The present regulation requires that the exclusion area be of such size 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that an individual located at any point on its boundary for two hours 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediately following onset of the postulated fission product release would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not receive a total radiation dose in excess of 25 rem to the whole body or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
300 rem to the thyroid gland. A footnote in the present regulation notes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a whole body dose of 25 rem has been stated to correspond numerically to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
once in a lifetime accidental or emergency dose to radiation workers which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could be disregarded in the determination of their radiation exposure status 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(NBS Handbook 69 dated June 5, 1959). However, the same footnote also clearly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
states that the Commission's use of this value does not imply that it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considers it to be an acceptable limit for an emergency dose to the public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under accident conditions, but only that it represents a reference value to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used for evaluating plant features and site characteristics intended to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mitigate the radiological consequences of accidents in order to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assurance of low risk to the public under postulated accidents. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commission, based upon extensive experience in applying this criterion, and in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognition of the conservatism of the assumptions in its application (a large 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fission product release within containment associated with major core damage, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximum allowable containment leak rate, a postulated single failure of any of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fission product cleanup systems, such as the containment sprays, adverse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
site meteorological dispersion characteristics, an individual presumed to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
located at the boundary of the exclusion area at the centerline of the plume 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for two hours without protective actions), believes that this criterion has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clearly resulted in an adequate level of protection. As an illustration of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the conservatism of this assessment, the maximum whole body dose received by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an actual individual during the Three Mile Island accident in March 1979, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which involved major core damage, was estimated to be about 0.1 rem. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the proposed rule, the Commission is proposing two changes in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, the Commission is proposing that the use of different doses for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the whole body and thyroid gland be replaced by a single value of 25 rem, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
total effective dose equivalent (TEDE). The total effective dose equivalent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concept is consistent with part 20 of the Commission's regulations, and is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defined as the deep dose equivalent (for external exposures) plus the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
committed effective dose equivalent (for internal exposures). The deep dose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalent is the same as the present whole body dose, while the committed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective dose equivalent is the sum of the products of doses to selected body 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organs times weighting factors for each organ that are representative of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
radiation risk associated with that organ. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed use of the total effective dose equivalent, or TEDE, is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based upon two considerations. First, since it utilizes a risk consistent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methodology to assess the radiological impact of all relevant nuclides upon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all body organs, use of TEDE promotes a uniformity and consistency in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessing radiation risk that may not exist with the separate whole body and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thyroid organ dose values in the present regulation. Second, use of TEDE 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lends itself readily to the application of updated accident source terms, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which can vary not only with plant design, but in which additional nuclides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
besides the noble gases and iodine are predicted to be released into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has examined the current dose criteria of 25 rem whole 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
body and 300 rem thyroid with the intent of selecting a TEDE numerical value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalent to the risk implied by the current dose criteria. These risks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consist of the risk of developing cancer some time after the exposure (latent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cancer incidence), as well as a delayed risk of cancer fatality (latent cancer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fatality). For a dose of 25 rem whole body, the individual risk of latent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cancer fatality is estimated to be about 2.5&times;10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
^2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
; the risk of latent cancer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incidence is about twice that (using risk coefficients expressed by ICRP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Publication 60 and in NUREG/CR&hyph;4214). For a dose of 300 rem thyroid, the risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of latent cancer fatality is about 2&times;10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
^3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
; the risk of latent cancer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incidence is about a factor of ten higher. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the risk of latent cancer fatality is selected as the appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk measure to be used, the current dose criteria represent a risk of about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2.7&times;10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
^2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Using a risk coefficient of about 10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
^3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 per rem, the risk of latent cancer fatality implied by the current dose criteria is equivalent to 27 rem TEDE. (BEIR
V estimates a latent cancer fatality risk coefficient of about 5&times;10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
^4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 per rem, if the dose is received over a period of days or more; however, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if the exposure period is shorter, such as 2 hours, the risk coefficient is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately double.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If latent cancer incidence rather than fatality were used, the current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dose criteria would correspond to a value of about 35 rem TEDE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is proposing to use the risk of latent cancer fatality as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the appropriate risk measure since quantitative health objectives (QHOs) for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it have been established in the Commission's Safety Goal policy. Although the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current dose criteria are equivalent in risk to 27 rem TEDE, as noted above, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Commission is proposing to use 25 rem TEDE as the dose criterion for plant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluation purposes, since this value is essentially the same level of risk as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the current criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nevertheless, the Commission is specifically requesting comments on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of TEDE. Comments are requested on whether the current dose criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be modified to utilize the total effective dose equivalent, or TEDE, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concept. The Commission is also requesting comments on whether a TEDE value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 25 rem (consistent with latent cancer fatality), or 34 rem (consistent with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
latent cancer incidence), or some other value should be used. Finally, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because the thyroid weighting factor is equal to a value of 0.03, there exists 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a theoretical possibility that an accidental release composed only of iodine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could result in a TEDE less than 25 rem, yet result in a thyroid dose of over 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
800 rem. Although the Commission believes that the likelihood that an actual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accident would release only iodine is highly unlikely, comments are also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested as to whether the dose criterion should also include a ``capping'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limitation, that is, an additional requirement that the dose to any individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organ not be in excess of some fraction of the total.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second change being proposed in this area is in regard to the time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period that a hypothetical individual is assumed to be at the exclusion area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
boundary. While the duration of the time period remains at a value of two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hours, the Commission is proposing that this time period not be fixed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regard to the appearance of fission products within containment, but that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
various two-hour periods be examined with the objective that the dose to an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual not be in excess of 25 rem TEDE for any two-hour period after the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appearance of fission products within containment. The Commission is proposing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this change to reflect improved understanding of fission product release into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the containment under severe accident conditions. For an assumed instantaneous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
release of fission products, as contemplated by the present rule, the two hour 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period that commences with the onset of the fission product release clearly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results in the highest dose to a hypothetical individual offsite. Improved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
understanding of severe accidents shows that fission product releases to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containment do not occur instantaneously, and that the bulk of the releases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may not take place for about an hour or more. Hence, the two-hour period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commencing with the onset of fission product release may not represent the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
highest dose that an individual could be exposed to over any two-hour period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result, the Commission is proposing that various two-hour periods be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examined to assure that the dose to a hypothetical individual at the exclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area boundary will not be in excess of 25 rem TEDE over any two-hour period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after the onset of fission product release. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Site Dispersion Factors.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Site dispersion factors have been utilized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to provide an assessment of dose to an individual as a result of a postulated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accident. Since the Commission intends to require that a verification be made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the exclusion area distance is adequate to assure that the guideline dose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to a hypothetical individual will not be exceeded under postulated accident 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions, as well as to assure that radiological limits are met under normal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operating conditions, the Commission is proposing that the atmospheric 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dispersion characteristics of the site will be required to be evaluated, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that site dispersion factors based upon this evaluation be determined and used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in assessing radiological consequences of normal operations as well as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accidents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Low Population Zone.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The present regulation requires that a low 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population zone (LPZ) be defined immediately beyond the exclusion area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Residents are permitted in this area, but the number and density must be such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that there is a reasonable probability that appropriate protective measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could be taken in their behalf in the event of a serious accident. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, the nearest densely populated center containing more than about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
25,000 residents must be located no closer than one and one-third times the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outer boundary of the LPZ. Finally, the dose to a hypothetical individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
located at the outer boundary of the LPZ over the entire course of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accident must not be in excess of the dose values given in the regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before 1980, the LPZ generally defined the distance over which public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protective actions were contemplated in the event of a serious accident. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations in 10 CFR 50.47 now requires plume exposure Emergency Planning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Zones (EPZ) of about 10 miles for each plant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the Commission considers that the siting functions intended for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the LPZ, namely, a low density of residents and the feasibility of taking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protective actions, have been accomplished by other regulations or can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplished by other guidance, the Commission continues to believe that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement that limits the radiological consequences over the course of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accident provides a useful evaluation of the plant's long-term capability to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mitigate postulated accidents. For this reason, the Commission is proposing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to retain the requirement that the dose consequences be evaluated at the outer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
boundary of the LPZ over the course of the postulated accident and that these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not be in excess of 25 rem TEDE.

Physical Characteristics of the Site.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 It has been required that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physical characteristics of the site, such as the geology, seismology, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hydrology, meteorology characteristics be considered in the design and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
construction of any plant proposed to be located there. The proposed rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would require that these characteristics be evaluated and that site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameters, such as design basis flood conditions or tornado wind loadings be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established for use in evaluating any plant to be located on that site in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order to ensure that the occurrence of such physical phenomena would pose no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undue hazard.

 As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for natural phenomena, it has been a long-standing NRC staff practice to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review man-related activities in the site vicinity to provide assurance that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential hazards associated with such facilities or transportation routes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will pose no undue risk to any plant proposed to be located at the site. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule would codify this practice.

 The proposed rule would require that the

characteristics of the site be such that adequate security plans and measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the plant could be developed. The Commission envisions that this would

entail a small secure area considerably smaller than that envisioned for the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Siting Away From Densely Populated Centers.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Population density considerations beyond the exclusion area have been required since issuance of part 100 in 1962.
The current rule requires a ``low population zone'' (LPZ) beyond the immediate exclusion area. The LPZ boundary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be of such a size that an individual located at its outer boundary must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not receive a dose in excess of the values given in part 100 over the course 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the accident. While numerical values of population or population density 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are not specified for this region, the regulation also requires that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nearest boundary of a densely populated center of about 25,000 or more persons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be located no closer than one and one-third times the LPZ outer boundary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part 100 has no population criteria other than the size of the LPZ and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proximity of the nearest population center, but notes that ``where very large 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cities are involved, a greater distance may be necessary.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whereas the exclusion area size is based upon limitation of individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk, population density requirements serve to set societal risk limitations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and reflect consideration of accidents beyond the design basis, or severe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accidents. Such accidents were clearly a consideration in the original 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issuance of part 100, since the Statement of Considerations (27 FR 3509; April 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12, 1962) noted that: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Further, since accidents of greater potential hazard than those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commonly postulated as representing an upper limit are conceivable, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
although highly improbable, it was considered desirable to provide for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection against excessive exposure doses to people in large centers, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where effective protective measures might not be feasible *&blank;*&blank;*. Hence, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population center distance was added as a site requirement.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Limitation of population density beyond the exclusion area has the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefits: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) It facilitates emergency preparedness and planning; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) It reduces potential doses to large numbers of people and reduces 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
property damage in the event of severe accidents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the Commission's Safety Goal policy provides guidance on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual risk limitations, in the form of the Quantitative Health Objectives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(QHO), it provides no guidance with regard to societal risk limitations and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore cannot be used to ascertain whether a particular population density 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would meet the Safety Goal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, results of severe accident risk studies, particularly those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtained from NUREG&hyph;1150, can provide useful insights for considering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential criteria for population density. Severe accidents having the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
highest consequences are those where core-melt together with early bypass of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or containment failure occurs. Such an event would likely lead to a ``large 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
release'' (without defining this precisely). Based upon NUREG&hyph;1150, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
probability of a core-melt accident together with early containment failure or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bypass for some current generation LWRs is estimated to be between 10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
^5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
^6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 per reactor year. For future plants, this value is expected to be less than 10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
^6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 per reactor year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a reactor was located nearer to a large city than current NRC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practice permitted, the likelihood of exposing a large number of people to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant releases of radioactive material would be about the same as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
probability of a core-melt and early containment failure, that is, less than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
^6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 per reactor year for future reactor designs. It is worth noting that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
events having the very low likelihood of about 10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
^6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 per reactor year or lower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been regarded in past licensing actions to be ``incredible'', and as such, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have not been required to be incorporated into the design basis of the plant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hence, based solely upon accident likelihood, it might be argued that siting a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactor nearer to a large city than current NRC practice would pose no undue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If, however, a reactor were sited away from large cities, the likelihood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the city being affected would be reduced because of two factors. First, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because the wind is expected to blow in all directions with roughly the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequency, the likelihood that radioactive material would actually be carried 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
towards the city is reduced significantly because it is likely that the wind 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will blow in a direction away from the city. Second, the radiological dose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consequences would also be reduced with distance because the radioactive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
material becomes increasingly diluted by the atmosphere and the inventory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
becomes depleted due to the natural processes of fallout and rainout before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reaching the city. Analyses indicate that if a reactor were located at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distances ranging from 10 to about 20 miles away from a city, depending upon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its size, the likelihood of exposure of large numbers of people within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
city would be reduced by factors of ten to one hundred or more compared with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
locating a reactor very close to a city. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, next-generation reactors are expected to have risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characteristics sufficiently low that the safety of the public is reasonably 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assured by the reactor and plant design and operation itself, resulting in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
very low likelihood of occurrence of a severe accident. Such a plant can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfy the QHOs of the Safety Goal with a very small exclusion area distance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(as low as 0.1 miles). The consequences of design basis accidents, analyzed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using revised source terms and with a realistic evaluation of engineered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety features, are likely to be found acceptable at distances of 0.25 miles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or less. With regard to population density beyond the exclusion area, siting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a reactor closer to a densely populated city than is current NRC practice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would pose a very low risk to the populace. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nevertheless, the Commission considers that defense-in-depth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considerations and the additional enhancement in safety to be gained by siting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactors away from densely populated centers should be maintained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is proposing a two-tier approach with regard to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population density and reactor sites. The proposed rule states that reactor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sites should be located away from very densely populated centers, and that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas of low population density are, generally, preferred. The Commission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that a site not falling within these two categories, although not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preferred, could be found acceptable under certain conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is not establishing specific numerical criteria for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluation of population density in siting future reactor facilities because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the acceptability of a specific site from the standpoint of population density 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be considered in the overall context of safety and environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considerations. The Commission's intent is to assure that a site that has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant safety, environmental or economic advantages is not rejected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solely because it has a higher population density than other available sites. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Population density is but one factor that must be balanced against the other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advantages and disadvantages of a particular site in determining the site's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptability. Thus, it must be recognized that sites with higher population 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
density, so long as they are located away from very densely populated centers, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can be approved by the Commission if they present advantages in terms of other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considerations applicable to the evaluation of proposed sites. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 28, 1977, Free Environment, Inc. et al., filed a petition for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking (PRM&hyph;50&hyph;20) requesting, among other things, that ``the central Iowa 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nuclear project and other reactors be sited at least 40 miles from major 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population centers.'' The petitioner also stated that ``locating reactors in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sparsely-populated areas *&blank;*&blank;* has been endorsed in non-binding NRC guidelines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for reactor siting.'' The petitioner did not specify what constituted a major 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population center. The only NRC guidelines concerning population density in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regard to reactor siting are in Regulatory Guide 4.7, issued in 1974, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revised in 1975, prior to the date of the petition. This guide states 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population density values of 500 persons per square mile out to a distance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30 miles from the reactor, not 40 miles.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulatory Guide 4.7 does provide effective separation from population 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
centers of various sizes. Under this guide, a population center of about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
25,000 or more residents should be no closer than 4 miles (6.4 km) from a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactor because a density of 500 persons per square mile within this distance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would yield a total population of about 25,000 persons. Similarly, a city of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
100,000 or more residents should be no closer than about 10 miles (16 km); a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
city of 500,000 or more persons should be no closer than about 20 miles (32 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
km), and a city of 1,000,000 or more persons should be no closer than about 30 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
miles (50 km) from the reactor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has examined these guidelines with regard to the Safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Goal. The Safety Goal quantitative health objective in regard to latent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cancer fatality states that, within a distance of ten miles (16 km) from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactor, the risk to the population of latent cancer fatality from nuclear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
power plant operation, including accidents, should not exceed one''tenth of one percent of the likelihood of latent
cancer fatalities from all other causes. In addition to the risks of latent cancer fatalities, the Commission has
also investigated the likelihood and extent of land contamination arising from the release of long lived radioactive
species, such as cesium-137, in the event of a severe reactor accident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The results of these analyses indicate that the latent cancer fatality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quantitative health objective noted above is met for current plant designs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
From analysis done in support of this proposed change in regulation, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
likelihood of permanent relocation of people located more than about 20 miles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(50 km) from the reactor as a result of land contamination from a severe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accident is very low. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Commission concludes that the current NRC staff guidance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in Regulatory Guide 4.7 provide a means of locating reactors away from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population centers, including ``major'' population centers, depending upon their size, that would limit societal
consequences significantly, in the event of a severe accident. The Commission finds that granting of the petitioner's

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request to specify population criteria out to 40 miles would not substantially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduce the risks to the public. As noted, the Commission also believes that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
higher population density site could be found to be acceptable, compared to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lower population density site, provided there were safety, environmental or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic advantages to the higher population site. Granting of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petitioner's request would neglect this possibility and would make population 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
density the sole criterion of site acceptability. For these reasons, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commission has decided not to adopt the proposal by Free Environment, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Incorporated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission also notes that future population growth around a nuclear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
power plant site, as in other areas of the region, is expected but cannot be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
predicted with great accuracy, particularly in the long-term. Since higher 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population density sites are not unacceptable, per se, the Commission does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intend to consider license conditions or restrictions upon an operating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactor solely upon the basis that the population density around it may reach 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or exceed levels that were not expected at the time of site approval. Finally, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Commission wishes to emphasize that population considerations as well as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other siting requirements apply only for the initial siting for new plants and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not be used in evaluating applications for the renewal of existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nuclear power plant licenses.

Change to 10 CFR Part 50 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed change to 10 CFR part 50 would relocate from 10 CFR Part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
100 the dose requirements for each applicant at specified distances. Because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these requirements affect reactor design rather than siting, they are more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriately located in 10 CFR part 50. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These requirements would apply to future applicants for a construction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permit, design certification, or an operating license. The Commission will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider after further experience in the review of certified designs whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more specific requirements need to be developed regarding revised accident

The following major changes in the proposed revision to Appendix A,

``Seismic and Geologic Siting Criteria for Nuclear Power Plants,'' to part 100, are associated with the proposed
seismic and earthquake engineering criteria rule making. These changes reflect new information and research results,
and incorporate the intentions of this regulatory action as defined in Section III of this proposed rule including
comments from the public on the first proposed revision of the regulations. A specific document explaining the NRC
staff's disposition of pertinent comments will be prepared coincident with the final rulemaking.

Criteria not associated with site suitability or establishment of the

Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motion (SSE) have been placed into 10 CFR part

50. This action is consistent with the location of other design requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in 10 CFR part 50. Because the revised criteria presented in the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation will not be applied to existing plants, the licensing basis for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing nuclear power plants must remain part of the regulations. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria on seismic and geologic siting would be designated as a new &sect;100.23 to subpart B in 10 CFR part 100. Criteria
on earthquake engineering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be designated as a new Appendix S, ``Earthquake Engineering Criteria for

2. Remove Detailed Guidance From the Regulation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current regulation contains both requirements and guidance on how to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfy the requirements. For example, Section IV, ``Required Investigations,'' of Appendix A, states that investigations
are required for vibratory ground motion, surface faulting, and seismically induced floods and water waves. Appendix
A then provides detailed guidance on what constitutes an acceptable investigation. A similar situation exists in
Section V, ``Seismic and Geologic Design Bases,'' of Appendix A. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Geoscience assessments require considerable latitude in judgment. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
latitude in judgment is needed because of limitations in data and the state-of-the-art of geologic and seismic analyses
and because of the rapid evolution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taking place in the geosciences in terms of accumulating knowledge and in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modifying concepts. This need appears to have been recognized when the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing regulation was developed. The existing regulation states that it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on limited geophysical and geological information and will be revised as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary when more complete information becomes available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, having geoscience assessments detailed and cast in a regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has created difficulty for applicants and the staff in terms of inhibiting the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of needed latitude in judgment. Also, it has inhibited flexibility in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applying basic principles to new situations and the use of evolving methods of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyses (for instance, probabilistic) in the licensing process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulation would be streamlined, becoming a new section in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subpart B to 10 CFR part 100 rather than a new appendix to part 100. Also, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the level of detail presented in the proposed regulation would be reduced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considerably. This approach reflects the philosophy of the first proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revision that the regulation only contains the basic requirements and that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detailed guidance, which is contained in the current regulation, Appendix A to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 CFR part 100, be removed to guidance documents. Thus, the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation contains: (a) Required definitions, (b) A requirement to determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the geological, seismological, and engineering characteristics of the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
site, and (c) A requirement to determine the Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Motion (SSE) and its uncertainty, to determine the potential for surface 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deformation, and to determine the design bases for seismically induced floods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and water waves. The guidance documents describe how to carry out these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required determinations. The key elements of the balanced approach to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine the SSE are presented in the following section. The elements are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the guidance that will be fully described in the guidance documents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulation is a new section in part 100 rather than an appendix 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to Part 100. The proposed regulation would identify and establish basic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements. Detailed guidance, that is, the procedures acceptable to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC for meeting the requirements, would be contained in a draft regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guide to be issued for public comment as Draft Regulatory Guide, DG&hyph;1032, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Identification and Characterization of Seismic Sources and Determination of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motions.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Uncertainties and Probabilistic Methods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The existing approach for determining a Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Motion (SSE) for a nuclear reactor site, embodied in appendix A to 10 CFR part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
100, relies on a ``deterministic'' approach. Using this deterministic approach, an applicant develops a single
set of earthquake sources, develops for each source a postulated earthquake to be used as the source of ground motion
that can affect the site, locates the postulated earthquake according to prescribed rules, and then calculates ground
motions at the site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although this approach has worked reasonably well for the past two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decades, in the sense that SSEs for plants sited with this approach are judged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be suitably conservative, the approach has not explicitly recognized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uncertainties in geosciences parameters. Because so little is known about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
earthquake phenomena (especially in the eastern United States), there have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
often been differences of opinion and differing interpretations among experts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as to the largest earthquakes to be considered and ground-motion models to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used, thus often making the licensing process relatively unstable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Over the past decade, analysis methods for incorporating these different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interpretations have been developed and used. These ``probabilistic'' methods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been designed to allow explicit incorporation of different models for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
zonation, earthquake size, ground motion, and other parameters. The advantage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of using these probabilistic methods is their ability to not only incorporate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different models and different data sets, but also to weight them using judgments as to the validity of the different
models and data sets, and thereby providing an explicit expression for the uncertainty in the ground motion estimates
and a means of assessing sensitivity to various input parameters. Another advantage of the probabilistic method
is the target exceedance probability is set by examining the design bases of more recently licensed nuclear power
plants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed revision to the regulation now explicitly recognizes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there are inherent uncertainties in establishing the seismic and geologic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design parameters and allows for the option of using a probabilistic seismic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazard methodology capable of propagating uncertainties as a means to address 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these uncertainties. The rule further recognizes that the nature of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uncertainty and the appropriate approach to account for it depend greatly on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the tectonic regime and parameters, such as, the knowledge of seismic sources, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the existence of historical and recorded data, and the understanding of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tectonics. Therefore, methods other than the probabilistic methods, such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sensitivity analyses, may be adequate for some sites to account for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uncertainties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC staff has achieved an appropriate balance between deterministic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and probabilistic seismic hazard evaluations to be used in the revision of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seismic and geologic siting criteria for nuclear power plants. The key 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elements of this balanced approach are:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Thus, the proposed approach requires thorough regional and site-specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
geoscience investigations. The proposed approach reflects some of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments of the U.S. utility industry. The U.S. Geological Survey provided a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
series of comments and recommendations that led to and can be met by the above 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
integrated approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Results of the regional and site-specific investigations must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered in application of the probabilistic method. The current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
probabilistic methods, the NRC sponsored study conducted by Lawrence Livermore 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National Laboratory (LLNL) or the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seismic hazard study, are essentially regional studies without detailed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information on any specific location. The regional and site-specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigations provide detailed information to update the database of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazard methodology to make the probabilistic analysis site-specific. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is also necessary to incorporate local site geological factors such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as stratigraphy and topography and to account for site-specific geotechnical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properties in establishing the design basis ground motion. In order to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporate local site factors and advances in ground motion attenuation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
models, ground motion estimates are determined using the procedures outlined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the Draft Standard Review Plan Section 2.5.2, Second Proposed Revision 3, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Vibratory Ground Motion.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Methods acceptable to the NRC staff for implementing the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation are described in Draft Regulatory Guide DG&hyph;1032, ``Identification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Characterization of Seismic Sources and Determination of Safe Shutdown 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Earthquake Ground Motions.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC staff's review approach to evaluate an application is described 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in Draft SRP Section 2.5.2. This review takes into account the information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
base developed in licensing more than 100 plants. This staff review is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with the intent of a USGS recommendation. Although the basic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
premise in establishing the target exceedance probability is that the current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design levels are adequate, a staff review further assures that there is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistency with previous licensing decisions and that the scientific basis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for decisions are clearly understood. This review approach will also assist 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in assessing the fairly complex regional probabilistic modeling which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporates multiple hypotheses and a multitude of parameters. Furthermore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this process should provide a clear basis for the staff's decisions and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilitate communication with nonexperts.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The existing regulation (10 CFR part 100, appendix A, section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
V(a)(1)(iv)) states ``The maximum vibratory accelerations of the Safe Shutdown 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Earthquake at each of the various foundation locations of the nuclear power 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plant structures at a given site shall be determined *&blank;*&blank;*''. The location of the seismic input motion
control point as stated in the existing regulation has led to confrontations with many applicants that believe this
stipulation is inconsistent with good engineering fundamentals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulation would move the location of the seismic input 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
motion control point from the foundation-level to the free-field at the free 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ground surface. The 1975 version of the Standard Review Plan placed the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control motion in the free-field. The proposed regulation is also consistent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the resolution of Unresolved Safety Issue (USI) A&hyph;40, ``Seismic Design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Criteria'' (August 1989), that resulted in the revision of Standard Review Plan Sections 2.5.2, 3.7.1, 3.7.2, and
3.7.3. However, the proposed regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires that the horizontal component of the Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Motion in the free-field at the foundation level of the structures must be an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate response spectrum considering the site geotechnical properties, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with a peak ground acceleration of at least 0.1g.

5. Value of the Operating Basis Earthquake Ground Motion (OBE) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Required OBE Analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The existing regulation (10 CFR, appendix A, section V(a)(2)) states 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the maximum vibratory ground motion of the OBE is at least one half the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximum vibratory ground motion of the Safe Shutdown Earthquake ground motion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, the existing regulation (10 CFR, appendix A, section VI(a)(2)) states 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the engineering method used to insure that structures, systems, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
components are capable of withstanding the effects of the OBE shall involve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the use of either a suitable dynamic analysis or a suitable qualification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test. In some cases, for instance piping, these multi-facets of the OBE in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the existing regulation made it possible for the OBE to have more design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significance than the SSE. A decoupling of the OBE and SSE has been suggested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in several documents. For instance, the NRC staff, SECY&hyph;79&hyph;300, suggested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that design for a single limiting event and inspection and evaluation for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
earthquakes in excess of some specified limit may be the most sound regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approach. NUREG&hyph;1061, ``Report of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Piping Review Committee,'' Vol. 5, April 1985, (Table 10.1) ranked a decoupling of the OBE and SSE as third out of six
high priority changes. In SECY&hyph;90&hyph;016, ``Evolutionary Light Water Reactor (LWR) Certification Issues
and Their Relationship to Current Regulatory Requirements,'' the NRC staff states that it agrees that the OBE should
not control the design of safety systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Activities equivalent to OBE&hyph;SSE decoupling are also being done in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
foreign countries. For instance, in Germany their new design standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires only one design basis earthquake (equivalent to the SSE). They 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require an inspection-level earthquake (for shutdown) of 0.4 SSE. This level 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was set so that the vibratory ground motion should not induce stresses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceeding the allowable stress limits originally required for the OBE design. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulation would allow the value of the OBE to be set at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) one-third or less of the SSE, where OBE requirements are satisfied without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an explicit response or design analyses being performed, or (ii) a value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greater than one-third of the SSE, where analysis and design are required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are two issues the applicant should consider in selecting the value of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the OBE: first, plant shutdown is required if vibratory ground motion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceeding that of the OBE occurs (discussed below in Item 6, Required Plant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Shutdown), and second, the amount of analyses associated with the OBE. An 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicant may determine that at one-third of the SSE level, the probability of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceeding the OBE vibratory ground motion is too high, and the cost associated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with plant shutdown for inspections and testing of equipment and structures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior to restarting the plant is unacceptable. Therefore, the applicant may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
voluntarily select an OBE value at some higher fraction of the SSE to avoid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plant shutdowns. However, if an applicant selects an OBE value at a fraction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the SSE higher than one-third, a suitable analysis shall be performed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrate that the requirements associated with the OBE are satisfied. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design shall take into account soil-structure interaction effects and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected duration of the vibratory ground motion. The requirement associated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the OBE is that all structures, systems, and components of the nuclear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
power plant necessary for continued operation without undue risk to the health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and safety of the public shall remain functional and within applicable stress, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
strain and deformation limits when subjected to the effects of the OBE in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combination with normal operating loads. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated above, it is determined that if an OBE of one-third of the SSE 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is used, the requirements of the OBE can be satisfied without the applicant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performing any explicit response analyses. In this case, the OBE serves the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
function of an inspection and shutdown earthquake. Some minimal design checks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the applicability of this position to seismic base isolation of buildings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are discussed below. There is high confidence that, at this ground-motion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level with other postulated concurrent loads, most critical structures, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems, and components will not exceed currently used design limits. This is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensured, in part, because PRA insights will be used to support a margins-type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment of seismic events. A PRA-based seismic margins analysis will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider sequence-level High Confidence, Low Probability of Failures (HCLPFs) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and fragilities for all sequences leading to core damage or containment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failures up to approximately one and two-thirds the ground motion acceleration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the design basis SSE (Reference: Item II.N, Site-Specific Probabilistic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Risk Assessment and Analysis of External Events, memorandum from Samuel J. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Licensing Issues Pertaining to Evolutionary and Advance Light-Water Reactor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ALWR) Designs, dated July 21, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are situations associated with current analyses where only OBE is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with the design requirements, for example, the ultimate heat sink 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(see Regulatory Guide 1.27, ``Ultimate Heat Sink for Nuclear Power Plants''). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In these situations, a value expressed as a fraction of the SSE response would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be used in the analyses. Section VIII of this proposed rule identifies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing guides that would be revised technically to maintain the existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design philosophy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In SECY&hyph;93&hyph;087, ``Policy, Technical, and Licensing Issues Pertaining to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Evolutionary and Advance Light-Water Reactor (ALWR) Designs,'' the NRC staff 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested Commission approval on 42 technical and policy issues pertaining to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either evolutionary LWRs, passive LWRs, or both. The issue pertaining to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elimination of the OBE is designated I.M. The NRC staff identified actions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary for the design of structures, systems, and components when the OBE 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design requirement is eliminated. The staff clarified that guidelines should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be maintained to ensure the functionality of components, equipment, and their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supports. In addition, the staff clarified how certain design requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are to be considered for buildings and structures that are currently designed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the OBE, but not the SSE. Also, the NRC staff has evaluated the effect on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety of eliminating the OBE from the design load combinations for selected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
structures, systems, and components and has developed proposed criteria for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis using only the SSE. Commission approval is documented in the Chilk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to Taylor memorandum dated July 21, 1993, cited above.

More than one earthquake response analysis for a seismic base isolated

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with base isolated facilities will be handled on a case by case

6. Required Plant Shutdow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current regulation (Section V(a)(2)) states that if vibratory ground 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
motion exceeding that of the OBE occurs, shutdown of the nuclear power plant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is required. The supplementary information to the final regulation (published 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
November 13, 1973; 38 FR 31279, Item 6e) includes the following statement: ``A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
footnote has been added to &sect;50.36(c)(2) of 10 CFR part 50 to assure that each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
power plant is aware of the limiting condition of operation which is imposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under section V(2) of appendix A to 10 CFR part 100. This limitation requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that if vibratory ground motion exceeding that of the OBE occurs, shutdown of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the nuclear power plant will be required. Prior to resuming operations, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licensee will be required to demonstrate to the Commission that no functional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
damage has occurred to those features necessary for continued operation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without undue risk to the health and safety of the public.'' At that time, it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was the intention of the Commission to treat the Operating Basis Earthquake as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a limiting condition of operation. From the statement in the Supplementary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information, the Commission directed applicants to specifically review 10 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part 100 to be aware of this intention in complying with the requirements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 CFR 50.36. Thus, the requirement to shut down if an OBE occurs was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected to be implemented by being included among the technical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifications submitted by applicants after the adoption of Appendix A. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fact, applicants did not include OBE shutdown requirements in their technical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulation would treat plant shutdown associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vibratory ground motion exceeding the OBE or significant plant damage as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition in every operating license. A new &sect;50.54(ff) would be added to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations to require a process leading to plant shutdown for licensees of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nuclear power plants that comply with the earthquake engineering criteria in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph IV(a)(3) of Proposed Appendix S, ``Earthquake Engineering Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for Nuclear Power Plants,'' to 10 CFR part 50. Immediate shutdown could be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required until it is determined that structures, systems, and components 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needed for safe shutdown are still functional. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Draft Regulatory Guide DG&hyph;1034, ``Pre-Earthquake Planning and Immediate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nuclear Power Plant Operator Post-Earthquake Actions,'' is being developed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide guidance acceptable to the NRC staff for determining whether or not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vibratory ground motion exceeding the OBE ground motion or significant plant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
damage had occurred and the timing of nuclear power plant shutdown. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidance is based on criteria developed by the Electric Power Research 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Institute (EPRI). The decision to shut down the plant should be made within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eight hours after the earthquake. The data from the seismic instrumentation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coupled with information obtained from a plant walk down, are used to make the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination of when the plant should be shut down, if it has not already 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been shut down by operational perturbations resulting from the seismic event. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The guidance being developed in Draft Regulatory Guide DG&hyph;1034 is based on two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assumptions, first, that the nuclear power plant has operable seismic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instrumentation, including the equipment and software required to process the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data within four hours after an earthquake, and second, that the operator walk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
down inspections can be performed in approximately four to eight hours 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
depending on the number of personnel conducting the inspection. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation also includes a provision that requires the licensee to consult 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the Commission and to propose a plan for the timely, safe shutdown of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nuclear power plant if systems, structures, or components necessary for a safe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shutdown or to maintain a safe shutdown are not available. (This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unavailability may be due to earthquake related damage.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Draft Regulatory Guide DG&hyph;1035, ``Restart of a Nuclear Power Plant Shut 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptable to the NRC staff for performing inspections and tests of nuclear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
power plant equipment and structures prior to plant restart. This guidance is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also based on EPRI reports. Prior to resuming operations, the licensee must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrate to the Commission that no functional damage has occurred to those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
features necessary for continued operation without undue risk to the health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and safety of the public. The results of post-shutdown inspections, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operability checks, and surveillance tests must be documented in written 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reports and submitted to the Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee shall not resume operation until authorized to do so by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation.

VII. Future Regulatory Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several existing regulatory guides will be revised to incorporate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
editorial changes or maintain the existing design or analysis philosophy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These guides will be issued subsequent to the publication of the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations that would implement this proposed action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following regulatory guides will be revised to incorporate editorial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes, for example to reference new sections to part 100 or appendix S to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part 50. No technical changes will be made in these regulatory guides. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

X. Questions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to soliciting comments on all aspects of this rulemaking, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Commission specifically requests comments on the following questions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Nonseismic Criteria
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Should the dose acceptance criteria be modified from 25 rem whole 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
body and 300 rem to the thyroid to utilize the concept of total effective dose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalent (TEDE), and if so, what TEDE value should be adopted? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Assuming that a dose acceptance criterion of 25 rem total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective dose equivalent (TEDE) is adopted, should an organ limitation or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``capping'' dose be included, and if so, what should such a limit be? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
XI. Finding of No Significant Environmental Impact: Availability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has determined under the National Environmental Policy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act of 1969, as amended, and the Commission's regulations in Subpart A of 10 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CFR Part 51, that this proposed regulation, if adopted, would not be a major 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and therefore an environmental impact statement is not required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revisions associated with the reactor siting criteria in 10 CFR part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
100 and the relocation of the plant design requirements from 10 CFR part 100 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to 10 CFR Part 50 have been evaluated against the current requirements. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commission has concluded that relocating the requirement for a dose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculation to Part 50 and adding more specific site criteria to part 100 does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not decrease the protection of the public health and safety over the current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. The proposed amendments do not affect nonradiological plant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effluents and have no other environmental impact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The addition of &sect;100.23 to 10 CFR part 100, and the addition of appendix 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
S to 10 CFR part 50, will not change the radiological environmental impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offsite. Onsite occupational radiation exposure associated with inspection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and maintenance will not change. These activities are principally associated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with base line inspections of structures, equipment, and piping, and with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintenance of seismic instrumentation. Base line inspections are needed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
differentiate between pre-existing conditions at the nuclear power plant and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
earthquake related damage. The structures, equipment and piping selected for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these inspections are those routinely examined by plant operators during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
normal plant walkdowns and inspections. Routine maintenance of seismic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instrumentation ensures its operability during earthquakes. The location of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the seismic instrumentation is similar to that in the existing nuclear power 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plants. The proposed amendments do not affect nonradiological plant effluents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and have no other environmental impact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which this determination is based are available for inspection at the NRC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC. Single 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
copies of the environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are available from Mr. Leonard Soffer, Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

XII. Paperwork Reduction Act Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed regulation amends information collection requirements that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). This proposed regulation has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review and approval of the
paperwork requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is no public reporting burden related to the nonseismic siting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria. Public reporting burden for the collection of information related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the seismic and earthquake engineering criteria is estimated to average 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
800,000 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and completing and reviewing the collection of information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Information and Records Management Branch (T&hyph;6 F33), U.S. Nuclear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555; and to the Desk Officer, Office 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Information and Regulatory Affairs, NEOB&hyph;10202, (3150&hyph;0011 and 3150&hyph;0093),

XIII. Regulatory Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has prepared a draft regulatory analysis on this proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation. The analysis examines the costs and benefits of the alternatives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered by the Commission. The draft analysis is available for inspection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW. (Lower Level), Washington, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DC. Single copies of the analysis are available from Mr. Leonard Soffer, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Washington, DC 20555, telephone (301) 415&hyph;6574, or Dr. Andrew J. Murphy,

XIV. Regulatory Flexibility Certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
605(b)), the Commission certifies that this proposed regulation will not, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promulgated, have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small entities. This proposed regulation affects only the licensing and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation of nuclear power plants. Nuclear power plant site applicants do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fall within the definition of small businesses as defined in Section 3 of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632), the Small Business Size Standards of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Small Business Administrator (13 CFR part 121), or the Commission's Size 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standards (56 FR 56671; November 6, 1991).

XV. Backfit Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC has determined that the backfit rule, 10 CFR 50.109, does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply to this proposed regulation, and therefore, a backfit analysis is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required for this proposed regulation because these amendments do not involve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any provisions that would impose backfits as defined in 10 CFR 50.109(a)(1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulation would apply only to applicants for future nuclear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
power plant construction permits, preliminary design approval, final design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval, manufacturing licenses, early site reviews, operating licenses, and

Exclusion area
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means that area surrounding the reactor, in which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the reactor licensee has the authority to determine all activities including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclusion or removal of personnel and property from the area. This area may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be traversed by a highway, railroad, or waterway, provided these are not so 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
close to the facility as to interfere with normal operations of the facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and provided appropriate and effective arrangements are made to control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
traffic on the highway, railroad, or waterway, in case of emergency, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protect the public health and safety. Residence within the exclusion area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall normally be prohibited. In any event, residents shall be subject to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ready removal in case of necessity. Activities unrelated to operation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactor may be permitted in an exclusion area under appropriate limitations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided that no significant hazards to the public health and safety will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

measures could be taken in their behalf in the event of a serious accident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These guides do not specify a permissible population density or total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

certification or combined license pursuant to part 52 of this chapter, shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comply with paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A description and safety assessment of the site on which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the facility is to be located, with appropriate attention to features 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affecting facility design. Special attention should be directed to the site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluation factors identified in part 100 of this chapter. The assessment must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contain an analysis and evaluation of the major structures, systems and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
components of the facility which bear significantly on the acceptability of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the site under the site evaluation factors identified in part 100 of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chapter, assuming that the facility will be operated at the ultimate power 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level which is contemplated by the applicant. With respect to operation at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the projected initial power level, the applicant is required to submit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information prescribed in paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(8) of this section, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
well as the information required by this paragraph, in support of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application for a construction permit, or a design approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A description and safety assessment of the site and a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety assessment of the facility. It is expected that reactors will reflect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through their design , construction and operation an extremely low probability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for accidents that could result in the release of significant quantities of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
radioactive fission products. The following power reactor design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characteristics and proposed operation will be taken into consideration by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commission: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Intended use of the reactor including the proposed maximum power 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level and the nature and inventory of contained radioactive materials; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The extent to which generally accepted engineering standards are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applied to the design of the reactor; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The extent to which the reactor incorporates unique, unusual or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enhanced safety features having a significant bearing on the probability or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consequences of accidental release of radioactive materials; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) The safety features that are to be engineered into the facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and those barriers that must be breached as a result of an accident before a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
release of radioactive material to the environment can occur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Special attention must be directed to plant design features intended to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mitigate the radiological consequences of accidents. In performing this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment, an applicant shall assume a fission product release
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 from the core into the containment assuming that the facility is operated at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ultimate power level contemplated. The applicant shall perform an evaluation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and analysis of the postulated fission product release, using the expected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrable containment leak rate and any fission product cleanup systems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended to mitigate the consequences of the accidents, together with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable site characteristics, including site meteorology, to evaluate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offsite radiological consequences. Site characteristics must comply with part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
100 of this chapter. The evaluation must determine that:

The fission product release assumed for this evaluation should be based upon a major accident, hypothesized for purposes
of site analysis or postulated from considerations of possible accidental events. Such accidents have generally
been assumed to result in substantial meltdown of the core with subsequent release into the containment of appreciable
quantities of fission products.

A whole body does of 25 rem has been stated to correspond numerically to the once in a lifetime accidental or emergency
dose for radiation workers which, according to NCRP recommendations at the time could be disregarded in the determination
of their radiation expousre status (see NBS Handbook 69 dated June 5, 1959). However, its use is not intended to imply
that this number constitutes an acceptable limit for an emergency does to the public under accident conditions. Rather,
this does value has been set forth in this section as a reference value, which can be used in the evaluation of plant design
features with respect to postulated reactor accidents, in order to assure that such designs provide assurance of
low risk of public exposure to radiation, in the event of such accidents.

I. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Each applicant for a construction permit, operating license, design certification, or combined license is required
by &sect;50.34(a)(12), (b)(10), and General Design Criterion 2 of appendix A to this part to design nuclear power
plant structures, systems, and components important to safety to withstand the effects of natural phenomena, such
as earthquakes, without loss of capability to perform their safety functions. Also, as specified in &sect;50.54(ff),
nuclear power plants that have implemented the earthquake engineering criteria described herein must shut down
if the criteria in paragraph IV(a)(3) of this appendix are exceeded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These criteria implement General Design Criterion 2 insofar as it requires structures, systems, and components
important to safety to withstand the effects of earthquakes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Operating Basis Earthquake Ground Motion (OBE) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
is the vibratory ground motion for which those features of the nuclear power plant necessary for continued operation

A 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
response spectrum 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
is a plot of the maximum responses (acceleration, velocity, or displacement) of idealized single-degree-of-freedom
oscillators as a function of the natural frequencies of the oscillators for a given damping value. The response spectrum
is calculated for a specified vibratory motion input at the oscillators' supports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motion 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(SSE) is the vibratory ground motion for which certain structures, systems, and components must be designed to remain
functional. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

structures, systems, and components required to withstand the effects of the Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motion
or surface deformation 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
are those necessary to assure: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The integrity of the reactor coolant pressure boundary, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The capability to shut down the reactor and maintain it in a safe shutdown condition, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The capability to prevent or mitigate the consequences of accidents that could result in potential offsite exposures
comparable to the guideline exposures of &sect;50.34(a)(1)(ii).

is distortion of geologic strata at or near the ground surface by the processes of folding or faulting as a result of
various earth forces. Tectonic surface deformation is associated with earthquake processes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Application to Engineering Design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The following are pursuant to the seismic and geologic design basis requirements of &sect;100.23 of this chapter:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Vibratory Ground Motion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motion. The Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motion must be characterized by
free-field ground motion response spectra at the free ground surface. In view of the limited data available on vibratory
ground motions of strong earthquakes, it usually will be appropriate that the design response spectra be smoothed
spectra. The horizontal component of the Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motion in the free-field at the foundation
level of the structures must be an appropriate response spectrum with a peak ground acceleration of at least 0.1g.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The nuclear power plant must be designed so that, if the Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motion occurs, certain structures,
systems, and components will remain functional and within applicable stress, strain, and deformation limits. In
addition to seismic loads, applicable concurrent normal operating, functional, and accident-induced loads must
be taken into account in the design of these safety-related structures, systems, and components. The design of the
nuclear power plant must also take into account the possible effects of the Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motion
on the facility foundations by ground disruption, such as fissuring, lateral spreads, differential settlement,
liquefaction, and landsliding, as required in &sect;100.23 to part 100 of this chapter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The required safety functions of structures, systems, and components must be assured during and after the vibratory
ground motion associated with the Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motion through design, testing, or qualification
methods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The evaluation must take into account soil-structure interaction effects and the expected duration of vibratory
motion. It is permissible to design for strain limits in excess of yield strain in some of these safety-related structures,
systems, and components during the Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motion and under the postulated concurrent loads,
provided the necessary safety functions are maintained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Operating Basis Earthquake Ground Motion.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) The Operating Basis Earthquake Ground Motion must be characterized by response spectra. The value of the Operating
Basis Earthquake Ground Motion must be set to one of the following choices: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) One-third or less of the Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motion design response spectra. The requirements associated
with this Operating Basis Earthquake Ground Motion in paragraph (a)(2)(i)(B)(I) can be satisfied without the applicant
performing explicit response or design analyses, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) A value greater than one-third of the Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motion design response spectra. Analysis
and design must be performed to demonstrate that the requirements associated with this Operating Basis Earthquake
Ground Motion in paragraph (a)(2)(i)(B)(I) are satisfied. The design must take into account soil-structure interaction
effects and the duration of vibratory ground motion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(I) When subjected to the effects of the Operating Basis Earthquake Ground Motion in combination with normal operating
loads, all structures, systems, and components of the nuclear power plant necessary for continued operation without
undue risk to the health and safety of the public must remain functional and within applicable stress, strain, and
deformation limits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Required Plant Shutdown. If vibratory ground motion exceeding that of the Operating Basis Earthquake Ground
Motion or if significant plant damage occurs, the licensee must shut down the nuclear power plant. If systems, structures,
or components necessary for the safe shutdown of the nuclear power plant are not available after the occurrence of
the OBE, the licensee must consult with the Commission and must propose a plan for the timely, safe shutdown of the nuclear
power plant. Prior to resuming operations, the licensee must demonstrate to the Commission that no functional damage
has occurred to those features necessary for continued operation without undue risk to the health and safety of the
public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Required Seismic Instrumentation. Suitable instrumentation must be provided so that the seismic response of
nuclear power plant features important to safety can be evaluated promptly after an earthquake. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Surface Deformation. The potential for surface deformation must be taken into account in the design of the nuclear
power plant by providing reasonable assurance that in the event of deformation, certain structures, systems, and
components will remain functional. In addition to surface deformation induced loads, the design of safety features
must take into account seismic loads, including aftershocks, and applicable concurrent functional and accident-induced
loads. The design provisions for surface deformation must be based on its postulated occurrence in any direction
and azimuth and under any part of the nuclear power plant, unless evidence indicates this assumption is not appropriate,
and must take into account the estimated rate at which the surface deformation may occur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Seismically Induced Floods and Water Waves and Other Design Conditions. Seismically induced floods and water
waves from either locally or distantly generated seismic activity and other design conditions determined pursuant
to &sect;100.23 of this chapter must be taken into account in the design of the nuclear power plant so as to prevent undue
risk to the health and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety of the public.

11. Section 100.1 is revised to read as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 -->
&sect;100.1 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->
Purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The purpose of this part is to establish approval requirements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed sites for stationary power and testing reactors subject to part 50 or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part 52 of this chapter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) There exists a substantial base of knowledge regarding power reactor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
siting, design, construction and operation. This base reflects that the primary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors that determine public health and safety are the reactor design, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
construction and operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Siting factors and criteria are important in assuring that radiological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
doses from normal operation and postulated accidents will be acceptably low, that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
natural phenomena and potential man-made hazards will be appropriately accounted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for in the design of the plant, and that the site characteristics are amenable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the development of adequate emergency plans to protect the public and adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
security measures to protect the plant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) This approach incorporates the appropriate standards and criteria for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval of stationary power and testing reactor sites. The Commission intends 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to carry out a traditional defense-in-depth approach with regard to reactor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
siting to ensure public safety. Siting away from densely populated centers has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been and will continue to be an important factor in evaluating applications for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
site approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area which contains residents, the total number and density of which are such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that there is a reasonable probability that appropriate protective measures could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be taken in their behalf in the event of a serious accident. These guides do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specify a permissible population density or total population within this zone 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because the situation may vary from case to case. Whether a specific number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
people can, for example, be evacuated from a specific area, or instructed to take 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shelter, on a timely basis will depend on many factors such as location, number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and size of highways, scope and extent of advance planning, and actual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of residents within the area.

Factors to be considered when evaluating sites. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Factors considered in the evaluation of sites include those relating both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the proposed reactor design and the characteristics peculiar to the site. It 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is expected that reactors will reflect through their design, construction and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation an extremely low probability for accidents that could result in release 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of significant quantities of radioactive fission products. In addition, the site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
location and the engineered features included as safeguards against the hazardous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consequences of an accident, should one occur, should insure a low risk of public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure. In particular, the Commission will take the following factors into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration in determining the acceptability of a site for a power or testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactor: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Characteristics of reactor design and proposed operation including_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Intended use of the reactor including the proposed maximum power level 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the nature and inventory of contained radioactive materials; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The extent to which generally accepted engineering standards are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applied to the design of the reactor; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The extent to which the reactor incorporates unique or unusual features 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
having a significant bearing on the probability or consequences of accidental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
release of radioactive materials; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The safety features that are to be engineered into the facility and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those barriers that must be breached as a result of an accident before a release 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of radioactive material to the environment can occur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Population density and use characteristics of the site environs, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including the exclusion area, low population zone, and the population center 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Physical characteristics of the site, including seismology, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meteorology, geology, and hydrology. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Appendix A to Part 100, ``Seismic and Geologic Siting Criteria for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nuclear Power Plants'' describes the nature of investigations required to obtain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the geologic and seismic data necessary to determine site suitability and to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide reasonable assurance that a nuclear power plant can be constructed and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operated at a proposed site without undue risk to the health and safety of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public. It describes procedures for determining the quantitative vibratory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ground motion design basis at a site due to earthquakes and describes information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needed to determine whether and to what extent a nuclear power plant need be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designed to withstand the effects of surface faulting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Meteorological conditions at the site and in the surrounding area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Geological and hydrological characteristics of the proposed site may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have a bearing on the consequences of an escape of radioactive material from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility. Special precautions should be planned if a reactor is to be located 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at a site where a significant quantity of radioactive effluent might accidentally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flow into nearby streams or rivers or might find ready access to underground 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water tables.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) As an aid in evaluating a proposed site, an applicant should assume a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fission product release
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 from the core, the expected demonstrable leak rate from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the containment and the meteorological conditions pertinent to his site to derive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an exclusion area, a low population zone and population center distance. For the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose of this analysis, which shall set forth the basis for the numerical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
values used, the applicant should determine the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The fission product release assumed for these calculations should be based upon a major accident, hypothesized for
purposes of site analysis or postulated from considerations of possible accidential events, that would result in
potential hazards not exceeded by those from any accident considered credible. Such accidents have generally been
assumed to result in substantial meltdown of the core with subsequent release of appreciable quantities of fission
products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) An exclusion area of such size that an individual located at any point 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on its boundary for two hours immediately following onset of the postulated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fission product release would not receive a total radiation dose to the whole 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
body in excess of 25 rem
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 or a total radiation dose in excess of 300 rem to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thyroid from iodine exposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The whole body dose of 25 rem referred to above corresponds numerically to the once in a lifetime accidental or emergency
dose for radiation workers which, according to NCRP recommendations may be disregarded in the determination of their
radiation exposure status (see NBS Handbook 69 dated June 5, 1959). However, neither its use nor that of the 300 rem
value for thyroid exposure as set forth in these site criteria guides are intended to imply that these numbers constitute
acceptable limits for emergency doses to the public under accident conditions. Rather, this 25 rem whole body value
and the 300 rem thyroid value have been set forth in these guides as reference values, which can be used in the evaluation
of reactor sites with respect to potential reactor accidents of exceedingly low probability of occurrence, and low
risk of public exposure to radiation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) A low population zone of such size that an individual located at any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
point on its outer boundary who is exposed to the radioactive cloud resulting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the postulated fission product release (during the entire period of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
passage) would not receive a total radiation dose to the whole body in excess of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
25 rem or a total radiation dose in excess of 300 rem to the thyroid from iodine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A population center distance of at least one and one''third times the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distance from the reactor to the outer boundary of the low population zone. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applying this guide, the boundary of the population center shall be determined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upon consideration of population distribution. Political boundaries are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controlling in the application of this guide. Where very large cities are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involved, a greater distance may be necessary because of total integrated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population dose consideration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) For sites for multiple reactor facilities consideration should be given 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If the reactors are independent to the extent that an accident in one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactor would not initiate an accident in another, the size of the exclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area, low population zone and population center distance shall be fulfilled with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respect to each reactor individually. The envelopes of the plan overlay of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas so calculated shall then be taken as their respective boundaries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the reactors are interconnected to the extent that an accident in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one reactor could affect the safety of operation of any other, the size of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclusion area, low population zone and population center distance shall be based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upon the assumption that all interconnected reactors emit their postulated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fission product releases simultaneously. This requirement may be reduced in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relation to the degree of coupling between reactors, the probability of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concomitant accidents and the probability that an individual would not be exposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the radiation effects from simultaneous releases. The applicant would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected to justify to the satisfaction of the Commission the basis for such a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction in the source term. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The applicant is expected to show that the simultaneous operation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
multiple reactors at a site will not result in total radioactive effluent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 releases beyond the allowable limits of applicable regulations.

The Commission will take the following factors into consideration in

determining the acceptability of a site for a stationary power reactor: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Population density and use characteristics of the site environs, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including the exclusion area, the population distribution, and site-related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characteristics must be evaluated to determine whether individual as well as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
societal risk of potential plant accidents is low, and that site-related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characteristics would not prevent the development of a plan to carry out suitable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protective actions for members of the public in the event of emergency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The nature and proximity of man-related hazards (e.g., airports, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dams, transportation routes, military and chemical facilities) must be evaluated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to establish site parameters for use in determining whether a plant design can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accommodate commonly occurring hazards, and whether the risk of other hazards is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
very low.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The population center distance, as defined in &sect;100.3, must be at least one and one-third times the distance
from the reactor to the outer boundary of (the low population zone. In applying this guide, the boundary of the population
center shall be determined upon consideration of population distribution. Political boundaries are not controlling
in the application of this guide; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Site atmospheric dispersion characteristics must be evaluated and dispersion parameters established such
that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Radiological effluent release limits associated with normal operation from the type of facility proposed to
be located at the site can be met for any individual located offsite; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Radiological dose consequences of postulated accidents shall meet the criteria set forth in &sect;50.34(a)(1)
of this chapter for the type of facility proposed to be located at the site; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The physical characteristics of the site, including meteorology, geology, seismology, and hydrology must be
evaluated and site parameters established such that potential threats from such physical characteristics will
pose no undue risk to the type of facility proposed to be located at the site; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Potential hazards associated with nearby transportation routes, industrial and military facilities must be
evaluated and site parameters established such that potential hazards from such routes and facilities will pose
no undue risk to the type of facility proposed to be located at the site; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Site characteristics must be such that adequate security plans and measures can be developed;

event of emergency can be developed: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Reactor sites should be located away from very densely populated centers. Areas of low population density are,
generally, preferred. However, in determining the acceptability of a particular site located away from a very densely

This section sets forth the principal geologic and seismic considerations that guide the Commission in its evaluation
of the suitability of a proposed site and adequacy of the design bases established in consideration of the geologic
and seismic characteristics of the proposed site, such that, there is a reasonable assurance that a nuclear power
plant can be constructed and operated at the proposed site without undue risk to the health and safety of the public.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applications to engineering design are contained in appendix S to part 50 of this chapter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Applicability. The requirements in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section apply to applicants for an early site
permit or combined license pursuant to part 52 of this chapter, or a construction permit or operating license for a
nuclear power plant pursuant to Part 50 of this chapter on or after [EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE FINAL RULE]. However, if the
construction permit was issued prior to [EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE FINAL RULE], the operating license applicant shall
comply with the seismic and geologic siting criteria in appendix A to part 100 of this chapter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Commencement of construction. The investigations required in paragraph (c) of this section are within the scope
of investigations permitted by &sect;50.10(c)(1) of this chapter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Geological, seismological, and engineering characteristics. The geological, seismological, and engineering
characteristics of a site and its environs must be investigated in sufficient scope and detail to permit an adequate
evaluation of the proposed site, to provide sufficient information to support evaluations performed to arrive at
estimates of the Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motion, and to permit adequate engineering solutions to actual
or potential geologic and seismic effects at the proposed site. The size of the region to be investigated and the type
of data pertinent to the investigations must be determined based on the nature of the region surrounding the proposed
site. Data on the vibratory ground motion, tectonic surface deformation, nontectonic deformation, earthquake
recurrence rates, fault geometry and slip rates, site foundation material, and seismically induced floods and water
waves must be obtained by reviewing pertinent literature and carrying out field investigations. However, each applicant
shall investigate all geologic and seismic factors (for example, volcanic activity) that may affect the design and
operation of the proposed nuclear power plant irrespective of whether such factors are explicitly included in this
section.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(d) Geologic and seismic siting factors. The geologic and seismic siting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors considered for design must include a determination of the Safe Shutdown 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Earthquake Ground Motion for the site, the potential for surface tectonic and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nontectonic deformations, the design bases for seismically induced floods and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water waves, and other design conditions as stated in paragraph (d)(4) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Determination of the Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motion. The Safe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motion for the site is characterized by both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
horizontal and vertical free-field ground motion response spectra at the free 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ground surface. The Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motion for the site is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined considering the results of the investigations required by paragraph (c) of this section. Uncertainties
are inherent in such estimates. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uncertainties must be addressed through an appropriate analysis, such as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
probabilistic seismic hazard analysis or suitable sensitivity analyses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph IV(a)(1) of appendix S to part 50 of this chapter defines the minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motion for design. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Determination of the potential for surface tectonic and nontectonic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deformations. Sufficient geological, seismological, and geophysical data must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be provided to clearly establish whether there is a potential for surface 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deformation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Determination of design bases for seismically induced floods and water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waves. The size of seismically induced floods and water waves that could affect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a site from either locally or distantly generated seismic activity must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Determination of siting factors for other design conditions. Siting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors for other design conditions that must be evaluated include soil and rock 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stability, liquefaction potential, natural and artificial slope stability, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooling water supply, and remote safety-related structure siting. Each applicant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall evaluate all siting factors and potential causes of failure, such as, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physical properties of the materials underlying the site, ground disruption, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the effects of vibratory ground motion that may affect the design and operation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the proposed nuclear power plant.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Airbus Model
A310 and A300&hyph;600 series airplanes. This proposal would require that certain flight control computers be modified
so that the autopilot will disengage whenever the airplane is in the ``go-around'' mode. This proposal is prompted
by an accident in which the flight crew may have attempted a go-around while the airplane was in an out-of-trim condition.
The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent severely reduced controllability of the airplane
due to an out-of-trim condition between the trimmable horizontal stabilizer and the elevator.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthiness authority for France,
recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Airbus Model A310 and A300&hyph;600 series
airplanes. The French DGAC advises that a Model A300&hyph;600 series airplane was recently involved in an accident
during which the flight crew may have attempted a go-around while the airplane was in an out-of-trim condition. Investigation
into the cause of this out-of-trim condition revealed that the flight crew may have attempted to override the autopilot
while it was engaged in the COMMAND mode. If the airplane is in pitch axis, and the autopilot is overridden for prolonged
periods by the flight crew via manual input from the control column, and if the autopilot is subsequently disengaged,
the resultant out-of-trim condition between the trimmable horizontal stabilizer and the elevator could reduce
controllability of the airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further investigation indicates that the design of Model A300&hyph;600 series airplanes does not provide for disengagement
of the autopilot in a manner that would allow for manual input from the control column without adversely affecting
controllability of the airplane. The design of Model A310 series airplanes is identical in this respect to Model A300&hyph;600
series airplanes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The French DGAC issued French Airworthiness Directive 94&hyph;185&hyph;165(B), dated August 17, 1994, in order
to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in France. The French AD requires modification of FCC's
having part numbers (P/N) B216ABM6, B350AAM1, B350AAM2, B350AAM3, and B470ABM1 (for Model A310 series airplanes);
and P/N's B297AAM3, B297AAM4, B297AAM5, and B470AAM1 (for Model A300&hyph;600 series airplanes). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The French AD references Airbus Service Bulletins A310&hyph;22&hyph;2036, dated December 14, 1993 (for Model A310
series airplanes), and A300&hyph;22&hyph;6021, Revision 1, dated December 24, 1993 (for Model A300&hyph;600 series
airplanes), as the appropriate sources of service information to accomplish the modification of the FCC's. However,
Airbus Service Bulletin A310&hyph;22&hyph;2036, dated December 14, 1993, describes procedures for modification
of only one of the FCC's, P/N B470ABM1, which is installed on Model A310 series airplanes; while Airbus Service Bulletin
A300&hyph;22&hyph;6021, Revision 1, dated December 24, 1993, describes procedures for modification of only one
of the FCC's, P/N B470AAM1, which is installed on Model A300&hyph;600 series airplanes. Upon accomplishment of this
software modification, the autopilot will disengage whenever the airplane is in the ``go-around'' mode above 400
feet radio altitude and whenever the pilot attempts to override the autopilot by exerting a certain amount of manual
force on the control column. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the
provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the French DGAC has kept the FAA informed of the situation
described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the French DGAC, reviewed all available information, and determined
that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require modification of FCC's having P/N's B216ABM6,
B350AAM1, B350AAM2, and B350AAM3 (for Model A310 series airplanes); and P/N's B297AAM3, B297AAM4, and B297AAM5
(for Model A300&hyph;600 series airplanes). Since the manufacturer has not yet developed a modification for these
FCC's, these modifications are to be accomplished in accordance with a method approved by the FAA.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This is considered to be interim action until final action is identified, at which time the FAA may consider further
rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Modification of FCC's having P/N's B470ABM1 (for Model A310 series airplanes) and B470AAM1 (for Model A300&hyph;600
series airplanes) has been addressed in a separate rulemaking action (reference Airworthiness Directive Rules
Docket Number 94&hyph;NM&hyph;134&hyph;AD). Since the manufacturer has advised that an ample number of required
parts will be available for modification of FCC's having these two part numbers, and in light of the degree of urgency
associated with the subject unsafe condition, the FAA finds that modification of those FCC's must be accomplished
sooner than the modification of the FCC's addressed in this proposal. That AD action also requires a revision to the
FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) that warns the flight crew to avoid overriding the autopilot while the
airplane is in the COMMAND mode and cautions the flight crew to check the status of the autopilot in the event the flight
controls respond abnormally. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 15 Model A310 series airplanes and 36 Model A300&hyph;600 series airplanes of U.S. registry
would be affected by this proposed AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the manufacturer has not yet developed one specific modification commensurate with the requirements of this
proposal, the FAA is unable at this time to provide a specific information as to the number of work hours or cost of parts
that would be required to accomplish the proposed modification. A further problem in developing a specific cost estimate
is the fact that modification costs are expected to vary from operator to operator and from airplane to airplane depending
upon airplane configuration. The proposed compliance time of 24 months should provide ample time for the development,
approval, and installation of an appropriate modification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, based on similar modifications accomplished previously on other FCC's installed on other airplane models,
the FAA can reasonably estimate that the proposed modification may require as few as 2 work hours or as many as 50 work
hours to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. The cost of required parts could range from a negligible
amount to as much as $1,500 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators
is estimated to be between $5,610 ($110 per airplane) and $216,750 ($4,250 per airplane).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated earlier in this preamble, the FAA specifically invites the submission of comments and other data regarding
this economic aspect of proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is reopening to November 16, 1994, the comment period for a proposed rule that
appeared in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of July 18, 1994 (59 FR 36379). The document proposed to revise the guidelines for voluntary nutrition labeling of
raw fruit, vegetables, and fish; revise the definition for compliance with respect to adherence by retailers to those
guidelines; and revise the labeling regulations and labeling values for the 20 most frequently consumed raw fruit,
vegetables, and fish. This action is in response to the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990. In addition,
the document solicited comments on all aspects of the FDA data base review process. FDA is taking this action in response
to several requests for an extension of the comment period.

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of July 18, 1994 (59 FR 36379), FDA issued a proposed rule to adopt regulations to revise the guidelines for voluntary
labeling of raw fruit, vegetables, and fish. The agency also published a correction document on July 21, 1994 (59 FR
37190), to correct an inadvertent error in the proposal. Interested persons were given until September 16, 1994,
to comment on the proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has received several requests from trade associations for an extension of the comment period in order to better
review the proposal and prepare comments. Most requests ask for a 30-day extension. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of these requests, FDA has concluded that it is in the public interest to allow additional time
for comments. With the additional period, the agency is providing more than 90 days for comments. FDA considers that
this amount of time should be more than ample for interested persons to complete and submit their comments. Accordingly,
the agency is reopening the comment period to November 16, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons may, on or before November 16, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written
comments regarding this proposal. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit
one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received

 On September 6, 1990, Treasury published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) proposing requirements for banks
with deposits over $100 million, and certain nonbank financial institutions, regardless of asset size, to maintain
specific systems to aggregate currency transactions and proposing requirements for financial institutions that
file more than 1,000 Currency Transaction Reports per year to file by magnetic media. After analysis of the comments
received in response to this NPRM and further study and review, Treasury has decided to withdraw it.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 6, 1990 (55 FR 36663), Treasury published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) with two separate proposals.
The first would have required: (1) banks with deposits in excess of $100 million to maintain systems to aggregate currency
transactions that are conducted by or on behalf of accountholders at the bank and that affect an account during a business
day; and (2) currency dealers and exchangers, check cashers, and transmitters of funds to maintain systems and procedures
to aggregate currency transactions that are conducted by or on behalf of customers at the financial institution during
a business day. The second proposal would have required financial institutions that file more than 1,000 Currency
Transaction Reports (CTRs) a year, to file by magnetic media. Treasury sought comments on each proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Following publication of the NPRM, numerous financial institutions implemented aggregation and magnetic media
filing systems. Some implemented these systems in anticipation of a Final Rule. Others adopted aggregation systems
because those systems save costs and enhance financial institutions' ability to monitor currency activity for BSA
compliance, as well as for other management and marketing purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1990, multiple transaction CTRs accounted for only 51% of the total number of CTRs filed, while in 1993, multiple
transaction CTRs comprised 70% of all CTRs received by Treasury. Treasury believes the increased reporting of multiple
transactions reflects an increased awareness in the financial services industry of the importance of BSA compliance
and the availability of automated systems to assist in this endeavor. Because these systems also meet other important
needs of financial institutions, it is not expected that financial institutions will discontinue using their aggregation
systems upon withdrawal of the NPRM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The number of banks filing CTRs magnetically has increased dramatically. (In 1989, only 50 banks magnetically filed
CTRs. By mid-1994, the number of banks filing magnetically has increased to 532.) Because magnetic filing reduces
financial institutions' CTR processing and storage costs, it is unlikely that banks will return to paper processing
when the proposed NPRM is withdrawn. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Treasury is currently considering ways to reduce the regulatory burden of complying with the BSA while enhancing
the utility of information it receives from financial institutions. After careful consideration of comments describing
the potential costs that would be incurred by financial institutions not yet using automated systems to aggregate
currency transactions, as well as Treasury's intention to implement additional regulatory changes, Treasury has
decided to withdraw the NPRM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In reaching this decision, Treasury analyzed comments received in response to the NPRM and consulted with the Bank
Secrecy Act Advisory Group. The Group, a committee which comprises 30 representatives from the financial services
industry, trades and businesses and state and federal government, expressed the view that financial institution
resources would be better devoted to programs specifically geared toward the detection and reporting of suspicious
transactions, and the implementation of mandatory ``know your customer'' programs. Treasury agrees with this reasoning
and is considering regulatory changes including reporting of suspicious transactions, mandatory ``know your customer''
programs, and federal licensing and state registration of nonbank financial institutions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendments to the Communications Act in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 preempted state rate and
entry regulation of commercial mobile radio services. States were given the opportunity to file petitions for the
authority to continue regulating these intrastate rates. This Order extends the deadlines for reply comments in
this proceeding in response to a request filed by the Louisiana Public Service Commission. This extension will provide
interested parties enough time to complete their review and submit meaningful replies on the issues we raised in this
proceeding.

By the Chief, Private Radio Bureau:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The Louisiana Public Service Commission (Louisiana) has filed an ``emergency'' motion for a 10-day extension
of time from the October 4, 1994 deadline for filing reply comments, and a motion for expedited consideration of that
motion.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 For the reasons given below, we grant the motion.

2. The amendments to the Communications Act in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 preempted state rate
and entry regulation of commercial mobile radio services. A state could, however, obtain intrastate rate regulatory
authority by filing a properly supported petition with the FCC.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 States with existing rate regulation could petition by August 10, 1994 to continue regulating, and would obtain a
stay of statutory preemption until the FCC acted. The Commission has one year in which to rule on the petition and to
decide any reconsideration. Louisiana filed such a petition on August 9, 1994. Pursuant to the Commission's rules,
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 interested parties had 30 days in which to comment and then 15 days for replies.

3. Louisiana states that an extension ``is necessary in order to provide the Commission with a complete and accurate
record on which to decide the numerous complex issues in this matter.'' The State claims that this extension ``will
not cause any undue hardship to any party nor will it retard the progress of this proceeding.''
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 It adds that this proceeding will affect state interests in the manner in which mobile carriers are regulated, the
development of the industry, and the rates paid by and services rendered to Louisiana ratepayers. It states that it
has a constitutional charge to protect ratepayers' interests.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 In requesting expedited consideration, Louisiana states that it has orally notified counsel of record of the filing
of its motions.

 This proposed rule would implement Amendment 21a to the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Groundfish Fishery
of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI), and would prohibit the use of trawl gear in specified
areas surrounding the Pribilof Islands. This action is necessary to protect areas of biological importance to certain
crab stocks and to reduce interference with seabird and marine mammal populations. It is intended to promote the objectives
of the FMP.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Fishing for groundfish by U.S. vessels in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the BSAI is managed by NMFS according
to the FMP for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI. The FMP was prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council
(Council) under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) (Magnuson Act), and is implemented by regulations governing the U.S. groundfish fisheries at 50 CFR parts 675 and
676. General regulations that pertain to U.S. fisheries are codified at 50 CFR part 620. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action proposes regulations to implement Amendment 21a to the FMP. If approved, this amendment would prohibit
the use of trawl gear in specified areas of the EEZ surrounding the Pribilof Islands. A description of, and reasons
for, the proposed measures are presented below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fishing for groundfish using trawl gear is authorized in the waters off St. Paul, St. George, Walrus, and Otter Islands
(Pribilof Islands area) under regulations at 50 CFR part 675. In addition to providing habitat for commercially important
groundfish, the Pribilof Islands area provides the necessary habitat for blue king crab, juvenile groundfish, Korean
hair crab, marine mammals, seabirds, and their prey species. The rocky benthic habitat immediately surrounding
the Pribilof Islands area provides essential food resources and protection for juvenile crab and fish species, which
are prey species for marine mammals and seabirds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS trawl surveys indicate that during 1975, the historic estimated abundance of blue king crab in the Pribilof Islands
area decreased significantly. During 1980&hyph;1992, the abundance decreased from 106 million animals to 10 million
animals, according to the estimates obtained from NMFS trawl surveys. Unlike other crab species, blue king crab populations
do not extend uniformly across the Bering Sea shelf, but are found in isolated populations located in waters surrounding
the Pribilof, St. Matthew, and St. Lawrence Islands. As a result of the decrease in crab abundance, commercial crab
fisheries in the Pribilof Islands area have not been authorized since 1987. Continued trawling under the current
FMP for groundfish in the Pribilof Islands area could jeopardize the recovery of depressed blue king crab stocks and
the productivity of marine resources living in this habitat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Pribilof Islands area contributes an essential food resource of prey species that allows for optimal foraging
and breeding opportunities for marine resources dependent on the habitat in this area. Fish, crab, seabird, and marine
mammal populations are dependent on the habitat that the Pribilof Islands area provides. Although sea lions and red-legged
kittiwakes are listed as a threatened species and as a candidate for threatened species, respectively, this action
would further protect these species. The northern fur seal is listed as depleted under the Marine Mammal Protection
Act. During the breeding season, approximately two-thirds of the northern fur seal population, and an estimated
88 and 92 percent of red-legged kittiwakes and Alaskan thick-billed murre, respectively, breed in the Pribilof Islands
area. The Pribilof Islands area also provides the rocky habitat necessary to protect fish and crab populations during
their juvenile stages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1989, the Central Bering Sea Fishermen's Association initiated a proposal to establish areas closed to trawling
in the Pribilof Islands area. The intent of this proposal was to protect this unique habitat and ecosystem so that it
could contribute long-term benefits to the fisheries surrounding the waters of the Pribilof Islands area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At its meeting in September 1991, the Council requested that an analysis be prepared to identify those areas needing
protection. The State of Alaska Department of Fish and Game prepared a draft EA/RIR for that proposal. The Pribilof
Islands habitat conservation area was determined by the Council at its April 1992 meeting, based on an analysis of
the distribution of crab and groundfish species.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The analysis was released for public review on October 29, 1992, and again in September 1993. During both review processes,
the Council recommended that additional alternatives be studied to define the areas that would protect a majority
of the species and habitat, while providing access to groundfish resources. The analysis identified areas of high
blue king crab bycatch and low groundfish harvests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The analysis indicated that the proposed Pribilof Islands habitat conservation area would not significantly impact
groundfish fishermen because it would affect only 14 vessels in the entire BSAI groundfish fleet and the operators
of these vessels would have the opportunity to fish in the remainder of the BSAI. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At its meeting in December 1993, the Council again reviewed the draft EA/RIR and sent the document out for public review.
At its meeting in April 1994, the Council considered the testimony and recommendations of its Advisory Panel, Scientific
and Statistical Committee, fishing industry representatives, and the general public on alternative habitat protection
zones and how these areas would be defined, established, and managed. The Council reviewed information about the
distribution and habitat of blue king crab in the NMFS annual trawl surveys, and on observer data. The proposed trawl
closure encompasses a major portion of the historic blue king crab distribution during years of low abundance and
during years when the population was expanding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendment 21a would prohibit trawling within the EEZ in an area bounded by a straight line connecting the following
pairs of coordinates in the following order:

The Council determined that this area protects most of the crab habitat in the Pribilof Islands area, without significant
adverse impacts on trawl operations for groundfish. This action balances the protection of the marine resources
dependent on this habitat with the needs of the groundfish fishery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council voted to recommend that Amendment 21a, which prohibit trawling in this area, be submitted to NMFS for approval.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 304(a)(1)(D) of the Magnuson Act requires the publication of regulations proposed by a Council within 15
days of receipt of the FMP amendments and regulations. At this time, NMFS has not determined that the FMP amendment
these regulations would implement are consistent with the national standards, other provisions of the Magnuson
Act, and other applicable laws. NMFS, in making a final determination about the FMP amendment and in implementing
a final rule, will take into account the data, views, and comments received during the comment period.

The Assistant General Counsel of the Department of Commerce certified to the Chief Counsel of the Small Business Administration
that this proposed rule, if adopted, would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. The proposed action would not have a significant economic impact on the fishing industry because less than
3 percent of the Bering Sea groundfish is harvested in the Pribilof Islands area by 14 vessels in the groundfish fleet.
The volume of groundfish historically caught in this area can be harvested elsewhere in the Bering Sea. As a result,
a regulatory flexibility analysis was not prepared.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Social Security Independence and Program Improvements Act of 1994 contains provisions affecting benefits under
titles II and XVI of the Social Security Act to individuals whose medically determined drug addiction or alcoholism
(DA&amp;A) is a contributing factor material to the finding of disability. Most of these provisions are effective
for benefits payable beginning March 1, 1995. Certain implementing regulations must be issued by February 11, 1995,
180 days after enactment. The Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) is requesting early public comment
on several important policy issues. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Social Security Administration
(SSA) plan to use the comments, along with other public views and information obtained, to help formulate rules necessary
to implement some provisions. For provisions not requiring final regulations by February 1995, principally representative
payment provisions, HHS plans to issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to solicit public comments.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 201 of the Social Security Independence and Program Improvements Act of 1994, Public Law (Pub. L.) 103&hyph;296,
enacted August 15, 1994, contains several provisions affecting the payment of Social Security and supplemental
security income (SSI) benefits to individuals whose medically determined drug addiction or alcoholism (DA&amp;A)
is a contributing factor material to the finding of disability. (For ease of reference in this Notice of Intent, we
refer to these individuals as being ``disabled based on DA&amp;A.'') The provisions may affect individuals currently
receiving benefits, as well as those awarded benefits in the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The law places new restrictions on Social Security and SSI benefit payments to individuals disabled based on DA&amp;A,
which are intended to discourage a beneficiary from using Social Security or SSI benefits to support an addiction.
It also requires the Secretary to promulgate regulations necessary to implement the statutory provisions by February
11, 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HHS decided to request advance comments on the provisions involving nonpayment or termination of benefits under
section 201 of Public Law 103&hyph;296 for several reasons. Congress mandated in the law that in promulgating the
required regulations we consult with professionals in the field of DA&amp;A treatment. This consultation must take
place before the regulations can be drafted. We also believe it warranted that we obtain public comment on the novel
program requirements of the law and policy issues at the same time. In addition, it is clear from the law that HHS must
have regulations in place by February 11, 1995. Accordingly, we are seeking advance public comments to be used in the
initial formulation of the rules through this request. In addition, we have requested individual comments directly
from various treatment professionals and advocacy groups around the country. We are holding and attending meetings
with various treatment professionals, representatives of referral and monitoring agencies (RMAs), and others
with knowledge of DA&amp;A-related issues to discuss, in general, contemporary treatment philosophies and receive
the individual views of those in attendance.

II. Summary of DA&amp;A Provisions Prior to the Passage of Public Law 103&hyph;296 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Prior to the passage of Public Law 103&hyph;296, there were no special program rules for Social Security DA&amp;A
beneficiaries. SSI beneficiaries disabled based on DA&amp;A were required to receive payment through a representative
payee. These SSI beneficiaries are required to undergo treatment, when available, at approved facilities. They
also must comply with the terms of their treatment program and take part in the monitoring and testing procedures established
by the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Major DA&amp;A-Related Provisions of Public Law 103&hyph;296 Involving Nonpayment or Termination of Benefits

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Payment Limitation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The payment of SSI benefits will be limited to 36 months for individuals disabled based on DA&amp;A. Also, the payment
of Social Security benefits will be limited to 36 months, but this limitation will begin with the first month for which
treatment is available, and only months for which treatment is available are counted in the 36-month period. The 36-month
DA&amp;A payment restrictions for both Social Security and SSI benefits will cease to be effective with respect to
benefits for months after September 2004. Medicare and Medicaid benefits will continue as long as a DA&amp;A beneficiary
whose benefits have been suspended for less than 12 months, or terminated after 36 months, continues to be disabled
and otherwise eligible. Dependents' benefits will continue as long as the DA&amp;A beneficiary whose benefits have
been suspended, or terminated after 12 months of noncompliance or the 36-month payment limit, continues to be disabled
and otherwise eligible. The payment limit will not apply to individuals who are disabled independent of their DA&amp;A.
Suspension months will not be counted in the 36 months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Suspension for Noncompliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Benefits will be suspended for noncompliance with treatment for both Social Security and SSI beneficiaries, beginning
the first month following the month beneficiaries are notified of such noncompliance. Once an individual is determined
to be in noncompliance and benefits are suspended, benefits must continue to be suspended until after the beneficiary
demonstrates compliance with treatment requirements for specified periods_a minimum of 2 months, 3 months, and
6 months, respectively, for the first, second, and third or subsequent instances of noncompliance. Suspension of
benefits for 12 consecutive months for noncompliance will result in termination of benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Treatment Requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The treatment participation requirement, which now applies only to SSI beneficiaries, will be extended to Social
Security beneficiaries disabled based on DA&amp;A. Additionally, SSA will be required to provide for the monitoring
of progress in treatment. The provision is to be implemented beginning after the effective date with newly adjudicated
cases and Social Security beneficiaries already on the rolls with a primary diagnosis of DA&amp;A and extended to
other applicable beneficiaries as quickly as possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Referral and Monitoring Agencies (RMAs) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Contracts with RMAs are in place in most States as a result of statutory requirements that the Secretary provide for
the monitoring and testing of title XVI DA&amp;A beneficiaries. Pursuant to Public Law 103&hyph;296, new RMA contracts
must be established in each State and regulations must be issued which define appropriate treatment and establish
guidelines to be used to review and evaluate compliance and measure progress for individuals disabled based on DA&amp;A.
The new contracts are needed in part because the RMAs will handle additional workloads (i.e., title II beneficiaries)
and will take on additional functions. New regulations are required by the legislation to implement the new program
requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Retroactive Benefits
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The law requires incremental payment, on a prorated basis, of retroactive Social Security and SSI benefits to individuals
disabled based on DA&amp;A, with a limited exception for those who have outstanding debts related to housing and are
at high risk of homelessness. Retroactive benefits due an individual whose entitlement terminates will continue
in prorated amounts until they are fully paid. No retroactive payments will be made in periods of suspension for noncompliance
with treatment requirements. In addition, if a beneficiary dies without having received all retroactive benefits,
the unpaid amount is treated like any other underpayment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Policy Questions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The statutory provisions regarding nonpayment and termination of benefits present many novel policy issues. SSA
has made separate contacts with DA&amp;A treatment professionals to obtain views on issues of treatment, compliance
and monitoring. In addition, SSA is facing many operational issues in terms of putting the processes and systems in
place to implement these provisions. This request for public comments is focused on the policy issues which, in our
opinion, have a broad public import, and on which SSA will benefit from receiving a wide range of public views. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The questions which follow may necessitate different responses depending on whether the answer relates to alcoholism
or to different types of drug addiction. SSA requests that commenters identify to which type(s) of addiction a particular
response applies. Public comments are requested on the following policy issues: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Defining Appropriate Treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The new legislation requires that individuals disabled based on DA&amp;A undergo appropriate substance abuse treatment.
Currently, there are no specific guidelines in the regulations which define ``appropriate treatment.'' HHS defines
``appropriate treatment'' at &sect;416.937 for SSI cases as ``recognized medical or other professional procedures
for treatment of drug addiction or alcoholism which is carried out at or under the supervision of, an approved institution
or facility (or facilities). This treatment may include_ (a) Medical examination and treatment; (b) Psychiatric,
psychological and vocational counselling; or (c) Other appropriate services for drug addiction or alcoholism.''
Instead of requiring the use of specific regulatory guidelines, SSA has directed employees of treatment facilities
or of RMAs under contract with SSA to make judgments in determining appropriate treatment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SSA is considering adopting a policy defining ``appropriate substance abuse treatment'' for individuals disabled
based on DA&amp;A in general terms under which SSA would continue to rely on the judgments of treatment professionals.
For example, a general definition of appropriate treatment could refer to substance abuse treatment which serves
the need of the individuals in the least restrictive setting. Accordingly, appropriate treatment would be determined
on the basis of a comprehensive assessment in which each individual's needs are defined and compliance with such individualized
treatment would be overseen by an approved institution or facility as defined in regulations. SSA may also incorporate
the examples from our current regulations cited above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Questions: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
What is considered ``appropriate'' substance abuse treatment? What factors should be considered in placing an individual
in treatment? What ranges of treatment modalities fall within an appropriate treatment spectrum for the most common
types of substance abuse problems? Recognizing that some individuals may abuse more than one substance, how should
``appropriate treatment'' be defined when there is more than one substance involved? With the objective of placing
as many clients as possible in appropriate treatment, how should the parameters of appropriate treatment be defined,
i.e., what would be the circumstances under which the client would not benefit from treatment? Should the regulations
refer generally to individual assessments being made by professionals or should specific treatment guidelines
be included? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->
B. Availability of Treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The legislation requires the disabled individual to undergo treatment which is ``available'' but does not define
the term. The current substance abuse treatment requirements are applicable only to title XVI beneficiaries, and
not to title II beneficiaries. The current regulations at &sect;416.939 provide guidance on when treatment for DA&amp;A
is considered available for title XVI beneficiaries. Generally, SSA determines whether treatment is available
based on: obtaining a treatment vacancy at no cost to the individual; the location of the facility; availability and
cost of transportation to the individual; the individual's general health; the individual's particular condition
and circumstances; and, the treatment that is required.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
SSA is considering the adoption of the same guidelines for determining the availability of treatment to title II and
title XVI beneficiaries. However, we would like to receive any comments on whether these guidelines are adequate
or if other factors should be considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Questions: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
How should SSA define available substance abuse treatment? Should availability take into consideration the client's
access to transportation, education, familial situation and/or health? What other factors should be considered,
if any? Should clients seeking readmission to treatment after a period of noncompliance be given priority for a treatment
slot over other clients awaiting initial intake into treatment?

C. Defining and Measuring Progress 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Currently, SSA has no rules for defining and measuring progress expected to be achieved by participants in treatment
programs. The law requires that such regulations be developed in establishing guidelines used to review and evaluate
compliance with treatment. Treatment professionals may have differing views and opinions on defining and measuring
progress. Progress is related to compliance. Currently, providers determine treatment and measures of progress.
The difficult task for SSA is to determine to what extent it can be externally validated. SSA is considering defining
parameters of progress as clinical measures, such as attendance, participation in activities, changes in physical
and mental limitations, degree of abstinence, drug testing results, attitude, cooperation, mental/psychological
status and instances of relapse. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Questions: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
What constitutes progress in substance abuse treatment? What are the most effective and reliable means of measuring
progress in substance abuse treatment? How can these be quantified and reported regularly in a cost-effective mode?
What methods currently exist for validating progress with treatment?

D. Evaluating Compliance With Treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, there are no specific guidelines in the regulations to evaluate beneficiaries' compliance with the treatment
requirements. Determinations on compliance generally have been based on judgments made by employees of the treatment
facilities or of the RMAs under contract with SSA. The statute requires that the Secretary issue regulations establishing
guidelines for evaluating whether individuals entitled to benefits based on DA&amp;A are in compliance and progressing
with treatment requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are a wide range of issues that pertain to evaluating compliance with treatment, including views on how to define
success within a treatment modality. For example, some believe that individuals can be expected to undergo periods
of drug or alcohol use even though they are following a treatment plan in large part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Questions: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
What are the factors we should use to evaluate compliance with substance abuse treatment? How should a relapse be treated
or evaluated for purposes of compliance? Are there varying degrees of relapse which may or may not indicate noncompliance?
While one isolated incident may not be defined as noncompliance, what number of ``second chances'' should be provided?
Should positive drug or alcohol tests be used as a tool to measure compliance? If yes, how, i.e., a single test, a certain
number of tests, or tests in conjunction with other indicators? If other indicators should be factored in, what are
those indicators? How reliable are these tests? Are there other types of testing or criteria that could be used to monitor
compliance with the substance abuse treatment requirements? How frequently should testing be done? What are the
customary and reasonable charges for testing? How and by whom are test specimens (blood, urine, breath) collected?
Should this be done outside a clinical or laboratory setting, and can it be done properly and effectively outside such
a setting? If so, please provide examples of appropriate nonclinic-based procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
How should SSA evaluate compliance with Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous? SSA is considering a requirement
for individuals to get signed statements of attendance.

E. Frequency of Monitoring by the RMA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, the treatment requirements have been applicable only to title XVI beneficiaries, and not to title II beneficiaries.
Accordingly, although there are RMAs under contract in most States, they serve only the title XVI population and the
referral and monitoring work presently being performed is not as extensive as the new legislation requires. There
are no regulations regarding the referral and monitoring functions.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The law requires SSA to establish one or more RMAs in each State. One function of the RMA will be to monitor progress and
compliance with the treatment program. Currently, SSA's contracts with RMAs require monitoring weekly for the 1st
month; bi-weekly for the 2nd and 3rd months; then monthly for the 4th through 12th months of treatment. SSA is considering
a requirement that, initially, each client be monitored bi-weekly for the first 3 months and monthly thereafter.
Ongoing monthly monitoring is consistent with legislative requirements that benefits can be suspended on a monthly
basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Monthly monitoring results in considerable administrative cost to the Agency. If reliable monitoring can be accomplished
on a quarterly or semi-annual basis, the net administrative cost would be reduced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Questions: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SSA would appreciate receiving views on whether a monitoring schedule other than monthly could be more effective.
In other words, how frequently should the average DA&amp;A beneficiary be monitored by SSA's RMA to assure the beneficiary
is in compliance with the terms and conditions for treatment, including measuring progress in treatment? Should
frequency of monitoring change in the course of the treatment program? If so, under what circumstances? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
F. Defining ``Good Cause'' for Failure To Comply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, payments are suspended if a title XVI beneficiary entitled to disability based on DA&amp;A fails to comply
with available treatment. When benefits are suspended for noncompliance, the suspension continues until the individual
undergoes the required treatment and compliance is verified or the benefits are terminated (see &sect;416.1326).
There are no current title II provisions requiring treatment for DA&amp;A or sanctioning noncompliance with treatment.
There also are no rules for establishing ``good cause'' for not complying with treatment. However, ``good cause''
is an established concept that is applied in other contexts in evaluating the fulfillment of program requirements
in both the Social Security and SSI benefits programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The legislation extends the requirement for suspension of benefits for noncompliance to title II beneficiaries.
Individuals entitled to a benefit based on DA&amp;A are required to comply with substance abuse treatment requirements.
A beneficiary who fails to comply with treatment requirements will have his/her benefits suspended beginning with
the first month after he/she has been notified of the determination of noncompliance. SSA is considering implementing
regulations which would provide a ``good cause'' exception to this requirement and which could set forth examples
of ``good cause'' for not complying with the treatment requirement. There are a multitude of possible definitions
of ``good cause,'' ranging from hospitalization or other health-related events to personal emergencies such as
a death in the family or illness of a family member. On the other hand, inability to comply due to ramifications resulting
from the abuse of drugs or alcohol should not be ``good cause.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Questions: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
What should constitute ``good cause'' for failing to comply with prescribed substance abuse treatment? What should
not constitute ``good cause?'' Are there certain obstacles to complying with treatment that these individuals should
be able to overcome?

G. Costs and Benefits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
SSA is not now in a position to assess the societal costs and benefits of the provisions in a manner that would produce
specific quantitative estimates for public comment. At this time, we cannot predict the future effect of encouraging
treatment and rewarding compliance versus noncompliance with the program requirements and the resulting suspension
or termination. For example, it is possible that significantly more beneficiaries will successfully complete treatment
as a result of the new requirements. Because of the limitation of existing data and analytic models as well as limited
Agency resources, SSA cannot provide a quantitative estimate of such effects. We intend to publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at the time of promulgation of the interim final rule, an evaluation of the prospective quantifiable and non-quantifiable
costs and benefits of the rule and of reasonable alternative approaches considered in the development of the rules.
At this time, we are limited to a description of some of the potential costs and benefits that will need to be considered.

Benefits
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The first type of benefit which should be realized from these new program requirements is an increase in the number
of substance-dependent individuals receiving treatment. Other potential benefits to society include a reduction
in Social Security and SSI program expenditures due to the 36-month payment restriction and suspension of benefits
for noncompliance with treatment requirements. The number of individuals receiving treatment may grow because
these requirements would make benefits conditioned on compliance with available treatment. To the extent that treatment
is successful, these individuals may realize improved mental and/or physical health, reducing use of public and
private health facilities. They may be more receptive and prepared for vocational rehabilitation and/or return
to work. Although reductions in substance dependency offer a broad array of benefits to society, the difficulties
of quantifying and valuing them lead us to concentrate our efforts in this benefits assessment on changes in the number
of individuals receiving treatment and the likely reductions in their substance dependencies.

Costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Savings to the Social Security and SSI programs will not accrue without a significant expenditure of Federal administrative
resources. SSA personnel must closely track individuals throughout their months of eligibility. They will process
suspensions and terminations, select representative payees, and respond to reports of noncompliance with required
treatment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SSA will enter into contracts with RMAs to assess treatment needs of beneficiaries, refer beneficiaries for treatment,
monitor treatment, and report to SSA on beneficiary compliance (including progress with the treatment plan). The
RMA structure required by the statute will represent a significant program cost. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the substance abuse treatment to which these individuals are referred will have a significant cost.
Including this cost in the analysis is appropriate to the extent that the benefits of increased participation in treatment
programs is also included. Beneficiaries generally cannot be required to pay for the treatment themselves. Therefore,
the cost of treatment will need to be absorbed by existing governmental sources, including Medicare and Medicaid,
and private sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The administrative requirements for implementation of the provisions may result in ``burdens'' on members of the
public (e.g., completion of forms and types of information collection) which are subject to clearance by the Office
of Management and Budget (OMB). If such is the case, required clearance will be obtained from OMB prior to implementation
of interim final regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The costs and benefits of the provisions are driven by the statutory requirements. This Department would welcome
any comments or suggestions for reducing administrative costs and reducing the burden on individuals, RMAs, substance
abuse treatment providers and other entities. Such information will help us refine the necessary policies and procedures.
Our aim is to carry out the Congressional mandate at the least possible cost and burden to organizations and members
of the public.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To maximize public participation early in the rulemaking process, we invite you to comment on the cost and benefit
issues raised in this request, particularly with respect to any policy recommendations in response to this solicitation.
In addition, we solicit comments on particular policy issues, such as the definition of ``compliance,'' ``good cause,''
and ``appropriate treatment.'' Finally, we request comments on any other aspects of the provisions of the provisions
of the law related to the nonpayment and termination of benefits on behalf of individuals disabled based on DA&amp;A.

VI. Next Steps 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After analysis of the comments received in response to this request, as well as the other information obtained, HHS
plans to develop and publish interim final regulations to implement the regulations required to be in place by February
11, 1995. In the interim final regulations, we will provide another opportunity for public comment. After the end
of that comment period, we plan to analyze the comments and determine whether changes to our interim final regulations
are warranted.
