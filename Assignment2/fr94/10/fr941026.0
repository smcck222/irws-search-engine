SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing final regulations to increase certain cost-of-living allowance
(COLA) rates paid to General Schedule, U.S. Postal Service, and certain other Federal employees in Kauai County,
Hawaii; Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands; and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The final regulations
also consolidate the two nonforeign COLA areas in the U.S. Virgin Islands into a single allowance area, delete obsolete
Commissary/Exchange COLA categories in four areas, clarify definitions shown in one of the appendices, and remove
from regulations three locations listed as places where nonforeign post differentials are paid. These three locations
are no longer territories or possessions of the United States and, therefore, are not covered by the nonforeign area
post differential program.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under section 5941 of title 5, United States Code, certain Federal employees in nonforeign areas outside the 48 contiguous
States are eligible for cost-of-living allowances when local living costs are substantially higher than those in
the Washington, DC, area. Nonforeign area COLA's are currently paid in Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin
Islands, Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OPM contracted with Runzheimer International to conduct living-cost surveys during the summer of 1993 in Hawaii,
Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. At that time, Runzheimer also surveyed the Washington, DC, area, which
is the base or reference area for living-cost comparisons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to these surveys, the COLA rates should be increased in three areas and reduced in three other areas. However,
a provision in the Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations Act, 1992 (Public Law 102&hyph;141
as amended), bars OPM from reducing any COLA rate through December 31, 1996. Therefore, only the COLA rate increases
are being implemented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The increases in COLA rates are summarized in the following table:

In computing the new COLA rate, OPM made two changes relative to the indices published with the proposed rule. The changes
were made to correct an error in one survey and to incorporate a methodological change recommended by one of the commenters
on the proposed rule. Neither of these changes affected the COLA rates proposed in the Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 26, 1994 (at 59 FR 27314). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The error OPM corrected was the failure to price a homeowner insurance policy in Maui, Hawaii, that included coverage
of damage caused by high winds. Correcting this raised the Maui index slightly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The methodological change made by OPM was to use the Goods and Services Component index as the cash contributions item
index in the Miscellaneous Component. The effect of this change was a slight increase in the living-cost indices in
all areas except Puerto Rico. The chart below compares the indices shown in the notice that accompanied the proposed
rule and those used in this final rule. As noted above, none of these convert to a different COLA rate under the procedures
prescribed in 5 CFR 591.206(b).

In this final rule, OPM is also consolidating the two allowance areas in the U.S. Virgin Islands into a single allowance
area. The two allowance areas were (1) the island of St. Croix and (2) the islands of St. Thomas and St. John. The new allowance
area is titled ``The U.S. Virgin Islands.'' In future surveys, OPM will continue to survey living costs on both St.
Croix and St. Thomas, but the data will be consolidated to represent the Virgin Islands as a whole. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OPM is eliminating Commissary/Exchange COLA rates in Anchorage, Alaska; Fairbanks, Alaska; Honolulu, Hawaii;
and Puerto Rico. OPM is 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 eliminating the Commissary/Exchange COLA rate in the Guam/Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI)
allowance area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the Department of Defense, Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA), Federal civilian employees in the Anchorage,
Fairbanks, Honolulu, and Puerto Rico allowance areas do 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 have access to commissaries by virtue of their Federal civilian employment. Commissary/Exchange COLA rates are
payable only to Federal white-collar employees who, by virtue of their Federal civilian employment, have unlimited
access to commissaries 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 exchanges in the allowance areas. Since Federal civilian employees in these four areas do not have access to commissaries,
the Commissary/Exchange COLA rates are not payable in these areas. Accordingly, OPM is eliminating the Commissary/Exchange
COLA rates in these areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In Guam/CNMI, on the other hand, DeCA says some Federal civilian employees have access to commissaries by virtue of
their Federal civilian employment. OPM believes these employees also have access to exchange facilities. Therefore,
OPM is 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 eliminating the Commissary/Exchange COLA rate in Guam/CNMI.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The elimination of the Commissary/Exchange rates in the four areas should have no effect on the COLA paid to any employee.
Federal white-collar employees in these areas should be receiving the higher Local Retail COLA rate. Similarly,
although OPM does not control access to commissaries and exchanges, OPM believes its action should not affect the
commissary or exchange privileges that employees might otherwise enjoy. Therefore, if an employee in one of the four
areas finds that his or her COLA rate or access to commissaries or exchanges is adversely affected by the elimination
of the Commissary/Exchange COLA rate, the employee should contact his or her agency immediately, and the agency should
bring the issue to OPM's attention as quickly as possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with the terminology used in other areas where only one COLA rate is payable, OPM is retitling the ``Local
Retail'' COLA rate as the ``All Employees'' COLA rate in the four areas affected. The retitling will not affect the
COLA rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OPM is also clarifying the definitions used in appendix A to subpart B of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, because
the previous definitions were subject to misinterpretation. The new definitions address this problem. The changes
do not affect COLA rates or eligibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lastly, OPM is also removing from the regulations three locations listed as places where nonforeign post differentials
are paid. The three locations are the Canton, Enderbury, and Christmas Islands. These islands are no longer territories
or possessions of the United States and, therefore, are not covered by the nonforeign area post differential program.

Summary and Analysis of Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OPM received 127 comments on the proposed regulations and notice it published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 26, 1994. Nearly all of these were from employees on St. Croix who endorsed the consolidation of the Virgin Islands
allowance areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OPM received one comment opposing the consolidation. The commenter believed the economies of St. Thomas and St. Croix
were significantly different and that living costs are higher on St. Thomas than on St. Croix. The commenter also suggested
that OPM survey St. Thomas twice a year, once in the ``tourist season'' and once in the ``off-season'' and average the
results. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although there may be differences between St. Thomas and St. Croix, OPM believes consolidation will improve the survey
and the administration of the program. Living costs vary among and within many COLA areas, including the Virgin Islands.
The issue is whether it is practical to differentiate among the living costs of certain places. Generally, the smaller
the area surveyed, the more difficult it is to measure relative differences in living costs. By consolidating areas
where appropriate, OPM can improve the surveys and reduce unwarranted fluctuations in COLA's that otherwise might
occur. This is the purpose of the consolidation of the Virgin Islands allowance areas. OPM does not believe semi-annual
surveys of St. Thomas are necessary. OPM plans, however, to review survey timing in all allowance areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requested that St. Croix employees receive their increase retroactively to the date of the increase
in the St. Thomas COLA rate. OPM finds no basis for a retroactive adjustment. The previous St. Croix living-cost surveys
were conducted according to regulation and provided adequate measures of local living costs. Therefore, the St.
Croix COLA rates set pursuant to previous surveys are appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters suggested that OPM review community selection in the City and County of Honolulu, Hawaii, allowance
area. The commenters believed some of the communities surveyed were not typical of places where Federal employees
live. OPM is reviewing community selections in all of the COLA survey areas in light of the results of the Federal Employee
Housing and Living Patterns Survey. OPM revised community selections in several areas prior to the summer 1994 surveys.
One of these allowance areas was the City and County of Honolulu. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter believed OPM had not complied with provisions of the Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government
Appropriations Act, 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;141, as amended by Pub. L. 103&hyph;329), as these provisions apply to
the COLA program. The law requires OPM to study living-cost issues and submit to Congress a report on possible changes
in the COLA methodology. The report is due March 1, 1996. The commenter thought the law directed OPM to make changes
in the COLA model before the report due date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As we stated in our response to comments received on an earlier proposed rule (at 59 FR 13844), OPM carefully reviewed
Pub. L. 102&hyph;141 and the related Senate Appropriations Committee report. OPM determined that the law has two
requirements: (1) COLA rates may not be reduced through December 31, 1995, and (2) OPM must submit a report to Congress
on possible changes in the COLA methodology. The law does not direct OPM to implement methodological changes at this
time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Senate Committee, however, asked OPM to research specific methodological issues. OPM is doing this and plans
to include the results of its research in its report to Congress. Although the law does not require OPM to implement
changes, OPM will continue to make improvements in the COLA program, as appropriate. We are implementing some of these
changes with this final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter said OPM regulations should describe the COLA model and survey in greater detail. OPM believes the COLA
regulations are adequately detailed and that subjecting the survey process to a set of overly detailed and inflexible
rules would impair, rather than improve, the COLA program. The flexibility results in a more accurate COLA model because
improvements can be made from one year to the next. Such changes are made public because, before COLA rates are adjusted,
OPM publishes in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a detailed report on the survey methodology and results. Employees have the opportunity to comment on any changes,
and OPM takes these comments into careful consideration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter believed OPM violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by publishing details after the survey.
He said OPM could not ``go back and replicate the data if it is subsequently determined that the changes were 'inappropriate.'''
The APA does not require OPM to make a change for each comment received. Instead, the APA requires OPM to inform the public
of certain proposals and actions, allow the public to comment on these, and take these comments into consideration.
This we do. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As evidenced in this final rule, OPM implements recommended changes as appropriate. With this rule, OPM is correcting
an error made in the calculation of the Maui index, implementing a new methodology for calculating the Miscellaneous
Component index, and eliminating Commissary/Exchange COLA rates in areas where they are no longer payable. OPM also
adopted, based in part on comments it received, community changes for the summer 1994 COLA surveys. Therefore, OPM
is in compliance with both the letter and spirit of the APA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter said there was no basis in law for the pledge of confidentiality that is provided on the Background Survey
information collection materials, which was part of Appendix 5 of the report. The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA),
as codified at 5 U.S.C. 552, allows the Government to withhold information from public release if the information
contains trade secrets or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential. Generally, the
information collected in Background Surveys is privileged commercial information. Background Surveys are used
to identify items that will be priced and outlets at which the prices will be collected. To identify commonly purchased
items and popular outlets, information on such things as sales volume and market penetration are collected. This
information is protected from disclosure under FOIA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter believed the COLA model was unnecessarily complex and suggested that it be simplified to use only one
income level. The commenter said this would reduce survey costs and the number of subjective assumptions required.
As we noted in our response to similar comments received on an earlier proposed rule (at 59 FR 13845), OPM's regulations
require the measurement of living costs at multiple income levels. This approach recognizes that relative living
costs may vary by income level and that the distribution of employees by income level may vary among areas. The multiple
income approach, therefore, yields a more accurate measure of overall living-cost differences than a single income
approach. Nevertheless, to the extent that multiple income levels require additional subjective assumptions,
we agree that the overall integrity of the model might not be impaired by using a single income level. OPM is examining
this issue and plans to address it in its report to Congress. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter also objected to Runzheimer's recommendation that OPM include income taxes in the COLA model. He believed
this would unduly complicate the model. As stated in previous 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notices, OPM is studying issues relating to Federal, State, and local income taxes and plans to include the results
of this study in its report to Congress.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The commenter wanted the COLA model to take into account the ``objectively determinable'' costs of remoteness, isolation,
and special needs. He cited increased home maintenance, out-of-area college and university costs, and medical expenses
as examples of these extra costs. In comments on previous 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notices, many employees identified special ``needs'' they believed were unique to their area. OPM has and is continuing
to research many of these issues, including home maintenance, college and university costs, and medical expenses.
We plan to include the results of this research in our report to Congress. At present, however, OPM believes the COLA
model reasonably and adequately measures cost differences for the vast majority of expenses that Federal employees
typically incur.

Noting the difficulty of comparing colleges and universities of equal quality, the commenter further proposed that
OPM measure the cost of higher education solely in the DC area. He said allowance area costs could be computed by adding
to the DC costs the extra expense of out-of-state tuition, room and board, and round-trip air travel between the allowance
areas and Washington, DC. Although this approach would address the problem of comparing the cost of an education of
like quality, we believe measuring costs in this manner would vastly overstate the costs incurred by most Federal
employees in the allowance areas. Measuring costs in this manner could also significantly understate the average
cost of college and university education incurred by Federal employees in the DC area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter said items needed only in allowance areas should be priced in the allowance area, but not in DC. OPM is
researching the issue of special needs. While there may be consumer requirements unique to living in the allowance
areas, there also are consumer requirements unique to living in the Washington, DC, area. For the summer surveys,
the model does not address these issues because they are highly subjective, difficult to measure, and vary widely
among areas. Instead, the model compares the cost of an item in an allowance area with the cost for the same item in the
DC area. OPM believes this is consistent with the settlement of

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in which the plaintiffs asked OPM to adopt a methodology that compared specified brands, models, and sizes whenever
possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We note, however, that the Senate Appropriations Committee asked OPM to research the issue of items required in the
allowance area but not in the Washington, DC, area and include this research in its report to Congress. This OPM is doing.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter recommended that OPM add 5 percentage points to all COLA rates to take into account costs that exist but
are not objectively determinable. OPM believes intangible factors, such as difficult living conditions, should
not be part of the COLA program. There are other programs, such as the post differential program, that compensate Federal
employees in such circumstances. OPM believes COLA should compensate employees for measurable differences in living
costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even if we agreed conceptually with such changes, significant changes in the law, Executive Order, and regulations
would be required to allow the adjustment of COLA for these intangible factors. The Senate Appropriations Committee
specifically asked OPM to study factors relating to remoteness and isolation and to report to Congress on 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
legislative 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
recommendations on how to calculate COLA's. Therefore, final resolution of these issues must await OPM's report
to Congress and subsequent congressional action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter believed employees in the allowance areas saved at a higher rate to afford the down payment for a house
or a car or to pay for college/university education. He said OPM should take this into consideration and adjust savings
and investments by the overall index for the area. The COLA model uses the same approach to savings and investments
as the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses in the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CES). That approach accounts for savings
and investments made for the purpose of future purchases in the category or component associated with the item to be
purchased. For example, savings made for the down payment or purchase of an automobile are accounted for in the private
transportation category. Therefore, if automobiles cost more in an allowance area and the purchaser must save more
to afford the car, the COLA model already takes this additional savings requirement into account. No additional adjustments
are required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other hand, the savings and investment category in the Miscellaneous Component covers long-term savings and
investments, such as those made for retirement purposes. The category also includes life insurance. For Federal
employees, the cost of life insurance and required contributions to a Federal retirement system do not vary by geographic
area. Any additional insurance or contributions to the retirement systems are a matter of personal preference. Therefore,
it is appropriate to hold the index constant for these items. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter objected to trimming high and low values in the housing component and use of trend analyses. The commenter
believed housing market price anomalies should be tolerated or that only ``obvious errors or anomalies'' should
be eliminated. The purpose of trimming and trend analyses is to stabilize the housing price data from one year to the
next. As OPM stated in its response to comments received on an earlier proposed rule (at 59 FR 13846), trimming is essentially
a nonparametric technique similar to using the median rather than the average. OPM and Runzheimer considered using
the median but rejected it because the limited number of observations obtained in some smaller allowance areas could
cause the median to be erratic from one year to the next. Trimming provides stability; and because equal numbers of
high and low values are trimmed, no bias is introduced. Eliminating ``obvious anomalies'' would be a more subjective
process with a potential for bias.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The commenter thought the age of the home should be included in home sales analyses. He recommended comparing prices
of homes of a similar age, size, and room count. Numerous factors influence home sale prices, but data on many of these
factors are not readily available. Runzheimer uses home size and room count as the major criteria in housing comparisons
because data on these factors are usually available in all areas and because these factors typically have a significant
influence on home prices. Age is not used because data on it frequently are not available and because OPM's initial
research indicates that its use may be problematic. Moreover, as noted in the report, the number of home sales observations
is limited in many areas. Stratifying these small quantities into age groups for purposes of comparison would complicate
the model_something the commenter wished to avoid. It would also probably introduce unwarranted fluctuations in
the housing index from one year to the next_something OPM wants to avoid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter said the survey failed to take into consideration the use of solar water heaters in Hawaii and Guam. The
commenter believed the model did not account for the capital cost of such heaters or the possible reduction in overall
utility consumption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As OPM stated in its response to comments received on an earlier proposed rule (at 59 FR 13847), significant home features
and improvements generally are reflected in the selling price of the home. Therefore, living-cost surveys reflect
the cost of solar water heaters to the extent that such items influence home market values and are commonly found in
homes in any area, including Hawaii and Guam. If solar water heaters are so common that their use generally reduces
the consumption of utilities, the survey results will reflect lower utility costs. This is as it should be. The COLA
model compares overall living costs in the allowance area with overall living costs in the DC area. If housing is more
expensive and utility costs are lower because solar heaters are common, the final comparison of overall housing costs
will be equitable. No special consideration of capital improvement costs or reduced utility consumption is appropriate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter said employees in the allowance areas face extreme weather disturbances, particularly typhoons or
hurricanes. He believed these weather disturbances and other climatic conditions result in higher costs, particularly
home insurance and maintenance costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The cost of homeowner's insurance is part of the COLA model. The policies priced include coverage of damage caused
by high winds (e.g., hurricane winds). As shown in Appendix 7 of the report, these policies are relatively expensive
in areas where severe weather is a problem. Other costs, such as the cost of repairing storm damage, are more difficult
to address in the surveys. Although it may be possible to price the cost of repairing or replacing an item such as a window
or a roof, it is difficult to know how often this must be done in each allowance area compared with the Washington, DC,
area. The same is true with other types of maintenance, such as painting. It is difficult to know what tasks, if any,
must be performed more often in the allowance areas than in the Washington, DC, area. OPM is researching these issues
and plans to discuss them in its report to Congress. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter objected to the selection of Los Angeles as the common destination point for comparing airfares. He
said the Los Angeles routes were highly competitive and resulted in lower fares compared with other destinations.
The commenter suggested pricing round-trip tickets from each area to Kansas City. As stated in the report, Los Angeles
was selected because it is a common point within the continental United States that is roughly equidistant from each
of the allowance areas and the Washington, DC, area. The route may be highly competitive, but that does not invalidate
cost comparisons. OPM is measuring the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
relative
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 cost of air travel. If competition reduces fares, the reductions will be reflected in the Washington, DC, to Los Angeles
fares as well as in the allowance area to Los Angeles fares. Therefore, OPM believes the comparisons are appropriate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter also felt that the COLA model did not measure true air transportation costs. He said inter-island travel
and travel to the contiguous 48 States required more frequent use of air transportation. The COLA model does not account
for regional differences in the frequency of transportation. It assumes the typical Federal employee uses air travel
occasionally but mainly travels by private automobile, putting 15,000 miles per year on a car. The model may underestimate
the cost of air travel for some allowance area residents, but it probably overestimates private transportation costs
for others because it is unlikely that most island residents would put 15,000 miles per year on their cars. Needless
to say, OPM would prefer to employ better usage estimates for both private and air transportation. To this end, OPM
is researching transportation issues and plans to include the results of this research in its report to Congress.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter believed the medical expense portion of the Miscellaneous Component failed to reflect the higher out-of-pocket
expenses that some Federal employees in the allowance areas incur. The commenter cited as examples the higher price
of medical service, the absence of Health Maintenance Organizations (HMO's), and the need to travel outside the area
to obtain some medical services. The COLA model takes into consideration relative differences in medical costs.
For example, the report indicated that medical costs in Honolulu are roughly 10 percent above those in the Washington,
DC, area. OPM notes that HMO's are very popular in Hawaii and Puerto Rico and that all of the allowance areas have medical
facilities that provide commonly required medical services. Nevertheless, OPM is researching issues relating
to medical expenses. The results of that research will be incorporated in our report to Congress. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter criticized the methodology used for catalog pricing. He assumed DC employees do not purchase by catalog
but that allowance areas employees do because certain items were not locally available. Consequently, he recommended
comparing allowance area catalog prices with over-the-counter prices in the Washington, DC, area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated in the report, catalogs are a popular form of retailing in both the allowance areas and in the Washington,
DC, area. The COLA model includes catalog sales to reflect this common type of shopping and to allow the comparison
of the prices of certain items for which the same brands, models, and sizes are difficult to find in the allowance areas
and in the Washington, DC, area. OPM does not agree with the commenter's assumption that people only purchase from
catalogs when the item is not available locally. People make catalog purchases for a variety of reasons, including
price, convenience, and availability. Numerous catalog merchandisers compete in the allowance areas and in the
Washington, DC, area. It would be inappropriate, therefore, to compare allowance area catalog prices with over-the-counter
prices in the DC area. In the employee survey, OPM asked employees about their purchasing patterns, including whether
they typically purchase various types of items by catalog. OPM plans to include the results of this survey in its report
to Congress.

The commenter criticized OPM for using old consumer expenditure information to weight commissary and exchange prices.
OPM acknowledges it is using older information. As evidenced in this final rule, however, OPM has been researching
commissary and exchange usage to discern which Federal employees have such access and in which areas. OPM plans to
continue and expand this research, as appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter assumed that employees who are paid the commissary and exchange COLA rate would have commissary and
exchange access if stationed in the Washington, DC, area. He recommended, therefore, comparing commissary and exchange
prices in the allowance areas with commissary and exchange prices in the DC area.

Executive Order 10000 requires OPM to ``*&blank;*&blank;*make appropriate deductions when *&blank;*&blank;*
commissary or other purchasing privileges are furnished as a result of Federal civilian employment at a cost substantially
lower than the prevailing costs in the allowance area concerned.'' Commissary and exchange prices in Guam are significantly
lower than prevailing prices. Therefore, a reduction in the COLA rate is warranted. The methodology used to calculate
the Commissary and Exchange COLA rate involves the comparison of a weighted average of local retail prices and commissary
and exchange prices in the allowance area with local retail prices only in the Washington, DC, area. This methodology
was reviewed and upheld by the court in

 The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is amending the Federal meat and poultry products inspection regulations
to increase the fees charged by FSIS to provide overtime and holiday inspection, voluntary inspection, identification,
certification, or laboratory services to meat and poultry establishments. The fees reflect the increased costs
of providing these services primarily as a result of Federal salary increases allocated by Congress under the Federal
Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.) provide for mandatory inspection by Federal inspectors of meat and poultry slaughtered and/or processed at official
establishments. Such inspection is required to ensure the safety, wholesomeness, and proper labeling of meat and
poultry products. The costs of mandatory inspection (excluding such services performed on holidays or on an overtime
basis) are borne by FSIS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to mandatory inspection, FSIS provides a range of voluntary inspection services (9 CFR 350.7, 351.8,
351.9, 352.5, 354.101, 355.12, and 362.5). The costs of voluntary inspection are totally recoverable by the Federal
Government. These services, set forth in Subchapter B_Voluntary Inspection and Certification Service, are provided
under the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1621 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

.) to assist in the orderly marketing of various animal products and byproducts not subject to the Federal Meat Inspection
Act or the Poultry Products Inspection Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fees charged by FSIS for voluntary inspection services provided to operators of official meat and poultry establishments,
importers, or exporters are reviewed annually and a cost analysis

or laboratory services.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the projected Fiscal Year 1994 cost analysis, FSIS is increasing the fees for voluntary services. These increased
costs are attributable to the average FSIS locality pay raise of 3.2 percent for Federal employees effective January
1994; the increasing number of employees covered by the Federal Employees Retirement System and subject to the Federal
Insurance Contributions Act tax; and increased health insurance costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On June 27, 1994, FSIS published a proposed rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 32940) to increase the fees charged by FSIS to provide overtime and holiday inspection, voluntary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection, identification, certification, or laboratory services to meat and poultry establishments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS received one comment in response to the proposal. The comment was from the owner of a small meat establishment
who felt that the current fee of $30.72 per hour was excessive and a burden on his company. After analyzing the available
data relating to costs of providing these services, FSIS has determined that these rates reflect the cost of providing
inspection services. The new rates reflect only an incremental increase in the costs currently borne by those entities
electing to utilize overtime and holiday inspection services and certain other voluntary inspection services.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To recover these increased costs in an expeditious manner, the Administrator has determined that these amendments
should be effective less than 30 days after publication in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register

Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule has been determined to be significant and was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
under Executive Order 12866. The fees provided for in this rule reflect a minimal increase in the costs currently borne
by those entities which elect to utilize certain voluntary inspection services. As discussed in the background of
this document, the increase in fees reflects the increased costs of providing these services primarily as a result
of Federal salary increases allocated by Congress under the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is intended to have
preemptive effect with respect to any State or local laws, regulations or policies which conflict with its provisions
or which would otherwise impede its full implementation. This rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is not intended to have retroactive effect. Prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions, all applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative procedures must be exhausted. Under the Federal Meat and Poultry Products Inspection Acts, the administrative
procedures are set forth in 7 CFR Part 1.

Effect on Small Entities

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administrator, Food Safety and Inspection Service, has determined that this action will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601).
The fees reflect a minimal increase in the costs currently borne by those entities which elect to utilize certain inspection
services.

 are to facilitate the meetings:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) There will be no admission fee or other charge to attend or to participate in the meetings. The meetings will be open
to all persons who are scheduled to present statements or who register on the day of the meeting (between 10:45 a.m.
and 11:45 a.m.) subject to availability of space in the meeting rooms. The meetings may adjourn early if scheduled
speakers complete their statements in less time than is scheduled for the meetings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) An individual, whether speaking in a personal or a representative capacity on behalf of an organization, may be
limited to a 10-minute statement. If possible, we will notify the speaker if additional time is available.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The DOT will try to accommodate all speakers. If the available time does not permit this, speakers generally will
be scheduled on a first-come-first-served basis. However, the DOT reserves the right to exclude some speakers if
necessary to present a balance of viewpoints and issues.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Sign and oral interpretation can be made available at the meeting, as well as an assistive listening device, if
requested 10 calendar days before the meeting.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Representatives of the DOT will preside over the meeting. A panel of DOT and FAA personnel involved in this issue
will be present.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The meeting will be recorded by a court reporter. A transcript of the meeting and any material accepted by the DOT
representatives during the meeting will be included in the public docket. Any person who is interested in purchasing
a copy of the transcript should contact the court reporter directly. Additional transcript purchase information
will be available at the meeting.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

five copies of all materials to be presented for distribution to the DOT representatives; other copies may be provided
to the audience at the discretion of the participant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Statements made by DOT representatives are intended to facilitate discussion of the issues or to clarify issues.
Any statement made during the meeting by a DOT representative is not intended to be, and should not be construed as,
a position of the DOT.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) The meetings are designed to solicit public views and more complete information on the High Density Rule. Therefore,
the meetings will be conducted in an informal and nonadversarial manner. No individual will be subject to cross-examination

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Treasury (``Department'') is issuing in final form amendments to the regulations issued under
the Government Securities Act of 1986 (the ``Government Securities Act'' or ``GSA'').
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 Section 405.3 of the GSA regulations requires registered government securities brokers and dealers to comply with
the requirements of Securities and Exchange Commission (the ``Commission'' or ``SEC'') Rule 17a&hyph;11 under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Exchange Act''), with certain modifications. The SEC has amended Rule
17a&hyph;11 and the Department's amendments parallel the SEC's changes.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendments will, among other things, ease the regulatory and reporting burdens on registered government securities
brokers and dealers by eliminating the requirement that they submit certain supplemental financial reports previously
required by &sect;405.3 of the GSA regulations. Registered government securities brokers and dealers will remain
obligated to transmit notice of a capital deficiency or certain other events.

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
When the Department first adopted rules and regulations affecting government securities brokers and dealers, it
took into consideration the already existing regulation of securities brokers and dealers registered with the SEC
under sections 15 or 15B of the Exchange Act, with a view toward preventing overly burdensome or duplicative regulations.
In that regard, the GSA regulations incorporated, by reference, many of the SEC's rules regulating brokers and dealers,
including, with modification, Rule 17a&hyph;11.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 7, 1993, the SEC adopted amendments to 17 CFR 240.17a&hyph;11 (Rule 17a&hyph;11), which became effective
August 12, 1993.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 The primary purpose of Rule 17a&hyph;11 is to provide the SEC and other regulatory bodies with advance warning and
information regarding brokers and dealers that are experiencing financial or operational difficulty. Prior to
the SEC's amendments, Rule 17a&hyph;11 required a broker or dealer to give notice and transmit supplemental reports
to the Commission and other regulatory bodies when its net capital declined below its required minimum level or when
its total outstanding principal amount of satisfactory subordination agreements exceeded allowable levels for
more than 90 days. The SEC's amendments, among other things, eliminated the requirement that brokers and dealers
file Part II or Part IIA of Form X&hyph;17A&hyph;5, Financial and Operational Combined Uniform Single Report (``FOCUS
Report'') after a net capital deficiency. Brokers and dealers, however, remain obligated to transmit same-day notice
of such a capital deficiency. Additionally, prior to the amendments to Rule 17a&hyph;11, brokers and dealers whose
net capital fell below certain ``early warning levels''
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 were required to file monthly FOCUS Report for at least three successive months. This requirement was eliminated
by the amendments and replaced with the requirement that brokers and dealers promptly notify the Commission and their
designated examining authority (``DEA'') of the triggering event. However, the changes to SEC Rule 17a&hyph;11
did not apply to registered government securities brokers and dealers because the Treasury is the rulemaker for these
firms.

Early warning levels are capital levels set at amounts that are higher than the minimum capital requirement. In situations
where the capital level of a broker or dealer is declining, the early warning level serves the purpose of alerting regulatory
agencies that the firm may be experiencing financial or operational difficulty. This early notification enables
the regulatory agencies to monitor the activities of a broker-dealer and assess its financial condition while there
is still time to take action to prevent the broker-dealer from falling out of compliance with the minimum capital requirement.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 405.3 of the GSA regulations requires, with certain modifications, every registered government securities
broker or dealer to comply with Rule 17a&hyph;11. Consistent with the SEC's pre-amendment Rule 17a&hyph;11, &sect;405.3
has required registered government securities brokers and dealers, including interdealer brokers and futures
commission merchants (FCMs), to provide notice of capital deficiencies, to submit financial reports within 24 hours
of a capital deficiency, and to file supplemental reports for three successive months when capital falls below early
warning levels. Since the SEC's amendments to Rule 17a&hyph;11, without conforming amendments to &sect;405.3 of
the GSA regulations, the rules applicable to government securities brokers and dealers have been unclear. At the
time of the amendments to SEC Rule 17a&hyph;11, Treasury was unable to revise the GSA regulations accordingly because
its rulemaking authority had expired in October 1991 and reauthorization legislation was still being considered
by the Congress.

The Treasury supported the SEC changes to Rule 17a&hyph;11 and took action to relieve registered government securities
brokers and dealers of the requirement to file supplemental financial reports under &sect;405.3, pending the reauthorization
of Treasury's rulemaking authority and the issuance of conforming amendments. Accordingly, on August 27, 1993,
at the request of Department staff, the SEC staff issued to no-action letter
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 stating that no action would be recommended to the Commission if a DEA waived the financial report filing requirements
of SEC Rule 17a&hyph;11, as modified and made applicable to registered government securities brokers and dealers
by &sect;405.3, provided that:

Letter from Michael A. Macchiaroli, Associate Director, Division of Market Regulation, U.S. Securities and Exchange

(1) a registered government securities broker or dealer gives notice the same day of the event in accordance with Rule
17a&hyph;11:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) if the liquid capital of a government securities broker-dealer subject to the financial responsibility requirements
of &sect;402.2 under the GSA declines below the minimum amount required by &sect;402.2, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) if the net capital of a government securities interdealer broker subject to the financial responsibility requirements
of &sect;402.1(e) of the GSA declines below the minimum amount required by &sect;402.1(e), or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) if the net capital of a registered government securities broker or dealer that is also an FCM registered with the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``CFTC'') falls below the greater of (i) the minimum amount required by Rule
15c3&hyph;1 (17 CFR 240.15c3&hyph;1) or (ii) the minimum amount required by CFTC Rule 1.17 (17 CFR 1.17); or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) a registered government securities broker or dealer gives notice promptly (within 24 hours) in accordance with
Rule 17a&hyph;11 upon the occurrence of an event that would require under &sect;405.3 the filing of a Report on Finances
and Operations of Government Securities Brokers and Dealers (``FOGS Report'') or FOCUS Report.

The no-action letter also noted that Treasury's rulemaking authority had expired, but that Treasury staff intended,
upon reauthorization of its rulemaking authority, to amend its regulations under the GSA to conform to the SEC's amendments
to Rule 17a&hyph;11. The Treasury's rulemaking authority was reauthorized on December 17, 1993, with the enactment
of the Government Securities Act Amendments of 1993,
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 thus enabling the Department to make this rule change.

A. Section 405.3
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The new rule eliminates the prior requirement that registered government securities brokers or dealers file financial
reports within 24 hours after a liquid or net capital deficiency by adopting paragraph (b) of SEC Rule 17a&hyph;11.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 Registered government securities brokers and dealers will remain obligated to transmit notice of a liquid or net
capital deficiency on the same day of the occurrence. However, unlike the previous rule, the amendments require the
notice to specify the registered government securities broker's or dealer's capital requirement and its current
amount of capital. This latter requirement does not impose any additional burdens on registered government securities
brokers and dealers because they are required to continually monitor their minimum capital requirement and their
current amount of capital to ensure compliance with the Department's capital rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 405.3 also adopts the requirement of SEC Rule 17a&hyph;11(b) that a broker or dealer must give notice of a capital
deficiency when it is informed by its DEA or the Commission that it is, or has been, in violation of the capital requirements,
even if it does not agree with that determination. In the event of such a dispute, the broker or dealer may state in its
notice the arguments for its disagreement with the capital deficiency determination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirement that registered government securities brokers and dealers file Part II or Part IIA of the FOGS Report,
or in limited cases the FOCUS Report, within 15 calendar days after the end of the next three months if their capital
falls below certain early warning levels is also eliminated. In lieu of this requirement, and consistent with the
SEC's Rule, &sect;405.3(a)(5) requires that, in the event a registered government securities broker's or dealer's
capital falls below certain early warning levels, it is required to file notice of such event promptly (within 24 hours).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 405.3(a)(5) also adds a new early warning level based on minimum capital after haircuts for registered government
securities brokers or dealers other than government securities interdealer brokers and government securities
brokers and dealers that also are FCMs. In addition to sending prompt notice any time their liquid capital is less than
150 percent of haircuts, such government securities brokers and dealers also have to send a notice when their liquid
capital after deducting total haircuts is less than 120 percent of their minimum capital requirement. This is consistent
with the SEC early warning level for net capital and especially important for a registered government securities
broker or dealer that may have no haircuts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These amendments to &sect;405.3 of the GSA regulations conform the notification provisions applicable to registered
government securities brokers and dealers to the requirements applicable to diversified brokers and dealers registered
with the SEC. The Department is conforming the regulations under the GSA to SEC Rule 17a&hyph;11 to ensure consistent
regulatory treatment for all classes of government securities brokers and dealers registered with the Commission
and to reduce the reporting burdens on registered government securities brokers and dealers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes that there is no reason for registered government securities brokers or dealers to file reports
in circumstances where other brokers or dealers registered with the SEC are not filing reports. Further, the same-day
notice requirement provides the Commission and the DEAs adequate warning of financial or operational problems,
thereby enabling them to increase the surveillance of a registered government securities broker or dealer experiencing
difficulty and to obtain any additional information necessary to assess the broker's or dealer's financial condition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due to the revisions of SEC Rule 17a&hyph;11, the Department is also making minor housekeeping changes to &sect;405.3(a)
by deleting paragraphs 405.3(a) (4) and (5), which are no longer applicable, and redesignating the remaining paragraphs.
To correct an oversight, the Department is adding new paragraph 405.3(c)(7) that indicates that references in SEC
Rule 17a&hyph;11 to &sect;240.17a&hyph;3, relating to records, mean &sect;404.2 of the GSA regulations. This provision,
which appears in paragraphs 405.3 (a) and (b), was inadvertently excluded from paragraph 405.3(c) when the implementing
GSA regulations were adopted in July 1987.

B. Technical Amendments to Section 402.2d
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Department is also making a technical amendment to paragraph (j) of &sect;402.2d of the GSA regulations. Currently,
paragraph (j) of &sect;402.2d, which modifies &sect;240.15c3&hyph;1d(c)(5)(i), prohibits a registered government
securities broker or dealer from entering into a temporary subordinated loan during any period in which the broker
or dealer is subject to ``any of the reporting provisions'' of &sect;405.3. Although the requirement in &sect;405.3
to file supplemental financial reports (i.e., FOGS or FOCUS Reports) in the event of a capital deficiency or the breaching
of early warning levels is being eliminated, the Department is retaining the capital rule's prohibition against
a registered government securities broker or dealer obtaining a temporary subordinated loan during a period of financial
or operational difficulty. Accordingly, paragraph (j) is being amended to prohibit a registered government securities
broker or dealer from obtaining a temporary subordinated loan if it has given notice under &sect;405.3 within the
preceding thirty days. This amendment will enable the DEAs to prevent a registered government securities broker
or dealer from obtaining temporary loans during periods in which the broker or dealer may be experiencing financial
or operational difficulties.

III. Special Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Because this final rule is merely a conforming amendment, the Department has determined that it is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' as defined in Executive Order 12866.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553(b)), the Department for good cause
finds that issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking and requesting comment are unnecessary. This rulemaking merely
makes corrections to the existing GSA rule to conform it to the amendments to the SEC rule upon which it is based. The
rule makes no independent substantive changes in the treatment of government securities brokers and dealers_they
have previously been subject to reporting requirements parallel to other registered brokers and dealers, and they
will continue to be subject to reporting requirements parallel to other registered brokers and dealers. This rule
change imposes no additional burdens or requirements on government securities brokers and dealers. For these reasons,
the Department is issuing the rule in final form, with an immediate effective date, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because no notice and public comment are required for this rulemaking, the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility
Act (5 U.S.C 601, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), do not apply. In addition, the information collections concerning this rule have been previously reviewed and
approved by the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)) and assigned
control number 1535&hyph;0089. This rulemaking makes no substantive change to the information collection requirements
except to delete the requirement that a registered government securities broker or dealer file a FOGS or FOCUS Report
after experiencing a capital deficiency or triggering the early warning level notice requirements.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 223(a)(7) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1715n(a)(7)) (the Act) authorizes HUD to insure mortgages
given to refinance existing HUD-insured mortgages under any section or title of the Act. HUD has implemented Section
223(a)(7) in each of its regulations authorizing the insurance of mortgage refinancing, including 24 CFR parts 207,
213, 220, 221, 231, 232, 236, 241, and 242. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Due to requirements of the Act, each of these parts limits the principal amount of the refinanced mortgage to the lower
of: (a) the original principal amount of the existing mortgage, or (b) the unpaid balance of the existing mortgage,
to which certain HUD-approved items may be added. Additionally, each of these parts, except parts 241 (supplemental
loans) and 242 (hospitals), prohibited the refinanced mortgage amount from exceeding a stated percentage of the
Federal Housing Commissioner's estimate of value of the project after completion of any repairs, improvements,
or additions to the property. Unlike the limitation noted above, the value criterion was not a statutory requirement.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The value criterion precluded many troubled projects from refinancing their HUD-insured mortgages, thus preventing
them from lowering their debt service payments and gaining a sounder financial footing. Because Section 223(a)(7)
mortgages are already limited by the amount of the original insured mortgage, HUD felt the public interest and HUD's
Insurance Fund would be better served by allowing these loans to be refinanced to take advantage of lower interest
rates. Accordingly, on October 26, 1993, HUD published an interim rule (58 FR 57558) removing the value criterion
from those sections of HUD's regulations implementing Section 223(a)(7). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The preamble to the interim rule stated that the rule would cease to be effective after October 26, 1994, unless before
that date HUD published it as a final rule. The final rule is currently in the last stages of review by HUD and the Office
of Management and Budget (OMB) and will be published upon approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To prevent a period during which there is no rule in effect on this subject, the Department is extending the effective
date of the interim rule deleting the value criterion in Section 223(a)(7) refinancing, from October 26, 1994, until
April 26, 1995. This action extends the potential effective period from 11 months to 18 months which is in accordance
with internal Departmental guidelines on interim rules. However, the Department anticipates that a final rule will
be published well before the expiration of the 18-month period. The final rule would supersede the interim rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with the extension of the interim rule, the Department also is extending the Expedited Section 223(a)(7)
Processing Instructions (issued November 24, 1993 for use by the Department). The instructions will now be effective
until April 26, 1995, unless otherwise superseded.

I. Background on the Indiana Plan
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 29, 1982, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Indiana plan. Background information
on the Indiana plan, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the approval of the Indiana
plan can be found in the July 26, 1982, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(47 FR 32110). Subsequent actions concerning the conditions of approval and amendments to the plan can be found at
30 CFR 914.20 and 914.25.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Submission of the Proposed Amendment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 410 of SMCRA authorizes the Secretary to use funds under the AMLR program to abate or control emergency situations
in which adverse effects of past coal mining pose an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or general welfare.
On September 29, 1982 (47 FR 42729), OSM invited States to amend their AMLR Plans for the purpose of undertaking emergency
reclamation programs on behalf of OSM. States would have to demonstrate that they have the statutory authority to
undertake emergencies, the technical capability to design and supervise the emergency work, and the administrative
mechanisms to quickly respond to emergencies either directly or through contractors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the provisions of 30 CFR 884.15, any State may submit proposed amendments to its approved AMLR Plan. If the proposed
amendments change the scope or major policies followed by the State in the conduct of its AMLR program, the Director
must follow the procedures set out in 30 CFR 884.14 in reviewing and approving or disapproving the proposed amendments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed assumption of the AMLR emergency program on behalf of OSM is a major addition to the Indiana AMLR plan.
Therefore, to asume the emergency program, Indiana must revise the Indiana Plan to include conducting the AML emergency
program.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 47 FR 42729 (September 29, 1982), as to its authority and procedures for implementing an emergency response reclamation
program based on the provisions in Section 410 of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, Pub. L. 95&hyph;87
(SMCRA).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The agency designated by the Governor as authorized to receive grants and administer an emergency program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A legal opinion from the chief legal officer that the designated agency has the authority under State law to conduct
the emergency program in accordance with the requirements of Section 410 of Title IV of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. A description of the policies and procedures to be followed by the designated agency in conducting the reclamation

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
a. The purpose of the emergency response reclamation activities to be undertaken by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources, Division of Reclamation is to enter upon any land where an emergency exists and on any other land to have
access to the land where the emergency exists and restore, reclaim, abate, control or prevent the adverse effect of
coal mining practices and to do all things necessary or expedient to protect the public health, safety, or general
welfare. For the purposes of this plan amendment emergency is defined as a sudden danger or impairment that presents
a high probability of substantial physical harm to the health, safety, or general welfare of people before the danger
can be abated under normal program operation procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. The Indiana Department of Natural Resources will assume authority for all emergency projects within Indiana and
will coordinate work with the Federal Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM). Coordination
with other state or local agencies will be on a project specific basis. The Department of Administration will be a key
component in the procurement of goods and services for emergency work. Assistance is also available from the Indiana
Department of Transportation and the Indiana State Emergency Management Agency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All investigations and eligibility findings required by Title IV of SMCRA will be conducted by the Division of Reclamation.
This information on emergency investigations will be provided to OSM. Once OSM makes a finding of fact that an emergency
situation exists, the state will undertake the specific construction efforts approved by OSM to abate the declared
emergency situation.

c. Land acquisition for emergency projects will follow the guidelines as stated in Indiana's approved State Plan.
The state will acquire lands in emergency situations where no other practical means are available to abate an immediate
threat to the health, safety or general welfare of its citizens. Policies, procedures and authority to acquire lands
is clearly detailed in the approved State Plan in the sections entitled Land Acquisition, Management and Disposal.
Indiana does not consider land acquisition to be a preferred step in reclamation projects and will therefore proceed
with this option only under unique circumstances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. The policies and procedures for emergency reclamation on private and public lands will be the same as for other AML
reclamation activities and detailed in the approved State Plan at 884.13(c)(5) and (6).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. The Indiana Department of Natural Resources may enter on any land where an emergency exists or on adjacent lands
for access, in order to protect the public health, safety or general welfare from adverse effects of coal mining. It
is the policy of the State of Indiana to respect the rights of private ownership, and the state will make all reasonable
efforts to obtain a written consent from the owner of record in advance of emergency reclamation. The consent for right
of entry shall be in the form of a signed agreement with the land owner or the authorized agent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. The Indiana Department of Natural Resources will publish a legal notice in a general circulation newspaper within
each county potentially affected by this emergency program assumption. These legal notices will provide for a thirty-day
comment period and will include the possibility of conducting public meetings in order to resolve any issues of general
concern. Each notice will include a statement of availability of this emergency reclamation amendment package.
All comments received on this amendment will be incorporated by reference to this document and made available to any
interested parties.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c.i. Administrative procedures for investigating and reporting emergency complaints will include on-site visitation
by a qualified staff member to make findings of fact and to document through a written report and photograph the current
status of the complaint. A complaint information gathering guide will aid in complaint investigation. Emergency
response will entail having a qualified staff member on-site as soon as is practicable. Urgency of the response time
will be determined by the initial description of the complaint received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c.ii. As soon as is practical, eligibility information will be obtained and reported for each potential emergency.
This information will include written determination of: (1) whether the site was mined for coal; (2) the dates, types,
and operations of any and all mines at the site, and (3) the existence of any continuing reclamation responsibility
at the site. This information will be provided to the appropriate legal staff in order to allow them to make an eligibility
determination for emergency reclamation. It is desirable but not necessary to have all required legal documents
completed prior to initiating emergency reclamation activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c.iii. All rights of entry and necessary appraisals will be executed according to the procedures outlined above and
as described in the approved State Plan. It is desirable but not necessary to have all required realty documents completed
prior to initiating emergency reclamation activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c.iv. Administrative procedures for project supervision will be the responsibility of the assigned project manager
and will fit within the approved administrative structure of the Division of Reclamation as outlined in the approved
State Plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c.v. Final project inspection and preparation and submission of final project reports will be conducted in conjunction
with the OSM Indianapolis field office. The assigned project manager and the pertinent grants staff of the division
of Reclamation will be responsible for the preparation of all technical, programmatic and financial reports and
documents. Approval by administrative staff of the Division of Reclamation of all reports to OSM will be required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. The purchasing and procurement systems to be used by the Department of Natural Resources, Division of Reclamation
under the emergency reclamation program will be those currently used for securing goods and services under other
aspects of the AML program, with the following special conditions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Emergency reclamation will have priority over all other requests originating within the Division of Reclamation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Purchase orders for emergency work will be ``hand carried'' through the administrative system to allow approval
within the shortest time frame possible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. A list of potential contractors and/or suppliers will be maintained for ready reference quick contact by the Restoration
Section. This list will be updated as necessary to include all capable potential contractors.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
4. In most cases, work will be allowed to proceed on the basis of verbal approval and a commitment for written follow-up.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The Division of Reclamation has developed, and is using, an emergency reclamation contracting system that expedites
the securing of abatement work.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. The accounting system to be used by the Division of Reclamation for the emergency program projects will be the same
as currently utilized for all other AML reclamation projects. Emergency program accounting will be on a project basis.
All emergency project obligations, payments and drawdowns will be tracked individually and separately and will
be done in accord with Federal requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. The Division of Reclamation has expertise in the disciplines necessary to implement the emergency program. Staff
engineers have a great deal of experience in reclamation designs for all types of problems anticipated to be encountered
in the emergency program. These may include, but are not limited to: filling and/or sealing mine openings or subsidence,
monitoring, grouting under or stabilizing ground affected by area subsidence or slides, refuse fires, roadway failures,
and flooding due to clogged streams. The Emergency Program Coordinator will specialize in correction of emergency
events and will be the lead staff person with support from the expertise of other Division of Reclamation specialists.
Technical consultation will be available to staff from OSM, U.S. Bureau of Mines, consultants, and the Indiana Division
of Engineering among others.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Technical capability to supervise emergency work is the same as the Division of Reclamation's project managers currently
use to perform on-site supervision and inspection of other AML projects. Procedures for field supervision will evolve
as Indiana's experience in emergency reclamation grows. However, the existing field operations manual provides
an excellent starting point of all emergency reclamation supervision.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
a. The OSM has been conducting emergency reclamation for almost twelve years in the State of Indiana. There have been
approximately 190 emergency investigations, with 85 declared or given emergency status. The majority of all emergency
projects have been related to subsidence (71), while shaft openings (9), slides (4), and refuse fires (1) account
for the balance of declared emergencies. The distribution by county of both emergency projects and investigations
has been documented.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Emergencies related to subsidence have been primarily the result of small pit type subsidence. This subsidence
is customarily associated with shallow underground mining. The potential for future emergency reclamation due
to subsidence is very large and widespread in the Indiana coal fields.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Narrative description which supports the State's position that the procedures, personnel and other proposed
aspects of its program give evidence of its abilities to promptly and effectively mitigate the full range of anticipated
emergency conditions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The objectives of the Indiana abandoned mine land program are to fulfill the general reclamation objectives set out
in Section 403 of P.L. 95&hyph;87. The highest priorities of the program are the protection of public health, safety
and general welfare from dangers resulting from the adverse effects of past coal mining. The emergency response program
described in this document provides an additional means whereby the State of Indiana will be able to protect its citizens
from these adverse effects consistent with the intent of Section 410 of P.L. 95&hyph;87. Indiana has the procedures,
personnel, and administrative functions within the Department of Natural Resources to capably and effectively
manage the emergency program as described in the previous sections, and is willing and able to work with OSM to insure
its success.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An additional objective of the State of Indiana in assuming the administration of the emergency program from OSM is
to provide continued protection to the citizens of this state. The State of Indiana must secure cooperation from OSM
in providing prompt emergency declaration as well as complete and adequate grant funding to carry out the work.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 405 of SMCRA, OSM finds that Indiana submitted an amendment to its AMLR plan, subsequently
revised and clarified, and it has been determined, pursuant to 30 CFR 884.15, that:

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The State provided adequate notice and opportunity for public comment in the development of the amendment and the
record does not reflect major unresolved controversies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Views of other Federal agencies having an interest in the plan have been solicited and considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The State has the legal authority, policies and administrative structure necessary to implement the amendment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The proposed plan amendment meets all requirements of the OSM AMLR program provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The State has an approved Surface Mining Regulatory Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The amendment is in compliance with all applicable State and Federal laws and regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director finds therefore, that the proposed Indiana plan amendment allowing the State to assume responsibility
for an emergency response reclamation program on behalf of OSM is no less stringent than SMCRA and no less effective
than the Federal regulations and can be approved.

Public Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Director solicited public comments and provided an opportunity for a public hearing on the proposed amendment.
No public comments were received, and because no one requested an opportunity to speak at a public hearing, no hearing
was held. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Federal Agency Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 30 CFR 884.14(a)(2) and 884.15(a), the Director solicited comments on the proposed amendment from various
other Federal agencies with an actual or potential interest in the Indiana plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the original submittal (November 17, 1992), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Forest Service
responded and stated that it had no comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the December 6, 1993, reopening of the public comment period, the USDA, Soil Conservation Service (SCS)
responded and stated that they did not see where the proposed language would impact the Rural Abandoned Mine Program
administered by the SCS. The U.S. Bureau of Mines responded and stated that it has no comment.

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(ii), the Director is required to obtain the written concurrence of the Administrator
of the EPA with respect to any provisions of a State program amendment that relate to air or water quality standards
promulgated under the authority of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) or the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The Director has determined that this amendment contains no provisions in these categories and that EPA's concurrence
is not required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 732.17(h)(11)(i), OSM solicited comments on the proposed amendment from EPA (Administrative Record
No. IND&hyph;1303). EPA did not respond to OSM's request.

V. Director's Decision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the above findings, the Director approves the proposed AMLR plan amendment as submitted by Indiana on November
17, 1992, and revised on October 29, 1993, and on June 27, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 914.25, codifying decisions concerning the Indiana plan, are being amended to implement
this decision. This final rule is being made effective October 26, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VI. Procedural Determinations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory
Planning and Review).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12778
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 and has determined
that, to the extent allowed by law, this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State and Tribal abandoned mine land reclamation
plans and revisions thereof since each such plan is drafted and adopted by a specific State or Tribe, not by OSM. Decisions
on proposed State and Tribal abandoned mine land reclamation plans and revisions thereof submitted by a State or Tribe
are based on a determination of whether the submittal meets the requirements of Title IV of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1231&hyph;1243)
and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR Parts 884 and 888.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
National Environmental Policy Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since agency decisions on proposed State and Tribal abandoned
mine land reclamation plans and revisions thereof are categorically excluded from compliance with the National
Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332) by the Manual of the Department of the Interior [516 DM 6, appendix 8, paragraph
8.4B(29)].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Paperwork Reduction Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by the Office of Management
and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3507 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->
Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon corresponding Federal regulations for which an economic
analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic effect
upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements previously
promulgated by OSM will be implemented. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have a significant
economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions in the analyses for the corresponding Federal
regulations.

 on April 6, 1994 (59 FR 16123), the Department of Defense is amending the Rule to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Delete section 91.7(d) and the accompanying ``Market Test.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Establish the requirements for an Economic Development Conveyance (EDC) application for real property in a revised
section 91.7(e).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Establish criteria that will be used to evaluate EDC applications in a revised section 91.7(e).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Provide guidance for greater flexibility on the compensation to the Federal Government for property conveyed
under an EDC in a revised section 91.7(e).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The scope of the following amendment is limited to the real property conveyance section of the rule &sect;&sect;91.7
(d), (e), and (f), and not the entire April 6, 1994, interim final rule. A final rule addressing all of the elements of
the interim final rule will be published in early 1995. The Department of Defense will also publish a guidebook describing
the base conversion process.

On July 2, 1993, President Clinton announced a major new policy to speed the economic recovery of communities affected
by base closures or realignments. The President requested that Congress provide additional authority to expedite
the reuse of closing military bases. Congress agreed, and passed this new authority, Title XXIX of the National Defense
Authorization Act for FY 1994.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 2903 of Title XXIX gave the Secretary of Defense the authority to transfer property to local redevelopment
authorities at or below fair market value. The Department of Defense implemented this authority by creating an additional
tool for local communities to help foster economic development through the creation of a new form of conveyance, referred
to as the ``Economic Development Conveyance '' (EDC). Under an EDC, the Department may transfer property to a Local
Redevelopment Authority (``LRA'') at or below estimated fair market value for purposes of economic development.
(Property may also be transferred under a series of other existing public benefit conveyances.)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 6, 1994, (59 FR 16123), the Department of Defense published an interim final rule that provided base closure
communities with guidance on how to use the new authority. During the public comment process, the Department of Defense
learned that some of the procedures contained in the interim final rule may be impractical and not assist in reaching
the rapid economic redevelopment goals. As a result, they are being revised by this amendment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, the interim final rule established a ``market test'' or ``market survey'' as a precondition to any
EDC. This approach was designed to help determine whether immediate private development of a property was possible
by advertising its availability and soliciting private interest. Many comments suggested that private developers
would not spend the time and money necessary to prepare a detailed expression of interest until after a community redevelopment
plan was approved, if at all. Additionally, the interim final rule was perceived to encourage private developers
to ``cherry-pick'' valuable parcels for private sector sales and leave the less attractive parcels for the community
redevelopment. This effort was said to be inconsistent with proper planning methods and not in the long-term interest
of enhancing local economic recovery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the assistance of comments received during the public comment period of the interim final rule, the Department
of Defense has been persuaded that such solicitation is unlikely to be fruitful unless and until the local community
provides the necessary investment and infrastructure for development: zoning, public utilities, etc. As a result,
the Department is eliminating the ``market test'' and creating with this Amendment a new process for an EDC that will
consider such information, as addressed by the local redevelopment plan.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim final rule also prescribed procedures and guidelines for recoupment of value by the Federal Government
if and when net proceeds were realized by development. Based upon experience since its publication and public comment,
the Department of Defense is persuaded that greater flexibility is needed in this area.

The interim final rule amendment being published today addresses some of the concerns raised by affected communities
and others. This amendment eliminates the ``market test'' requirements, includes a new application and review process
for an EDC, and establishes criteria to evaluate the applications as a substitute for the ``market test.'' Greater
flexibility is given to the Military Departments and the communities to negotiate the terms and conditions of the
EDC. A detailed application, including the approved community redevelopment plan, will now be the basis for a determination
of whether or not an LRA will be eligible for an EDC. The application and review process will also be used to help determine
the terms and conditions of such a conveyance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This Amendment is an intermediate step before the April 6, 1994, interim final rule is reissued as a final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;What is an Economic Development Conveyance (EDC)?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An EDC is a new process for transferring real property to a Local Redevelopment Authority (LRA) to help spur local economic
development and job creation. An EDC may be with or without initial payment or with only partial payment at time of transfer,
may be at or below the estimated fair market value of the property, and allows for negotiated terms and conditions of
payment (consideration) to the Department of Defense. These negotiations must be fair and reasonable to both parties
and strike a balance between compensation to the Federal taxpayer and the need for the EDC to spur redevelopment. The
EDC offers LRAs an additional tool to use in the acquisition of former military base property.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;When should an EDC be used?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal Property and Administrative Services Act (FPASA) of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 484) and airport public benefit authorities
(49 U.S.C. 47151&hyph;47153) allow for public benefit transfers to units of government or non-profit institutions
that maintain the use of property for a public purpose including, but not limited to, parks, public health, education,
aviation, historic monuments, and prisons. Transfers of property under public benefit transfers must be in accordance
with the sponsoring Federal agency regulations. The FPASA also allows for negotiated sales at fair market value to
public entities for public purposes or direct sales through a public bid process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EDC should be used when the LRA wants to obtain property for job generating purposes and it is not practicable to
pay fair market value at the time of transfer. However, the EDC is not intended to supplant other Federal property disposal
authorities and cannot be used if the intended land use can be accomplished through another authority unless unusual
circumstances are presented that demonstrate that the needed economic development and job generation cannot occur
under the other allowable federal transfer authority.

1Public benefit and other specific conveyances are typically either approved or sponsored by the authorized Federal
agency. In approved transfers, the Federal agency must grant its approval but property conveyance is accomplished
by the Military Department. In sponsored transfers, the Military Department assigns the property to the Federal
agency, upon request, and the Federal agency is responsible for conveyance of the property to its recipient.

&bull;Who Can Receive an Economic Development Conveyance?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An LRA is the only entity eligible to receive property under an Economic Development Conveyance. An LRA should have
broad-based membership, including, but not limited to, representatives from those jurisdictions with zoning authority
over the property. The Secretary of Defense shall officially recognize an LRA for planning and/or implementation
through the Office of Economic Adjustment. Consequently, applications submitted by entities other than LRAs will
not be considered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;When should an application for an Economic Development Conveyance be made?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, an LRA must be organized and a redevelopment plan created. The Department of Defense's Office of Economic Adjustment
can provide guidance and technical and financial support in these efforts. Once a redevelopment plan has been developed
and adopted, the LRA can then submit an EDC application to the Military Department responsible for the property. The
application should be submitted by the LRA after consultation with the Military Department which shall establish
a reasonable time period for submission of the application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The LRA always has the option of acquiring property under the FPASA and thus it may not be necessary to complete an application
for an EDC within the stated timetables. LRAs can discuss the various transfer options with the Military Department.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;How much property should be included in an Economic Development Conveyance application?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EDC should be used by LRAs to obtain large parcels of the base rather than merely individual buildings. The income
received from some of the higher value property should be used to offset the maintenance and marketing costs of the
less desirable parcels. In order for this conveyance to spur redevelopment, large parcels must be used to provide
an income stream to assist the long-term development of the property.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Why is an application necessary?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This Amendment to the interim final rule prescribes that an application be prepared by an LRA as the formal request
for property, to better assist the Military Department in considering requests for property under the Economic Development
Conveyance (EDC). This information also will provide the basis for the Military Department to respond to its obligations
under Title XXIX, taking into account the best community-based information on the proposed conveyance action. A
great deal of information necessary for an application is readily available to the LRA through the community planning
process and supported through existing DoD technical and financial resources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Beyond the standard planning information collected to date, LRAs should incorporate a business and development
component into their overall base reuse planning process as a basis for receiving and managing the real property.
This supplemental effort will assist LRAs in identifying necessary implementation resources and establish a community-based
proposal for the Military Department's consideration. The Military Departments and the Office of Economic Adjustment
will continue to work closely with the affected LRA to ensure that an adequate planning effort is undertaken.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After receipt of an application for an EDC, the Secretary of the Military Department will determine whether an EDC
is appropriate to spur economic development and job creation and examine whether the terms and conditions proposed
are fair and reasonable. The Military Department may also consider information independent of the application,
such as views of other Federal agencies, appraisals, caretaker costs and other relevant information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following criteria and factors will be used, as appropriate, to determine whether a community is eligible for
an EDC and to evaluate the proposed terms and conditions of the EDC, including price, time of payment and other relevant
methods of compensation to the Federal Government.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Adverse economic impact of closure on the region and potential for economic recovery after an EDC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Extent of short- and long-term job generation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Consistency with the overall Redevelopment Plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Financial feasibility of the development, including market analysis and the need and extent of proposed infrastructure
investment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Extent of State and local investment and level of risk incurred.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Current local and regional real estate market conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Incorporation of other Federal agency interests and concerns, and applicability of, and conflicts with,
other Federal property disposal authorities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Relationship to the overall Military Department disposal plan for the installation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Economic benefit to the Federal Government, including protection and maintenance cost savings and anticipated
consideration from the transfer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Compliance with applicable Federal, State, and local laws and regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;What are the guidelines for determining the terms and conditions of consideration?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The individual circumstances of each community and each base mean that the amount and type of consideration
may vary from base to base. This amendment gives greater discretion and flexibility to the Military Departments to
negotiate with the LRA to arrive at an appropriate arrangement. Due to the circumstances of a particular site, the
base's value may be high or low, and the range of the estimated present fair market value may be broad or narrow. Where
there is value, the Department of Defense has an obligation under Title XXIX of the National Defense Authorization
Act for FY 1994 to obtain consideration within the estimated range of present fair market value, or to justify why such
consideration was not realized.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Taking into account all information provided in the EDC application and any additional information considered
relevant, the Military Department will contract for or prepare an estimate of the fair market value of the property,
which may be expressed as a range of values. The Military Department shall consult with the LRA on valuation assumptions,
guidelines and on instructions given to the person(s) making the estimation of value.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;As stated above, the EDC application must contain a statement that proposes general terms and conditions of
the conveyance, as well as the amount and type of the consideration, a payment schedule, and projected date of conveyance.
After reviewing the application, the Military Department has the discretion and flexibility to enter into one of
two types of agreements:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Consideration within the estimated range of present fair market value, as determined by the Secretary of the Military
Department. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Military Department can be flexible about the terms and conditions of payment, and can provide financing on the
property. The payment can be in cash or in-kind, and can be paid at time of transfer or at a time in the future. The Military
Departments will have the discretion and flexibility to enter into agreements that specify the form and amount of
consideration and ensures that consideration is within the estimated range of fair market value at the time of application.
Such methods of payment could include: participation in the gross or net cash flow, deferred payments, mortgages
or other financing arrangements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Consideration below the estimated range of fair market value, where proper justification is provided.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If a discount is found by the Secretary of the Military Department to be necessary to foster local economic redevelopment
and job creation, the amount of consideration can be below the estimated range of fair market value. Again, the terms
and conditions of payment will be negotiated between the Military Department and the LRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Justification
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Proper justification for a discount shall be based upon the findings in the business and development plan contained
in the EDC application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Development economics, including absorption schedules and legitimate infrastructure costs, would provide a basis
for such justification. The ability to pay at time of conveyance or to obtain financing would not be a proper justification,
since payment terms and conditions can be negotiated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;In negotiating the terms and conditions of consideration with the LRA, the Secretary of the Military Department
must determine that a fair and reasonable compensation to the Federal Government will be realized from the EDC. Where
property is transferred under an EDC at an amount less than the estimated range of fair market value, the Military Department
shall prepare a written explanation of why the consideration was less than the estimated range of present fair market
value.

Economic Development Conveyances
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Section 2903 of Public Law 103&hyph;160 gives the Secretary of Defense the authority to transfer property to local
redevelopment authorities for consideration in cash or in kind, with or without initial payment or with only partial
payment at time of transfer, at or below the estimated fair market value of the property. This authority creates an
additional tool for local communities to help spur economic opportunity through a new real property conveyance method
specifically designed for economic development, referred to as the ``Economic Development Conveyance'' (EDC).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The EDC should only be used when other Federal property disposal authorities for the intended land use cannot be
used to accomplish the necessary economic redevelopment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Before making an EDC, the Military Department must prepare an estimate of the present fair market value of the property,
which may be expressed as a range of values. The Military Department shall consult with the Local Redevelopment Authority
on valuation assumptions, guidelines and on instructions given to the person(s) making the estimation of value,
but shall be fully responsible for completion of the valuation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A Local Redevelopment Authority (LRA) is the only entity able to receive property under an Economic Development
Conveyance. An LRA should have broad-based membership, including, but not limited to representatives from those
jurisdictions with zoning authority over the property. The Secretary of Defense shall officially recognize an LRA
for planning and/or implementation through the Office of Economic Adjustment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) A properly completed application will be the basis for a decision on whether an LRA will be eligible for an Economic
Development Conveyance. An application should be submitted by the LRA after a Redevelopment Plan is adopted by the
LRA. The Secretary of the Military Departments shall establish a reasonable time period for submission of the EDC
application after consultation with the LRA. The Services will review the applications and make a decision whether
to make an EDC based on the criteria specified in paragraph (e)(7) of this section. The terms and conditions of the EDC
will be negotiated between the Military Departments and the LRA. Bases in rural areas shall be conveyed with no consideration
if they meet the standards in paragraph (f)(3) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The application should explain why an EDC is necessary for economic redevelopment and job creation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the elements in paragraph (e)(6) of this section, after Military Department review of the application,
additional information may be requested to allow for a better evaluation of the application. The application should
contain the following elements:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

, the Secretary of the Military Department will review the application for an EDC and negotiate the terms and conditions
of each transaction with the LRA. The Military Departments will have the discretion and flexibility to enter into
agreements that specify the form, amount, and payment schedule. The consideration may be at or below the estimated
fair market value, with or without initial payment, in cash or in-kind and paid over time. An EDC must be one of the two
following types of agreements:

(i) Consideration within the estimated range of present fair market value, as determined by the Secretary of the Military
Department. Payments must be made to ensure consideration is within the estimated range of fair market value at the
time of application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Consideration can be below the estimated range of fair market value, when proper justification is provided.
The amount of consideration can be below the estimated range of fair market value, if the Secretary of the Military
Department determines that a discount is necessary for economic redevelopment and job creation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The amount of consideration paid in the future shall equal the present value of the agreed-upon fair market value
or discounted fair market value. Additional provisions may be incorporated in the conveyance documents to protect
the Department's interest in obtaining the agreed upon consideration. Also, the standard GSA excess profits clause,
appropriately tailored to the transaction, will be used in the conveyance documents to the LRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) In a rural area, as defined by this rule, any EDC approved by the Secretary of the Military Department shall be made
without consideration when the base closure will have a substantial adverse impact on the economy of the communities
in the vicinity of the installation and on the prospect for their economic recovery. The Secretary of the Military
Department concerned will determine if these two conditions are met based on all the information considered in the
application for an Economic Development Conveyance. Specific attention will be placed on the business and development
plan submitted as part of the EDC application and the criteria listed in section 91.7(e)(8) will be used.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) In those instances in which an EDC is made for consideration below the range of the estimated present fair market
value of the property_or if the estimated fair market value is expressed as a range of values, below the lowest value
in that range_the Military Department shall prepare a written explanation why the estimated fair market value was
not obtained. Additionally, the Military Departments must prepare a written statement explaining why other Federal
property transfer authorities could not be used to generate economic redevelopment and job creation.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Due to an adverse comment, EPA is removing the approval of a marginal nonattainment area state implementation plan
(SIP) revision for Memphis/Shelby County, Tennessee, submitted by the State of Tennessee for the purpose of bringing
about attainment of the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for ozone. The original action was published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
on August 4, 1994, as a direct final rule. 59 FR 39692. As stated in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
document, if adverse or critical comments were received by September 6, 1994, the effective date would be delayed
and timely notice would be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
. Therefore, due to receiving an adverse comment within the comment period, EPA is removing amendments relating to
the SIP revision for Memphis/Shelby County, TN, in the final rule and will address all public comments received in
a subsequent final rule based on the proposed rule also published on August 4, 1994. 59 FR 39715. EPA will not institute
a second comment period on this document.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is publishing a notice and request for data regarding issues concerning
the Clean Water Act section 311 (as amended by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990) requirements for facility response plan
preparation as applied to non-transportation-related, onshore facilities that handle, store, or transport animal
fats and vegetable oils. This notice is, in part, in response to a Petition for reconsideration of EPA's final facility
response plan rule (Final Rule), (59 FR 34070, July 1, 1994), submitted to EPA by seven agricultural organizations.
The Petition asserts that EPA does not adequately treat these oils differently from petroleum and toxic non-petroleum
oils in the Final Rule. In support of their Petition, these organizations rely on studies that draw several conclusions
concerning the physical, toxicological, and chemical properties of animal fats and vegetable oils compared with
other types of oil. This notice summarizes the Petition, and asks for data and comment to assist EPA in determining
whether and how the differences in properties of various oils warrant further different treatment, including possibly
creating separate facility response plan regulatory regimes for these oils beyond the regime established in the
July 1, 1994 Final Rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 1, 1994, EPA published its Final Rule amending the Oil Pollution Prevention regulation (40 CFR part 112) to
incorporate new requirements to implement section 4202(a)(6) of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA), amending section
311(j)(5) of the Clean Water Act (CWA). (See 33 U.S.C. 1321(j)(5).) (Oil Pollution Prevention; Non-Transportation-Related
Onshore Facilities; Final Rule, 59 FR 34070, July 1, 1994.) The Final Rule directs certain facility owners and operators
to prepare plans for responding to a worst case discharge of oil, and to a substantial threat of such a discharge. Under
authority of section 311(j)(1)(C) of the CWA, the Final Rule requires planning for a small and medium discharge of
oil, as appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 4202(a)(6) of the OPA, these planning requirements apply to owners and operators of all offshore facilities
and any onshore facility that, ``because of its location, could reasonably be expected to cause substantial harm
to the environment by discharging into or on the navigable waters, adjoining shorelines, or the exclusive economic
zone.'' OPA directs owners and operators of these facilities to prepare a plan for responding ``to the maximum extent
practicable, to a worst case discharge, and to a substantial threat of such a discharge of oil or a hazardous substance.''
The July 1, 1994, Final Rule establishes requirements for plans for responding to discharges of oil from certain onshore
facilities within EPA's jurisdiction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA published the proposed facility response plan rule on February 17, 1993 (58 FR 8824). One of the issues on which
the Agency received comment was whether EPA should establish separate response plan requirements and selection
criteria for owners or operators of facilities that handle, store, or transport non-petroleum oils. Among other
things, some commenters argued that fundamental chemical and physical differences between petroleum and non-petroleum
oils indicate the necessity for different response techniques and equipment. At least two comments on the proposed
rule asserted that lack of toxicity was a property distinguishing some non-petroleum oils both from petroleum and
other non-petroleum oils. (See letters commenting on the February 17, 1993, proposed rule from the National Renderers
Association [SPCC&hyph;2P&hyph;2&hyph;1248]; and on behalf of the American Soybean Association, the Corn Refiners
Association, the National Corn Growers Association, the Institute of Shortening &amp; Edible Oils, the National
Cotton Council, the National Cottonseed Products Association, and the National Oilseed Processors Association,
[SPCC&hyph;2P&hyph;2&hyph;L34].) The letter on behalf of the seven agricultural organizations [SPCC&hyph;2P&hyph;2&hyph;L34]
asked EPA to ``provide for a different approach to response and removal methodologies for these substances than that
required for petroleum oil.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's Final Rule for non-transportation-related facility response plans provides a strategy for petroleum oils
and non-petroleum oils that gives a considerably greater degree of flexibility to owners and operators of non-petroleum
oil facilities than to owners and operators of petroleum oil facilities in designing their plans. The Petitioners
contend that EPA should avoid treating the category animal fats and vegetable oils with the category toxic, non-petroleum
oils. EPA addressed the likely differences in responding to petroleum oil as opposed to non-petroleum oil, and created
an approach that allows owners or operators of facilities that handle, store, or transport non-petroleum oils flexibility
to determine appropriate response equipment levels within the framework established by the regulation (See Section
7.7 of Appendix E to 40 CFR part 112). The Agency provided further flexibility by allowing the Regional Administrators
(RA) to assess the adequacy of response plans including those for non-petroleum facilities, recognizing the greater
knowledge RAs have about facilities and geographic-specific environmental areas within their Regions.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA's approach for the identification of response resources for non-petroleum oil facilities is adapted from, and
consistent with, the U.S. Coast Guard's (USCG) interim final rule establishing response plan requirements under
the OPA for owners and operators of marine-transportation-related, non-petroleum oil facilities. (See 33 CFR part
154. The docket includes a chart comparing USCG plan resource requirements for petroleum and non-petroleum oil facilities,
and referencing the applicable sections of the USCG facility response plan rule.) As with the USCG Interim Final Rule,
the EPA approach gives these facility owners and operators substantial latitude in calculating required response
resources for their non-petroleum facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To calculate resources for non-petroleum oil facilities, an owner or operator is not limited to using emulsification
or evaporation factors in Appendix E (the Equipment Appendix) of the Final Rule, as required for petroleum oil facilities.
Rather, these owners and operators must: (1) show procedures and strategies for responding to the maximum extent
practicable to a worst case discharge; (2) show sources of equipment and supplies necessary to locate, recover, and
mitigate discharges; (3) demonstrate that the equipment identified in the plan will work under the conditions and
in the areas that the plan covers, and reach the area within required times; and (4) ensure the availability of required
resources by contract or other approved means. EPA does not prescribe the type and amount of equipment that response
plans for non-petroleum oil discharges must identify (See Section 7.7 of Appendix E to 40 CFR part 112). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's Final Rule is consistent with the CWA section 311(j)(5) (as amended by section 4202(a) of the OPA), which requires
facility response plans to ``remove to the maximum extent practicable'' a worst case discharge of oil or a hazardous
substance. In many responses to discharges of oil, response personnel may need to employ containment boom, skimmers,
or other equipment to contain oil and remove oil from water. Responders also may employ other strategies appropriate
for the area. These strategies apply to all oils and do not distinguish among types of oil (i.e., petroleum and non-petroleum
or toxic and non-toxic oils). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As EPA stated in the Final Rule (59 FR 34088), when results from research on such factors as emulsification or evaporation
of non-petroleum oil are available, the Agency may change the rule regarding the type of response resources for which
an owner or operator of a non-petroleum oil facility must plan.

II. The Organizations' Petition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By a letter dated August 12, 1994, EPA received a ``Petition for Reconsideration and Stay of Effective Date'' of the
OPA-mandated facility response plan Final Rule as that rule applies to facilities that handle, store, or transport
animal fat or vegetable oils. The Petition was submitted on behalf of seven agricultural organizations (``the Organizations''
or ``Petitioners''): the American Soybean Association, the Corn Refiners Association, the National Corn Growers
Association, the Institute of Shortening &amp; Edible Oils, the National Cotton Council, the National Cottonseed
Products Association, and the National Oilseed Processors Association. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To support their Petition, the Organizations reference an industry-sponsored study titled ``Environmental Effects
of Release of Animal Fats and Vegetable Oils to Waterways'' (prepared by ENVIRON Corporation, June 28, 1993) and an
associated study titled ``Diesel Fuel, Beef Tallow, RBD Soybean Oil and Crude Soybean Oil: Acute Effects on the Fathead
Minnow, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pimephales Promelas''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (prepared by Aqua Survey, Inc., May 21, 1993). Both of these studies had been submitted to EPA during the facility response
plan rulemaking as enclosures to a comment filed over nine months after the close of the comment period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ENVIRON study concludes that ``animal fats and vegetable oils are significantly different from petroleum oils
in their effects on the aquatic environment and so merit separate treatment in environmental regulations.'' Among
other things, ENVIRON concludes that ``animal fat and vegetable oils are orders of magnitude less toxic than petroleum
oils to aquatic life;'' that ``there are no accumulating or otherwise harmful components in animal fats and vegetable
oils that are irritating, toxic or carcinogenic;'' and that ``animal fats and vegetable oils are easily biodegraded
by bacteria using them as food.'' The study also concludes that these oils can coat aquatic biota and foul wildlife,
causing hypothermia when fur or feathers mat; and that these oils have a high ``Biological Oxygen Demand'' (or BOD),
which may result in oxygen deprivation where there is a large spill in a confined body of water with a low flow and low
dilution rate. The ENVIRON study's ultimate conclusion is that animal fats and vegetable oils are sufficiently different
from petroleum oils and other hazardous materials that they merit separate treatment in environmental regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Aqua Survey, Inc. study presents the results of Aqua Survey's tests of the acute toxicity of the test substances
on the Fathead minnow at five concentrations of each test substance. Based on the study results, the Organizations
assert that animal fats and vegetable oils_unlike petroleum-based oil and toxic non-petroleum oils_``are non-toxic,
readily biodegradable, not persistent in the environment, and, in fact, are essential components of human and wildlife
diet.''

Based, in part, on these studies, the Petitioners ask EPA to create a regulatory regime for response planning for non-petroleum,
``non-toxic'' oils separate from the regime established for petroleum oils and ``toxic,'' non-petroleum oils.
The Petitioners further submitted, as an Appendix to their Petition, specific suggested language to amend the July
1, 1994, facility response plan rule to allow mechanical dispersal and ``no action'' options for responding to a spill
of animal fats and vegetable oils.

III. Addressing Issues Presented in the ENVIRON and Aqua Survey Studies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA acknowledged in the Final Rule that response strategies for petroleum and non-petroleum oils may differ (59 FR
34088). However, because the Agency was aware of little data to support developing a separate regulatory regime for
non-petroleum oils and because the OPA calls for resources to remove ``oil'' (broadly defined in section 311 of the
Clean Water Act), the Agency adopted the regime described in the Final Rule (see 59 FR 3470 at 34087, 34088) and summarized
above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) took issue with many statements in the ENVIRON Report in a letter to the Research
and Special Projects Administration (U.S. Department of Transportation). (See Letter from Michael J. Spear, Assistant
Director, Ecological Services, FWS to Ms. Ana Sol Gutierrez, Research and Special Projects Administration, U.S.
Department of Transportation, April 11, 1994.) The FWS expressed concern with ENVIRON statements suggesting that
edible oils and fats pose no real risk to fish and wildlife. FWS states that although petroleum oils may pose greater
risks than vegetable oils for acute toxicity to fish and wildlife from ingestion and inhalation of petroleum oil's
hydrocarbon component, both types of oil pose chronic effects from the fouling of coats and plumage in wildlife, which
often leads to death. FWS also stated that in some circumstances, edible oils can persist in the environment for extended
periods of time, forming mat and encrustation similar to petroleum products, potentially causing chronic adverse
effects to fish. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NOAA also has evaluated the effects on the environment of spilled non-petroleum oils, including coconut, corn, cottonseed,
fish, and palm oils. (See a Memorandum for the Record, date June 3, 1993, from NOAA Hazardous Materials Response and
Assessment Division.) The NOAA assessment, based on literature research, addresses physical and chemical properties
and toxicity of these and other oils, and indicates that some edible oils, when spilled, may have adverse environmental
effects. Some of these effects seem to contradict conclusions in the ENVIRON study. According to NOAA, coconut and
palm oils are very viscous; in most coastal waters, these oils probably would persist for over a decade. By contrast,
ENVIRON concluded that animal fats and vegetable oils ``are easily biodegraded by bacteria,'' and that the physical
impacts of non-recoverable animal fats and vegetable oils ``would be of limited duration.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tri-State Bird Rescue and Research (TSBR) made a statement on the ENVIRON study in response to a request for comment
from the Department of the Interior. (TSBR provides contingency planning, training workshops, and emergency response
for wildlife affected by oil spills.) A summary of the TSBR statement was published in its ``Wildlife &amp; Oil Spills.''
(See Vol. 4, No. 1-Winter/Spring 1994.) In the summary, TSBR makes the following observation: ``While edible oils
do not contain the toxic components of many of the polyaromatic hydrocarbons, they do have many of the same physical
properties as petroleum oils; the animals and birds will suffer the same physical effects from edible oils as they
would from contamination with petroleum products.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Among the studies reviewed by USCG (for the USCG rule referenced above) attesting to the harmful effects of non-petroleum
oils in the environment is an International Maritime Organization (IMO) study titled ``Harmful Effects on Birds
of Floating Lipophilic Substances Discharged from Ships.'' The IMO study underscores ENVIRON's findings of the
physical hazards associated with non-petroleum oil.

IV. Request for Public Comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In view of the differing scientific conclusions reached by the Petitioners, the FWS, and other groups and agencies,
EPA requests broader public comment on issues raised by the Petitioners. These include whether to have different
specific response approaches for releases of animal fats and vegetable oils (rather than increased flexibility),
and the effects on the environment of releases of these oils. EPA also asks for information regarding the following
specific questions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
What data are there on both the probability that spilled animal fats and vegetable oils will persist in the environment,
and the physical effects of these substances on wildlife and aquatic biota? To what extent do environmental factors
such as water temperature affect the physical characteristics of animal fats and vegetable oils and the strategies
for cleaning up the oil?

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Both the ENVIRON and Aqua Survey Inc. studies imply that there is some level or concentration at which animal fats and
vegetable oils are hazardous to wildlife when ingested. Are there additional further studies, scientific papers,
or other data that bear on the issue? Are there data showing at what concentrations animal fat, vegetable oil, and other
non-toxic oils have adverse effects on animals that ingest such oils? How critical is the matter of an oil's toxicity
in determining what kind of equipment resources and strategies responders should use in containment and recovery?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency also requests comment on whether there are data to demonstrate that the response approach set out in the
rule for non-petroleum oils is either unnecessary or harmful. Does spill size or location affect whether a response
can be more harmful than leaving the oil in the environment? If so, how and to what degree? Are there circumstances where
response techniques like containing and removing a discharge of animal fats and vegetable oils are more harmful than
dispersing these oils through use of chemical or mechanical dispersants? Are there effective, available, and authorized
chemical dispersants that responders can use for discharged animal fats and vegetable oils? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Are there data on emulsification and evaporation factors for non-petroleum oils that EPA can use to determine whether
to revise the facility response plan rule for facilities that handle, store, or transport non-petroleum oils, including
animal fats and vegetable oils? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Is there research in-progress or planned research on the issues raised in this notice?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After review and evaluation of the public comments on this notice, EPA will decide whether data support creating a
new facility response plan regulatory regime for facilities that handle, store, or transport non-petroleum oils
which Petitioners assert are non-toxic. EPA's determination may take the form of no further action, guidance, or
some other regulatory action.

 In the

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of July 27, 1994 (59 FR 38151), EPA issued a proposed rule that gave notice that the Y-Tex Corp., P.O. Box 1450, 1825 Big
Horn Ave., Cody, WY 82414, had requested that the Administrator, pursuant to section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a(e), propose to amend 40 CFR 180.1001(e) by establishing an exemption from
the requirement of a tolerance for acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer, FD &amp; C Yelow No. 6 aluminum lake, 2-(2'-hydroxy-5'-methylphenyl)benzotriazole
and octadecyl 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamate when used as components of ear tags and similar slow-release
devices in pesticide formulations applied to animals. The proposal was a reissuance of the original proposal that
appeared in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of February 3, 1989 (54 FR 5502), and responded to a comment by including a revised calculation of lifetime risk from
exposure to monomeric acrylonitrile. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Inert ingredients are all ingredients that are not active ingredients as defined in 40 CFR 153.125, and include, but
are not limited to, the following types of ingredients (except when they have a pesticidal efficacy of their own):
solvents such as alcohols and hydrocarbons; surfactants such as polyoxyethylene polymers and fatty acids; carriers
such as clay and diatomaceous earth; thickeners such as carrageenan and modified cellulose; wetting, spreading,
and dispersing agents; propellants in aerosol dispensers; microencapsulating agents; and emulsifiers. The term
``inert'' is not intended to imply nontoxicity; the ingredient may or may not be chemically active. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data submitted on the proposal and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed rule.
Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the tolerance exemption will protect the
public health. Therefore, the tolerance exemption is established as set forth below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 of October 20, 1988 (53 FR 41238), which announced that Rhone-Poulenc Ag Co., P.O. Box 12014, 2 T.W. Alexander Drive,
Research Triangle Park, NC 27709, had submitted a pesticide tolerance petition (PP 8F3689), and a food/feed additive
petition (FAP 8H5567) to EPA requesting that the Administrator, pursuant to sections 408(d) and 409 of the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a(d), establish a tolerance for the fungicide fosetyl-Al, aluminum
tris(O-ethylphosphonate), in or on pome fruit at 10 ppm and pome fruit juice and pome fruit pomace (wet and dry) at 12
ppm, respectively. Subsequently, the Agency reviewed an apple-processing study and concluded that section 409
tolerances for pome fruit juice and pome fruit pomace were unnecessary, and the food/feed additive petition was withdrawn.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of November 2, 1983 (48 FR 50532), carcinogenic effects were noted in the rat chronic feeding/carcinogenicity study.
In this study, Charles River CD rats were dosed with aluminum tris(O-ethylphosphonate) at levels of 0, 2,000, 8,000,
and 40,000/30,000 ppm (0, 100, 400, and 2,000/1,500 mg/kg bwt/day). The 40,000 ppm dose was reduced to 30,000 ppm after
2 weeks following observations of staining of the abdominal fur and red coloration of the urine at 40,000 ppm (2,000
mg/kg bwt/day).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The highest dose level of the chemical tested in the male Charles River CD-1 rats (2,000/1,500 mg/kg bwt/day) in this
study appears to approximate a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) based on the finding of urinary bladder hyperplasia at
this dose. Similarly, an MTD level appeared to be satisfied in the female Charles River CD-1 rats at the high-dose level
of 2,000 mg/kg bwt/day, during the first 2 weeks of the carcinogenicity/chronic feeding study, before the dose level
was reduced to 1,500 mg/kg bwt/day.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The study demonstrated a significantly elevated incidence of urinary bladder tumors (adenomas and carcinomas combined)
at the highest dose level tested (2,000/1,500 mg/kg) in male Charles River CD-1 rats. The tumors were mainly seen in
surviving males at the time of terminal sacrifice. The original pathological diagnosis of these tumors was independently
confirmed by another consulting pathologist, who also reported an elevated incidence of urinary bladder hyperplasia
in high-dose male rats. No increase in the incidence of urinary bladder tumors was observed in female rats.

In 1986, the Health Effects Division Peer Review Committee for Carcinogenicity of the Office of Pesticide Programs
concluded that the available data provided limited evidence of the carcinogenicity of fosetyl-Al in male rats and
classified the pesticide as a Category C carcinogen (possible human carcinogen with limited evidence of carcinogenicity
in animals) in accordance with proposed Agency guidelines, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of November 23, 1984 (49 FR 46294). The Health Effects Division Peer Review Committee for Carcinogenicity determined
that a quantitative risk assessment was not appropriate for the following reasons:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The carcinogenic response observed with this chemical was confined solely to the high-dose males at one site (urinary
bladder) in rats.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The tumor response was primarily due to an increase in benign tumors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The tumors were seen only in surviving animals at the time of terminal sacrifice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The carcinogenic effects were observed only at unusually high doses which exceed the commonly used limit dose of
1,000 mg/kg/day recommended as an upper-limiting dose for bioassays.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The chemical was not carcinogenic when administered in the diet to Charles River CD-1 mice at dose levels ranging
from 2,500 to 30,000 ppm (357 to 4,286 mg/kg bwt/day).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Fosetyl-Al was not mutagenic in eight well conducted genotoxic assays.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1993, the Health Effects Division Peer Review Committee (PRC) for Carcinogenicity revisited the carcinogenicity
classification of fosetyl-Al due to a recent 90-day feeding study of fosetyl-Al in rats which showed a strong association
between the presence of uroliths in the urinary bladder and the incidence of urinary bladder tumors in treated rats.
The PRC concluded that fosetyl-Al is not amenable to classification using the current Agency cancer guidelines.
Based on a mechanistic evaluation of the only tumors seen, those that occurred at exceptionally high doses in the bladder
of male rats, it appears that humans are not likely to be exposed to doses of fosetyl-Al that produce the urinary tract
toxicity that precedes and seems to lead to the tumor response in rats. In particular, anticipated human dietary and
occupational exposures to fosetyl-Al are far below the NOEL in rats for the apparent urinary tract tumor precursors
(stone formation and attendant epithelial irritation). These effects are produced in rats at extremely high doses,
under conditions not anticipated to occur outside of the experimental laboratory. The PRC concludes that pesticidal
use of fosetyl-Al is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic hazard to humans. Therefore, the standard risk assessment approach
of using the Reference Dose (RfD) based on systemic toxicity was applied to fosetyl-Al.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Using a 100-fold safety factor and the NOEL of 250 mg/kg bwt/day determined by the most sensitive species from the 2-year
dog feeding study, the RfD is 3.0 mg/kg bwt/day. The theoretical maximum residue contribution (TMRC) from the established
and proposed tolerances is 0.058818 mg/kg bwt/day and utilizes 2 percent of the RfD for the overall U. S. population.
For exposure of the most highly exposed subgroup in the population, nonnursing infants, the TMRC is 0.130051 mg/kg
bwt/day and utilizes 4 percent of the RfD. Previous tolerances have been established for fosetyl-Al, aluminum tris(O-ethylphosphonate),
in asparagus, avocadoes, brassica vegetable crop group, caneberries, citrus, cucurbit vegetables group, dried
hops, dry bulb onions, fresh ginseng root, leafy vegetables crop group, pineapples, pineapple forage and fodder,
and strawberries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The metabolism of aluminum tris(O-ethylphosphonate) in plants is adequately understood. There is no reasonable
expectation of secondary residues occurring in milk, eggs, and meat of livestock or poultry as a result of this use
on pome fruit. Based on an apple-processing study, a concentration of fosetyl-Al into process fractions did not occur
and food/feed additive tolerances are not needed in conjunction with these uses on pome fruit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An adequate analytical method, gas-liquid chromatography, is available for enforcement purposes. Because of the
long lead time from establishing these tolerances to publication of the enforcement methodology in the Pesticide
Analytical Manual, Vol. II, the analytical methodology is being made available in the interim to anyone interested
in pesticide enforcement when requested from: Calvin Furlow, Public Information Branch, Field Operations Division
(7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office
location and telephone number: Rm. 242, CM #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Hwy., Arlington, VA 22202, (703-305-4432).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The pesticide is considered useful for the purposes for which the tolerances are sought. Based on the information
and data considered, the Agency concludes that the establishment of the tolerances will protect the public health.
Therefore, the tolerances are established as set forth below.

, file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fees provided by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, and the requestor's contentions on each such issue, and a summary of the evidence relied upon by the objection
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: there is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve on or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).

Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the

 of November 2, 1983 (48 FR 50532), carcinogenic effects were noted in the rat chronic feeding/carcinogenicity study.
In this study, Charles River CD rats were dosed with aluminum tris(

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
O
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-ethylphosphonate) at levels of 0, 2,000, 8,000, and 40,000/30,000 ppm (0, 100, 400, and 2,000/1,500 mg/kg bwt/day).
The 40,000 ppm dose was reduced to 30,000 ppm after 2 weeks following observations of staining of the abdominal fur
and red coloration of the urine at 40,000 ppm (2,000 mg/kg bwt/day).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The highest dose level of the chemical tested in the male Charles River CD-1 rats (2,000/1,500 mg/kg bwt/day) in this
study appears to approximate a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) based on the finding of urinary bladder hyperplasia at
this dose. Similarly, an MTD level appeared to be satisfied in the female Charles River CD-1 rats at the high-dose level
of 2,000 mg/kg bwt/day, during the first 2 weeks of the carcinogenicity/chronic feeding study, before the dose level
was reduced to 1,500 mg/kg bwt/day.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The study demonstrated a significantly elevated incidence of urinary bladder tumors (adenomas and carcinomas combined)
at the highest dose level tested (2,000/1,500 mg/kg) in male Charles River CD-1 rats. The tumors were mainly seen in
surviving males at the time of terminal sacrifice. The original pathological diagnosis of these tumors was independently
confirmed by another consulting pathologist, who also reported an elevated incidence of urinary bladder hyperplasia
in high-dose male rats. No increase in the incidence of urinary bladder tumors was observed in female rats.

In 1986, the Health Effects Division Peer Review Committee for Carcinogenicity of the Office of Pesticide Programs
concluded that the available data provided limited evidence of the carcinogenicity of fosetyl-Al in male rats and
classified the pesticide as a Category C carcinogen (possible human carcinogen with limited evidence of carcinogenicity
in animals) in accordance with proposed Agency guidelines, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of November 23, 1984 (49 FR 46294). The Health Effects Division Peer Review Committee for Carcinogenicity determined
that a quantitative risk assessment was not appropriate for the following reasons:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The carcinogenic response observed with this chemical was confined solely to the high-dose males at one site (urinary
bladder) in rats.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The tumor response was primarily due to an increase in benign tumors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The tumors were seen only in surviving animals at the time of terminal sacrifice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The carcinogenic effects were observed only at unusually high doses which exceed the commonly used limit dose of
1,000 mg/kg/day recommended as an upper-limiting dose for bioassays.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The chemical was not carcinogenic when administered in the diet to Charles River CD-1 mice at dose levels ranging
from 2,500 to 30,000 ppm (357 to 4,286 mg/kg bwt/day).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Fosetyl-Al was not mutagenic in eight well conducted genotoxic assays.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1993, the Health Effects Division Peer Review Committee (PRC) for Carcinogenicity revisited the carcinogenicity
classification of fosetyl-Al due to a recent 90-day feeding study of fosetyl-Al in rats which showed a strong association
between the presence of uroliths in the urinary bladder and the incidence of urinary bladder tumors in treated rats.
The PRC concluded that fosetyl-Al is not amenable to classification using the current Agency cancer guidelines.
Based on a mechanistic evaluation of the only tumors seen, those that occurred at exceptionally high doses in the bladder
of male rats, it appears that humans are not likely to be exposed to doses of fosetyl-Al that produce the urinary tract
toxicity that precedes and seems to lead to the tumor response in rats. In particular, anticipated human dietary and
occupational exposures to fosetyl-Al are far below the NOEL in rats for the apparent urinary tract tumor precursors
(stone formation and attendant epithelial irritation). These effects are produced in rats at extremely high doses,
under conditions not anticipated to occur outside of the experimental laboratory. The PRC concludes that pesticidal
use of fosetyl-Al is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic hazard to humans. Therefore, the standard risk assessment approach
of using the Reference Dose (RfD) based on systemic toxicity was applied to fosetyl-Al.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Using a 100-fold safety factor and the NOEL of 250 mg/kg bwt/day determined by the most sensitive species from the 2-year
dog feeding study, the RfD is 3.0 mg/kg bwt/day. The theoretical maximum residue contribution (TMRC) from the established
and proposed tolerances is 0.058818 mg/kg bwt/day and utilizes 2 percent of the RfD for the overall U. S. population.
For exposure of the most highly exposed subgroup in the population, nonnursing infants, the TMRC is 0.130051 mg/kg
bwt/day and utilizes 4 percent of the RfD. Previous tolerances have been established for fosetyl-Al, aluminum tris(

-ethylphosphonate), in asparagus, avocadoes, brassica vegetable crop group, caneberries, citrus, cucurbit vegetables
group, dried hops, dry bulb onions, fresh ginseng root, leafy vegetables crop group, pineapples, pineapple forage
and fodder, and strawberries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The metabolism of aluminum tris(O-ethylphosphonate) in plants is adequately understood. There is no reasonable
expectation of secondary residues occurring in milk, eggs, and meat of livestock or poultry as a result of this use
on tomatoes. Based on a tomato-processing study, concentration of fosetyl-Al into process fractions did not occur
and food/feed additive tolerances are not needed in conjunction with this use on tomatoes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An adequate analytical method, gas-liquid chromatography, is available for enforcement purposes. Because of the
long lead time from establishing these tolerances to publication of the enforcement methodology in the Pesticide
Analytical Manual, Vol. II, the analytical methodology is being made available in the interim to anyone interested
in pesticide enforcement when requested from: Calvin Furlow, Public Information Branch, Field Operations Division
(7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office
location and telephone number: Rm. 242, CM #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Hwy., Arlington, VA 22202, (703)-305-4432.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The pesticide is considered useful for the purposes for which the tolerances are sought. Based on the information
and data considered, the Agency concludes that the establishment of the tolerances will protect the public health.
Therefore, the tolerances are established as set forth below.

A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fees provided by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, and the requestor's contentions on each such issue, and a summary of the evidence relied upon by the objection
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve on or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).

Inert ingredients are all ingredients that are not active ingredients as defined in 40 CFR 153.125, and include, but
are not limited to, the following types of ingredients (except when they have a pesticidal efficacy of their own):
solvents such as alcohols and hydrocarbons; surfactants such as polyoxyethylene polymers and fatty acids; carriers
such as clay and diatomaceous earth; thickeners such as carrageenan and modified cellulose; wetting, spreading,
and dispersing agents; propellants in aerosol dispensers; microencapsulating agents; and emulsifiers. The term
``inert'' is not intended to imply nontoxicity; the ingredient may or may not be chemically active. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data submitted relevant to the proposal and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed
rule. Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the tolerance exemption will protect
the public health. Therefore, the tolerance exemption is established as set forth below.

 file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document modifies the uses and categories of exemptions included in the recent regulation establishing an exemption
from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of methyl vinyl ether-maleic acid copolymer (CAS Reg. No. 25153-40-6)
and methyl vinyl ether-maleic acid copolymer calcium sodium salt (CAS Reg. No. 62386-95-2) in order to correctly
list the exemptions and uses for these polymers. EPA is establishing exemptions from the requirement of a tolerance
for residues of these polymers when used as inert ingredients (dispersants, seed-coating adhesives) in pesticide
formulations applied to growing crops and raw agricultural commodities after harvest. International Specialty
Products requested this regulation.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of August 24, 1994 (59 FR 43526), EPA issued a proposed rule that gave notice that International Specialty Products
(ISP), 1361 Alps Rd., Wayne, NJ 07470, had submitted petitions (PPs 3E4260 and 3E4261) to EPA requesting that the Administrator,
pursuant to section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) (21 U.S.C. 346a(e)), propose to amend
40 CFR 180.1001(c) and (e) by establishing an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of methyl
vinyl ether-maleic acid copolymer (CAS Reg No. 25153-40-6) and methyl vinyl ether-maleic acid copolymer calcium
sodium salt (CAS Reg. No. 62386-95-2) when used as inert ingredients (dispersants, seed-coating adhesives) in pesticide
formulations applied to growing crops, raw agricultural commodities after harvest, or animals. For simplicity,
the exemption from tolerance under 40 CFR 180.1001(c) was requested for the seed-coating adhesive use, which is only
applicable to growing crops, as well as the dispersant use, which could include post-harvest uses. The exemption
from tolerance under 40 CFR 180.1001(e) would apply to the use of the inerts as dispersants in formulations applied
to animals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Inert ingredients are all ingredients that are not active ingredients as defined in 40 CFR 153.125, and include, but
are not limited to, the following types of ingredients (except when they have a pesticidal efficacy of their own):
solvents such as alcohols and hydrocarbons; surfactants such as polyoxyethylene polymers and fatty acids; carriers
such as clay and diatomaceous earth; thickeners such as carrageenan and modified cellulose; wetting, spreading,
and dispersing agents; propellants in aerosol dispensers; microencapsulating agents; and emulsifiers. The term
``inert'' is not intended to imply nontoxicity; the ingredient may or may not be chemically active. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data submitted relevant to the proposal and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed
rule. Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the tolerance exemptions will protect
the public health. Therefore, the tolerance exemptions are established as set forth below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Florida has applied for final authorization of revisions to its hazardous waste program under the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act (RCRA). Florida's revisions consist of the provisions contained in the rules promulgated between
July 1, 1987, and June 30, 1990, otherwise known as HSWA Cluster II. These requirements are listed in Section B of this
notice. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reviewed Florida's application and has made a decision, subject
to public review and comment, that the Florida hazardous waste program revisions satisfy all of the requirements
necessary to qualify for final authorization. Thus, EPA intends to approve Florida's hazardous waste program revisions.
Florida's application for program revisions is available for public review and comment.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
States with final authorization under Section 3006(b) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (``RCRA'' or ``the Act''), 42 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S.C. 6926(b), have a continuing obligation to maintain a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazardous waste program that is equivalent to, consistent with, and no less stringent than the Federal hazardous
waste program. In addition, as an interim measure, the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (Public Law 98&hyph;616,
November 8, 1984, hereinafter ``HSWA'') allows States to revise their programs to become substantially equivalent
instead of equivalent to RCRA requirements promulgated under HSWA authority. States exercising the latter option
receive ``interim authorization'' for the HSWA requirements under Section 3006(g) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926(g), and
later apply for final authorization for the HSWA requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revisions to State hazardous waste programs are necessary when Federal or State statutory or regulatory authority
is modified or when certain other changes occur. Most commonly, State program revisions are necessitated by changes
to EPA's regulations in 40 CFR Parts 260&hyph;268 and 124 and 270. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
B. Florida 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Florida initially received final authorization for its base RCRA program effective on February 12, 1985, (50 FR 3908,
January 29, 1985). Florida received authorization for revisions to its program on April 6, 1992, for Non-HSWA III,
IV, and V, and on January 10, 1994 for HSWA I without Corrective Action. Today, Florida is seeking approval of its program
revisions in accordance with 40 CFR 271.21(b)(3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has reviewed Florida's application and has made an immediate final decision that Florida's hazardous waste program
revisions satisfy all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Consequently, EPA intends
to grant final authorization for the additional program modifications to Florida. The public may submit written
comments on EPA's immediate final decision up until November 25, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copies of Florida's application for these program revisions are available for inspection and copying at the locations
indicated in the Addresses
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 section of this notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approval of Florida's program revisions shall become effective December 27, 1994, unless an adverse comment pertaining
to the State's revisions discussed in this notice is received by the end of the comment period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If an adverse comment is received EPA will publish either (1) a withdrawal of the immediate final decision or (2) a notice
containing a response to comments which either affirms that the immediate final decision takes effect or reverses
the decision.

C. Decision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
I conclude that Florida's application for these program revisions meets all of the statutory and regulatory requirements
established by RCRA. Accordingly, Florida is granted final authorization to operate its hazardous waste program
as revised.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Florida now has responsibility for permitting treatment, storage, and disposal facilities within its borders and
carrying out other aspects of the RCRA program, subject to the limitations of its program revision application, its
previously approved authorities and where otherwise noted in this Notice. Florida also has primary enforcement
responsibilities, although EPA retains the right to conduct inspections under section 3007 of RCRA and to take enforcement
actions under sections 3008, 3013, and 7003 of RCRA.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this authorization will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This authorization effectively suspends the applicability
of certain Federal regulations in favor of Florida's program, thereby eliminating duplicative requirements for
handlers of hazardous waste in the State. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This rule, therefore,
does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard is amending the rules that require a radar-observer endorsement. The amended rules will require radar-training
for licensed masters, mates, and operators of radar-equipped uninspected towing vessels 8 meters (approximately
26 feet) or more in length, either toward an endorsement or, in the short run, toward a certificate. The amended rules
are necessary to ensure that vessels equipped with radar are manned by mariners with the skills and knowledge to operate
them.

Regulatory Information

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is being published as an interim rule and will be effective on November 25, 1994. The Coast Guard has determined
that it would be contrary to the public interest to delay publication of this rule, which applies current statutory
law [46 U.S.C. 2103, 7101, and 8904(a)], establishes an overdue regulatory requirement at a minimal cost, and shows
great potential for improving public safety. For these good reasons, the Coast Guard finds under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B)
that no public notice is necessary.

Background and Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The derailment of the Amtrak Sunset Limited, a passenger train, on September 22, 1993, with extensive injury and loss
of life, resulted in a study entitled 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Review of Marine Safety Issues Related to Uninspected Towing Vessels.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This study, based on an investigation conducted jointly by the Offices of Navigation Safety and Waterway Services
(G&hyph;N) and of Marine Safety, Security, and Environmental Protection (G&hyph;M), provided the Commandant of
the Coast Guard with a number of recommendations to enhance safety in the towing industry. One of these recommendations
called for a regulatory project to amend 46 CFR parts 10 and 15 to require radar-observer training and endorsements
for operators of radar-equipped towing vessels more than 8 meters (approximately 26 feet) in length. The Commandant
concurred, and directed the Merchant Vessel Personnel Division (G&hyph;MVP) to initiate the project.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Discussion of Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This interim rule amends the current rules in two basic ways. First, it adds to 46 CFR part 15 language that extends the
requirement of a radar-observer endorsement to licensed operators of radar-equipped towboats 8 meters (approximately
26 feet) or more in length. Second, it adds to part 10 two courses: A Radar-Observer (Rivers) course and a Radar-Operation
course, the latter temporary. Because operators with unlimited and inland-waters endorsements may navigate on
rivers, the Coast Guard also found it necessary to add rivers-related topics to the list of subjects for the courses
encompassing broader routes. (``River'' means any river, canal, or similar body of water designated by the Officer
in Charge, Marine Inspection; ``Inland Waters'' means the navigable waters of the United States shoreward of the
Boundary Lines as described by 46 CFR part 7, excluding the Great Lakes [46 CFR 10.103].)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To provide a reasonable opportunity for affected personnel to complete full radar-observer courses and obtain radar-observer
endorsements, this interim rule requires these courses and endorsements only of personnel receiving original licenses,
renewing licenses, or upgrading licenses, on or after February 15, 1995. (Since licenses are valid for five years,
some OUTVs will not have to complete these courses until January, 2000.) However, because of the urgent need to improve
safety, this rule requires the Radar-Operation course of all affected personnel not yet required to hold the radar-observer
endorsement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the large number of personnel required to attend radar-training by February 15, 1995, and the importance
of their getting basic training as soon as possible, the Radar-Operation course may be conducted by individuals,
companies, or other organizations without prior approval of the Coast Guard. However, offerors must state on their
course-completion certificates that the courses conform to rules of the Coast Guard. Each such certificate is valid
until the holder's license is renewed or upgraded, whichever occurs first. By then, a holder of this certificate must
have completed an approved radar-observer course to obtain the endorsement on his or her license. No mariner who renews
or upgrades his or her license on or after February 15, 1995, without having attended a radar-observer course, may
serve as the master, mate, operator, or pilot of any vessel identified by 46 CFR 15.815_among which are radar-equipped
uninspected towing vessels of at least 8 meters (approximately 26 feet) in length.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The radar-observer endorsement on a license expires after five years. To renew, an applicant must present a certificate
of training from an approved course: radar-observer renewal or original. Like the original course, the renewal course
will contain two principal components: a demonstration of skills on a radar simulator, and a radar-theory examination.
Any applicant successfully completing the appropriate approved course and presenting the certificate of training
to the OCMI may have his or her endorsement renewed.

Regulatory Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866, ``Regulatory Planning
and Review,'' and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order.
It has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under that Order. It is nonsignificant under the Regulatory
Policies and Procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) [44 FR 11040 (February 26, 1979)].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirements announced by this rule will apply to licensed operators of radar-equipped towing vessels 8 meters
(approximately 26 feet) or more in length operating in U.S. waters.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph
10e of the Regulatory Policies and Procedures of DOT is unnecessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are about 12,300 licensed operators of uninspected towing vessels (OUTV) in the U.S. Although some may operate
towboats on ocean (domestic-trade) waters, many of those vessels are manned by licensed masters or mates. OUTVs on
ocean waters already must complete radar-observer courses [see 46 CFR 10.464(e)(2)], but they must do this only once.
This rule will require certain licensed OUTVs to obtain radar-observer endorsements, which must be renewed five
years after the month of issue [see 46 CFR 10.480(f), below]. Roughly 15,000 masters, mates, and OUTVs will each need
to complete a radar-observer course or a Radar-Operation course sometime during the five years after the effective
date of this rule to comply with 46 CFR 15.815(c), below. Those completing the radar-observer course will need to renew
their endorsements every five years to continue to work on radar-equipped towboats of at least 8 meters (approximately
26 feet) in length. Certificates from Radar-Operation courses will not be valid with licenses dated after February
15, 1995. Consequently, persons using the Radar-Operation certificate to satisfy 46 CFR 15.815(c) will need to complete
radar-observer courses when they renew or upgrade their licenses_if they intend to continue working on radar-equipped
towboats of 8 meters (approximately 26 feet) or more in length. A Radar-Operation course, at least four hours in length,
is designed to indoctrinate operators with regard to basic uses and interpretation of radar. Radar-observer courses,
courses approved by the Coast Guard and completed by applicants seeking radar-observer endorsements on their licenses,
range in length from four hours (renewal only) to five or more days. The radar-observer courses and corresponding
endorsements are separated by area of operation: Rivers, Inland Waters, and Unlimited (any waters). Expenses to
complete the different courses will vary, depending on the courses selected, the sources of training, and the applicants'
abilities. In-house courses should cost less than courses offered by independent schools. Unless their employers
offer the courses, OUTVs likely will bear the expense for the training, and complete it on their own time. Tuition might
cost up to $100.00 a day, and miscellaneous expenses for travel, meals, and lodging will sometimes accrue too, at $20.00
to $100.00 a day. Since the endorsement is valid for five years, the expense may be spread over five years as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, if the typical OUTV completes a Radar-Operation course before February 15, 1995, for $50.00 and then
two years later, when renewing his or her license, completes a Radar-Observer (Rivers) course at a cost of $480.00
(three days of training, lodging, meals, and miscellaneous expenses), the expense for the first seven years will
be about $530.00, or $76.00 a year. For subsequent five-year intervals, the expense will fall to about $14.00 a year,
due to the shorter length of the renewal course ($50.00 tuition + $20.00 miscellaneous expenses = $70.00 divided by
five years = $14.00). Hence, over 30 years, training 15,000 licensed individuals will cost about $440,000.00 a year.
Since about 450 new OUTVs are added each year (at $480.00 each), $216,000.00 must also be added each year to arrive at
the total expense for the towing industry_$656,000.00 a year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Statistical research has shown that American society is willing to pay $2,600,000.00 to save even just one life. Therefore,
even if only one life is saved each year by this rule, the benefit outweighs the expense by about $2,000,000.00 a year.

Small Entities

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act [5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
], the Coast Guard must consider the economic impact on small entities of a rule for which a general notice of proposed
rulemaking is required. ``Small entities'' may include (1) small businesses and not-for-profit organizations
that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields and (2) governmental jurisdictions
with populations of less than 50,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interim rule does not require a general notice of proposed rulemaking and, therefore, is exempt from the provisions
of the Act. Although this rule is exempt, however, the Coast Guard has reviewed it for potential impact on small entities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interim rule places its burden on individual OUTVs, not on their employers, which may, but need not, take it on
themselves. The Coast Guard expects that, of the employers that will take it on themselves, few if any will be small
entities. Therefore, the Coast Guard has determined that it will have no adverse economic impact on small entities.
If you nonetheless think that your business or organization qualifies as a small entity and that this rule will have
a significant economic impact on your business or organization, please submit a comment (see

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1. By this Order, we amend our ex parte 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
rules to provide an exemption for presentations between the Commission and the Department of Justice or Federal Trade
Commission relating to telecommunications competition matters. The rules are further amended to provide for disclosure
of any new factual information obtained by the Commission in such presentations if such information is relied on by
the Commission in the decision-making process. This exemption would not apply if the Department of Justice or Federal
Trade Commission becomes a party to the proceeding, e.g., by the filing of comments in the proceeding. Nor would it
apply if the proceeding is designated for hearing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. We believe that this exemption will promote the public interest through the exchange of information and ideas between
the Commission and the other principal agencies responsible for promoting or ensuring competition in the telecommunications
industry. It should lead to more effective enforcement and protection of the public interest, development and application
of more consistent analytical methodologies, an improved, expedited license transfer process, and the possible
avoidance of unnecessarily duplicative efforts. At the same time, the requirement for disclosure of any factual
information relied on by the Commission will protect the rights of the parties.

 This final rule establishes escrow accounting procedures under Sections 6(g) and 10 of the Real Estate Settlement
Procedures Act, 12 U.S.C. 2605(g) and 2609 (RESPA). It establishes a nationwide standard accounting method known
as aggregate accounting. The rule requires servicers to use the aggregate accounting method for escrow accounts
involving federally related mortgage loans that are settled on or after the effective date of this rule. It provides
a three-year phase-in period for existing escrow accounts to convert to the aggregate accounting method. In addition,
the final rule establishes formats and procedures for initial and annual escrow account statements. By this rulemaking,
the Department is implementing the Section 10 amendments made in section 942 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable
Housing Act. Conforming changes are also made to appropriate Federal Housing Administration (FHA) provisions in
parts 203 and 234.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 10 of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 (RESPA) (12 U.S.C. 2609) sets out the statutory limits
on the amounts that lenders may legally require borrowers to deposit in escrow accounts. The statutory language of
Section 10 is complex. It has been subject to increasing controversy. At times the statute uses the term ``lender''
and at other times it uses the term ``servicer.'' A lender creates a loan obligation but may or may not service the loan.
Within this rule, HUD uses the term servicer to include the lender when the lender performs the servicing function.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 10(a) of RESPA limits the amounts that a lender may charge a borrower at the creation of an escrow account and
during the lifetime of the account. Section 10(a)(1) sets limits on charges to a borrower when a lender creates an escrow
account. At the time the lender creates an escrow account, the lender may only charge the borrower an amount sufficient
to pay the charges respecting the mortgaged property, such as taxes and insurance, that are attributable to the period
from the date such payment(s) were last paid until the first full installment payment under the mortgage. In addition,
the lender may charge the borrower a cushion to cover unanticipated expenses. The statute limits the cushion to one-sixth
of the estimated total annual payments from the account. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 10(a)(2) sets limits on charges to a borrower over the rest of the lifetime of the escrow account. It provides
that a lender may charge a borrower a monthly sum equal to one-twelfth of the total annual escrow payments that the lender
reasonably anticipates paying from the account. In addition, a lender may add an amount to maintain a cushion equal
to one-sixth of the estimated total annual payments from the account. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 10(c) of RESPA requires a servicer to provide a borrower with initial and annual escrow account statements.
Section 10(d) sets forth the penalty provisions for a servicer's failure to provide the required statements. Section
6(g) of RESPA provides that if the servicer has required an escrow account, then the servicer shall make disbursement
payments for the escrow account items in a timely manner as such payments become due. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Historically, HUD had only interpreted the escrow accounting portions of Section 10 by informal opinion and one Interpretive
Rule, dated January 21, 1993 (58 FR 5520). Litigation initiated by various State Attorneys General and private class-action
plaintiffs raised serious questions about what RESPA permitted in this regard and fueled a debate about the extent
of ``overescrowing'' in the industry. The Secretary decided that HUD needed to fulfill its responsibility to protect
consumers by setting forth clear, specific guidance on escrow practices. Therefore, the Department initiated this
rulemaking process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 3, 1993 (58 FR 64065), the Department published its proposed rule seeking public comments. After reviewing
the comments, the Department developed this final rule, which is consistent with the consumer-oriented approach
announced by the Secretary in the proposed rule. This final rule will:

(1) Reduce the cost of homeownership, by ensuring that funds are not held in escrow accounts in excess of the amounts
necessary to protect the lenders' interests in preserving the collateral;

(3) Provide servicers with clear, specific guidance on the requirements of Section 10. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the proposed rule, new &sect;3500.17 set out HUD's regulations for escrow accounts subject to RESPA. The proposed
rule covered any escrow account established in connection with a federally related mortgage loan. It provided HUD's
interpretation of what was a permissible cushion and what was an overcharge to the borrower's escrow accounts. The
proposed rule articulated HUD's new policy requiring aggregate accounting analysis on all new escrow accounts.
The proposed rule set out the requirements for initial and annual escrow account statements. The rule also proposed
a delayed effective date to provide sufficient time for servicers to implement the regulatory requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When issuing the proposed rule, HUD reviewed existing escrow accounting procedures. A prevalent practice exists,
called single-item analysis, where a lender accounts for each escrow item separately. The lender may collect more
money under a single-item analysis accounting than under aggregate analysis accounting. An aggregate accounting
method is one in which the sufficiency of the funds is determined by analyzing the escrow account as a whole. Attorneys
General of numerous States have claimed that single-item analysis has resulted in substantial over-escrowing of
consumers' money. The Attorneys Generals interpreted Section 10 as requiring aggregate accounting practices to
determine the maximum account balances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD's own escrow study found that too many accounts were over-escrowed and too much of consumers' funds was being held
by mortgage servicers. In the proposed rule, HUD announced its determination that servicers should be required to
analyze all new escrow accounts on an aggregate accounting basis. HUD proposed to provide a three-year phase-in period
after the rule's publication date for existing accounts to be converted to an aggregate accounting methodology.
HUD requested comments on its proposed rule and received 142 comments through the February 1, 1994, due date.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Five commenters specifically supported the proposed rule (two mortgage companies, one attorney, one bank, and a
government agency). Seven comments supported the rule, but with recommended clarifications or revisions. Twenty
commenters supported industry standardization. Fifteen flatly opposed the proposed rule for various reasons.
Some argued that HUD was overly interfering in escrow industry practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD believes that the final rule will end uncertainty that now exists within the industry. HUD is providing clear standards
for the servicing industry to follow. Congress explicitly provided HUD with regulatory authority to interpret the
Act to further its purpose. This regulation is well within HUD's rulemaking authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eighteen commenters requested an additional comment period or the opportunity to participate in hearings. Although
the Department considered requests for additional time for comments and hearings, it concludes that it has sufficient
information to complete rulemaking without more input.

Costs of Implementation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Forty-four commenters (19 mortgage companies, 16 banks, 4 attorneys, 4 associations, and 1 government agency) expressed
concern about the cost of redesigning software systems to perform the aggregate analysis and to complete the required
statements. Many commenters indicated that the expense of systems design and implementation, staff training, and
additional administrative efforts would far outweigh any potential benefit provided to consumers. In reviewing
these comments, the Department balanced the short-term cost considerations against the long-term advantages of
standardized nationwide requirements for escrow accounts and consumer savings. The Department concludes that
the long-term benefits outweigh the short-term costs.

Phase-in and Implementation Periods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule provided a 180-day period for persons to implement its provisions concerning aggregate accounting
practices for new escrow accounts. Sixty-seven commenters (33 mortgage companies, 20 banks, 7 associations, 5 attorneys,
and 2 government agencies) requested that the 180-day period be extended to 12 or 18 months. They cited changes in software,
staff training, and other administrative burdens as reasons for the implementation extension. Several commenters
also stated that there would be no incentive to maintain dual systems for pre- and post-rule accounts because dual
systems would be too costly and difficult to administer. Sixteen commenters observed that if the implementation
period was extended to at least one year, the phase-in period for pre-rule activity should be eliminated. Three commenters
supporting the phase-in of pre-rule escrow accounts suggested that HUD should not require the disclosures proposed
in the rule during the phase-in period. Four commenters requested that the implementation date be extended to two
to three years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While recognizing that a 180-day implementation period for new accounts is demanding, the Secretary concludes that
this rule will save consumers money and that it should be implemented as quickly as possible. Moreover, HUD alerted
the mortgage servicing and software industry in December 1993 of its intention to implement aggregate accounting
requirements. The Secretary believes the affected industries are capable of developing the necessary systems within
the 180-day implementation period. This final rule therefore carries forward the 180-day implementation period.

The Department further believes that permitting a three year phase-in period for existing accounts is appropriate.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 It is a fair way to apply aggregate accounting requirements to existing escrow accounts. During the three year phase-in
period, a considerable number of existing escrow accounts will likely be terminated as residential property is sold
or mortgages are refinanced and new escrow accounts established. The three-year requirement sets an appropriate
balance between sensitivity to servicer expectations regarding the price of servicing and concern that the desired
policy is implemented for consumers as quickly as reasonable. The three year phase-in period provides a specific
date when all escrow accounts are subject to aggregate accounting requirements. HUD acknowledges that servicers
may have purchased servicing rights at premiums based, among other things, on the expectation of doing single-item
accounting. However, because HUD has provided notice nearly four years in advance of the conversion date, the pricing
of servicing will adjust accordingly (if it has not already).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 Until the conversion date for pre-rule accounts, both single-item (individual-item) analysis and aggregate analysis
methods are acceptable accounting methods, as are accounting methods that combine characteristics of both the foregoing
methods (sometimes termed ``hybrid accounting methods''), as long as use of any such method does not result in payments
or cushions in excess of those that result from escrow account analysis using the single-item analysis method. For
post-rule accounts, aggregate analysis is the only acceptable accounting method to conduct escrow account analysis
to ensure compliance with the limits imposed by this regulation.

Interest on Escrow Accounts and Single-Item Escrow Accounts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters asked whether the final rule would address interest on escrow accounts. Seven commenters suggested that
the rule specifically exempt servicers that either pay interest on escrow accounts or service only one escrow item.
These commenters believed that a required interest payment on escrow account balances would create a disincentive
to servicers to over-escrow. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After considering the comments, the Department determines that it will not create the requested exemptions. The
Department does not interpret Section 10 of RESPA as providing the Department with legal authority to require payment
of interest on escrow accounts. Where interest is required, it is a matter of State law, with fourteen States requiring
that some amount of interest be paid on escrow account funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where there is only one escrow account item in the escrow account, there is no difference in the outcome between these
two accounting methods. Nonetheless, HUD believes it appropriate for escrow accounts with only one escrow item to
conform to the rule requirements. To enhance industry standardization, HUD applies the final rule to all escrow accounts
involving a federally related mortgage loan, regardless of the number of escrow account items within the escrow account.

Termination of Escrow Accounts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two commenters asked HUD to address whether a borrower could terminate his/her escrow account when the loan was paid
down to a certain amount (similar to provisions included in a proposed escrow account reform bill introduced in Congress).
The Department believes it has no authority under Section 10 to regulate when a borrower may terminate an escrow account
based on a loan-to-value ratio or otherwise. HUD encourages borrowers to turn to the mortgage documents for guidance.
Additionally, major secondary market purchasers have established standards for termination of escrow accounts.
Also, a borrower may simply ask the servicer to exercise discretion in terminating an escrow account.

Annual Escrow Account Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters requested that HUD clarify its terms or definitions to be consistent with industry terminology,
the National Affordable Housing Act (Pub. L. 101&hyph;625, approved November 28, 1990) (NAHA), or terms used by other
Federal agencies. Thirteen commenters requested clarification of the term ``annual escrow account statement''.
Many commenters thought that the Department had commingled the requirements for the annual escrow account statement,
as set forth in NAHA, with the requirements for an annual escrow analysis. The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA)
recommended that ``HUD retain the definition of annual escrow account statement as defined in the proposed rule for
escrow account statements published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 9, 1991.'' (56 FR 64445.) The MBA argued that the previous definition would alleviate any confusion about
the timing of the annual escrow account statements and annual escrow analysis. In addition, the MBA stated that the
previous definition of ``annual escrow account statement'' took into account the industry practice of generally
performing escrow analyses after the largest escrow account item was paid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD defines an annual escrow account statement as a statement containing the information required in &sect;3500.17(i)
that a servicer must submit to the borrower within 30 days of the end of the escrow account computation year. This definition
comports with the MBA recommendation. The comments correctly observed that the annual statements and the escrow
account analysis are ``commingled.'' HUD considers an escrow account analysis necessary to make the annual escrow
account statement meaningful. Thus, the rule clearly requires the servicer to conduct an escrow account analysis
at the end of the escrow account computation year. However, the final rule provides servicers with flexibility in
setting the escrow account computation year. HUD's rule therefore allows the industry to continue the practice of
conducting the escrow analysis after paying the largest escrow account item.

Cushion and Pre-Accrual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Nine commenters requested clarification of the definitions of cushion and pre-accrual. The proposed rule defined
the cushion to mean funds that a servicer could require a borrower to pay into an escrow account to cover unanticipated
disbursements or to cover disbursements made before the borrower's payments are available in the account. The proposed
rule defined ``pre-accrual'' to be a practice that some servicers employed under which funds needed for disbursement
from an escrow account are required to be on deposit in the account at a date prior to the disbursement date. Both terms
were subject to the limitations of paragraph (c) of the section. Paragraph (c)(6) of the proposed rule prohibited
the use of pre-accrual on post-rule accounts and limited its use on pre-rule accounts to within the limits set in paragraph
(c)(4). Commenters stated that the pre-accrual disallowance language in the proposed &sect;3500.17(c)(6) effectively
modified previously allowable cushions. This was HUD's intent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD received 30 comments questioning HUD's prohibition of pre-accrual practices for post-rule accounts. Many commented
that HUD had long accepted pre-accrual as a legal methodology for analyzing escrow balances. Seventeen commented
that servicers may be discouraged from establishing escrow accounts because of the increased costs and prohibitions
against pre-accrual practices. They stated that if servicers ceased handling escrow accounts, some borrowers would
be delinquent in their tax payments and the taxing authorities would experience greater administrative expenses.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes that pre-accrual practices allow servicers to acquire the equivalent of up to another month
of cushion in the escrow account. Coupled with a cushion of greater than one month, a pre-accrual practice could result
in escrow account balances that exceed RESPA's limits. HUD believes that the cushion provides sufficient extra funds
to cover unanticipated disbursements or disbursements made before the borrower's payments are available in the
account. Therefore, pre-accrual is unnecessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule eliminates the use of pre-accrual on all new accounts. Generally, for existing escrow accounts, a servicer
may not require any pre-accrual that exceeds one month or that results in an account balance larger than the limits
set forth in &sect;3500.17(c). In addition, the Department considered the arguments of servicers who claimed they
would discontinue handling escrow accounts under the proposed rule. The Department concludes that servicers are
unlikely to abandon the practice of handling escrow accounts.

Forty-two commenters (25 mortgage companies, 11 banks, 2 associations, 3 attorneys, and Fannie Mae) requested clarification
of the definition of disbursement date. Fannie Mae's response noted that the proposed disbursement date definition
permits the payment to occur ``*&blank;*&blank;* without regard to the lender's normal lending practice or local
custom or prudent lending practice.'' Further, several commenters suggested that the proposed definition does
not reflect that the disbursement date may be in a month or in a period prior to the month it is due, in order to take advantage
of discounts. GE Capital Mortgage Services, Inc. stated that ``although HUD may not have intended to require a disbursement
date to always be in the same calendar month as the due date, the language could be read to require this.''

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its proposed definition, HUD intended to define the disbursement date as the date the servicer actually pays the
escrow item. HUD intended to apply a standard that conformed with prudent lending practices to pay escrow account
items promptly and to take advantage of discounts, when available, and avoid penalties. The proposed definition
required a servicer to pay an escrow item in time to take advantage of available discounts, or at least in time to avoid
a penalty. In the final rule, HUD defines the disbursement date as the date the servicer actually pays an escrow item.
In &sect;3500.17(k), HUD provides that in calculating the disbursement date, the servicer must pay the disbursement
on or before the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
earlier
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of the deadline to take advantage of discounts, if available, or the deadline to avoid a penalty. The disbursement
date may be in a month other than the due date established by the payee. In cases of payments to obtain a discount, the
disbursement date may be in a month before the payee's due date. In cases of payments to avoid a penalty, the disbursement
date may be in a month after the payee's due date, but before the penalty would be assessed.

Escrow Account 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Eight commenters requested clarification of the proposed ``escrow account'' definition. Commenters stated that
the final rule definition should exclude voluntarily escrowed funds. They believed that such payments should be
excluded from the trial running balance calculations of an escrow account. The Department rejects this argument.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term escrow account encompasses all escrow accounts, including those that are ``voluntarily'' agreed to by borrowers
and under the control of servicers. Because most borrowers are anxious to obtain a loan, they are likely to agree to
a lender's request for a voluntary escrow account that is under the lender's control. Arguably all escrow accounts
are voluntarily entered into when the parties agree to the mortgage loan. Thus, an exemption for servicer controlled
accounts involving ``voluntarily'' escrowed funds would nullify the statute's purpose of protecting consumers.
Therefore, the final rule provides a uniform standard for all servicers who control escrow accounts. In the final
rule, the term ``escrow account'' excludes any account that is totally under the borrower's control.

Escrow Account Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Twenty-one commenters requested clarification of the ``escrow account analysis'' definition (14 mortgage companies,
4 banks, 2 attorneys, and the MBA). These comments complained that the proposed definition of ``escrow analysis''
required that an analysis be done to prepare the initial and annual escrow account statements. The commenters viewed
these functions as completely separate. They argued against the linkage of the analysis with the preparation of the
escrow account statements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department considered these comments but concludes that an escrow analysis is ordinarily needed to provide an
initial and annual escrow account statement. Otherwise, the statements may be meaningless. In the final rule, however,
the Department no longer requires the servicer to provide the initial escrow account statement at settlement. Section
3500.17(g) now permits servicers to submit the initial escrow account statement to the borrower within 45 calendar
days after settlement. In this way the servicer, rather than the closing agent, is likely to perform the escrow account
analysis, and the initial escrow account statement will more accurately reflect the first year's projections.

Escrow Account Computation Year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Twenty-eight commenters sought clarification of the term ``escrow account computation year'' (17 mortgage companies,
6 banks, 3 attorneys, and 2 associations). Twenty comments asked for clarification of the term ``escrow account computation
year'' as HUD used it in the definition of ``trial running balance.'' Several commenters requested that HUD revise
the final definition to be consistent with HUD's definition in an earlier proposed rule of December 9, 1991. There,
HUD defined ``escrow account computation year'' to mean ``any escrow account year whose date of establishment begins
on or after January 1, 1991.'' (56 FR 64445, &sect;3500.17(a)(1).) January 1, 1991, was the statutory initiation
date. In HUD's December 3, 1993, proposed rule, the definition of ``escrow account computation year'' is a 12-month
period starting on the initial payment date (58 FR at 64071). Several commenters argued for greater flexibility to
set the escrow account computation year, rather than have it established by the initial payment date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD is aware that servicers may need to spread out their workload throughout the year. The final rule permits the servicer
to have some flexibility in setting the computation year by allowing for ``short year'' statements. In the final rule,
an escrow account computation year begins at the initial payment date. However, the servicer may use a ``short year''
statement to level its production load and reestablish an escrow account computation year that best meets its business
cycle.

Installment Payment

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Four commenters requested clarification of the ``installment payment'' definition. They stated that HUD's proposed
definition lacked clarity regarding tax or insurance statements that are payable on a quarterly or semi-annual basis,
but are actually paid by the servicers annually. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believed the proposed definition adequately described installment payments, but has given an example
to clarify its usage in the final rule. Unless there is a discount to the borrower for early payments, the regulation
does not allow servicers to pay installment payments on an annual or other prepayment basis.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Six commenters suggested the definition of ``payment date'' be changed to ``payment due date'' to distinguish the
term from the disbursement date. In response to these comments, the Department uses the phrase ``payment due date''
in the final rule. These commenters also suggested that the reference to monthly payments be revised to ``periodic
payments.'' HUD makes this change when appropriate. Four commenters requested detailed guidance on escrow accounts
when payments are made biweekly or for periods other than monthly. The proposed rule did not explicitly address this
issue. It used monthly and yearly phrases because those terms follow the statute's language. The final rule, however,
provides illustrations of biweekly accounting in Appendix H.

Refinancing Loans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule stated that the refinancing of a pre-rule escrow account would turn it into a post-rule account.
One commenter indicated that a refinancing between the same lender and borrower should not change the account from
a pre-rule to post-rule status. Four commenters questioned whether modifications or assumptions of pre-rule escrow
accounts would result in a pre- or post-rule escrow account. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Congress amended RESPA in Section 908 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 specifically to change
the definition of ``federally related mortgage loan'' to include ``any such secured loan, the proceeds of which are
used to prepay or pay off an existing loan secured by the same property.'' 12 U.S.C. 2602(1)(A). This amendment became
effective on October 28, 1992, its enactment date. As of December 2, 1992 (57 FR 49600), HUD's regulations withdrew
the previous exemption for refinancing transactions from RESPA coverage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Thus, when HUD issued the proposed escrow accounting rule of December 3, 1993, refinancing transactions were covered
by RESPA. HUD issued a final rule implementing the section 908 amendments of RESPA on February 10, 1994. In that final
rule, the Department defined a refinancing to mean ``a transaction in which an existing obligation that was subject
to a secured lien on residential real property is satisfied and replaced by a new obligation undertaken by the same
borrower and with the same or a new lender.'' (59 FR 6506, at 6512.) HUD also adopted certain Regulation Z requirements
for refinancing transactions with the same lender. This final rule uses the &sect;3500.2 definition to determine
whether a transaction is a refinancing that requires post-rule treatment. If the transaction involves only a modification
or other change to existing terms of a mortgage document, then it will remain a pre-rule account during the three-year
implementation period.

an express provision will try to circumvent the express limits on profiteering contained in the proposed rule by charging
consumers annual maintenance fees.'' In response, the Department considered whether servicers would charge borrowers
escrow account maintenance fees or document storage fees to defray lost revenue resulting from changes in accounting
practices required by this final rule. An examination of the standard Fannie Mae-Freddie Mac Uniform Instrument
(Section 2 of the Uniform Covenants) indicates that such fees are prohibited in most circumstances (except where
interest is paid on escrow accounts and state law allows such charges). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The Department has not seen evidence that servicers, as a common practice, currently charge maintenance or storage
fees in conjunction with escrow accounts. HUD's existing regulations for FHA insured loans already prohibit the
FHA mortgagee or servicer from charging the borrower for servicing activities. 24 CFR 203.552(a)(12)(i). If the
Department sees such fees develop with respect to any other loans to thwart the statutory and regulatory limitations,
then HUD is likely to reconsider this issue in conjunction with applicable State law provisions. At this time, the
Department intends to monitor the servicing industry carefully to insure compliance with Sections 8 and 10 of RESPA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Twenty-nine comments sought guidance on how to estimate disbursement amounts for the next year. They specifically
questioned how to determine whether increases or decreases in amounts ``are known or should be known.'' They questioned
how they ``should know'' a change in the charge. Twenty-two comments supported the use of estimates based on the prior
year's actual disbursements modified by a defined CPI index. They also supported using actual increases or decreases,
if known. Nineteen comments requested more explicit guidance, specifically questioning which CPI index to use.
Five commenters requested an example of how to estimate a new payment for the ensuing escrow account computation period.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 In the final rule, the Department provides that if the servicer knows the charges for the subsequent escrow account
computation year, then the servicer shall use those amounts in estimating the disbursement amounts. If the charge
is unknown to the servicer, then the servicer may use an estimate based on the preceding year's charge as modified by
an amount not exceeding the most recent year's change in the national Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers
(CPI, all items). In addition, the final rule establishes procedures for estimating charges for new construction
where the land and structure are unassessed.

Provisions in Mortgage Documents

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule stated that the mortgage loan documents prevail if the documents prescribe escrow account limits
lower than those prescribed in the rule. Six commenters observed that the final rule should permit a cushion on all
escrow accounts regardless of contract provisions in the mortgage document. Twenty-five commenters indicated
that the final rule should explicitly state that a one-sixth cushion could be established when the loan documents
are silent. Many commenters were concerned that the language in the proposed rule would alter the contractual terms
between borrowers, lenders, and servicers, and they questioned inconsistencies with standard form Fannie Mae,
Freddie Mac, FHA, and VA security instruments. Six comments indicated that the final rule should pronounce common
standards for contract types that address the cushions allowed under Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, FHA, and VA contracts,
using standard contract language. The joint comments from the States' Attorneys General noted that, ``while HUD's
proposed rule clearly states that where contracts provide for more restrictive cushions than the two-month aggregate
cushion, the contracts control, however the proposed rule leaves unnecessary ambiguity as to which contracts those
are, and how explicit the contract language must be in order for the contract to take precedence.'' One comment also
stated that pre-rule loan documents that violate the final rule should not have to be revised or be considered a violation
of RESPA if the servicer complies with the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The rule requires servicers to examine the mortgage loan documents to determine their escrow limits in preparing
the initial escrow account statements. If the loan document provides that an escrow account may hold amounts ``up
to the limits allowed by RESPA,'' HUD interprets this as permitting the full amount allowed by this rule. In the final
rule, the Department clearly states that if the mortgage loan documents provide for lower cushion limits or less pre-accrual
than the rule, then the documents apply. Where the mortgage documents allow payments to an escrow account in excess
of those permitted under this rule, then this final rule and the statute control. Where the mortgage documents do not
specifically establish an escrow account, whether a servicer may appropriately establish an escrow account is a
matter for determination by State law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
of cushion or pre-accrual limits and the servicer establishes an escrow account under State law, then this final rule
governs unless State law provides for a lower amount. A lower amount would be consistent with RESPA's maximums and
could be seen as giving greater protection to the consumer.

The proposed rule mandated aggregate account analysis for all escrow accounts established under mortgages closed
after the final rule's effective date. Thirteen comments supported this position. Twenty-eight comments opposed
a mandatory aggregate accounting method (15 banks, 7 mortgage companies, 3 associations, and 3 attorneys). Many
comments stressed that increased costs associated with aggregate analysis_redesigning software, staff training,
and additional administrative efforts_would be passed on to borrowers as either higher interest rates, higher origination
fees, or escrow management/servicing fees. They also suggested that low- and moderate-income borrowers would be
the most affected by cost increases. Four comments noted an inconsistency between HUD's rationale for requiring
aggregate accounting and the conclusions in HUD's Phase II study results published in May 1991. They suggested that
aggregate analysis could result in more overall funds being escrowed than currently result under single-item accounting.
They claimed that because a majority of servicers currently escrow below the RESPA limitations, under this final
rule they would raise their cushions to the maximum allowable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Although there will be some initial costs associated with a conversion to aggregate accounting, HUD believes that
this cost is outweighed by the long-term consumer savings that will be accomplished. HUD believes that aggregate
analysis will result in lower escrow balances in the long run. Moreover, the Phase II study concluded unambiguously
that aggregate accounting results in lower escrow balances than single-item accounting with the same cushion and
pre-accrual practices. HUD acknowledges that servicers who have maintained escrow balances below RESPA's limits
may increase the accounts to the allowable maximum amounts.

The proposed rule provided an arithmetic example of an aggregate analysis computation. It also gave a detailed narrative
of the steps to use in calculating the maximum cushion. Two comments requested that Step B in the calculation be simplified
and Step C deleted. Many stated that HUD should describe the aggregate accounting method using only a narrative paragraph
and should not attempt to set out the arithmetic steps to use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Others disagreed with HUD's calculations. For example, 38 commenters stated that when they determine the lowest
monthly trial balance calculations of an escrow account, they first consider disbursements (debits) before receipts
(credits). They claim that borrowers often do not make their mortgage payments until the end of a grace period. Disbursements
are often due at the first of the month. Because HUD did not consider the timing of payments and disbursements, the commenters
argued that the low-point balance may be understated. They claim this could result in shortages and deficiencies.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The final rule contains both narrative and arithmetic descriptions of the steps to be used in an escrow account analysis
under either method. The Department believes that it is providing useful guidance to the industry by giving both descriptions
and examples. If HUD failed to provide a step-by-step algorithm, some servicers might be uncertain about the allowable
limits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 To consider all disbursements before receipts is to effectively reintroduce one month pre-accrual. Under the final
rule, the escrow account analysis is a picture of the escrow account at month's end. Consequently, the timing of the
payments and disbursements within a month do not change the computations. If a servicer pays a disbursement before
the borrower makes a monthly mortgage payment, then the servicer may use the allowable cushion, if necessary.

Single-Item Analysis

Nineteen comments stated that HUD should reaffirm its past policy in support of single-item analysis method. They
argued that Section 10 of RESPA permits single-item analysis. HUD's previous informal interpretations and an opinion
of the Comptroller General supported this view. They claim that Congress did not intend aggregate analysis limits
to be imposed on escrow account balances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Other comments indicated that HUD's example in Appendix F of a single-item analysis was inconsistent with the methodology
used by the majority of the industry. The commenters claimed that the industry does not use a trial running balance
to determine single-item analysis limits. The commenters expressed concern that they would have to conform their
current systems and software to the proposed single-item analysis during the phase-in period. They claimed that
this would further increase costs and the burden of compliance. Five suggested that HUD delay the implementation
of the ``new'' single-item analysis provisions for one year, to permit time to reprogram systems and train staff.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 When the Secretary issued the proposed rule, he was well aware of prior HUD interpretations concerning single-item
analysis. Through informal legal opinions, HUD allowed servicers to use single-item analysis in calculating Section
10's limitations. HUD also issued an Interpretive Rule, dated January 21, 1993, in which HUD allowed single-item
analysis within Section 10's limitations. The Interpretive Rule is effective until the effective date of this final
rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 HUD reconsidered its position on single-item accounting because HUD's Phase II report showed that aggregate accounting
would result in lower escrow balances. When RESPA was first enacted the vast majority of servicers employed single-item
analysis. The development of computer software and the increased availability of computer office equipment, however,
makes the aggregate accounting computations easier than before. The statute describes the cushion as ``one-sixth
of the estimated total amount'' of such charges. This rule represents the policy decision that aggregate accounting
shall be the new standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 In reaching this decision, the Secretary has seriously considered the countervailing interests. Servicers have
had the benefit of greater escrow account balances under a single-item analysis accounting than they would have had
if an aggregate analysis were employed. On the other hand, borrowers have had more money tied up in escrow accounts
under a single-item accounting practice than would have been the case if aggregate accounting were practiced. Because
the application of single-item analysis almost always means that servicers collect more money from borrowers than
would be the case if the account were computed on an aggregate basis, the final rule requires an aggregate analysis
prospectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 During the three-year phase-in period, servicers may still use single-item analysis for pre-rule accounts. The
proposed rule contained a description and an illustration of single-item analysis that some commenters argued inaccurately
described their practices. HUD does not intend for servicers to develop new single-item analysis systems. However,
any application of single-item analysis must be within Section 10's limits as interpreted by this rule in &sect;3500.17(d)(2).
As long as servicers are within these limits, they may use a single-item accounting procedure on pre-rule accounts
for three years from the publication date of this rule.

Four comments noted that the HUD settlement statements currently use single-item analysis at closing. They raised
questions concerning the proper procedures for collecting the cushion at settlement after the effective date of
this rule. Some commenters were concerned that aggregate accounting at settlement could cause confusion if that
method replaced the relatively simple method of adding a two-month cushion to the amounts due by the initial payment
date. Several commenters suggested that single-item analysis be permitted at closing and aggregate analysis be
used for all post-closing escrow activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 In consideration of these concerns, HUD is offering two alternative methods for completing the HUD settlement statements
during a phase-in period ending three years from the date of publication of this rule. However, one of the Department's
goals in this rule is to reduce the amount borrowers must pay at closing into escrow accounts. HUD intends to implement
this goal by requiring aggregate accounting practices at closing. The Department intends to make computer software
available to interested persons to help make the necessary calculations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Under the first of the 2 methods permitted during the phase-in period, the settlement agent may use an aggregate accounting
method to adjust the initial entries on the last line of the 1000 series on the HUD&hyph;1 or HUD&hyph;1A settlement
statement. The Department anticipates that software and implementation materials will be generally available
to settlement agents by the effective date of this rule. Alternatively, during the phase-in period the settlement
agent may initially calculate the deposits using a single-item analysis approach, but with only a one-month cushion.
HUD's studies indicate that a one-month cushion roughly yields the equivalent aggregate accounting result. This
option is available only where aggregate accounting is not performed as part of the closing process. The final rule
permits the servicer to provide the initial escrow account statement within 45 days of closing, and the servicer shall
then adjust the escrow account at that time to an aggregate accounting calculation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The Federal Reserve Board also was concerned about how lenders would calculate the amount for the mortgage insurance
premium cushion in making a Truth in Lending disclosure of the annual percentage rate. HUD consulted with Federal
Reserve Board officials, who indicated that the Federal Reserve Board will issue, in conjunction with the issuance
of this final rule, clarifying instructions for lenders and servicers to use in completing the HUD settlement statements
and in computing the annual percentage rate. Whichever of the alternative methods is used during the phase-in period,
the figures currently required by the Federal Reserve Board for Regulation Z purposes will still be reported, in the
same form under which they have always been reported. This practice will minimize inconvenience for both the Federal
Reserve Board and lenders under Regulation Z.

Initial Escrow Account Statements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule required servicers to provide borrowers an initial escrow account statement at settlement. For
escrow accounts established after settlement, the proposed rule allowed an additional 45 days for the servicer to
provide an initial escrow account statement to the borrowers. Fifteen commenters wanted to eliminate this requirement.
Thirteen indicated that creating the initial escrow account statement is cumbersome and costly for servicers and
confusing to borrowers. Others argued that the provisions of the proposed regulation that required delivery of the
initial escrow account statement at settlement contradicted Section 10(c)(1)(B) of the statute. They claimed that
the statute permitted up to 45 days from settlement within which servicers could submit initial escrow account statements
to borrowers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule did not specifically address table-funded transactions. Six commenters asked who would be responsible
for preparing the initial escrow account statement in table-funded transactions. They noted that loan correspondents,
brokers, and closing attorneys typically do not have the software and systems to produce the statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three comments asked how to compute the initial escrow deposits for a post-rule account. Three others suggested that
the final rule specifically state that the settlement agent may collect funds at closing for items that have a disbursement
date between the settlement and the initial payment date. Five commenters pointed out that some of the information
on the initial escrow account statement duplicated the HUD&hyph;1 settlement statement. They claimed that borrowers
received no additional benefit or disclosure from the separate statement. Four comments stated that HUD should provide
a suggested, rather than required, format for the initial escrow account statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to these comments, HUD notes that the RESPA statute as amended in 1990 requires servicers to provide borrowers
with initial escrow account statements. HUD is implementing that statutory requirement through this final rule.
In this final rule, the Department amends its proposed rule by expanding the timing requirements. The final rule permits
servicers to provide the initial escrow account statement at settlement or within 45 days of settlement for escrow
accounts that are established as a condition of the loan. The statute and rule also allow servicers to incorporate
the initial escrow account statement in the HUD&hyph;1 or HUD&hyph;1A settlement statement. Thus, some servicers
may avoid a purported duplication of information by including the initial escrow account statement in the HUD&hyph;1
settlement statement at closing. For escrow accounts established after settlement (and not as a condition of the
loan), the final rule allows an additional 45 days from the date the account is established for the servicer to provide
an initial escrow account statement to the borrowers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of these changes, the actual servicer of the loan, rather than a settlement agent, is more likely to prepare
the initial escrow account statement. HUD expects that in many table-funded transactions, for example, the servicer
that sets up the escrow account will be responsible for delivering the initial escrow account statement to the borrowers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above, the Department provides examples of how to compute the initial escrow deposits for a post-rule account.
The initial escrow account statement is a forward-looking projection of anticipated activity in the account's first
year. HUD's changes in the final rule should assure a higher degree of accuracy in the initial escrow account statements.
In addition, borrowers are likely to find less errors or discrepancies when comparing later annual escrow account
statements with the initial statement.

Annual Escrow Account Statements and Escrow Account Analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD's December 3, 1993, proposed rule required servicers to submit annual escrow account statements to borrowers
for every federally related mortgage loan for which there is an outstanding escrow account. In its proposed definitions,
HUD defined an ``escrow account analysis'' as a practice of computing a trial running balance that a servicer performs
to prepare the initial and annual escrow account statements. Twenty-six commenters asked HUD to clarify the difference
between the annual escrow account statement and the escrow account analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD considers the annual escrow account statement to be the borrower's tool to check the past year's escrow account
activities and the projections for the next year. As such, HUD believes that servicers need to perform an escrow account
analysis to make the statements meaningful. An escrow account analysis, therefore, is one step in the process of preparing
the escrow account statements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Twenty-two commenters stated that when preparing the escrow account analysis, servicers should exclude from the
trial running balance calculations unexpected deposits to the escrow account, such as ``loss drafts'' (insurance
payments), and anticipated or actual earnings, such as interest. HUD concurs and excludes these deposits from the
trial running balance calculations. However, if there is a special assessment to the borrower that impacts the escrow
account within the escrow account computation year (e.g., water purification, road or utility assessments or special
condominium assessments), then the servicer may choose to conduct an escrow account analysis at the time of the assessment
and adjust the account accordingly. Some assessments may be billed for periods longer than a year. For example, flood
insurance or water purification escrow funds may be payable on a three-year cycle. HUD's final rule provides guidance
on how to calculate the account limits when the account includes such payables. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule specified that the servicer deliver the annual escrow account statement to a borrower within 30
days of the conclusion of the escrow account computation year. Four commenters thought that the term escrow account
computation year should be changed to escrow computation cycle. They believed that this name change would allow servicers
to spread out the work load more efficiently during the year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seventeen commenters advocated more flexibility in when to conduct the escrow analyses, especially when servicers
experience delays in obtaining pertinent information (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
tax bills). These commenters recommended delaying the escrow analysis to provide a more meaningful statement, rather
than performing one on schedule merely to comply with a regulatory requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seven commented that the escrow analysis is generally prepared after the largest disbursement is made from the escrow
account. Two commenters were not sure whether the proposed rule permitted the escrow account analysis to be performed
on more than an annual basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to these comments, HUD maintains a requirement of at least one escrow account analysis per year. Servicers
are free to do more. The servicer will need to perform the analysis in preparing the annual escrow account statements.
HUD retains the definition of escrow account computation year because it corresponds to the statute's 12 month period
reference. Through the use of short year statements, servicers may set the escrow account computation year to coincide
with the largest payment in the account, normally taxes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sixty-nine commenters claimed that HUD's proposed annual escrow account statement requirements were confusing
to borrowers and costly for servicers to implement and prepare. (These comments came from 26 banks, 30 mortgage companies,
7 attorneys, and 6 associations.) Three commenters requested elimination of the trial running balance, since it
appeared unnecessary and confusing to borrowers. They also believed that the annual escrow account statements should
be more general. The comments argued that it was too costly to develop and administer programs to provide tailored
explanations. One software company stated that ``several statements on the annual statement may be impossible to
provide using an automated system. *&blank;*&blank;* Generally, data processing systems are not designed to provide
this type of annotated explanations. This type of artificial intelligence is cost prohibitive.'' Further, the commenters
stated that the final rule should provide suggested, not required, disclosures and format.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response, the Department simplifies the format for the annual escrow account statement in the final rule. HUD provides
sample statements for both single-item accounting and aggregate accounting practices. In each, the annual escrow
account statement includes a historical description of what actually was paid in and out of the account in the previous
computation year. It also contains a forward-looking projection of anticipated activity in the account for the next
year. The escrow account statements are prepared like bank statements, in a format that is familiar to the borrowers.
By doing so, the Department intends that the borrowers will be able to better understand account activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD is sensitive to the concern that the statements may be too specific in nature. However, some specific information
is necessary to make the disclosure useful to borrowers. If the account has exceeded the RESPA limits during the year,
then the servicer must explain why. If the mortgage documents require a lower cushion, then the servicer will use that
amount. The example provides a checklist for servicers to complete to explain why an account exceeded RESPA's limits.
The Department concludes that borrowers need this explanation; otherwise, over-escrowing of accounts may continue.
In addition, for borrowers who closely monitor their escrow accounts, HUD believes that the annual escrow account
statements will provide sufficient information to borrowers to save servicers time otherwise spent in responding
to borrower inquiries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Twenty-one commenters suggested that the annual escrow account statement be divided into two separate statements:
(1) An annual escrow account statement providing historical information that the servicers mail to borrowers with
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) information at calendar year-end; and (2) an escrow analysis statement, including
the projection of the next cycle's calculations, that the servicers deliver to borrowers within 30 to 60 days of completing
the escrow computation cycle. This practice would benefit servicers by combining part of the annual escrow account
statement with existing IRS requirements. It would also benefit the borrowers by providing information in a useful
and understandable fashion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department considers these comments informative. Many servicers will provide two such accountings to borrowers
anyway. The IRS information requires calendar year-end totals. The year-end statements, however, do not necessarily
correspond with the servicer's escrow account computation year. At any time, however, servicers may change the escrow
account computation year to a calendar year-end period by using short year statements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Twenty-five comments wanted HUD to exclude foreclosures and loans that are 60 days or more delinquent from the rule's
requirements for annual escrow account analysis and statements. In the final rule, HUD provides that servicers need
not submit an annual escrow account statement if the mortgage loan account is delinquent (30 days or more) or if the
servicer has initiated a foreclosure action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Short Year Annual Escrow Account Statements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule required the servicer to issue a short year annual escrow account statement to a borrower within
60 days of a loan payoff or 30 days of a transfer of servicing. Fifty-five commenters opposed these requirements, including
32 mortgage companies, 16 banks, 3 associations, and 4 attorneys. They stated that the IRS requires such information
at calendar-year end; thus, they claimed, HUD's requirement was unnecessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes that servicers should provide borrowers with relevant information at a meaningful time,
when borrowers will focus their attention on the information. HUD believes that borrowers should have the opportunity
to correct escrow account errors when servicing is transferred or soon after loan pay-off. If servicers fail to deliver
this information to borrowers for up to 12 months after the event, borrowers will be less likely to obtain corrective
action of any errors made. Consequently, the final rule retains the short year escrow account statement provisions,
although the Department has extended to 60 days the time for a transferor servicer to submit a short year statement
to the borrower.

Upon the transfer of loan servicing to a new servicer, the proposed rule required the new servicer to perform an escrow
account analysis before making any change to a borrower's escrow deposits. The proposed rule required the new servicer
to submit an initial escrow account statement to the borrower within 45 days after establishing the new escrow account.
Thirty-seven commenters asked HUD to eliminate this requirement. They questioned the benefit to the borrower and
the time and cost involved in preparing the statement. Seven commenters suggested that HUD extend to at least 90 days
the deadline for submitting the initial escrow account statement, because of integration issues associated with
transfers of servicing. Three commenters were unclear whether the initial escrow account statement was required
if the new servicer does not change the borrower's required escrow deposits or if the method of escrow account analysis
does not change between servicers. Two comments stated that if the initial escrow account statement is required,
it should be prepared by the transferor servicer, because that servicer performs an escrow account analysis before
transferring the account. One comment questioned whether the initial escrow account statement applied to transfers
of servicing between affiliates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department concludes that borrowers will benefit by receiving initial escrow account statements from new servicers
under certain circumstances. The final rule requires a new servicer to provide a borrower with an initial escrow account
statement if the servicer changes either the monthly payment amount or the accounting method previously used by the
transferor servicer. Because post-rule accounts will be using aggregate accounting methods, no initial escrow
account statement is needed for post-rule account transfers of servicing. In pre-rule accounts where there is a change
in the escrow account balances, the new servicer shall use the effective date of the transfer of servicing to establish
the new escrow account computation year. Where there is no change in the escrow account balances, the new servicer
shall continue the escrow account computation year that the transferor servicer started. (The Department expects
to publish soon a final rule on mortgage servicing transfers, adding a new &sect;3500.21 to Regulation X.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to comments, HUD extends the time for new servicers to deliver the initial escrow account statement from
45 to 60 days from the date of servicing transfer. The new servicer shall treat shortages, surpluses, and deficiencies
in the transferred escrow account according to the procedures set forth in &sect;3500.17(f). A pre-rule account
remains a pre-rule account upon the transfer to a new servicer, as long as the transfer occurs before the conversion
date.

Surpluses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Eleven comments requested clarification of HUD's proposed ``surplus'' definition. HUD's proposal defined a surplus
to be an amount, determined at the time of escrow analysis, by which an escrow account balance exceeds the target balance
for the account. The comments indicated that HUD's definition should state that a surplus is a balance in excess of
the allowable cushion, if any. HUD disagrees. HUD believes that its definition in the final rule more accurately describes
the surplus to be the excess of the current balance over the target balance. The target balance reflects the borrower's
accrued payments for escrow account items 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the cushion selected by the servicer. A servicer may choose to use no cushion or one that is less than the maximum set
by RESPA. It is therefore incorrect to state that the surplus is the balance that exceeds the allowable cushion. HUD
retains the term target balance, rather than allowable cushion, in its definition.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule required servicers to refund surpluses to a borrower within 30 days of the escrow analysis unless
the borrower timely instructed the servicer to apply the surplus to the escrow account balance. Many commenters saw
HUD's requirement as increasing their administrative burdens. Fifteen commenters pointed out that the 30-day period
was unrealistic. They argued that HUD should either extend the timeframe or eliminate the requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD's proposal set no dollar threshold for refunding surpluses. Fifty-three commenters advocated that the final
rule require servicers to refund automatically surpluses above a minimum threshold ($25 to $50). This way servicers
would not have to wait for the borrower's instructions. Thirteen others suggested that servicers be permitted discretion
to retain a surplus below a nominal amount. Forty comments opposed refunding surpluses if the borrower is delinquent
or in default. Sixteen comments stated that the rule should allow servicers the discretion to refund surpluses immediately
or to spread out the payments over a 12-month period. Several comments requested clarification on whether the existence
of a surplus violated RESPA. Two comments specifically stated that a servicer who handles a surplus according to these
rules is in compliance with RESPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to these comments, the Department has revised the final rule to require the servicer to refund to the borrower
any surplus that is greater than or equal to $50. This provision responds to the comments concerning timing and administrative
problems in obtaining borrower instructions. At the servicer's option, the servicer may refund to the borrower or
credit to the borrower's escrow account a surplus of less than $50. Again, the servicer need not interact with the borrower
to handle this surplus. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD's final rule provides that if the servicer does not receive the borrower's payment within 30 days of the payment
due date, then the servicer may retain the surplus in the escrow account pursuant to the terms of the mortgage loan document.
It also provides that if the servicer has brought an action for foreclosure under the mortgage loan, then the servicer
may retain any surplus in the escrow account according to the mortgage loan documents. If a servicer meets the provisions
of this final rule, then HUD will deem the servicer in compliance with RESPA.

Shortages and Deficiencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule defined a shortage to be the amount that the servicer estimates at the time of an escrow account analysis
will be needed to meet the target balance for the escrow account. A deficiency, on the other hand, is the amount that
a servicer has actually advanced to pay a disbursement from the escrow account. HUD had proposed that servicers allow
borrowers up to 12 months to pay shortages or deficiencies in the escrow account. Many commenters thought HUD's proposal
required servicers to extend interest-free loans to borrowers. For example, Fannie Mae stated that ``*&blank;*&blank;*
this requires the servicer to extend what is in essence a 12-month interest-free loan to the borrower. We believe that
this financial burden on the servicer is inequitable.'' Fifteen commenters wanted servicers to charge borrowers
interest at the note rate while advances for a deficiency are outstanding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD received numerous suggestions to change these provisions. Thirty-nine commenters suggested that the rule allow
servicers to collect shortages from borrowers within 30 days to 6 months from the date of the analysis. The comments
indicated that servicers could always allow borrowers more time (12 or more months) to pay a projected shortage than
is required by law. Sixty-six comments recommended that the rule allow servicers to collect deficiencies from borrowers
within 30 days to 6 months from the disbursement date. These comments also stated that servicers could choose to provide
borrowers with more time than legally mandated. Another comment sought immediate payment of servicer advances arising
from borrower-initiated changes (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
additional or optional insurance). Six comments noted that there is no need for a separate servicer notice to borrowers
of shortages in the escrow account, because the annual escrow statement fulfills this function. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD sees a distinction between a shortage and a deficiency in the escrow account. In a situation where the servicer
has advanced its own funds (a deficiency), HUD believes that the servicer may collect this advance quickly. In the
final rule, HUD provides servicers with three possible ways of handling borrower deficiencies that amount to less
than one month's escrow payment: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The servicer may allow a deficiency to exist and do nothing to change it; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The servicer may require the borrower to pay the deficiency within 30 days; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The servicer may allow the borrower to repay the deficiency in 2 or more equal monthly payments over a period of up
to 12 months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the deficiency is equal to or more than one month's escrow payment, then the servicer may allow a deficiency to exist
and do nothing to change it, or the servicer may allow the borrower to repay the deficiency in 2 or more equal monthly
payments over a period of up to 12 months. Moreover, if the servicer does not receive the borrower's payment within
30 days of the payment due date, then the servicer may recover the deficiency pursuant to the terms of the mortgage loan
documents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because a shortage is the difference between the current escrow account balance and the target balance, HUD believes
that shortages warrant different treatment than deficiencies. Borrowers' escrow accounts are likely to be influenced
by yearly changes in taxes, insurance, or other items that may cause a shortage at the time of an escrow account analysis.
At that time, servicers may easily adjust the borrower's monthly escrow payments for the next year. Thus, in the final
rule, HUD provides that if the servicer's escrow account analysis indicates a shortage of less than one month's escrow
payment, the servicer has three options: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The servicer may allow a shortage to exist and do nothing to change it; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The servicer may allow the borrower to pay the shortage amount within 30 days; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The servicer may allow the borrower to pay off the shortage in equal monthly payments over a 12-month period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the shortage is greater than or equal to one month's escrow account payment, then the servicer has two options: the
servicer may allow a shortage to exist and do nothing to change it; or the servicer may allow the borrower to pay off the
shortage in equal monthly payments over a 12-month period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An escrow account analysis may indicate a shortage at the time of the analysis that will produce a deficiency at a later
date. This rule does not allow servicers to anticipate deficiencies and collect on a deficiency in advance. However,
at the time of a deficiency, a servicer may conduct an escrow account analysis and seek repayment from a borrower according
to these provisions.

Timely Payments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In implementing Section 6(g) of RESPA, HUD had proposed that servicers make disbursements in a timely manner from
the escrow account, even if the escrow account had insufficient funds for such payments, as long as the borrower was
current in the borrower's principal, interest, and escrow account payments. Twenty-eight commenters opposed this
requirement. On the other hand, Fannie Mae noted that ``while the proposed rule states that servicers are not required
to make escrow account payments on delinquent accounts, Fannie Mae holds the servicer responsible for the timely
payment of taxes and insurance premiums even in situations where the borrower is delinquent on the mortgage.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After considering these comments and reviewing the legislative history of Section 6(g) of RESPA, the Department
clarifies the requirement. Section 3500.17(k) of this rule implements Section 6(g) of the statute, by requiring
servicers to advance funds to make disbursements in a timely manner as long as the servicer receives the borrower's
payment within 30 days of the payment due date. HUD clarifies that a timely payment is one in which the servicer pays
the disbursement on or before the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
earlier 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
of the deadline for available discounts or the deadline to avoid penalties. Upon advancing funds to pay a disbursement,
the servicer may seek repayment from the borrower for the deficiency pursuant to &sect;3500.17(f). If the servicer
advances payments for a borrower who is in default, however, then the servicer may recover the deficiency pursuant
to the terms of the mortgage loan documents. The Department expects that servicers will continue to make disbursements
on delinquent accounts to protect their security interests in the mortgaged properties.

Recordkeeping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule established a five-year recordkeeping requirement. Sixteen commenters stated that this requirement
would be expensive and burdensome. Several suggested that two years was a more reasonable period. Seventeen commenters
requested that HUD provide a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
standard describing the information that servicers should retain. They wanted the final rule to specify whether
servicers can retain records in hard-copy, electronic, or microfiche format. Seventeen comments requested that
the rule provide examples of noncompliance subject to penalties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the December 1993 proposed rule, HUD responded to earlier comments critical of HUD's specific recordkeeping provisions
in the December 1991 proposal. In this final rule, HUD adds clarifying language that servicers may maintain records
in hard-copy, electronic, microfiche, or any other format that reasonably assures retrieval. The Department maintains
the five-year record retention provision. It is consistent with RESPA's other retention requirements.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Forty-eight commenters suggested that the final rule not reflect the strict liability language of the proposed rule.
The majority believed that servicers should not be held liable for clerical errors, inadvertent acts, or acts of nature.
They also indicated that servicers should not be liable for expending ``best and reasonable efforts'' in complying
with the requirements. The comments advocated that penalties be based on practices and patterns of noncompliance.
The MBA concurred and stated that ``*&blank;*&blank;* HUD should determine violations that warrant a monetary penalty
based on a pattern or practice of noncompliance. Penalties would be justified in those cases where the servicer made
the same error repeatedly.'' Ten comments suggested that the rule include a cure period, in which the servicer could
submit a corrective statement to a borrower within 60 days of discovering the error. They pointed out that similar
defenses are permitted by other consumer protection statutes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Strict liability is a term used in product liability law and HUD misapplied the term in the proposed rule. The final
rule removes any reference to a strict liability standard. However, HUD continues the statutory distinction between
unintentional and intentional violations. Violations do not require any proof of intent. The statute provides for
more serious penalties in cases of a servicer's intentional disregard for the statute's requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a statement of its enforcement policy, the Department is likely to pursue cases involving a pattern and practice
of noncompliance more vigorously than solitary or minor transgressions of these provisions. HUD is less likely to
enforce penalties in cases where the servicer has taken prompt corrective action on its own initiative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Civil Penalties Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD received eight comments concerning the civil penalties procedures provisions. They suggested that HUD lengthen
the time for servicers to prepare an adequate defense. The commenters suggested that the time to respond to a notice
of intent to impose penalties be extended from 20 to 30 days. They wanted HUD to extend the period in which a servicer
presents its evidence from 45 to 60 days. They also recommended extending the period for filing for judicial review
of a decision from 20 to 30 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response, the Department extends from 20 to 30 days the initial response period to HUD's notice of intent to impose
penalties. Because the rule permits the servicer to request additional time from the administrative law judge, HUD
sees no need to extend the time for presenting evidence. Responding to comments, the final rule provides 30 days for
a party to file a petition seeking judicial review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Financial Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Seventeen commenters were concerned about the rule's effect upon the value of mortgage servicing rights. They estimated
that servicing rights may be reduced in value by 3 to 20 percent. Three commenters requested that the final rule be applicable
only to loans originated after the effective date, thus resulting in less impact on the value of servicing rights.
Four stated that capital structures would be negatively affected for institutions with servicing rights regulated
by government agencies (e.g., FDIC, OCC, OTS, Federal Reserve Board). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department recognizes that the rule has an adverse effect on the pricing of mortgage servicing. HUD's issuance
of the December 3, 1993, proposed rule has already affected the value of mortgage servicing pricing. However, as indicated
above, the Department believes that the three-year phase-in period somewhat tempers this effect. The phase-in period
allows servicers to recoup the greatest value on their servicing rights in the early years of a mortgage loan, while
the rule moves the industry to a simpler system that protects consumers as soon as practicable.

Legal Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Twenty-three commenters questioned HUD's statutory authority to mandate interest-free loans to borrowers under
RESPA. Five stated that the final rule should address compliance issues with individual State requirements. One
commenter indicated that HUD left unaddressed how State rules take precedence or supersede the final rule. One respondent
requested that the rule clarify whether RESPA establishes an escrow ceiling cushion and does not preempt State law
or contracts between lenders and borrowers. A second stated that the final rule should address the impact the regulations
will have on contractual relationships related to securitization arrangements. A third requested clarification
of loans that are exempt from RESPA provisions pending HUD's final rule. Four commenters believed that the proposed
rule could lead to an increase in escrow class action suits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes that it has full legal authority and administrative discretion to implement these escrow
accounting regulations. Section 19(a) of RESPA empowers the Secretary to prescribe rules and regulations to achieve
the purpose of the Act. This final rule reflects HUD's interpretation of the statute and HUD's reaction to public comments
on the proposed rule. In issuing this rule, HUD considers the needs of borrowers and servicers and interprets the statute
to respond to those needs. For example, in response to comments regarding interest-free loans, HUD recast certain
provisions in the final rule. One of HUD's goals here is to promote Section 6's provisions that disbursements from
escrow be made timely. At the same time, the final rule responds to servicers' needs for prompt reimbursement of their
advances, and is fair to the borrower. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the possible preemption of State laws, the Department recognizes that many of the States have enacted laws
relating to escrow accounts. Section 18 of RESPA provides: ``This Act does not annul, alter, or affect, or exempt any
person subject to the provisions of (RESPA) from complying with, the laws of any State with respect to settlement practices,
except to the extent that those laws are inconsistent with any provision of (RESPA), and then only to the extent of the
inconsistency.'' 12 USC 2616. Given this statutory language, and further statutory instruction that a state statute
is not to be preempted if it gives greater protection to the consumer, the Department believes it should make specific
preemption decisions on a case-by-case basis. The current RESPA rule (&sect;3500.13(c)) sets forth provisions
for requesting preemption determinations.

to conform with these regulatory changes. HUD therefore amends &sect;203.550(a) to clarify that the FHA mortgagee
shall use the procedures contained in &sect;3500.17 to compute the amount of escrow, the methods of collection and
accounting, and the disbursement of escrow account items. HUD also amends &sect;234.38 to conform with the final
rule, and retains the language of &sect;203.550(c) that permits FHA mortgagees to estimate escrow requirements
based on the probable payments required for special assessment items, such as water purification escrow funds.

Aggregate Accounting At Settlement. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) If the settlement agent uses a cushion in determining the initial entries for lines 1000&hyph;1008 of the HUD&hyph;1
or HUD&hyph;1A settlement statement, then the settlement agent shall make an adjustment to reflect the appropriate
starting balance in the escrow account under the aggregate accounting method. The cushion using the aggregate accounting
is computed according to the steps set out in &sect;3500.17(d). The adjustment reflects the difference between the
amounts collected as a cushion in the 1000 series for individual escrow items under the single-item accounting method
and the permissible cushion under the aggregate accounting method. The servicer shall enter the aggregate adjustment
amount on the last line in the 1000 series of the HUD&hyph;1 or HUD&hyph;1A statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) During the phase-in period, as defined in &sect;3500.17(b), an alternative procedure is available. The settlement
agent may initially calculate the 1000 series deposits for the HUD&hyph;1 and HUD&hyph;1A settlement statement
using single-item analysis with only a one-month cushion (unless the mortgage loan documents indicate a smaller
amount). In the escrow account analysis conducted within 45 days of settlement, however, the servicer shall adjust
the escrow account to reflect the aggregate accounting balance. Appendix F to this part sets out examples of aggregate
analysis. Appendix A to this part contains instructions for completing the HUD&hyph;1 or HUD&hyph;1A settlement
statements using an aggregate analysis adjustment and the alternative process during the phase-in period.

General.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section sets out the requirements for an escrow account that a lender establishes in connection with a federally
related mortgage loan. It sets limits for escrow accounts using calculations based on monthly payments and disbursements
within a calendar year. If an escrow account involves biweekly or any other payment period, the requirements in this
section shall be modified accordingly. Appendix H to this part provides an example of the transposition from monthly
to biweekly accounting and Appendix J to this part provides an example of a 3-year accounting cycle that may be used
in accordance with paragraph (c)(9) of this section.

 (1) A lender or servicer (hereafter servicer) shall not require a borrower to deposit into any escrow account, created
in connection with a federally related mortgage loan, more than the following amounts: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (i) Charges at settlement or upon creation of an escrow account.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 At the time a servicer creates an escrow account for a borrower, the servicer may charge the borrower an amount sufficient
to pay the charges respecting the mortgaged property, such as taxes and insurance, which are attributable to the period
from the date such payment(s) were last paid until the initial payment date. In addition, the servicer may charge the
borrower a cushion that shall be no greater than one-sixth (1/6) of the estimated total annual payments from the escrow
account. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Charges during the life of the escrow account.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Throughout the life of an escrow account, the servicer may charge the borrower a monthly sum equal to one-twelfth (1/12)
of the total annual escrow payments which the servicer reasonably anticipates paying from the account. In addition,
the servicer may add an amount to maintain a cushion no greater than one-sixth (1/6) of the estimated total annual payments
from the account. However, if a servicer determines through an escrow account analysis that there is a shortage or
deficiency, the servicer may require the borrower to pay additional deposits to make up the shortage or eliminate
the deficiency, subject to the limitations set forth in &sect;3500.17(f).

 Before establishing an escrow account, the servicer shall conduct an escrow account analysis to determine the amount
the borrower shall deposit into the escrow account, subject to the limitations of &sect;3500.17(c)(1)(i) and the
amount of the borrower's periodic payments into the escrow account, subject to the limitations of &sect;3500.17(c)(1)(ii).
In conducting the escrow account analysis, the servicer shall estimate the disbursement amounts according to &sect;3500.17(c)(7).
Pursuant to &sect;3500.17(k), the servicer shall use a date on or before the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
earlier
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of the deadline to take advantage of discounts, if available, or the deadline to avoid a penalty as the disbursement
date for the escrow item. Upon completing the initial escrow account analysis, the servicer shall prepare and deliver
an initial escrow account statement to the borrower, as set forth in &sect;3500.17(g). The servicer shall use the
escrow account analysis to determine whether a surplus, shortage or deficiency exists since settlement and shall
make any adjustments to the account pursuant to &sect;3500.17(f).

 For each escrow account, the servicer shall conduct an escrow account analysis at the completion of the escrow account
computation year to determine the borrower's monthly escrow account payments for the next computation year, subject
to the limitations of &sect;3500.17(c)(1)(ii). In conducting the escrow account analysis, the servicer shall estimate
the disbursement amounts according to &sect;3500.17(c)(7). Pursuant to &sect;3500.17(k), the servicer shall
use a date on or before the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
earlier
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of the deadline to take advantage of discounts, if available, or the deadline to avoid a penalty as the disbursement
date for the escrow item. The servicer shall use the escrow account analysis to determine whether a surplus, shortage
or deficiency exists and shall make any adjustments to the account pursuant to &sect;3500.17(f). Upon completing
an escrow account analysis, the servicer shall prepare and submit an annual escrow account statement to the borrower,
as set forth in &sect;3500.17(i).

Acceptable accounting methods to determine escrow limits.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pre-rule accounts.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For pre-rule accounts, servicers may use either single-item analysis or aggregate-analysis during the phase-in
period. In conducting the escrow account analysis, servicers shall use ``month-end'' accounting. Under month-end
accounting, the timing of the disbursements and payments within the month is irrelevant. As of the conversion date,
all pre-rule accounts shall comply with the requirements for post-rule accounts in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this
section. During the phase-in period, the transfer of servicing of a pre-rule account to another servicer does not
convert the account to a post-rule account. After the effective date of this rule, refinancing transactions (as defined
in &sect;3500.2) shall comply with the requirements for post-rule accounts.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Post-rule accounts.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For post-rule accounts, servicers shall use aggregate accounting to conduct an escrow account analysis. In conducting
the escrow account analysis, servicers shall use ``month-end'' accounting. Under month-end accounting, the timing
of the disbursements and payments within the month is irrelevant.

Cushion.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For post-rule accounts, the cushion shall be no greater than one-sixth (1/6) of the estimated total annual disbursements
from the escrow account using aggregate analysis accounting. For pre-rule accounts, the cushion may not exceed the
total of one-sixth of the estimated annual disbursements for each escrow account item using single-item analysis
accounting. In determining the cushion using single-item analysis, a servicer shall not divide an escrow account
item into sub-accounts, even if the payee requires installment payments.

Restrictions on pre-accrual.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For pre-rule accounts, a servicer shall not require any pre-accrual that results in the escrow account balance exceeding
the limits of paragraph (c)(1) of this section. In addition, if the mortgage documents in a pre-rule account are silent
about the amount of pre-accrual, the servicer shall not require in excess of one month of pre-accrual, subject to the
additional limitations provided in paragraph (c)(8) of this section. For post-rule accounts, a servicer shall not
practice pre-accrual.

Servicer estimates of disbursement amounts.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 To conduct an escrow account analysis, the servicer shall estimate the amount of escrow account items to be disbursed.
If the servicer knows the charge for an escrow item in the next computation year, then the servicer shall use that amount
in estimating disbursement amounts. If the charge is unknown to the servicer, the servicer may base the estimate on
the preceding year's charge, or the preceding year's charge as modified by an amount not exceeding the most recent
year's change in the national Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers (CPI, all items). In cases of unassessed
new construction, the servicer may base an estimate on the assessment of comparable residential property in the market
area.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provisions in mortgage documents.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The servicer shall examine the mortgage loan documents to determine the applicable cushion and limitations on pre-accrual
for each escrow account. If the mortgage loan documents provide for lower cushion limits or less pre-accrual than
this rule, then the terms of the loan documents apply. Where the terms of any mortgage loan document allow greater payments
to an escrow account than allowed by this rule, then this rule controls the applicable limits. Where the mortgage loan
documents do not specifically establish an escrow account, whether a servicer may establish an escrow account for
the loan is a matter for determination by State law. If the mortgage loan document is silent on the escrow account limits
(for cushion or pre-accrual) and a servicer establishes an escrow account under State law, then the limitations of
this rule apply unless State law provides for a lower amount. If the loan documents provide for escrow accounts up to
the RESPA limits, then the servicer may require the maximum amounts consistent with this rule, unless an applicable
State law sets a lesser amount.

Assessments for periods longer than one year.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Some escrow account items may be billed for periods longer than one year. For example, servicers may need to collect
flood insurance or water purification escrow funds for payment every three years. In such cases, the servicer shall
estimate the borrower's payments for a full cycle of disbursements. For a flood insurance premium payable every 3
years, the servicer shall collect the payments reflecting 36 equal monthly amounts. For two out of the three years,
however, the account balance may not reach its low monthly balance because the low point will be on a three-year cycle,
as compared to an annual one. The annual escrow account statement shall explain this situation (see example in Appendix
J to this part).

Methods of escrow account analysis.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Paragraph (c) of this section prescribes acceptable accounting methods. The following sets forth the steps servicers
shall use to determine whether their use of an acceptable accounting method conforms with the limitations in &sect;3500.17(c)(1).
The steps set forth in this section derive maximum limits. Servicers may use accounting procedures that result in
lower target balances. In particular, servicers may use a cushion less than the permissible cushion or no cushion
at all. This section does not require the use of a cushion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Aggregate analysis.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) When a servicer uses aggregate analysis in conducting the escrow account analysis, the target balances may not
exceed the balances computed according to the following arithmetic operations: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (A) The servicer first projects a trial balance for the account as a whole over the next computation year (a trial running
balance). In doing so the servicer assumes that it will make estimated disbursements on or before the earlier of the
deadline to take advantage of discounts, if available, or the deadline to avoid a penalty. The servicer does not use
pre-accrual on these disbursement dates. The servicer also assumes that the borrower will make monthly payments
equal to one-twelfth of the estimated total annual escrow account disbursements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (B) The servicer then examines the monthly trial balances and adds to the first monthly balance an amount just sufficient
to bring the lowest monthly trial balance to zero, and adjusts all other monthly balances accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (C) The servicer then adds to the monthly balances the permissible cushion. The cushion is two months of the borrower's
escrow payments to the servicer or a lesser amount specified by State law or the mortgage document (net of any increases
or decreases because of prior year shortages or surpluses, respectively). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lowest monthly balance.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under aggregate analysis, the lowest monthly target balance for the account shall be less than or equal to one-sixth
of the estimated total annual escrow account disbursements or a lesser amount specified by State law or the mortgage
document. The target balances that the servicer derives using these steps yield the maximum limit for the escrow account.
Appendix F to this part illustrates these steps. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (2)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Single-item or other non-aggregate analysis method.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) When a servicer uses single-item analysis or any hybrid accounting method in conducting an escrow account analysis
during the phase-in period, the target balances may not exceed the balances computed according to the following arithmetic
operations: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (A) The servicer first projects a trial balance for each item over the next computation year (a trial running balance).
In doing so the servicer assumes that it will make estimated disbursements on or before the earlier of the deadline
to take advantage of discounts, if available, or the deadline to avoid a penalty. The servicer does not use pre-accrual
on these disbursement dates. The servicer also assumes that the borrower will make periodic payments equal to one-twelfth
of the estimated total annual escrow account disbursements.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(B) The servicer then examines the monthly trial balance for each escrow account item and adds to the first monthly
balance for each separate item an amount just sufficient to bring the lowest monthly trial balance for that item to
zero, and then adjusts all other monthly balances accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The servicer then adds the permissible cushion, if any, to the monthly balance for the separate escrow account
item. The permissible cushion is two months of escrow payments for the escrow account item (net of any increases or
decreases because of prior year shortages or surpluses, respectively) or a lesser amount specified by State law or
the mortgage document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) The servicer then examines the balances for each item to make certain that the lowest monthly balance for that item
is less than or equal to one-sixth of the estimated total annual escrow account disbursements for that item or a lesser
amount specified by State law or the mortgage document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) In performing an escrow account analysis using single-item analysis, servicers may account for each escrow
account item separately, but servicers shall not further divide accounts into sub-accounts, even if the payee of
a disbursement requires installment payments. The target balances that the servicer derives using these steps yield
the maximum limit for the escrow account. Appendix F to this part illustrates these steps.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Transfer of servicing.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) If the new servicer changes either the monthly payment amount or the accounting method used by the transferor (old)
servicer, then the new servicer shall provide the borrower with an initial escrow account statement within 60 days
of the date of servicing transfer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Where a new servicer provides an initial escrow account statement upon the transfer of servicing, the new servicer
shall use the effective date of the transfer of servicing to establish the new escrow account computation year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Where the new servicer retains the monthly payments and accounting method used by the transferor servicer, then
the new servicer may continue to use the escrow account computation year established by the transferor servicer or
may choose to establish a different computation year using a short-year statement. At the completion of the escrow
account computation year or any short year, the new servicer shall perform an escrow analysis and provide the borrower
with an annual escrow account statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The new servicer shall treat shortages, surpluses and deficiencies in the transferred escrow account according
to the procedures set forth in &sect;3500.17(f). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(i) As noted in &sect;&sect;3500.17(c)(2) and (3), the servicer shall conduct an escrow account analysis upon establishing
an escrow account and at completion of the escrow account computation year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The servicer may conduct an escrow account analysis at other times during the escrow computation year. If a servicer
advances funds in paying a disbursement, which is not the result of a borrower's payment default under the underlying
mortgage document, then the servicer shall conduct an escrow account analysis to determine the extent of the deficiency
before seeking repayment of the funds from the borrower under this paragraph (f). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Surpluses. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) If an escrow account analysis discloses a surplus, the servicer shall, within 30 days from the date of the analysis,
refund the surplus to the borrower if the surplus is greater than or equal to 50 dollars ($50). If the surplus is less
than 50 dollars ($50), the servicer may refund such amount to the borrower, or credit such amount against the next year's
escrow payments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) These provisions regarding surpluses apply if the borrower is current at the time of the escrow account analysis.
A borrower is current if the servicer receives the borrower's payments within 30 days of the payment due date. If the
servicer does not receive the borrower's payment within 30 days of the payment due date, then the servicer may retain
the surplus in the escrow account pursuant to the terms of the mortgage loan documents.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Shortages. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) If an escrow account analysis discloses a shortage of less than one month's escrow account payment, then the servicer
has three possible courses of action: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The servicer may allow a shortage to exist and do nothing to change it; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The servicer may allow the borrower to pay the shortage amount within 30 days; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The servicer may allow the borrower to repay the shortage in equal monthly payments over a 12-month period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If an escrow account analysis discloses a shortage that is greater than or equal to one month's escrow account
payment, then the servicer has two possible courses of action: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The servicer may allow a shortage to exist and do nothing to change it; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The servicer shall allow the borrower to repay the shortage in equal monthly payments over a 12-month period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Deficiency.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If the escrow account analysis confirms a deficiency, then the servicer may require the borrower to pay additional
monthly deposits to the account to eliminate the deficiency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If the deficiency is less than one month's escrow account payment, then the servicer: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) May allow the deficiency to exist and do nothing to change it; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) May require the borrower to repay the deficiency within 30 days; or (C) May allow the borrower to repay the deficiency
in 2 or more equal monthly payments over a period of up to 12 months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the deficiency is greater than or equal to 1 month's escrow account payment, the servicer may allow the deficiency
to exist and do nothing to change it or may allow the borrower to repay the deficiency in 2 or more equal monthly payments
over a period of up to 12 months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) These provisions regarding deficiencies apply if the borrower is current at the time of the escrow account analysis.
A borrower is current if the servicer receives the borrower's payments within 30 days of the payment due date. If the
servicer does not receive the borrower's payment within 30 days of the payment due date, then the servicer may recover
the deficiency pursuant to the terms of the mortgage loan documents.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice of Shortage or Deficiency in Escrow Account. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The servicer shall notify the borrower at least once during the escrow account computation year if there is a shortage

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted in &sect;3500.17(c)(2), the servicer shall conduct an escrow account analysis before establishing an escrow
account to determine the amount the borrower shall deposit into the escrow account, subject to the limitations of
&sect;3500.17(c)(1)(i). After conducting the escrow account analysis for each escrow account, the servicer shall
submit an initial escrow account statement to the borrower at settlement or within 45 calendar days of settlement
for escrow accounts that are established as a condition of the loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The initial escrow account statement shall include the amount of the borrower's monthly mortgage payment and
the portion of the monthly payment going into the escrow account and shall itemize the estimated taxes, insurance
premiums, and other charges that the servicer reasonably anticipates to be paid from the escrow account during the
escrow account computation year and the anticipated disbursement dates of those charges. The initial escrow account
statement shall indicate the amount that the servicer selects as a cushion. The statement shall include a trial running
balance for the account.

 This paragraph contains an exemption to the provision of &sect;3500.17(i)(1). If at the time the servicer conducts
the escrow account analysis the borrower is more than 30 days overdue, then the servicer is exempt from the requirements
of submitting an annual escrow account statement to the borrower under &sect;3500.17(i). This exemption also applies
in situations where the servicer has brought an action for foreclosure under the underlying mortgage loan.

Timely payments.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) If the terms of any federally related mortgage loan require the borrower to make payments to an escrow account,
the servicer shall pay the disbursements in a timely manner, that is, by the disbursement date, so long as the borrower's
payment is not more than 30 days overdue. In calculating the disbursement date, the servicer shall use a date on or before
the
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 earlier
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of the deadline to take advantage of discounts, if available, or the deadline to avoid a penalty. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The servicer shall advance funds to make disbursements in a timely manner so long as the borrower's payment is not
more than 30 days overdue. Upon advancing funds to pay a disbursement, the servicer may seek repayment from the borrower
for the deficiency pursuant to &sect;3500.17(f). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
System of recordkeeping. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Each servicer shall keep records, which may involve electronic storage, microfiche storage, or any method of
computerized storage, so long as the information is easily retrievable, reflecting the servicer's handling of each
borrower's escrow account. The servicer's records shall include, but not be limited to, the payment of amounts into
and from the escrow account and the submission of initial and annual escrow account statements to the borrower. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The servicer responsible for servicing the borrower's escrow account shall maintain the records for that account
for a period of at least five years after the servicer last serviced the escrow account. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A servicer shall provide the Secretary with information contained in the servicer's records for a specific escrow
account, or for a number or class of escrow accounts, within 30 days of the Secretary's written request for the information.
The servicer shall convert any information contained in electronic storage, microfiche or computerized storage
to paper copies for review by the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) To aid in investigations, the Secretary may also issue an administrative subpoena for the production of documents,
and for the testimony of such witnesses as the Secretary deems advisable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the subpoenaed party refuses to obey the Secretary's administrative subpoena, the Secretary is authorized
to seek a court order requiring compliance with the subpoena from any United States district court. Failure to obey
such an order of the court may be punished as contempt of court. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Borrowers may seek information contained in the servicer's records by complying with the provisions set forth
in 12 U.S.C. 2605(e) and &sect;3500.21(f). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) After receiving a request (by letter or subpoena) from the Department for information relating to whether a servicer
submitted an escrow account statement to the borrower, the servicer shall respond within 30 days. If the servicer
is unable to provide the Department with such information, the Secretary shall deem that lack of information to be
evidence of the servicer's failure to submit the statement to the borrower.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Penalties.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) A servicer's failure to submit to a borrower an initial or annual escrow account statement meeting the requirements
of this part shall constitute a violation of the RESPA and this section. For each such violation, the Secretary shall
assess a civil penalty of 50 dollars ($50), except that the total of the assessed penalties shall not exceed $100,000
for any one servicer for violations that occur during any consecutive 12-month period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Violations described in paragraph (m)(1) of this section do not require any proof of intent. However, if a lender
or servicer is shown to have intentionally disregarded the requirements that it submit the escrow account statement
to the borrower, then the Secretary shall assess a civil penalty of $100 for each violation, with no limit on the total
amount of the penalty.

Notice of intent to impose civil money penalties. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Whenever the Secretary intends to impose a civil money penalty for violations of section 10(c) of RESPA (12 U.S.C.
2609(c)), the responsible program official, or his or her designee, shall serve a written Notice of Intent to Impose
Civil Money Penalties (Notice of Intent) upon any servicer on which the Secretary intends to impose the penalty. A
copy of the Notice of Intent must be filed with the Chief Docket Clerk, Office of Administrative Law Judges, at the address
provided in the Notice of Intent. The Notice of Intent will provide: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A short, plain statement of the facts upon which the Secretary has determined that a civil money penalty should
be imposed, including a brief description of the specific violations under 12 U.S.C. 2609(c) with which the servicer
is charged and whether such violations are believed to be intentional or unintentional in nature, or a combination
thereof; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The amount of the civil money penalty that the Secretary intends to impose and whether the limitations in 12 U.S.C.
2609(d)(1), apply; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The right of the servicer to a hearing on the record to appeal the Secretary's preliminary determination to impose
a civil penalty;

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Answer. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To appeal the imposition of a penalty, a servicer shall, within 30 days after receiving service of the Notice of Intent,
file a written Answer with the Chief Docket Clerk, Office of Administrative Law Judges, Department of Housing and
Urban Development, at the address provided in the Notice of Intent. The Answer shall include a statement that the servicer
admits, denies, or does not have (and is unable to obtain) sufficient information to admit or deny each allegation
made in the Notice of Intent. A statement of lack of information shall have the effect of a denial. Any allegation that
is not denied shall be deemed admitted. Failure to submit an Answer within the required period of time will result in
a decision by the Administrative Law Judge based upon the Department's submission of evidence in the Notice of Intent.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Submission of evidence. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A servicer that receives the Notice of Intent has a right to present evidence. Evidence must be submitted within 45
calendar days from the date of service of the Notice of Intent, or by such other time as may be established by the Administrative
Law Judge (ALJ). The servicer's failure to submit evidence within the required period of time will result in a decision
by the Administrative Law Judge based upon the Department's submission of evidence in the Notice of Intent. The servicer
may present evidence of the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The servicer did submit the required escrow account statement(s) to the borrower(s); or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Even if the servicer did not submit the required statement(s), that the failure was not the result of an intentional
disregard of the requirements of the RESPA (for purposes of determining the penalty). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Review of the record. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administrative Law Judge will review the evidence submitted by the servicer, if any, and that submitted by the
Department. The Administrative Law Judge shall make a determination based upon a review of the written record, except
that the Administrative Law Judge may order an oral hearing if he or she finds that the determination turns on the credibility
or veracity of a witness, or that the matter cannot be resolved by review of the documentary evidence. If the Administrative
Law Judge decides that an oral hearing is appropriate, then the procedural rules set forth at 24 CFR part 30, subpart
E, shall apply, to the extent that they are not inconsistent with this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Burden of Proof. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The burden of proof or the burden of going forward with the evidence shall be upon the proponent of an action. The Department's
submission of evidence that the servicer's system of records lacks information that the servicer submitted the escrow
account statement(s) to the borrower(s) shall satisfy the Department's burden. Upon the Department's presentation
of evidence of this lack of information in the servicer's system of records, the burden of proof shifts from the Secretary
to the servicer to provide evidence that it submitted the statement(s) to the borrower. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

Determination of the Administrative Law Judge. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Following the hearing or the review of the written record, the Administrative Law Judge shall issue a decision
that shall contain findings of fact, conclusions of law, and the amount of any penalties imposed. The decision shall
include a determination of whether the servicer has failed to submit any required statements and, if so, whether the
servicer's failure was the result of an intentional disregard for the law's requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The Administrative Law Judge shall issue the decision to all parties within 30 days of the submission of the evidence
or the post-hearing briefs, whichever is the last to occur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

If the settlement agent uses a cushion in determining the initial entries for lines 1000&hyph;1008 of the HUD&hyph;1
or HUD&hyph;1A settlement statement, then the settlement agent shall make an adjustment to reflect the appropriate
starting balance in the escrow account under an aggregate accounting method. The cushion using the aggregate accounting
is computed according to the steps set out in &sect;3500.17(d). The adjustment reflects the difference between the
amounts collected as a cushion on the lines 1000&hyph;1008 for individual escrow items and the permissible cushion
under the aggregate accounting method. The servicer shall enter the aggregate adjustment amount on the final line
of the 1000 series of the HUD&hyph;1 or the HUD&hyph;1A statement. The amount will always be $&hyph;0&hyph; or a negative
number. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the phase-in period, as defined in &sect;3500.17(b), an alternative procedure is available. If a servicer
has not yet conducted the escrow account analysis to determine the aggregate accounting starting balance, the settlement
agent may initially calculate the 1000 series deposits for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD&hyph;1 and HUD&hyph;1A settlement statement using single-item analysis with a one-month cushion (unless the
mortgage loan documents indicate a smaller amount). In the escrow account analysis conducted within 45 days of settlement,
the servicer shall adjust the escrow account to reflect the aggregate accounting balance.
