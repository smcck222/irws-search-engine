 The Board is seeking public comment on a proposed exception to the anti-tying restrictions of section 106 of the Bank
Holding Company Act Amendments of 1970 and the Board's Regulation Y. The proposed amendment would establish a ``safe
harbor'' permitting a bank to offer a discount on any product or package of products if a customer maintains a combined
minimum balance in deposits and other products specified by the bank.

Background

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 106(b) of the Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of 1970 (12 U.S.C. 1972) generally prohibits a bank from
tying a product or service to another product or service offered by the bank or by any of its affiliates.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 A bank engages in a tie for purposes of section 106 by: (1) offering a discount on a product or service (the ``tying product'')
on the condition that the customer obtain some additional product or service (the ``tied product'') from the bank
or from any of its affiliates; or (2) allowing the purchase of a product or service only if the customer purchases another
product or service from the bank or from any of its affiliates. Violations of section 106 can be addressed by the Board
through an enforcement action, by the Department of Justice through a request for an injunction, or by a customer or
other party through an action for damages. 12 U.S.C. 1972, 1973, and 1975.

Section 106 contains an explicit exception (the ``statutory traditional bank product exception'') that permits
a bank to tie a product or service to a loan, discount, deposit, or trust service offered by that bank. The Board has recently
extended this exception by providing that a bank or any of its affiliates also may vary the consideration for a traditional
bank product on condition that the customer obtain another traditional bank product from an affiliate (the ``regulatory
traditional bank product exception'').

Section 106 authorizes the Board to grant exceptions to its restrictions by regulation or order. On October 19, 1994,
the Board granted an exemption permitting the subsidiary banks of Fleet Financial Group, Inc., Providence, Rhode
Island (Fleet) to offer a discount on the monthly service fee charged for the ``Fleet One Account'' to a customer who
maintains a combined minimum balance of $10,000 in one or more products selected by the customer from a menu of eligible
Fleet products. The Board decided that, to the extent that Fleet's combined-balance discount was prohibited by section
106, an exemption was warranted given the public benefits and absence of anti-competitive concerns generated by
the arrangement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Fleet One Account provides a customer, for a $14 monthly fee, discounts and premiums on various Fleet services,
such as free checking and lower installment loan rates. Under the Board's order, Fleet may waive the $14 fee for any
customer who maintains a $10,000 combined balance among the following eligible products: (1) deposits and certain
loans at the Fleet bank at which the customer establishes the Fleet One Account;
<FOOTCITE></FOOTCITE>

<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 (2) credit card balances at a Fleet bank; (3) investment securities held at Fleet's brokerage subsidiary and (4) shares
held in a family of mutual funds advised by a Fleet subsidiary. All products offered as part of these arrangements are
separately available to customers at competitive prices.

Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board is proposing to use its statutory authority to grant a regulatory exception to section 106 for combined-balance
discount arrangements akin to that offered by Fleet. The Board is proposing the exception in order to provide certainty
as to the general permissibility of combined-balance discounts, and because it believes that such discounts are
pro-consumer and not anti-competitive.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The combined-balance discount offered by Fleet appears to be covered by section 106, which prohibits a bank from offering
a discount on a product or service on the condition that the customer obtain some additional product or service from
the bank or from any of its affiliates. Although the discount on the Fleet One Account fee is not conditioned on any 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
particular 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
product being purchased, the customer is required to purchase 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
some 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
product or products from the menu of eligible products in order to receive the discount.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 Furthermore, the packaging of some of those products in the form proposed by Fleet does not appear to qualify for the
statutory or regulatory traditional bank product exception.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Coverage of combined-balance discounts also appears to be consistent with the purposes of section 106. Section 106
was enacted because of Congress's concern that banks would use their power over credit to gain a competitive advantage
in other markets. Ordinarily, a tying arrangement involves an attempt to gain a competitive advantage in one product
market, but the fact that a bank is attempting to gain a smaller advantage in a larger number of product markets raises
similar concerns.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Board's regulations, a bank or nonbank could offer a discount on brokerage services on condition that a customer
purchase a traditional bank product from the bank or company offering the brokerage services or from an affiliate.
However, no exception allows the reverse case, where discounts on bank products are being used to induce customers
to purchase brokerage services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, although the discount plan offered by Fleet is structured so as to avoid any anti-competitive effects,
the Board notes that in other cases the number and attractiveness of traditional bank products offered in such an arrangement
could be substantially less than those offered by Fleet, and the effect of the tie to non-traditional products that
much stronger. In addition, there is the potential for such discount plans to be manipulated in order to have the same
effect as a classic tie_that is, structured so that the customer is effectively required to purchase one product in
order to receive, or to receive a discount on, another product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Exception 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In deciding to permit Fleet to offer the Fleet One Account, the Board concluded that the combined-balance discount
on the Fleet One Account was consistent with the type of banking relationships that section 106 recognized were important
to preserve.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 Section 106 preserves such relationships through the statutory traditional bank product exception, which permits
a bank to tie a product or service to a loan, discount, deposit, or trust service offered by that bank. The legislative
history of section 106 notes that this exception was intended to preserve a customer's ability to negotiate the price
of multiple banking services with the bank on the basis of the customer's entire relationship with the bank. The proposed
exception serves the same purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board also granted Fleet an exemption allowing Fleet banks to condition the Fleet One Account on a customer's obtaining
two products from Fleet, but the Board is not proposing to make this exemption broadly available through regulation.
Rather, the Board has concluded that such exemptions should be granted on a case-by-case basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Moreover, under the statutory and regulatory traditional bank product exceptions, a bank already could offer a combined-balance
discount on an account where all the products in the arrangement were traditional bank products (loans, discounts,
deposits, and trust services). Granting an exception for a combined-balance discount would simply permit the bank
to increase customer choice by adding a customer's securities brokerage account or other non-traditional products
to the menu of traditional products that count toward the minimum balance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these reasons, the Board is proposing to establish, through a regulatory exception, a safe harbor for arrangements
offering benefits similar to those in Fleet. The proposed safe harbor is not only consistent with the statute's goal
of preserving traditional banking relationships, but also its concerns about anti-competitive behavior. The proposal
requires that the offering bank offer deposits and that all such deposits be considered in determining whether the
customer has reached the minimum balance required to waive the relevant fee. Furthermore, all products offered as
part of the arrangement would be required to be separately available for purchase at competitive prices.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 Because a customer could qualify for a combined-balance discount based solely on deposit balances and because the
bank would be required to offer customers all products involved in the arrangement separately and at competitive
prices, a customer would not have an incentive to establish a brokerage account, or obtain any other product, that
the customer did not want in order to obtain the discount. For this reason, the Board does not believe that the proposed
rule would allow coercive or anticompetitive practices, or otherwise contravene the purposes of section 106.

The Board's anti-tying regulation currently conditions all regulatory exceptions on all products involved in the
tying arrangement being separately available for purchase, and that condition would apply to the proposed exception.
The Board has sought comment on an amendment to this condition providing that products be separately available for
purchase ``at competitive prices.'' 59 FR 39709 (August 4, 1994).

Under antitrust precedent, concerns over tying arrangements are substantially reduced where the buyer is free to
take either product by itself even though the seller also may offer the two items as a unit at a single price.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice proposes to establish Class E airspace areas at Mobile, AL; Fort Myers, FL; Tallahassee, FL; Columbus,
GA; Savannah, GA and Greer, SC. Presently, these areas are designated as Class C airspace when the associated control
tower is in operation. However, controlled airspace to the surface is needed when the control towers at these locations
are closed. The intended effect of the action is to be provided adequate Class E Airspace for instrument flight rule
(IFR) operations when these control towers are closed.

The Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class
E airspace at Mobile, AL; Fort Myers, FL; Tallahassee, FL; Columbus, GA; Savannah, GA and Greer, SC. Currently, this
airspace is designated Class C when the associated control tower is in operation at these locations. Controlled airspace
to the surface is needed when the control towers are closed at Mobile, AL; Fort Myers, FL; Tallahassee, FL; Columbus,
GA; Savannah, GA and Greer, SC. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate Class E airspace for IFR
operations at these airports when these control towers are closed. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based
on North American Datum 83. Designations for Class E airspace extending upward from above the surface are published
in Paragraph 6002 of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994 and effective September 16, 1994 which is incorporated by
reference in CFR 71.1 effective September 16, 1994. The Class E airspace designation listed in this document would
be published subsequently in the Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal would establish new jet routes and modify existing jet routes in the Miami, FL, area. Establishing new
jet routes and realigning existing routes are necessary as a result of the commissioning of the Virginia Key, FL, Very
High Frequency Omnidirectional Range and Distance Measuring Equipment (VOR/DME).

The Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish and
to alter various jet routes in the Miami, FL, area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1992, Hurricane Andrew rendered the Biscayne Bay, FL, Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (VOR) inoperative.
The Biscayne Bay VOR was a navigational aid serving air traffic in the Miami terminal airspace. Consequently, several
of the jet routes previously based on the Biscayne Bay Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range had to be realigned
with other navigational aids. The Virginia Key VOR/DME is being commissioned to replace the Biscayne Bay VORTAC to
support the air traffic operations in the Miami, FL, area. Commissioning of the new, Virginia Key VOR/DME, navigational
aid will necessitate the realignment of existing routes. Additionally, the establishment of several new jet routes
is necessary to provide additional support for air traffic operations in the Miami area. Jet routes are published
in paragraph 2004 of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective September 16, 1994, which is incorporated
by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The jet routes listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore - (1) is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

ICAO Considerations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
As part of this proposal relate to navigable airspace outside the United States, this notice is submitted in accordance
with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) International Standards and Recommended Practices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicability of International Standards and Recommended Practices by the Air Traffic Rules and Procedures Service,
FAA, in areas outside domestic airspace of the United States is governed by Article 12 of, and Annex 11 to, the Convention
on International Civil Aviation, which pertains to the establishment of air navigational facilities and services
necessary to promote the safe, orderly, and expeditious flow of civil air traffic. Their purpose is to ensure that
civil aircraft operations on international air routes is carried out under uniform conditions designed to improve
the safety and efficiency of air operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The International Standards and Recommended Practices in Annex 11 apply in those parts of the airspace under the jurisdiction
of a contracting state, derived from ICAO, wherein air traffic services are provided and also whenever a contracting
state accepts the responsibility of providing air traffic services over high seas or in airspace of undetermined
sovereignty. A contracting state accepting such responsibility may apply the International Standards and Recommended
Practices in a manner consistent with that adopted for airspace under its domestic jurisdiction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with Article 3 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation, Chicago, 1944, state aircraft are
exempt from the provisions of Annex 11 and its Standards and Recommended Practices. As a contracting state, the United
States agreed by Article 3(d) that its state aircraft will be operated in international airspace with due regard for
the safety of civil aircraft.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since this action involves, in part, the designation of navigable airspace outside the United States, the Administrator
is consulting with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense in accordance with the provisions of Executive
Order 10854.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal would establish new Federal airways and modify existing airways in the Miami, FL, area. Establishing
new airways and realigning existing airways are necessary because of the commissioning of the Virginia Keys, FL (VKZ)
Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range and Distance Measuring Equipment (VOR/DME).

The Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish and
alter various Federal airways in the Miami, FL, area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1992, Hurricane Andrew rendered the Biscayne Bay, FL, Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (VOR) inoperative.
Biscayne Bay VOR was a significant navigational aid serving air traffic in the Miami terminal airspace. Consequently,
several of the airways previously based, in part, on the Biscayne Bay VOR had to be realigned with other navigational
aids. The Virginia Key VOR/DME is being commissioned to replace the Biscayne Bay VORTAC to support the air traffic
operations in the Miami, FL, area. Commissioning of the new, Virginia Key VOR/DME, navigational aid will necessitate
the realignment of existing routes. Also, a new airway would be established to provide additional support for air
traffic operations in the Miami area. Domestic VOR Federal airways are published in paragraph 6010(a) of FAA Order
7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective September 16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The
Domestic VOR Federal airways listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore - (1) is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. ICAO Considerations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of this proposal relates to navigable airspace outside the United States, this notice is submitted in accordance
with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) International Standards and Recommended Practices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicability of International Standards and Recommended Practices by the Air Traffic Rules and Procedures Service,
FAA, in areas outside domestic airspace of the United States is governed by Article 12 of, and Annex 11 to, the Convention
on International Civil Aviation, which pertains to the establishment of air navigational facilities and services
necessary to promote the safe, orderly, and expeditious flow of civil air traffic. Their purpose is to ensure that
civil aircraft operations on international air routes is carried out under uniform conditions designed to improve
the safety and efficiency of air operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The International Standards and Recommended Practices in Annex 11 apply in those parts of the airspace under the jurisdiction
of a contracting state, derived from ICAO, wherein air traffic services are provided and also whenever a contracting
state accepts the responsibility of providing air traffic services over high seas or in airspace of undetermined
sovereignty. A contracting state accepting such responsibility may apply the International Standards and Recommended
Practices in a manner consistent with that adopted for airspace under its domestic jurisdiction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with Article 3 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation, Chicago, 1944, state aircraft are
exempt from the provisions of Annex 11 and its Standards and Recommended Practices. As a contracting state, the United
States agreed by Article 3(d) that its state aircraft will be operated in international airspace with due regard for
the safety of civil aircraft.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since this action involves, in part, the designation of navigable airspace outside the United States, the Administrator
is consulting with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense in accordance with the provisions of Executive
Order 10854.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 23, 1994, Public Law (Pub. L.) 103&hyph;305 was enacted and requires that the FAA conduct a study on the availability,
effectiveness, cost, and usefulness of restraint systems that may offer protection to children, who presently do
not use child restraint systems and who are presently carried on the laps of adults, aboard air carrier aircraft. The
report to Congress is due February 23, 1995. This document requests comments from the public on the issues surrounding
child restraint systems.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
United States air carriers have a superb safety record that has continued to improve over time and now ranks among the
best in the world. The risk of injury or death when traveling on an airline is low. Air carrier accidents are infrequent.
Even identifying the causes of these accidents (e.g., severe inflight turbulence) requires thorough and wide-ranging
research.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Children under the age of two (infants) are permitted to travel aboard airlines on the laps of their parents, guardians,
or attendants. Air carriers decide whether to charge for the transportation of infants who are held on adult laps.
Infants traveling in this manner, however, are not secured by any safety/restraint systems. In the rare event of a
crash or rapid aircraft movements such as those caused by severe in-flight turbulence, forces may be too great for
the accompanying adult, guardian, or attendant to protect the infant from injury. In these circumstances, infants
are at higher risk of death or injury than all other travelers who must fasten safety belts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Infants may also be placed in acceptable child/infant safety seats. However, most air carriers require that a ticket
be purchased for those children under two in order to reserve a seat to which the safety seat can be attached. The added
ticket cost, and the generally perceived low rate of accidents and injuries, results in many parents, guardians or
attendants opting to hold infants in their laps. The alternative of incurring an added cost to reserve a seat for use
with an infant safety seat may divert some air travelers to other less costly modes of transportation. Infants and
adults may be at a higher risk of death or injury when traveling in alternative modes than if they flew.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress, in Public Law 103&hyph;305, amended the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982. This amendment directs
the FAA to conduct a study of child restraint systems on air carrier aircraft. The study is due to Congress on February
23, 1995. The purpose of this study is to determine the availability, effectiveness, cost, and usefulness of restraint
systems that may offer protection to a child, carried in the lap of an adult aboard an air carrier aircraft or provide
for the attachment of a child restraint device to the aircraft. Congress has directed the FAA to study the following
issues:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The direct cost to families of requiring air carriers to provide restraint systems and requiring infants to use
them, including whether airlines will charge a fare for use of seats containing restraining systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The impact on air carrier aircraft passenger volume by requiring use of infant restraint systems, including whether
families will choose to travel to destinations by other means, including automobiles.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The impact on fatalities and fatality rates of infants and adults using airplanes, automobiles, and other modes
of transportation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The efficacy of infant restraints currently marketed as able to be used for air carrier aircraft.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are at least four additional issues that are related to the Congressional issues described above:

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
1. What cost might airlines incur if the use of child safety seats was required by regulation? There are several subordinate
issues related to cost. For example: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Would air carriers provide child safety seats? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) What would it cost air carriers to purchase and maintain child safety seats? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) How often would child safety seats have to be replaced?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) How many times annually would child safety seats be used on air carrier aircraft? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) How many child safety seats would be purchased during a year by air carriers? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. For a family traveling with infants, what is the price elasticity of demand for air travel? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) What fares doe air carriers now charge for infants currently seated in child safety seats? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) If parents had to purchase a ticket for their child under the age of two and the price of the seats on their flight of
choice was such that their only alternatives would be to (1) drive or (2) fly paying discount fares during off-peak
hours (or a non-direct flight), which alternative would they choose? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Is there a difference in the elasticity of short versus long trips_(less than 300 miles and 300 miles or greater)?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Is 300 miles the appropriate demarcation for a short versus a long trip for a family traveling with infants? What,
if any, is a relevant demarcation? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) What is the cross-price elasticity of demand for air and automobile travel for families traveling with infants?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. What are the profiles of families with infants who drive? What are the profiles of families with infants who fly?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) How many infants are enplaned annually aboard domestic air carriers? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) How many infants would be represented in an average size family that flies? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) What is the average number of individuals in a family that flies? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) How many families fly annually? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Of those families with infants who fly, what percent of families currently use child safety seats? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. What are the infant and adult mortality rates for air travel, automobile travel, and other modes of transportation?
There are several subordinate issues related to mortality rates. For example:

(a) What are the appropriate units of measure to use to compare infant fatalities/injuries from automobile travel
to infant fatalities/injuries from air travel?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) What is the infant automobile passenger fatality, serious injury, and minor injury incidence rate for families
with infants traveling by automobile? How does this incidence rate compare with those of families traveling by air?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) What is the non-infant automobile passenger fatality, serious injury, and minor injury incidence rate for families
with infants traveling by automobile? How does this incidence rate compare with those of families traveling by air?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) How does the automobile accident rate for parents and guardians of infants compare with the automobile accident
rate for the general population?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) When is the passenger seat and safety belt that is available to an adult passenger (without the child safety seat)
safe enough for a child?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) When should seats not manufactured to federal motor vehicle safety standards be used (if at all)?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the issue of the efficacy of infant restraints, the FAA has completed a study entitled ``The Performance
of Child Restraint Devices in Transport Airplane Passenger Seats.'' A notice of availability was published in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on September 27, 1994 (59 FR 49276). The FAA is continuing to study child restraint systems and to work with the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration to develop revised standards for child safety seat testing and labeling.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA will be seeking data from some individually selected air carriers, air taxis, and commercial operators or
their representatives concerning anticipated pricing policies if child safety seats are mandated for infants.
This data is needed to respond to the Congressional request for a report and would constitute competitive commercial
information. To avoid any improper exchange of competitive price or marketing information the FAA will maintain
the confidentiality of such information. Raw data of this nature will not be disclosed; rather, any presentation
of such data will be aggregated to avoid any competitive concerns.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 We propose to revise the requirements of the Social Security and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) regulations
regarding the certifications required on disability determination forms. Determinations of disability are generally
made by disability determination services (DDS), which are agencies of each State. Present regulations require
that, unless the disability determination is made by a State agency disability hearing officer, disability determinations
made by a DDS will be made by a State agency medical or psychological consultant and a State agency disability examiner,
including those in which the determination is made on technical, non-medical, rather than medical, grounds. We propose
to remove the requirement that a medical or psychological consultant make the determination jointly with the disability
examiner when there is no medical evidence to be evaluated.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Social Security Act (the Act) provides, in title II, for the payment of disability benefits to individuals insured
under the Act. Title II also provides for the payment of child's insurance benefits based on disability and widow's
and widower's insurance benefits for disabled widows, widowers, and surviving divorced spouses of insured individuals.
In addition, the Act provides, in title XVI, for SSI payments to persons who are aged, blind, or disabled and who have
limited income and resources. For adults under both the title II and title XVI programs and for persons claiming child's
insurance benefits based on disability under the title II program, ``disability'' means the inability to engage
in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable impairment. For a child under age 18 claiming
SSI benefits based on disability, ``disability'' means that the child's impairment(s) is of comparable severity
to one that would disable an adult (i.e., the impairment(s) substantially reduces the child's ability to function
independently, appropriately, and effectively in an age-appropriate manner such that the child's impairment(s)
and resulting limitations are comparable to those that would disable an adult). Under both title II and title XVI,
disability must be the result of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment(s) which can be expected
to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 404.1503 and 416.903 of the Social Security Administration's regulations provide that State agencies
make disability and blindness determinations for the Secretary of Health and Human Services for most persons living
in the State. Sections 404.1615(c) and 416.1015(c) of the regulations provide that disability determinations will
be made by either: (1) A State agency medical or psychological consultant 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a State agency disability examiner or (2) a State agency disability hearing officer. Sections 404.1615(e) and 416.1015(e)
of the regulations require the State agency to certify each determination of disability to the Social Security Administration
(SSA) on forms provided by SSA. The term ``determination of disability'' is defined in &sect;&sect;404.1602 and
416.1002 of the regulations to mean one or more of the following decisions: whether or not a person is under a disability;
the date a person's disability began; or the date a person's disability ended. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When a disability determination is made jointly by a State agency medical or psychological consultant and a State
agency disability examiner, the medical or psychological consultant is responsible for the medical portion of the
determination and the disability examiner is responsible for the remainder of the determination. Under our current
procedures, both the disability examiner and the medical or psychological consultant must certify the determination
on forms which we provide as required in the regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In some instances, however, the requirement for the medical or psychological consultant's certification is unnecessary
because the decision is made on technical, non-medical grounds alone, without consideration of any medical evidence.
Many medical and psychological consultants who work with the State agencies do so on a part-time basis and are not always
available to sign disability determination forms. This can result in delays of cases that are otherwise complete
because no medical input or expertise is necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This happens, for example, when an individual who has no history of medical treatment or examination_and, hence,
no existing medical records that we can obtain_refuses to attend a consultative examination purchased at our expense.
In such a case, the State agency makes its determination on technical, non-medical, rather than medical, grounds.
It denies such a claim because, without the individual's cooperation, the evidence needed to determine whether the
individual is disabled cannot be obtained. Nevertheless, our current rules require that a medical or psychological
consultant sign the standard disability determination form in such a case, even though there is no medical evidence
and consequently, no medical finding can be made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We propose to address this issue by revising &sect;&sect;404.1615 and 416.1015 of the regulations to provide, in
a new paragraph (c)(2), that a State agency disability examiner alone may make the disability determination when
there is no medical evidence to be evaluated, such as when there is no existing medical evidence and the individual
refuses to attend a consultative examination. We also propose to redesignate current paragraph (c)(2), which provides
that a State agency disability hearing officer may also make disability determinations, as paragraph (c)(3).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Interregional Research Project No. 4 (IR&hyph;4), New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station, P.O. Box 231,
Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ 08903, has submitted pesticide petition (PP) 0E3907 to EPA on behalf of the
Agricultural Experiment Station of California. This petition requests that the Administrator, pursuant to section
408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a(e), establish a tolerance for combined
residues of the herbicide 3,5-dichloro-
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
-(1,1-dimethyl-2-propynyl)benzamide (also referred to in this document as pronamide) and its metabolites (calculated
as 3,5-dichloro-

per million (ppm).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The scientific data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have been evaluated. The toxicological
data considered in support of the proposed tolerance include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. A 90-day feeding study with rats administered pronamide in the diet at concentrations of 0, 40, 200, 1,000, or 4,000
ppm (equivalent to 0, 2.5, 12.3, 60.0, or 254.0 milligrams (mg)/kilogram (kg)/day in males; 0, 3.1, 15.0, 74.6, or
289.2 mg/kg/day in females). A systemic no-observed-effect level (NOEL) was established at 200 ppm (12.3 mg/kg/day/male;
15 mg/kg/day/female). A systemic lowest-effect level (LEL) was established at 1,000 ppm (60.0 mg/kg/day/male;
74.6 mg/kg/day/female), based on increased liver relative weight and incidence of liver histopathology in both
sexes, decreased body/weight gain and feed consumption in females, and increased blood cholesterol level in males.
Effects observed at the high dose (4,000 ppm) include decreases in body weight/weight gain and feed consumption in
both sexes, and increases in liver-related effects and in the histopathology of the thyroid (both sexes) and anterior
pituitary (males).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A 52-week chronic feeding study with dogs fed diets containing 0, 300, 875, or 1,750 ppm (equivalent to 0, 11.9, 33.1,
or 67.7 mg/kg/day in males; or 0, 11.9, 36.1, or 69.0 mg/kg/day in females) with a NOEL established at 300 ppm, based
on increases in serum alkaline phosphatase in males and thyroid weight in females, and in liver pathology in both sexes
at the 875-ppm dose level. Additional effects observed at the highest dose tested (1,750 ppm) include decreases in
body weight/feed consumption, increases in serum alkaline phosphatase and gamma glutamyl transferase in both sexes,
increases in serum alanine aminotransferase in females, and increases in testes relative weight in males.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. An 18-month carcinogenicity study with B6C3F1 mice fed diets containing 0, 1,000, or 2,000 ppm (approximately
0, 150, or 300 mg/kg/day) with a dose-related increase in incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas in male mice sacrificed
at 18 months. The increases in tumor rates observed at 1,000 and 2,000 ppm were statistically significant by pair-wise
comparison with the control. There were no carcinogenic effects observed in female mice under the conditions of the
study. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. A 24-month chronic feeding/carcinogenicity study with rats fed diets containing 0, 40, 200, or 1,000 ppm (equivalent
to 0, 1.73, 8.46, or 42.59 mg/kg/day/male and 0, 2.13, 10.69, or 55.09 mg/kg/day/female). The NOEL for systemic (nonneoplastic)
effects was established at 8.46 mg/kg/day/males and 10.69 mg/kg/day females, based on decreased body weight/body
weight gain and increased liver weight, as well as an increased incidence of hepatic centrilobular hypertrophy,
eosinophilic cell alterations, and thyroid follicular cell hypertrophy in both sexes at the high-dose level. Rats
fed at the high-dose level also showed an increased incidence of thyroid tumor (thyroid follicular cell adenomas)
and testicular tumor (benign testicular interstitial cell tumors) rates, which exceeded historical control ranges.
There was no progression from thyroid and testicular tumors to carcinomas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. A two-generation reproduction study with rats fed diets containing 0, 40, 200, or 1,500 ppm (approximately 0, 3.0,
15.4, or 114.0 mg/kg/day/P1 males and 0, 3.2, 16.5, or 127.3 mg/kg/day/P2 males during pre-mating period; group time-weighted
average approximately 0, 4.1, 20.2, and 158.2 mg/kg/day/P1 females and 0, 4.0, 19.8, or 157.4 mg/kg/day/P2 females).
The reproductive NOEL was established at 200 ppm, based on decreased combined male/female pup weight per litter at
the 1,500-ppm dose level. A NOEL for parental systemic effects was established at 200 ppm, based on decreased body
weight and food consumption and histopathology of the liver and adrenal in both sexes, the thyroid in females, and
the anterior pituitary in males at the 1,500-ppm dose level. These effects were observed in both P1 and P2 generations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. A developmental toxicity study with rabbits given gavage doses of 0, 5, 20, or 80 mg/kg/day during gestation days
7 through 19 with a developmental NOEL established at 20 mg/kg/day, based on late resorption (2 of 5 abortions at the
80 mg/kg/day dose level each showed one incidence of late resorption). The maternal NOEL was established at 20 mg/kg/day,
based on one mortality, abortions in 5 of 16 animals, body weight loss, and liver histopathology at the 80 mg/kg/day
dose level.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. A developmental toxicity study with rats given gavage doses of 0, 5, 20, 80, or 160 mg/kg/day on gestation days 6 through
15 with no clinical signs of toxicity under the conditions of the study. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Mutagenicity tests, including gene mutation (Ames test), forward gene mutation (CH V79 cells), structural chromosome
aberration in vitro (CHO cells), structural chromosome aberration in vivo (mouse bone marrow cells), and UDNA synthesis
(primary hepatocytes of rats), were all negative. The results of the mutagenicity test indicate that pronamide does
not appear to be mutagenic.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Office of Pesticide Programs' Carcinogenicity Peer Review Committee has classified pronamide as a Group B2 carcinogen
(a probable human carcinogen), based on the findings of two types of tumors in the rat (uncommon benign testicular
interstitial cell tumors and thyroid follicular cell adenomas) and one type (liver carcinomas) in the mouse. The
upper limit on the carcinogenic risk from dietary exposure resulting from established uses of pronamide and the proposed
use on radicchio is estimated at 4.9 X 10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for the general population. The carcinogenic risk assessment for pronamide was calculated based on a potency estimator

 and an Anticipated Residue Contribution (ARC) calculated at 0.000032 mg/kg/body weight/day.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reference dose (RfD) is established at 0.080 mg/kg of body weight/day. The RfD is based on an NOEL of 8.46 mg/kg/day
from the rat 2-year feeding study and an uncertainty factor of 100. The ARC from established uses and the proposed use
of pronamide utilizes less than 1 percent of the RfD for the U.S. population and all subgroups of the population currently
evaluated by EPA's Dietary Risk Evaluation System.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The nature of the residue in plants is adequately understood. The residues of concern are pronamide and its metabolites
containing the 3,5-dichlorophenyl moiety. An adequate analytical method, gas chromatography, is available for
enforcement purposes. The analytical method for enforcing this tolerance has been published in the Pesticide Analytical
Manual, Vol. II (PAM II). There is no reasonable expectation that secondary residues will occur in milk, eggs, or meat
of livestock and poultry: radicchio greens are not considered to be livestock feed items.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are presently no actions pending against the continued registration of this chemical.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the information and data considered, the Agency has determined that the tolerance established by amending
40 CFR part 180 would protect the public health. Therefore, it is proposed that the tolerance be established as set
forth below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide, under the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) as amended, which contains any of the ingredients listed herein, may request
within 30 days after publication of this document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that this rulemaking proposal be referred to an Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e) of the FFDCA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulation. Comments must bear a notation
indicating the document control number, [PP 0E3907/P588]. All written comments filed in response to this petition
will be available in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch, at the address given above from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday, except legal holidays.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e., Regulatory Impact Analysis,
review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant'' as those
actions likely to lead to a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious
inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering
the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues
arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Region V announces its intent to delete the Boise Cascade/Onan/Medtronics
Site from the National Priorities List (NPL) and requests public comments on this action. The NPL is appendix B of 40
CFR part 300 which is the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP), which EPA promulgated
pursuant to section 105 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA)
as amended. This action is being taken, because all Fund-financed response actions under CERCLA have been implemented
and EPA, in consultation with the State of Minnesota, has determined that no further response is appropriate. Moreover,
EPA and the State have determined that remedial activities conducted at the site to date have been protective of public
health, welfare, and the environment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Region V announces its intent to delete the Boise Cascade/Onan/Medtronics
Site from the National Priorities List (NPL), appendix B to the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency
Plan, 40 CFR part 300 (NCP), and requests comments on the proposed deletion. The EPA identifies sites which appear
to present a significant risk to public health, welfare or the environment, and maintains the NPL as the list of those
sites. Sites on the NPL may be the subject of Superfund (Fund) financed remedial actions. Pursuant to &sect;300.425(e)(3)
of the NCP, any site deleted from the NPL remains eligible for additional Fund-financed remedial actions in the unlikely
event that conditions at the site warrant such action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The USEPA will accept comments on this proposal for thirty (30) days after publication of this notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section II of this notice explains the criteria for deleting sites from the NPL. Section III discusses procedures
that EPA is using for this action. Section IV discusses the history of this site and explains how the site meets the deletion
criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Deletion of sites from the NPL does not itself create, alter, or revoke any individual's rights or obligations. Furthermore,
deletion from the NPL does not in any way alter EPA's right to take enforcement actions, as appropriate. The NPL is designed
primarily for informational purposes and to assist in Agency management.

II. NPL Deletion Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NCP establishes the criteria the Agency uses to delete sites from the NPL. In accordance with 40 CFR 300.425(e),
sites may be deleted from the NPL where no further response is appropriate. In making this determination, USEPA will
consider, in consultation with the State, whether any of the following criteria have been met:

The Boise Cascade/Onan/Medtronics Superfund Site covers 183 acres and is located in the City of Fridley in Anoka County
in the state of Minnesota. From approximately 1921 through 1961, National Pole and Treating Company and its affiliate,
Minnesota and Ontario Paper Company (M&amp;O) operated a wood treating facility at the site. Initial operations
included the use of creosote treatment of wood for the manufacture of railroad ties and utility poles. In approximately
1958, pentachlorophenol (PCP), another wood preservative, was also used for treating lumber. Wood-treating operations
ceased in early 1961. In 1964, M&amp;O merged with the Boise Cascade Corporation (Boise). Boise sold the site in 1967.
Subsequently, Medtronics, Inc. acquired 50 acres of the Boise Cascade property located to the west and south, and
Onan, Inc. acquired 133 acres of the site to the north and east. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1979, Onan began excavation for construction purposes and encountered large quantities of creosote and PCP saturated
soil. Similar deposits were subsequently discovered on the Medtronics portion of the Site. Wood-treating operations
had contaminated soils and groundwater with creosote and PCP by spillage, dripping, and wastewater disposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Boise Cascade site was placed on the National Priorities List on September 21, 1984, at 49 FR 37066&hyph;37090.
In conjunction with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA), Boise conducted extensive soil and groundwater
investigations from 1979 through 1982. Because the Site's ownership is divided between two different companies,
Site investigations at the Boise Cascade Site were conducted separately within the individual property boundaries.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the Onan property the analyses verified that the major contaminants of concern were creosote derived polynuclear
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS) and phenolic compounds (phenolics are also derived from PCP). The heaviest concentrations
of these substances were found on two areas where significant aspects of the tie treating process had been conducted:
(1) The area where the ties were pressure treated in the retorts; and (2) the area where the ties were left to cool and
dry after they were removed from the retorts and before they were loaded onto railroad cars for shipment.

Seven shallow monitoring wells were installed at locations to sample surficial groundwater in the coarse Fridley
Formation to determine the Glacial Drift Stratigraphy in the Site area. Heavy concentrations of PAHs were found in
the vicinity of the Retort building in an area where tanks were removed in mid-1979. A plume of PAH compounds was found
to extend to the southwest of the Retort area; however, the concentrations of PAH compounds decreased by more than
two orders of magnitude by the time the plume reached the southern boundary of the Onan property, which was likely due
to the attenuation of the PAH compound in the soil system. Phenolics were not present in the samples from the shallow
groundwater beneath the Onan property at concentrations above the detection limits with the one exception of 4-methylphenol
which was detected in the Retort area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Hillside sand aquifer was sampled and found to contain insignificant levels of PAHs and no phenolics compounds.
An eight inch diameter bedrock well, uncovered in 1979 during earth moving activities, was investigated. Approximately
two feet of creosote sludge was discovered at the bottom of the well. All contaminated soil was excavated and placed
in a vault formed by slurry wall and a cap consisting of clean soil and a vegetative cover was constructed over the vault.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The direction of groundwater movement in the surficial groundwater system in the upper portion of the Fridley Formation
beneath the Onan property is southwesterly toward Rice and Norton Creeks. Water and sediment samples were collected
from two monitoring stations along Norton Creek and from three monitoring stations along Rice Creek. PAH samples
were measured above detection limits in the surface water and sediment samples from all sampling stations on Rice
and Norton Creeks, including stations upstream of the site, therefore it was impossible to attribute an impact from
the Site to the Creeks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the Medtronic Property the waste water treatment lagoons were utilized for disposal of the waste waters generated
by operations. The waste waters contained quantities of creosote and PCP which subsequently contaminated soils
and groundwater beneath the primary and secondary wastewater treatment lagoons and a trench leading to the lagoons.
Both the trench and the lagoons were located on the Medtronics portion of the site, east of Old Central Avenue. Eight
shallow soil borings were installed along the waste water trench and around the primary and secondary waste water
treatment lagoons. High levels of PAHs and heterocyclics were found. Additionally, about 5000 gallons of free oil
were discovered in the vicinity of the primary waste water lagoon. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As with the Site Investigations, remediation at the Boise Cascade Site was conducted separately within the individual
property boundaries. The following remedial actions were implemented at the Site: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A slurry wall containment system was constructed around the former retort building. Visually contaminated soil
was excavated and placed in a vault formed by a slurry wall, and a cap was constructed over the vault. The excavated areas
were backfilled with clean soil. A subdrain system was installed in the former loading area to remove groundwater
from the coarse Fridley Formation and discharge it into the City of Fridley sanitary sewer system. A long-term monitoring
of groundwater, surface water, and air quality has been ongoing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the Medtronics Property on the basis of the investigations above, Boise and Medtronics companies developed a Remedial
Action Plan (RAP) to excavate and dispose of visibly contaminated soils on the Medtronics portion of the site. The
following Remedial Actions were implemented at the Site: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All the visibly contaminated soil in the two wastewater lagoons and in the trench that was used to convey wastewater
from the retort to the lagoons were excavated and disposed of in a hazardous waste facility that had interim status
pursuant to RCRA. Excavated areas were backfilled with clean soil. Groundwater that was in contact with and directly
beneath contaminated soil was collected, treated and disposed of into the City of Fridley sanitary sewer system.
About 5000 gallons of free oil discovered in the vicinity of the primary wastewater lagoon was collected and disposed
offsite. Long-term monitoring of groundwater, surface water, sediments, and air quality has been ongoing. A final
Close Out Report which documents completion of Site construction, was signed on September 30, 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

EPA, with the concurrence of the State of Minnesota, has determined that all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate Fund-financed responses under CERCLA at the Boise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cascade/Onan/Medtronics Site have been completed, and no further Superfund

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 By decision served August 23, 1994 (59 FR 43529, August 24, 1994), the Commission sought public comment by September
23, 1994, on a proposal to exempt partially from regulation the rail transportation of certain non-ferrous recyclables.
The due date for comments was subsequently extended to October 24, 1994 (59 FR 47292, September 15, 1994). The Association
of American Railroads and the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries, Inc., require additional time to prepare
and coordinate the witness statements and the joint comments and request an extension of the due date until November
7, 1994. The request is reasonable; therefore, the extension will be granted.

Section 4(b)(3)(A) of the Act, as amended, requires that the Service make a finding on whether a petition to list, delist
or reclassify a species presents substantial scientific or commercial information to demonstrate that the petitioned
action may be warranted. This finding is to be based on all information available to the Service at the time the finding
is made. To the maximum extent practicable, the finding shall be made within 90 days following receipt of the petition
and promptly published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The Service must also commence a timely status review of the petitioned species if its accompanying information
results in a positive finding. Following a positive 90-day finding, Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act requires the Service
to make a 12-month finding as to whether the petitioned action is:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Not warranted,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Warranted; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Warranted but precluded by other higher priority listing proposals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On February 15, 1994, the Service received a petition from Ms. Nancy Fraser Williams on behalf of the Rock Creek Owners'
Association, Gainesville, Florida. The petition requests that Says' spiketail dragonfly, (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Cordulegaster sayi
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), be listed as an endangered species. It states that a portion of a forested ravine and its riparian corridor owned
by the Rock Creek residential housing subdivision is essentially the species' only known breeding grounds. The petitioners
contend that a proposed municipal storm water retention project within the corridor's floodplain, described as
the Possum Branch of Hogtown Creek, would gravely endanger the existing breeding sites of this extremely rare dragonfly
and virtually wipe out the species.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Westfall (unpublished) provides collection information for Say's spiketail from seven localities in northern
Florida and one specific site from southeastern Georgia. Five of these sites are located on public land, with occurrence
based on fewer than two dozen specimens. Rock Creek, named in the petition, is the best studied and most productive
of the known collection sites. Alabama may be added to the range if identification of an adult female collected in 1994
from Conecuh National Forest is verified (Mr. Bill Mauffray, International Odonate Research Institute, pers. comm.,
1994).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Say's spiketail was included as a candidate for listing in the Service's invertebrate notice of review for animals
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 22, 1984 (49 FR 21664) and is comprehensive animal notices of review published January 6, 1989 (54 FR 554) and
November 21, 1991 (56 FR 58804). The dragonfly was included in the first notice as a category 1 candidate for listing,
but as a category 2 candidate in subsequent notices. A category 1 taxon is one for which the Service has available enough
substantial information on biological vulnerability and threat(s) to support a proposal to list it as endangered
or threatened. A category 2 taxon is one for which information in possession of the Service indicates that proposing
to list as endangered or threatened is possibly appropriate, but for which conclusive data on biological vulnerability
and threat are not currently available to support a proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information presented in the petition supports the Service's previous decision to consider this species as a
category 2 listing candidate as defined above. At the time the petition was received, the Service was aware of and investigating
the proposed floodwater relief project and its potential impact on Say's spiketail. The hydrologic model for the
project (Westfall and Mauffray 1994) predicted the proposed flood control structure would increase depth of inundation
for 10-year and 25-year storm events by approximately 2 and 3 feet, respectively. All but one of nine seepage transects
included in the project's biological assessment would be completely inundated during any 10-year event. The seep
heads and a few feet of their runs in four of the nine sampled seeps would not be totally inundated by a 10-year flood under
the existing pre-project conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One such 10-year event did occur in March 1993. The only larvae collected after this flood were found at three completely
inundated seeps (Westfall and Mauffray, 1994). Less than 10 percent of the previous seasons' adult total was observed
during a 3-week period in 1993. During the 1994 flight season, however, 12 adults were observed in a single day at Rock
Creek, indicating recovery from any adverse effects from flooding. It appears that larvae may not be displayed by
significant flooding and are able to survive these episodes at their original locations.

A recent review of category 2 insects in the southeast region (Schweitzer 1989) recommended a very high status survey
priority for Say's spiketail. The Service concurs with this recommendation and plans to fund a survey within the near
future to better determine current distribution and status. However, the service does not anticipate this survey
will be completed in time for the 12-month finding on this petition.

trends, biological vulnerability and threats to this species should be sent to the office specified in the

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Executive Director of the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (Board) is publishing proposed regulations
governing retirement benefits court orders. The proposed regulations contain a number of procedural changes which
reflect the Board's experience in processing retirement benefits court orders, as well as changes in Federal tax
law. The proposed regulations will establish a new Part in the Code of Federal Regulations replacing existing regulations
regarding court orders.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board administers the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP), which was established by the Federal Employees' Retirement
System Act of 1986 (FERSA), Pub. L. 99&hyph;335. The provisions governing the TSP are codified primarily in subchapters
III and VII of Chapter 84 of Title 5, United States Code. The TSP is a tax-deferred retirement savings plan for Federal
employees that is similar to cash or deferred arrangements established under section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue
Code. Sums in a TSP participant's account are held in trust for that participant. 5 U.S.C. 8437(g).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under 5 U.S.C. 8467(a), payments from the TSP that would otherwise be made to a TSP participant shall be paid ``to another
person if and to the extent that the terms of a court decree of divorce, annulment or legal separation, or the terms of
any court order or court-approved property settlement agreement incident to any court decree of divorce, annulment,
or legal separation expressly provide.'' A related provision, 5 U.S.C. 8435(d), states that an election or change
of election of TSP benefits shall not be effective to the extent that it would conflict with ``a court decree of divorce,
annulment or legal separation *&blank;*&blank;* or any court order or court-approved property settlement agreement
incident to such decree *&blank;*&blank;*.'' The TSP need only honor court orders or decrees meeting the requirements
of 5 U.S.C. 8467(a) and 8435(d) if the Executive Director receives proper notice of the order before disbursement
of the participant's account.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These proposed regulations address only court orders and decrees described in 5 U.S.C. 8435(d) and 8467. Such orders
and decrees are referred to in the proposed regulations as ``retirement benefits court orders.'' These are to be distinguished
from ``alimony and child support orders,'' which are governed by 5 U.S.C. 8437(e)(3). Proposed regulations governing
alimony and child support orders will be promulgated in a separate subpart of Part 1653. The current proposed regulations,
when effective, will supersede the interim regulations presently found at 5 CFR 1650.27 to 1650.43.

Section 1653.1 states the purpose of the proposed regulations. The procedures set forth in the regulations will be
applied in determining whether the Board must honor orders purporting to constitute retirement benefits court orders
described in 5 U.S.C. 8435(d) and 8467. The regulations also establish procedures for calculation and payment of
awards pursuant to qualifying retirement benefits court orders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1653.2(a) sets forth the general rule that only ``qualifying'' retirement benefits court orders will be
honored. If an order is determined not to be qualifying, it will not affect the participant's account. TSP participants
involved in divorce proceedings, and their representatives, are encouraged to read the TSP publication, ``Information
About Court Orders,'' to obtain useful information for drafting and submitting court orders that will be deemed qualifying
under the regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1653.2(b) sets forth the requirements for a court order to be ``qualifying.'' Section 1653.2(b)(1) describes
the type of legal document that can be a qualifying order. The first sentence is designed to clarify that the language
``court decree of divorce, annulment, or legal separation,'' as used in both 5 U.S.C. 8435(d) and 8467 has been interpreted
by the Board to mean ``a court decree of divorce, a court decree of annulment, or a court decree of legal separation.''
In order to have a qualifying court order, a court must be involved. A legal separation agreement that has not been approved
by a court, for example, is not a ``court decree of legal separation,'' and therefore cannot constitute a qualifying
court order. Also, a property settlement agreement must be court-approved in order to be qualifying. This means that
the court's approval must be demonstrated on the face of the document or in an accompanying court order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second sentence of &sect;1653.2(b)(1) is designed to make it clear that a ``court order or court-approved property
settlement agreement incident to [a decree of divorce, of annulment or of legal separation]'' may occur at any stage
of the proceeding, not just after the entry of a final decree of divorce, of annulment or of legal separation. For example,
courts often issue orders during a divorce proceeding in order to preserve the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
status quo
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in anticipation of a final decree dividing the property of the parties. The proposed regulations also allow for the
possibility that an order serving a function other than preservation of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
status quo
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 could be deemed ``incident to'' a decree that has not yet been entered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the Board receives an otherwise valid order awarding a former spouse a portion of a TSP account, but prior to payment
receives a valid amended order changing the earlier award, the amended order will be honored. However, under no circumstances
will the Board accept the return to the TSP of funds that have been properly paid pursuant to an earlier order, even if
a subsequent order would dictate such a result. The processing of multiple court orders is addressed in &sect;1653.3(k).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1653.2(b)(2) addresses the requirement in 5 U.S.C. 8435(d)(2)(A) that a court order must ``expressly relate''
to a participant's TSP account and the requirement in 5 U.S.C. 8467 that the court order must ``expressly provide''
for payment to someone other than the participant. For an order to be honored under either provision, the order must
unambiguously address the TSP account.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1653.2(b)(2)(i) requires that an order must clearly and specifically deal with a participant's TSP account.
It is not sufficient to use generic language that is arguably broad enough to include the TSP. For example, an order
that states, ``Former Spouse is awarded 50% of all of Participant's Federal retirement benefits'' would not be language
that expressly relates to the TSP, even though the TSP is a Federal retirement benefit. The clearest and most effective
way to ensure that an order is honored is to actually name the Thrift Savings Plan; parties to divorce actions are encouraged
to attempt to obtain such specific language in their orders. However, &sect;1653.2(b)(2)(ii) makes it clear that,
even if the Thrift Savings Plan is identified by name, the order must not contain language that is inconsistent with
the division of a participant's interest in a defined contribution plan, such as the TSP, in which the participant
has an individual account. References to ``benefit formulas,'' ``accrued benefits,'' or ``eventual benefits''
may or may not be acceptable in context, because such terms have the potential to raise questions as to whether the order
is truly dealing specifically with the TSP account as opposed to simply including the TSP among other retirement benefits
to which the participant may be entitled. Since use of such terms may lead the Board to reject an order as not expressly
relating to the TSP account, these terms should be avoided in favor of references to the ``TSP account'' or ``TSP account
balance.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1653.2(b)(3) further implements the requirement of 5 U.S.C. 8467 that a payment pursuant to a court order
must be expressly provided for in the order. If the order requires a payment from the TSP account, it must either award
a specific dollar amount or divide the participant's account balance by applying a fraction, a percentage, or a formula
that yields a mathematically possible result. For example, a formula where the numerator is larger than the denominator
and therefore yields an amount greater than the entire account balance is not acceptable. All of the variables for
the formula must also be set forth in the order or must be available through reference to Government employment records.
The dollar amount, percentage, fraction or variables used must be clearly determinable; they cannot be qualified
by terms such as ``approximately.'' The order may or may not provide for interest or earnings to be added to the amount
of the award, but any award of earnings must also be clearly determinable. The order may also award a survivor annuity
under 5 U.S.C. 8435(e).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under &sect;1653.2(b)(4), an order will only be deemed qualifying if it calls for payment to the spouse, former spouse,
attorney for the spouse or former spouse, dependent children of the participant, other dependents of the participant,
or the attorney for the participant's dependent children or other dependents. Payment cannot be made to the participant
or to others, such as credit card companies, mortgage lenders, or other creditors of the parties to the divorce. The
TSP is a retirement savings plan, and the occasion of a divorce should not be a general opportunity for the participant
to obtain access to his or her account or for the parties to use retirement savings to liquidate their general debts.
In this context, payment to the attorney for the participant is tantamount to a payment to the participant, since the
participant owes a debt to the attorney. Thus, the proposed rules would not permit such a payment. In contrast, it is
permissible for the court to award a payment from the TSP account to the attorney representing the spouse/former spouse
or dependent children or other dependents for legal fees incurred in connection with the divorce, because direct
payments to the spouse/former spouse or dependent children or other dependents are also permissible. The Board will
not honor an order asking for payment to be made jointly, such as to the former spouse and his or her children. Rather,
the order should separately specify the award to be made to each person.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1653.2(c) specifically states that certain orders are not qualifying. Section 1653.2(c)(1) provides that
an order relating only to money that is not vested (under 5 U.S.C. 8432(g)) shall not be deemed a qualifying order unless
the money will become vested within 90 days of receipt of the order if the participant remains in Federal employment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1653.2(c)(2) represents a significant departure from current rules for processing court orders. Under
current rules the Board has been paying court orders as soon as the amount of the award can be calculated, even where
the order calls for a payment at a later date. In cases where a dollar amount is awarded and the order specifies that payment
is to be made upon a date in the future, that dollar amount has been paid immediately. On the other hand, where the amount
of the award is based on a percentage of the account balance as of a date in the future (such as the participant's separation
from Federal Government employment or some other specified date), or is based on a percentage determined by a formula
containing variables that cannot be determined until a date in the future, the Board's current procedures have called
for the order to be retained by the Board so that payment could be made at the appropriate time in the future.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under &sect;1653.2(c)(2)(i) of the proposed rules, orders requiring payment at a future specified date will not
be considered qualifying orders unless two requirements are met. First, it must be currently possible to calculate
the amount of the entitlement. Second, the award must provide for interest or earnings to be paid on the amount of the
award until the date of payment. If both of these requirements are met, the order will be considered qualifying. However,
payment will be made not at the future date specified in the order, but rather will be made currently after following
the procedures of &sect;1653.5. The rationale for this limited exception to the general rule that orders requiring
future payment will be rejected is that, where the amount of the award can currently be calculated and the order calls
for interest or earnings, a payment of that amount currently is the economic equivalent of a payment of the same amount
plus earnings at a future date. However, under the proposed regulations there will be no case in which the Board will
hold orders until a future date specified by a court for payment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1653.2(c)(2)(ii) is designed to clarify that is not necessary for the exact amount of the award to be determinable
upon receipt of the order by the Board. An order may be qualifying if it provides for a current payment to be calculated
as of the date of payment. The Board recognizes that the procedures set forth in the proposed regulations will often
require a few months between the receipt of the order by the Board and the payment of the account. Orders will not be deemed
non-qualifying future orders merely because the amount of the award cannot be calculated until a payment date that
will invariably be later than the date of receipt of the order by the Board. For example, an order that incorporates
a formula using a variable such as the number of months of the participant's Federal employment as of the date of payment
would not be considered a non-qualifying future order, even though the length of the participant's Federal service
will have to be determined as of the date of payment, which is likely to be a few months after the Board's receipt of the
order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1653.2(d) defines the term ``former spouse'' as used in the proposed regulations, by adopting the definition
contained in 5 U.S.C. 8401(12).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1653.3 sets forth procedures for reviewing retirement benefits court orders. Section 1653.3(a) provides
that the Board will process court orders in accordances with applicable Federal law, namely FERSA and the Board's
regulations. The Board's processing of court orders is not controlled by the procedures of the state divorce courts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1653.3(a) also makes it clear that the Board cannot be made a party to the underlying divorce action and thereby
be subject to the jurisdiction of the court handling the divorce proceeding. The Board is a Federal agency which, under
the doctrine of sovereign immunity, is not subject to suit in state court absent specific statutory authorization.
Therefore, legal process to join the Board as a party to a divorce proceeding will not be honored. Parties to a divorce
must, without the Board's participation in the proceeding, obtain from the court an appropriate order and then submit
that order to the Board for a determination as to whether it is a qualifying order. To the extent there is any dispute
about the Board's actions concerning a court order, the matter must be resolved in Federal court under 5 U.S.C. 8477,
not in state court.

Section 1653.3(b) provides the address for the TSP recordkeeper to which court orders should be sent for processing.
Receipt by the recordkeeper is deemed receipt by the Board.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1653.3(c) provides the general rule that the Board will ``freeze'' the account of a TSP participant for whom
a document has been received that purports to be a qualifying retirement benefits court order. When an account is frozen,
the participant may not withdraw the account or obtain a loan from the account. The freeze is intended to ensure that
the participant may not defeat the purposes of a court order by removing the funds from the account while the Board is
conducting its review of what may turn out to be a valid order. Both 5 U.S.C. 8435(d) and 8467 indicate that the Executive
Director may not make payments to the participant after receiving a qualifying court order until the court order has
been complied with.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1653.3(d) lists certain types of documents that the Board views as not even purporting to constitute qualifying
retirement benefits court orders. Therefore, these documents will be rejected without substantive review and no
freeze will be placed on the account. Section 1653.3(d)(1) provides that an order will be rejected if it fails to indicate
on its face that it has been issued or approved by a court, unless an accompanying document plainly establishes that
the order was approved or issued by a court. An unsigned order will be rejected under this provision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1653.3(d)(2) provides that an order will be rejected where the account has been closed, which may have occurred
either because the participant withdrew his or her account or because the entire account was paid pursuant to an earlier
court order. Similarly, because FERSA was enacted on June 6, 1986, court orders entered before that date cannot ``expressly
relate'' to a TSP account, since the court could not have contemplated the existence of a TSP account. Accordingly,
under &sect;1653.3(d)(3), such orders will be rejected without review. Court orders awarding funds in the TSP account
only to the participant (&sect;1653.3(d)(4)) and court orders failing to make any mention of any retirement benefits
(&sect;1653.3(d)(5)) will also be rejected without substantive review and without freezing the account.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 1653.3(e) and (f) require a court order to be either an original or copy of a complete court order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a court order is not complete, the parties will be given 30 days to submit a complete document. If it is not received
within 30 days, the account will be unfrozen and the order will not be reviewed further. However, if the incomplete
order does not include a signature or other indication that it was properly issued or approved by a court, then it will
be rejected under &sect;1653.3(d)(1) without a 30-day period for resubmission.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 1653.3 (g) and (h) require the Board to determine whether court orders accepted for review under this subpart
constitute qualifying orders and to provide an explanation of the decision. If the order is found to be qualifying,
the decision will state the effect of the order on the TSP account of the participant. In many cases, the effect of a final
divorce decree will be a payment from the participant's account to the spouse of former spouse. In the case of a preliminary
order, the effect is often maintenance of a freeze on the account until a further court order is received by the Board.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under current Board procedures, the Board's decisions provide a 30-day appeal period for the parties to request an
administrative review of the decision by the Executive Director. Section 1653.3(i) of the proposed regulations
eliminates that appeal period and makes the Board's initial decision the final administrative action. In the Board's
experience, the appeal period has been used primarily as a time for seeking from the divorce court a new order to supersede
the earlier order, rather than to raise substantive issues relating to the Board's decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board believes that it is appropriate for the divorce court, rather than the Board, to clarify any question concerning
the meaning of the order. Elimination of the appeal period will not, however, eliminate any opportunity for the parties
to return to the divorce court for an amended order, since &sect;1653.5(a) provides that even after a determination
that an order awards a portion of a TSP account, payment cannot be made until at least 30 days after appropriate tax notification
has been provided. Similarly, if the Board determines that an order is not qualifying, &sect;1653.3(j)(4) provides
that the account will remain frozen for 45 days from the date of the Board's determination. Thus, the spouse or former
spouse is protected against disbursement of a loan or withdrawal to the participant during the 45-day period, and
may seek a new order from the divorce court during that time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1653.3(j) describes when a freeze imposed under &sect;1653.3(c) will be removed. Section 1653.3(j)(1)
reiterates the provision in paragraph (f) that if the Board receives an incomplete order the parties will be notified
that a complete document must be received within 30 days. If it is not received within that time, the freeze will be removed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1653.3(j)(2) provides that, where a qualifying order precludes disbursements from the participant's account,
the freeze will remain on the account until the order is either superseded or vacated by a subsequent order of the court.
Of course, if the subsequent order itself requires freezing the account, then the account will not be unfrozen. A common
situation involves a preliminary order entered to preserve the status quo by precluding the participant from obtaining
a loan or withdrawal from his or her account while the divorce proceedings are pending. The court then enters a final
divorce decree, which dissolves the preliminary order but also includes an award of a portion of the TSP account to
the former spouse. Because the final divorce decree will itself require that the account be frozen, the freeze will
remain on the account until payment of the former spouse's share. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1653.(j)(3) provides that, where it is determined that an order makes an award of a portion of a TSP account,
the freeze will be removed upon payment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in connection with the elimination of the appeal period &sect;1653.3(j)(4) provides that, where the
Board determines that an order is not qualifying, the account will remain frozen for 45 days after that determination.
This enables the parties to seek and submit to the Board a new, qualifying order from the divorce court, without concern
that the participant may withdraw or borrow from his or her account during the 45-day period. Alternatively, a party
may seek to challenge the Board's determination in Federal court. The freeze may be removed sooner than the expiration
of the 45-day period only upon written agreement from both parties to the divorce proceedings.

Section 1653.3(k) provides the rules for processing multiple court orders. Section 1653.3(k)(1) provides that,
where there are conflicting orders arising from the same divorce proceeding and involving the same spouse of former
spouse, the order bearing the latest date will supersede any earlier orders, regardless of the dates on which they
are received by the Board. The date will be determined by using the date the order was entered by the clerk of the court
or the date the order was filed by the clerk of the court, if the order does not show a date entered. If the order does not
indicate a date entered or filed, the date the order was signed by the judge will be used. Since 5 U.S.C. 8467(a) provides
that ``[a]ny payment under this subsection to a person bars recovery by any other person,'' the general rule set forth
in &sect;1643.3(k)(1) obviously cannot be applied if payment on the first order received has already been made before
the Board receives a later order that would have superseded the first order. Moreover, consistent with the last sentence
of &sect;1653.2(b)(1), no court order will be honored to the extent that doing so would require the Board to accept
the return of money already properly paid pursuant to another order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1653.3(k)(2) provides that where there are conflicting orders involving different spouses of former spouses,
the order with the earliest date (determined in the same manner as under &sect;1653.3(k)(1)) will be given priority
(again, unless payment on the first order received has already been made). Any payments from the account will be made
first based on the order bearing the earliest date, and proceeding through and additional orders until the account
is exhausted. It is presumed that the earliest order established rights for the spouse or former spouse named in that
order which cannot be affected by subsequent orders in different cases in which the first spouse is not a party.

Section 1653.4 sets forth rules for calculation of the amount of an entitlement. TSP accounts are valued once a month
as of the last day of the month. Under &sect;1653.4(a), if the date or event specified in the order for calculating the
award falls on any day except the last day of the month, the account balance on which the amount of the entitlement is
based is determined as of the last day of the previous month. Unless otherwise provided by the court order, any outstanding
loan balance as of the end of the month used for calculating the entitlement will be included in the account balance
for this calculation. If the date or event specified in the order falls on the last day of a month, the account balance
is determined as of that day.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The actual month-end account balance used to calculate the entitlement must be adjusted by transactions which are
processed before the payment is processed but which relate to the period on or before the month-end used for the calculation.
For example, assume that in March 1995 the Board receives a qualifying court order awarding the former spouse one-half
of the participant's account balance as of the end of February 1995. In May 1995, the Board processes an adjustment
record received from the participant's employing agency which removes from the account $100 that was determined
by the agency to be an excess contribution erroneously made by the agency in January 1995. If payment pursuant to the
court order is made in July 1995, the amount paid would be computed based on the February 1995 month-end account balance,
minus the $100 which was removed from the account in May 1995 but which related to the period prior to the February month-end
computation date. On the other hand, if the adjustment record was for an erroneous contribution made in April 1995,
then the February balance would be used in the calculation of the former spouse's award without reduction for the $100
adjustment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1653.4(b) provides that, where the award does not cite a specific date or event, the entitlement will be calculated
based on the month-end balance on or immediately preceding the date the order was entered by the clerk of the court or
the date the order was filed by the clerk of the court, if the order does not show a date entered. If the order does not indicate
a date entered or filed, the date the order was signed by the judge will be used. Once the appropriate date is established,
the rules of paragraph (a) are applied as if that date had been specified in the order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1653.4(c) provides that, if the court awards a specific dollar amount, but indicates that the amount awarded
must be paid out of the balance that is in the account on a certain date, the award will be for the lesser of the amount awarded
or the appropriate month-end account balance, determined and adjusted under the same rules as in paragraph (a). This
approach is based on the notion that the court has no power to award a sum that is greater than the amount in the account
on the particular date cited in the order. Also similar to the rules set forth in paragraph (a), if no date is specified
in the court order, the award will be assumed to be based on the date the order was entered, filed or signed as appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under &sect;1653.4(d), unless the court order specifies otherwise, no earnings will be credited to the amount awarded.
If the court specifies that interest or earnings are to be credited, but does not specify a rate or method of calculation,
the Board will use the actual rate of return on the participant's account for the time period involved based on the funds
in which the account is invested. The participant's account may be invested in one or more of the following funds: the
Government Securities Investment (G) Fund, the Common Stock Index Investment (C) Fund, the Fixed Income Index Investment
(F) Fund. Because the earnings may be based in whole or in part on the earnings of the Common Stock Index Investment (C)
Fund or the Fixed Income Index Investment (F) Fund, and those funds may suffer losses for any given period of time, the
earnings credited to the award could be either positive or negative. The earnings calculation will begin with the
month after the month-end balance used in calculating the principal amount of the award, and will end with the month
preceding payment. If the court specifies a different method for calculating interest to be credited to the award,
that method will be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1653.4(e) makes it clear that under no circumstances may a participant's Agency Automatic (1%) Contributions
be paid pursuant to a court order it those funds are not vested under 5 U.S.C. 8432(g) at the time of payment. While the
entitlement may initially be calculated to include such nonvested sums for purposes of advising the parties of the
amount awarded, the amount will be recalculated excluding those sums if they have not become vested by the date of payment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1653.5 sets forth the procedures for making payments pursuant to qualifying retirement benefits court orders.
Under &sect;1653.5(a), if a qualifying order is found to require payment, an appropriate tax notification will be
provided to the payee after issuance of the Board's decision. Payment will not be made less than 30 days after issuance
of the tax notification because, under the Internal Revenue Code, the payee will often have the right to elect a transfer
to an Individual Retirement Arrangement (IRA) or other eligible retirement plan, or to make a tax withholding election.
As discussed with respect to the elimination of the period for appeal of the Board's decision, this minimum waiting
period of 30 days also provides the participant an opportunity to seek an amended order from the state divorce court
or to challenge the Board's determination in Federal court under 5 U.S.C. 8477.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1653.5(b) states that payment must be made directly to the individual(s) specified in the court order. However,
as required by the Internal Revenue Code, this paragraph also provides for a spouse or former spouse to elect to have
all or a part of the payment transferred directly to an IRA or other eligible retirement plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1653.5(c) provides that no payment may be made from an account that exceeds the vested account balance at the
time of payment, excluding any outstanding loan at the time of payment. Although outstanding loan balances are included
for purposes of computing the amount of an award as of the appropriate computation date as determined in accordance
with &sect;1653.4, payment cannot include any amount that is outstanding as a loan, because the money is not in the
account and thus is not available to be paid. Payment of more than the vested account balance excluding the outstanding
loan balance would require a payment from the Plan that would have to be absorbed by the rest of the TSP participants.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1653.5(d) provides that orders requiring a series of payments will not be deemed qualifying orders. If an
order requires a payment greater than the account balance as of the date of the payment, the full amount of the account
will be paid pursuant to the order. If the account subsequently receives additional money, that money will not be paid
pursuant to the court order. A new court order would be required for payment of the additional sums. In essence, a payment
pursuant to a court order extinguishes all entitlements under that court order; further payment can only be made pursuant
to a subsequent order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1653.5(e) provides that joint payments are not permitted. If more than one person is awarded a portion of the
account, the amount awarded to each must be specified in the order. Although the checks will be made payable only to
the payee(s) named in the order, the Board will permit each payee to specify the address to which the check should be
sent, even if that address is different from an address listed in the court order. However, only the payee may designate
an address to which the check should be sent, and such designation must be done in writing. The Board will not honor a
change of address submitted, for example, by the payee's attorney. A strict rule against accepting address changes
from anyone other than the payee is necessary to protect against forbidden alienations of the benefits to which the
payee, as a beneficiary of the TSP, has become entitled. Unless the address is changed by the payee, the check will be
sent to an address provided in the court order. If an order provides an address that is ``in care of'' another individual,
the check will be issued to the payee but sent to the ``in care of'' address.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1653.5(f) provides that prior to payment the TSP recordkeeper must have the payee's full name, mailing address,
and Social Security number. This information may be provided in the court order or separately by the parties or their
representatives. However, as discussed in connection with paragraph (e), only the payee may change the mailing address
for the check to an address other than his or her own address. The payee's representative may not do so.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1653.5(g) provides that payment will be made to the payee's estate if the payee dies before payment is made
pursuant to a court order. It is not necessary that the court order be submitted to the Board prior to the death of the
payee, as long as the order was issued prior to the payee's death and in all other respects constitutes a qualifying
order. The court may, in the order, provide for an individual or entity other than the payee's estate to receive payment
in the event of the payee's death.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the participant dies prior to payment of the account, a court order entered prior to the participant's death will
be honored. It does not matter that the order may not have been received by the Board prior to the participant's death.
However, if the order is not received by the Board prior to otherwise proper payment of the account to someone other
than the payee(s) specified in the court order, then the court order will not be honored. The Board will neither seek
nor accept a return of funds properly paid prior to receipt of a court order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1653.5(h) provides that remarriage or termination of a legal separation does not nullify a court order that
has already been submitted to the Board. The Board does not believe it can be presumed that in all cases in which a domestic
relations court divides property, including a TSP account, the division should be rendered void merely because the
parties choose to remarry. If that is the court's intent, then the parties must obtain an order to that effect and submit
it to the Board before payment is made pursuant to the original court order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1653.5(i) reflects the last sentence of 5 U.S.C. 8467(a), which provides that, ``Any payment under this subsection
to a person bars recovery by any other person.'' Once payment pursuant to a court order has been properly made, the Board
will not accept return of the money disbursed. Nor will an additional payment be made to another payee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1653.5(j) provides that payments will be made from the TSP investment funds on a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 basis. For example, if a participant's $10,000 account balance is invested 50% ($5,000) in the G Fund, 30% ($3,000)
in the C Fund and 20% ($2,000) in the F Fund, then an award of $1,000 would be paid $500 from the G Fund, $300 from the C Fund,
and $200 from the F Fund. The Board will not honor any provision in a court order that requires the payment to be made other
than 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

Qualifying retirement benefits court orders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The TSP will only honor the terms of a retirement benefits court order that is qualifying under paragraph (b) of
this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) A retirement benefits court order must meet each of the following requirements to be considered qualifying:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The court order must be a court decree of divorce, of annulment, or of legal separation, or any court order or court-approved
property settlement agreement incident to a decree of divorce, of annulment, or of legal separation. Orders may be
issued at any stage of a divorce, annulment, or legal separation proceeding. Orders issued prior to a final decree,
such as orders for the purpose of preserving the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
status quo
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 pending the final resolution of the proceeding, are referred to as ``preliminary'' court orders, and will be considered
``incident to'' a final decree, notwithstanding that a final decree has not yet been, and may not be, issued. Orders
issued subsequent to a final decree, such as orders for the purpose of amending such decree, are referred to as ``subsequent''
court orders, and will also be considered ``incident to'' such decree. However, any subsequent order that requires
the return of money properly paid pursuant to an earlier court order will not constitute a qualifying order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The court order must ``expressly relate'' to the Thrift Savings Plan account of a current TSP participant. This
means that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The order must on its face specifically describe the TSP in such a way that it cannot be confused with other Federal
Government retirement benefits or non-Federal retirement benefits; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The order must be written in terms appropriate to a defined contribution plan rather than a defined benefit plan.
For example, it should generally refer to the individual participant's ``account'' or ``account balance'' rather
than a ``benefit formula'' or the participant's ``eventual benefits.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If the court order awards an amount to be paid from the participant's TSP account, the award must be for:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A specific dollar amount;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A stated percentage or stated fraction of the account;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A portion of the account to be calculated by applying a formula that yields a mathematically possible result.
Any variables in the formula must have values that are readily ascertainable from the face of the order or from Government
employment records; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) A survivor annuity as provided in 5 U.S.C. 8435(e).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Court orders that make awards from the TSP may only provide for payments to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Spouses or former spouses of the participant;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Attorneys for spouses or former spouses of the participant;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Dependent children or other dependents of the participant;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Attorneys for dependent children or other dependents of the participant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The following retirement benefits court orders will be considered non-qualifying:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Orders relating to a TSP account that contains only nonvested money, unless the money will become vested within
90 days of the date of receipt of the order if the participant remains in Federal service;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2)(i) Orders that award an amount to be paid at a future specified date or upon the occurrence of a future specified
event, unless:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The amount of the entitlement can be currently calculated; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The award provides for the payment of interest or earnings from the date of calculation to the specified date or
event for payment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If an order meets the requirements of paragraphs (c)(2)(i) (A) and (B) of this section, a current payment will
be made in accordance with the procedures set forth in &sect;1653.5, rather than a payment at the future date stated
in the order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) For purposes of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, orders that require only that the amount of the award be calculated
on the date of payment, without stating a future date or event for payment, will not be considered as awarding an amount
to be paid at a future date or upon the occurrence of a future event. In such cases, the date of payment will be determined
in accordance with the procedures set forth in &sect;1653.5, and the amount of the entitlement will be determined
in accordance with &sect;1653.4 using that date of payment.

 For purposes of this part, the term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
former spouse
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 shall have the same meaning as set forth in 5 U.S.C. 8401(12).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 -->
&sect;1653.3 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->
Processing retirement benefits court orders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The Board's review of retirement benefits court orders is governed solely by the Federal Employees' Retirement
System Act (FERSA), 5 U.S.C. Chapter 84, and by the terms of this part. The Board will honor retirement benefits court
orders properly issued by a court of any state, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, the
Northern Mariana Islands, or the Virgin Islands, and any Indian court. However, those courts have no jurisdiction
over the Board and the Board cannot be made a party to the underlying domestic relations proceedings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Retirement benefits court orders should be submitted to the Board's recordkeeper at the following address: Thrift
Savings Plan Service Office, National Finance Center, P.O. Box 61500, New Orleans, Louisiana 70161&hyph;1500.
Receipt by the recordkeeper will be considered receipt by the Board.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Upon receipt of a document that purports to be a qualifying retirement benefits court order, including preliminary
and subsequent court orders, the participant's account will be frozen. After an account is frozen, no withdrawals
or loans will be allowed until the account is unfrozen. All other account activity, including contributions, adjustments,
and interfund transfers, will be permitted. The parties will be notified that the participant's account has been
frozen.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The following documents will not be treated as purporting to be qualifying retirement benefits court orders.
Therefore accounts of participants to whom such orders relate will not be frozen and these documents will not be reviewed
by the Board:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A document that does not indicate on its face (or accompany a document that establishes) that it has been issued
or approved by a court;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A court order relating to a TSP account that has been closed;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A court order dated prior to June 6, 1986;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A court order that fails to award all or any part of the TSP account to anyone other than the participant;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) A court order that does not mention retirement benefits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) After the participant's account is frozen, the document will be reviewed initially to determine if it is a complete
original or copy of a retirement benefits court order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) It it is determined that the document is not complete, a complete document will be requested. If it is not received
within 30 days of the date of such request, the account will be unfrozen and no further action will be taken with respect
to the document.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Upon receipt of a complete order that is either an original or a copy of a retirement benefits court order, the Board
will review the order and will determine whether it is a qualifying order as described in &sect;1653.2 and, if it awards
an amount to be paid from a participant's TSP account, the amount of the entitlement. The Board will advise all parties
in writing of its decision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) The Board's decision will contain the following information:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The Board's determination regarding whether the court order is qualifying;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A statement of the applicable statute or regulations;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If the order is determined to be qualifying, a statement regarding the effect that compliance with the court order
will have on the participant's TSP account;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) If the order requires payment, a description of the method by which the entitlement under the court order was calculated
and the circumstances under which payment will be made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The Board's decision will be final. There is no administrative appeal from the decision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) An account frozen under this section will be unfrozen as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If a complete document has not been received within 30 days from the date of a request described in paragraph (f)
of this section, upon expiration of the 30-day period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) If the order is a preliminary order or other order precluding payment from the account, as soon as practicable after
receipt of a certified copy or original court order vacating or superseding such order (unless the order vacating
or superseding the preliminary order itself warrants placing a freeze on the account).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If the order is valid to award a payment from the TSP account of a participant under this part, upon payment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) If the Board determines that the order is not a qualifying order under this part, 45 days after issuance of the Board's
decision. The 45-day period will be terminated if both parties submit a written request for such a termination to the
Board.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(k) Multiple court orders pending before the Board will be processed in accordance with the procedures set forth in
this part in the following order:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) As between conflicting qualifying court orders relating to the same spouse or former spouse, the Board will process
only the court order bearing the latest date entered by the clerk of the court. If any order does not have a date entered,
then the date the order was filed by the clerk shall be used; if there is no date entered or date filed, then the date the
order was signed by the judge shall be used.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) As between conflicting qualifying court orders relating to two or more former spouses, the Board will process
the orders in the order of the dates entered by the clerk of the court, starting with the order bearing the earliest date,
and continuing until the account is exhausted. If any order does not have a date entered, then the date the order was
filed by the clerk shall be used; if there is no date entered or date filed, then the date the order was signed by the judge
shall be used.

&sect;1653.4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->
Calculating entitlement under a retirement benefits court order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) If the court order awards a percentage or fraction of the account as of a specific date or event, the amount of the
entitlement will be calculated based upon the balance of the account as of the end of the month on or immediately preceding
the date or event, plus any transactions posted after the date or event, but before payment, that are effective on or
before the month-end date used for calculating the entitlement. For purposes of computing the amount of an entitlement,
any loan amount outstanding as of the month-end date used for calculating the entitlement shall be treated as included
in the account balance, unless the court order provides otherwise.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) If the court order awards a percentage or fraction of an account but does not contain a specific date as of which to
apply the percentage or fraction to the account, the amount of the entitlement will be calculated as described in paragraph
(a) of this section, using the account balance as of the end of the month on or immediately prior to the date the order
was entered by the clerk of the court or, if the order does not show a date entered, the date the order was filed by the clerk
of the court or, if the order does not contain a date entered or a date filed, the date signed by the judge.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) If the court order awards a specific dollar amount, the amount of the entitlement will be the lesser of:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The amount of order awards; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The amount in the account as of the end of the month on or before the date specified in the order (or, if no date is specified,
the date the order was entered by the clerk of the court or, if the order does not show a date entered, the date the order
was filed by the clerk of the court, or, if the order does not contain a date entered or a date filed, the date signed by
the judge) plus any transactions posted after the date or event, but before payment, that are effective on or before
the month-end date used for calculating the entitlement. For purposes of computing the amount of entitlement, any
loan amount outstanding as of the month-end date used for calculating the entitlement shall be treated as included
in the account balance, unless the court order provides otherwise.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Unless the court order specifically provides otherwise, the entitlement calculated under this section will
not be credited with interest or earnings. If interest or earnings are awarded, the Board will use the monthly rates
of return credited to the account unless the court order specifies a different rate. The TSP monthly rates of return
may be either positive or negative. Interest or earnings will be calculated beginning with the month following the
month-end valuation date used for calculating the entitlement and ending with the month prior to the month of payment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) All entitlements will be calculated initially under this section including both vested and nonvested amounts
in the participant's account. If at the time of payment the non-vested portion of the account has not become vested
or has been forfeited, the entitlement will be recalculated using only the participant's vested account balance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) If a qualifying court order creates an entitlement to a portion of a TSP account under this part, payment will be
made no sooner than 30 days after the Board's decision has been issued and the appropriate tax withholding notification
has been provided.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(b) A payment made pursuant to a qualifying court order will be made only to the person(s) specified in the court order.
If payment is to be made to the spouse or former spouse of the participant, he or she may request that the TSP transfer
all or a portion of his or her payment to an Individual Retirement Arrangement (IRA) or other eligible retirement plan.
Such a request must be made by filing a Spouse Election to Transfer to IRA or Other Eligible Retirement Plan, and must
be received prior to payment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) In no case may a payment made pursuant to a qualifying court order exceed the participant's vested account balance,
excluding any outstanding loan amount as of the end of the month preceding the date of payment. If the entitlement calculated
pursuant to this subpart exceeds the participant's vested account balance (excluding any outstanding loan amount),
then only the vested amount in the account (excluding the outstanding loan balance) will be paid.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The entire amount of an entitlement created by a qualifying court order must be disbursed at one time. A series of
payments will not be made even if the court order provides for such a method of payment. A payment pursuant to a court
order extinguishes all further rights to any payment under that order even if the entire amount of the entitlement
could not be paid. Any further award must be contained in a separate court order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Payment cannot be made jointly to more than one person. If payment is to be made more than one individual, the order
must separately indicate the amount to be paid to each.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) In order to make a payment pursuant to a retirement benefits court order, the Board's recordkeeper must be provided
with the full name, mailing address, and Social Security number of the payee, even if the payment is being mailed to
another address.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) If the payee dies before a payment is made pursuant to a qualifying retirement benefits court order, payment will
be made to the estate of the payee, unless otherwise specified by the court order. If the participant dies before payment
is made pursuant to a qualifying retirement benefits order entered prior to the participant's death, the order will
be honored as long as it is submitted to the Board before payment of the account, regardless of whether the order was
received by the Board prior to the participant's death.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) If the parties to a divorce or annulment are remarried, or a legal separation is terminated, a new court order will
be required to prevent payment pursuant to a previously submitted qualifying retirement benefits court order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Payment to a person (including the estate of the payee) pursuant to a qualifying retirement benefits court order,
made in accordance with this subpart, bars recovery by any other person pursuant to that order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) Payments pursuant to qualifying court orders will be paid 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 from the TSP investment funds, based on the balance in each fund on the date as of which the payment is made. The Board
will not honor provisions of court orders that require payment to be made from specific investment funds.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) proposes to amend its regulations in response to a
petition for rulemaking. The rulemaking would require that the regulatory authority provide to each person who was
a party to an informal conference its written findings granting, requiring modification of, or denying a permit application.
The rulemaking would also require both that an approved permit contain in its permit area only lands for which the applicant
has established a right-to-enter and commence surface coal mining and reclamation operations, and that compliance
with an approved permit be based on activities to be conducted solely upon such lands.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In a letter dated September 29, 1992, Mr. Jim B. Wyant of Vincennes, Indiana, presented a petition for rulemaking to
OSM. A ``Notice of availability of a petition to initiate rulemaking and request for comment'' was published in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, November 12, 1992, (57 FR 53670). After consideration of the petitioner's requests and public comments received
on the petition, the Director of OSM published his ``Notice of decision on petition for rulemaking'' and stated that
``OSM will initiate Federal rulemaking proposing to revise the permit application provisions of 30 CFR 773.15 to
require notification of all parties to an informal conference of any decision to require modification of the permit
application. OSM will also initiate a rulemaking to revise the provisions of 30 CFR 778.15 to address the degree to
which lands may be included in the permit area where the permittee does not have the right-to-enter.'' (August 24,
1993, 58 FR 44630)

Notification Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM proposes to modify 30 CFR 773.15, Review of Permit Applications at 773.15(a)(1). The sentences of this subparagraph
would be redesignated as (1), (i) and (ii) with an additional sentence added as subsection (iii). The added sentence
would require that the regulatory authority ``(p)rovide a copy of the written decision granting, requiring modification
of, or denying the permit, and stating the specific reasons for the decision to the permit applicant and to each person
who was a party to the conference.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM is proposing to revise &sect;773.15(a) because its current regulations 30 CFR 773.19(b)(1) only require the
regulatory authority to provide written notification of its final decision on the permit application to all parties
to an informal conference. Its regulations at &sect;773.15(a) do not, however, require the regulatory authority
to provide the same notification to the same parties when that authority requires a modification of the permit application.
Section 773.15(a) would, therefore, be revised to require the regulatory authority to provide parties to an informal
conference the same notification of decisions modifying the permit application as for decisions approving or denying
the application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1979 final permanent regulations at 30 CFR 786.23(c) originally required the regulatory authority to notify
all parties to an informal conference of any decision granting, modifying or denying the permit application, and
stating the specific reasons therefor in the decision. (March 13, 44 FR 15381) This required notice provision was
dropped without explanation in the 1983 revision of OSM's permitting regulations. (September 28, 48 FR 44371, 44395)
Thus, under the current 30 part 773 regulations, and as noted by the petitioner, concerned parties who have taken an
active role in the permitting process through participation in informal conferences may find that regulatory authority
decisions requiring modification of the permit application are conveyed solely to the applicant. These concerned
parties would receive no feedback on important permit application issues until the regulatory authority's final
decision on the application is conveyed to all parties pursuant to &sect;773.19(b)(1). The proposed revisions to
&sect;773.15(a) would address this inequity by reinstating the 1979 requirement that all parties to an informal
conference be provided the regulatory authority's written decision granting, modifying, or denying the permit
application and stating the specific reasons therefore in the decision.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 August 24, 1993, the agency stated that it would ``initiate a rulemaking to revise the provisions of 30 CFR 778.15 to
address the degree to which lands may be included in the permit area where the permittee does not have the right-to-enter.''
Later, in considering this commitment, OSM concluded that it could be more appropriately implemented by proposing
revisions to &sect;773.15, Review of permit applications, and 30 CFR 773.17, Permit conditions, rather than to &sect;778.15,
Right-of-entry information. Existing section 773.15 would therefore be revised to add paragraph (c)(13) requiring
both that the approved permit contain only lands for which the applicant has established a right-to-enter and conduct
surface mining and reclamation operations and that compliance with the operation and reclamation plans be based
upon activities conducted solely upon such lands.

Note: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A new but different subparagraph &sect;773.15(c)(13) has also been proposed under the remining rulemaking. (June
2, 1994, 59 FR 28744) If both this and the remining rulemaking are finalized as proposed, the (c)(13) subparagraph
of the second effective rule will be redesignated as (c)(14).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Existing &sect;773.17 would also be revised to be consistent with proposed &sect;773.15(c)(13) and would, as a permit
condition, impose a similar requirement that the permit area of an approved permit contain only lands for which the
applicant has established a right-to-enter and conduct surface mining and reclamation operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 507(b)(9) of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA or the Act), 30 U.S.C. 1201 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, states, ``the applicant shall file with the regulatory authority on an accurate map or plan, to an appropriate scale,
clearly showing the land to be affected as of the date of the application, the area of land within the permit area upon
which the applicant has the legal right-to-enter and commence surface mining operations on that area affected, and
whether that right is the subject of pending court litigation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
That nothing in this Act shall be construed as vesting in the regulatory authority the jurisdiction to adjudicate
property title disputes.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act and its implementing regulations are silent on the specific question of whether the approved permit can include
land for which the applicant does not have right-of-entry (``uncontrolled land'') and which will not be disturbed
under the permit until such right-of-entry is obtained. It has, however, been OSM's practice under its Federal and
Indian lands programs to allow inclusion in the permit application of land for which the applicant can not establish
right-of-entry but to prohibit inclusion of such land in the permit at the time of issuance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Promulgation of this Federal practice as a national rule would end the practice in a minority of approved program States
of allowing inclusion in the approved permit of land for which the applicant does not have right-of-entry. The owners
of such lands often complain that this inclusion clouds their title, depresses their property values, and interferes
with their ability to enjoy their property rights.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The language of proposed &sect;773.15(c)(13) ``(t)he applicant has demonstrated that the approved permit area
contains only lands for which the applicant has established a right-to-enter and conduct surface coal mining and
reclamation operations'' and similar language in proposed &sect;773.17(a) are intended to prohibit the inclusion
of uncontrolled land in the permit area of approved permits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM's oversight of those State programs allowing uncontrolled land in the permit area of approved permits has shown
that the validity of the operation and reclamation plans required by 30 CFR part 780 may be substantially compromised
by the applicant's subsequent inability to gain access to blocks of land within the permit area upon which the plans
were predicated. Examples exist where central elements upon which approval was based required modification when
the applicant subsequently was unable to obtain access to required land. In various instances, proposed spoil and
soil storage areas, borrow areas, and facility areas have been unavailable for use. Sediment control strategies
have been compromised when land for sediment ponds and diversion ditches in the approved operation and reclamation
plans was unavailable. Changes have occurred which require recalculation of the bond amount. While OSM recognizes
the need for operation and reclamation plans to be dynamic enough to accommodate new information and unexpected conditions
that may develop, changes such as those described militate against the credibility of OSM's regulatory scheme which
is to be based upon the approval or rejection of accurate and reliable operation and reclamation plans. Accordingly,
and in partial response to industry's comments discussed below, OSM is also proposing that &sect;773.15(c)(13)
include the requirement that compliance with the operation and reclamation plans be based upon activities to be conducted
solely upon lands for which the applicant has the right-to-enter and conduct surface mining and reclamation operations.
This language is intended to put all parties on notice that operation and reclamation plans included in the approved
permit cannot be based on activities to be conducted on uncontrolled land.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters opposing the petition argued that the inclusion of uncontrolled land in the permit areas of permit
applications and approved permits is necessary to accommodate the complexities of real estate transaction involved
in mine plan development and to allow for environmental planning based on a more conceptually complete mining and
reclamation plan. While OSM acknowledges that inclusion of uncontrolled lands in an approved permit may allow the
formulation of a comprehensive and cumulative operation and reclamation plan and environmental analysis, such
plans and analysis may not prove reliable and, therefore, may not provide the regulatory authority with a reasonable
basis for concluding that the lands for which the applicant has right-of-entry can actually be mined and reclaimed
in accordance with the Act and in compliance with its implementing regulations. 30 CFR 773.15(c) (1), (2) and 780.2.
Neither would the commenter's suggestion that the approved permit be conditioned to authorize mining only on lands
for which right-of-entry is obtained address this potential defect in the permitted operation and reclamation plans
and associated environmental analysis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;&sect;773.15(c)(13) and 773.17(a) would not preclude inclusion under &sect;778.15(a) of a reasonable
amount of uncontrolled land in the permit application thus accommodating the need for continued real estate transactions
during the permit review process and facilitating the development of environmental projections based on mining
and reclamation on a scale the applicant plans to achieve. However, under the proposed rule permit issuance would
be predicated upon the existence of a clearly discernible and finite permit area in the operation and reclamation
plans where the applicant's ability to obtain right-of-entry is not a variable that would influence the execution
of the plans as approved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In practical terms, the requirement of proposed &sect;773.15(c)(13) that ``compliance with the operation and reclamation
plans is based upon activities to be conducted solely upon such lands'' means that immediately prior to permit issuance
the regulatory authority must reassess the legitimacy of the applicant's operation and reclamation plans taking
into account the impact of the applicant's lack of access to any uncontrolled land. Loss of a piece of land necessary
for the accomplishment of the operation or reclamation plan could require permit modification or permit denial.
It is anticipated that the &sect;773.15(c)(13) requirement will militate against inclusion in the permit application
of properties for which the applicant is unlikely to obtain right-of-entry by the time of permit issuance. This should
in turn accrue to the benefit of landowners who never wanted their properties included in the permit application.
It should also accrue to the benefit of the environment as planning would be based on more plausible real estate projections.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;&sect;773.15(c)(13) and 773.17(a) are seen as striking a reasonable balance between not unnecessarily
burdening the legitimate mining industry and protecting the rights of landowners while providing the regulatory
authority with the accurate, comprehensive and reliable information it needs to comply with its responsibilities
under 30 CFR 773.15(c)(1), (2) and 780.2. These proposals are not intended to alter existing standards for establishing
right-of-entry. They merely require that the applicant must demonstrate that the permit area of the approved permit
contains only lands for which he has established a right-of-entry.

, that the proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Although
OSM does not have data on the number of coal mine operations or the number of landowners and amount of land that would
be affected by this rule, data obtained from OSM Field Offices on 14 States indicates that only 3 of those States do not
notify participants as to the outcome of informal conferences, and that only 6 out of 18 States for which data is available
allow land in the permit area of an approved permit for which the applicant does not have right-of-entry authorization.
However, to notify the participants to a conference of the outcome of that conference is a procedural type of action
entailing minor economic consequences comprised of the cost of mailing notices to the participants, and to require
that an applicant have right-of-entry authorization to all lands included in the permit area of an approved permit
does not take any economic rights from the applicant, nor does it impose significant additional costs on the applicant.
Therefore, the proposed revisions are not expected to be of economic significance.

This proposed rule has been reviewed under the applicable standards of section 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778,
Civil Justice Reform (56 FR 55195). In general, the requirements of section 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778 are covered
by the preamble discussion of this proposed rule. Additional remarks follow concerning individual elements of the
Executive Order: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. What is the preemptive effect, if any, to be given to the regulation? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would have the same preemptive effect as other standards adopted pursuant to SMCRA. To retain primacy,
States have to adopt and apply standards for their regulatory programs that are no less effective than those set forth
in OSM's rules. Any State law that is inconsistent with or that would preclude implementation of this proposed rule
would be subject to preemption under SMCRA section 505 and implementing regulations at 30 CFR 730.11. To the extent
that the proposed rules would result in preemption of State law, the provisions of SMCRA are intended to preclude inconsistent
State laws and regulations. This approach is established in SMCRA, and has been judicially affirmed. See

This rule modifies the implementation of SMCRA as described herein, and is not intended to modify the implementation
of any other Federal statute. The preceding discussion of this rule specifies the Federal regulatory provisions
that are affected by this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
