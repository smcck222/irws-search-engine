<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. If adopted, this proposed
rule will not: (1) Preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable
conflict with this rule; (2) Have any retroactive effect; and (3) Require administrative proceedings before parties
may file suit challenging the provisions of this rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
REA has determined that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities, as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The REA program provides loans to REA Borrowers at interest rates and terms that are more favorable than those generally
available from the private sector. REA Borrowers, as a result of obtaining federal financing, receive economic benefits
which ultimately offset any direct economic costs associated with complying with REA regulations and requirements.
Moreover, this action is in response to the Rural Electrification Loan Restructuring Act of 1993.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 20, 1993, REA published an interim rule (58 FR 66250) to incorporate changes to telephone loan policies
required by the Rural Electrification Loan Restructuring Act of 1993 (RELRA) (107 Stat. 1356). RELRA amended several
provisions of the Rural Electrification Act of 1936, as amended (7 U.S.C. 901 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) (RE Act), and mandated a restructuring of the telephone loan program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 13, 1994, REA adopted its interim rule as a final rule (59 FR 17460) with one exception, 7 CFR Part 1751, Telecommunications
System Planning and Design Criteria, and Procedures. Because of the overwhelming response and concerns regarding
the requirements of the State Telecommunications Modernization Plan (Modernization Plan), REA is proposing to
amend 7 CFR part 1751, subpart B. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As revised, this Rule would require that Modernization Plans, at a minimum, apply to all REA borrowers. If a Modernization
Plan is developed by the PUC or the State Legislature, REA encourages, but does not require, that the Modernization
Plan's requirements apply to the rural service areas of all Telecommunications Providers. A State's decision not
to include non-REA borrowers will not prejudice REA approval of their Plan. The PUC or the State Legislature may also,
at its option, extend coverage of the Modernization Plan to all service areas of all Telecommunications Providers
in the State. In addition, while requirements contained in &sect;1751.106 apply only to wireline services, the State
Legislature or PUC, at its discretion, may extend coverage of Modernization Plans to wireless or other communications
services in a State as it deems appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is REA's policy that every State have a Modernization Plan which provides for the improvement of the State's Public
Switched Network. If the Plan Developer is either the State Legislature or the PUC, such entity must submit for REA
approval its Modernization Plan by a date one year from issuance of the Final Rule. After this date, if a State or its
PUC declines or fails to submit for REA approval its Modernization Plan, eligibility to develop the Plan passes to
a numeric majority of the Borrowers within the State. While there is no time limit requiring States to have an approved
plan in place, REA, as required by RELRA, will not approve any direct loans in States without such a plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the comment period, REA received 81 comments regarding the interim rule, and these comments were taken into
consideration in preparing the proposed amendments. Comments were received from the following:

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This was a nearly unanimous comment and one with which REA concurs. REA's intent is to specify information carrying
capability, i.e., bit rate. References to specific technologies, like ISDN, have been removed.

Many commenters believe that the use of the word ``objectives'' in RELRA implies non-binding guidelines. REA believes
the commenters are taking the word out of context. The entire provision is as follows:

``REQUIREMENTS._For purposes of subparagraph (A), a telecommunications modernization plan must, at a minimum,
meet the following objectives.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
REA believes that an objective that must be met is mandatory. In the interim regulation (7 CFR part 1751, published
December 20, 1993), REA set forth both ``requirements'' and ``objectives'' to be contained in the Modernization
Plan. Requirements were to be binding while objectives were only goals or targets. This may have led to confusion because
both words are used in RELRA. In the proposed rule, REA has included only requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
REA went beyond the intent of RELRA by establishing timeframes for modernization.

REA set timeframes because a requirement with no due date is not a requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
REA believes that advanced telecommunications services should be available to the public within a reasonable time
after they are developed. Broad experience in bringing modern telephone service to rural America teaches the value
of caution and reflection before imposing binding requirements on future business activities. Varying construction
schedules, economic conditions and rates of technological innovation affect even the most careful projections.
REA conservatively projected the reasonably expected growth of both the public's need for telecommunications services
and the ability of Telecommunications Providers and equipment manufacturers to provide those services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
REA consulted both its past experience and its expectations of future technological development before setting
the short-, medium- and long-term deadlines in the regulation. Our experience with new technology such as buried
cable, digital switching, and fiber optic systems where the widespread deployment into the telecommunications
network took two to five years, lead us to adopt the five year phase-in concept. The timetable is achievable, given
the telecommunications services presently available, the resources of the Telecommunications Providers, and
the accelerating engineering achievements likely in the next few years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations phase in the requirements in three steps to provide for an orderly deployment of these telecommunications
services. Facilities constructed more than one year after REA approves a Modernization Plan are required to provide
those services that can be produced by equipment now in existence. The one year delay allows for construction-in-progress
to be completed before the Modernization Plan requirements go into effect. The requirements for the medium and long
terms simply expand the coverage of the requirements so that when the long term period (11&hyph;16 years) is reached,
all subscribers will have the services deployed during the short term period available to them.

c. Comment Summary: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
RELRA does not require that telecommunications improvements be deployed ``concurrently'' in rural and nonrural
areas but only that ``the plan must provide for uniform deployment schedules to ensure that advanced services are
deployed at the same time in rural and nonrural areas''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters thought that REA intended all improvements to be made simultaneously throughout a service area.
REA understands that there is a logical order to providing improvements and that they will often happen first in nonrural
areas. REA intends that they should be deployed and available at approximately the same time in rural and nonrural
areas. For example, if digital switching technology is being deployed in a nonrural area, replacement switches in
rural areas would also employ digital technology. This does not mean that if a switch was replaced in a nonrural area,
a switch would have to be replaced in the rural area. In the proposed rule, REA has clarified this requirement. See &sect;1751.106(a).

d. Comment Summary: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
REA has no basis for requiring either the elimination of mileage and/or zone charges or that Telecommunications Providers
adopt flexible tariffs. These issues concern rates and are not ``service standards''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The stated requirement in RELRA is the elimination of party line service. REA's experience has been that imposing
zone and mileage charges on one-party service creates a large disincentive for subscribers to choose this service.
However, REA will not require the Modernization Plan contain a provision to eliminate zone and mileage charges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
RELRA 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
provides that the Modernization Plan ``must provide for the availability of telecommunications services for improved
business, educational, and medical services.'' Rigid rate structures have served as the primary impediment to the
provision of distance learning and medical link services. REA has seen cases where states have set wideband rates
in direct proportion to the voiceband rate resulting in, for example, rates for schools far beyond what they can afford.
REA has clarified its intent on this subject in &sect;1751.106(e).

REA concurs and has given the Plan Developer some discretion in this matter. Section 1751.106(g)(2)(ii) has been
revised to allow a Telecommunications Provider to request additional time from the Plan Developer in the case of a
PUC or State Legislature developed plan, or from the REA in the case of a REA Borrower developed plan. The Plan Developer
or REA, as the case may be, must consider each request separately and can grant additional time only if either the best
available telecommunications technology lacks the capability to enable the Telecommunications Provider to comply
with the non-loaded requirement or complying with the requirement would impose prohibitive cost on the Telecommunications
Provider.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the interim rule, all references to provision of 150 Mb/sec service were non-binding ``objectives'', see paragraph
2a. REA focused on the requirement in RELRA that telephone lines be capable of carrying at least 1,000,000 bits per
second. REA adjusted this to the standard North American rate of 1.544 Mb/sec. Such a rate allows for both the transmission
of at least 1 million bits per second and for the transmission of modest quality, highly compressed video. A higher
rate is not required by the proposed rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The interim rule violates section 202 of the RE Act which states that nothing in the RE Act shall be construed to deprive
any State commission of jurisdiction to regulate telephone service, including the rates for such service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 REA believes there is no conflict between RELRA and section 202 of the RE Act. The PUC is neither required to develop
a Modernization Plan nor to approve REA loans that are consistent with a Modernization Plan whoever is the Plan Developer.
Therefore the PUC's jurisdiction to regulate telephone service is not impaired. No change has been made to the regulation
based on this comment.

6. Comment Summary: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
REA has not considered how the proposed services can be offered at affordable rates. The regulation could result in
an REA Borrower-developed Modernization Plan which requires investments that a PUC would not approve.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The requirements included in the proposed regulation apply almost entirely to new construction. New construction
has to be economically justified to receive either REA financing or PUC approval for inclusion in the rate base. REA
believes strongly in universal service and would not issue a regulation which it believed to be an impediment to that
goal. No change has been made to the regulation based on these comments.

 As redrafted, the Modernization Plan must apply only to REA Borrowers unless a PUC or a State Legislature decides,
at its option, to apply the Modernization Plan to non-REA Borrower Telecommunications Providers. The REA does, however,

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The modern telecommunications system envisioned by RELRA and the Modernization Plan requirements can succeed only
if it is supported by market demand. REA's electric and telecommunications programs have repeatedly demonstrated
how quickly rural America takes advantage of new utility services. RELRA and the Modernization Plans lead the way
for today's nonrural and rural subscribers to receive the modern telecommunications services they want and need.
REA believes that the Modernization Plan requirements of this regulation rest on a sound economic basis. True to its
statutory mandate, REA will finance projects only if it believes there is adequate security and the loan will be repaid
within the time agreed.

It is untimely for REA to develop a rule when other laws concerning telecommunications have been introduced in Congress.
It is inappropriate for REA to develop rules for telecommunications. That should be the responsibility of the FCC.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 REA, as the agency responsible for promoting rural telecommunications, has long experience in setting the engineering
and technical standards for service in rural areas and is ideally suited for the responsibility it was given by Congress.
REA is working to ensure that Modernization Plan requirements and the Proposed Rule governing their preparation
are flexible enough to accommodate evolving national policies promoting the National Information Infrastructure.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
REA will revise, within our statutory constraints, these regulations and approve amendments to Modernization Plans
if the National Information Infrastructure develops along lines not presently envisioned. However, the legislative
imperative of RELRA and rural America's urgent need for modern telecommunications services require that the regulations
not be delayed.

Comment Summary:

The rule is not clear on Plan Developer eligibility as related to time. The law says the one year period starts after
publication of the final rule. Can Borrowers submit a Modernization Plan before the end of the year if the PUC or State
Legislature does not intend to? What if a PUC or State Legislature submits a Modernization Plan on the last day? Won't
loans be delayed if a PUC or State Legislature does not develop a plan and an REA Borrower-developed one has not been
approved?

RELRA sets forth the method of determining Plan Developer eligibility. With regard to the specific points mentioned
above: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The one year period starts with publication of the final rule developed in response to comments on this proposed

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. A Modernization Plan submitted on the last day will be approved by REA if it meets the minimum requirements without
alteration. The proposed rule includes language which recommends that to ensure a PUC or a State Legislature has sufficient
time to respond to any REA comments on its proposed Modernization Plan, the PUC or State Legislature should submit
its plan at least 90 days in advance of the expiration of its eligibility. See &sect;1751.104(b)(2).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
REA believes that the lack of consensus on how to bring wider band switched service to the home and small business, particularly
in rural areas, means that Telecommunications Providers continue to build and rebuild their systems essentially
for traditional voiceband service. In many cases this plant can not be adapted to wider band services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the interim rule (dated December 20, 1993) REA had required a ``generic design'' for broadband service. Since REA
is no longer including non-binding goals in the proposed regulation, the requirement for a generic design has been
changed to a requirement for the developer to provide a strategic development proposal which provides the Plan Developer's
vision of a State telecommunications structure for the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to local power, REA retains a concern over system reliability. The proposed rule requires that no matter
what level of service is being offered, sufficient system power must be available to provide voice service during
electric utility outages. See &sect;1751.106(h)(2)(ii) and (i)(2)(iv).

General Summary: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is REA's belief that national telecommunications ``highways'' will not and cannot be fully utilized unless improvements
are made to what might be called the telecommunications ``driveways'', the local loops. Most loops cannot transmit
information over 9600 bits per second (b/s). Consequently, many advanced telecommunications services are not available
on the Public Switched Network or, where available, operate only on short loops. This limits use of these advanced
services to densely populated areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RELRA requires that telephone lines be capable of transmitting: (1) Information at no less than 1,000,000 bits per
second (1Mb/s) and (2) video images. REA believes both requirements can be satisfied by telephone lines which can
transmit and receive 1.544 Mb/s, the North American standard digital transmission rate. This rate is sufficient
to carry both 1 million bits per second and highly compressed, modest quality video. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To carry 1.544 Mb/sec, the capacity of ordinary telephone loops must be increased by several orders of magnitude.
The other requirements in the law are more easily met. Therefore, improving the loop has been REA's focus in preparing
minimum Modernization Plan requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
REA believes that the requirements and time limits set forth in this section will achieve the service standards of
RELRA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, REA is concerned about coordination between States. REA recommends that Modernization Plan Developers
should work with Plan Developers in other States both before and after their Modernization Plans are approved to coordinate
proposed improvements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
REA recommends that Modernization Plan Developers give consideration to planning for outside plant which can ultimately
provide future broadband Wireline Service with a bandwidth equivalent to a digital rate on the order of 150 Mb/sec.
Such facilities could carry one or more channels of conventional video with the quality depending on the modulation
technique.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) It is the policy of REA that every State have a Modernization Plan which provides for the improvement of the State's
Public Switched Network. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (b) A proposed Modernization Plan must be submitted to REA for approval. REA will approve the proposed Modernization
Plan if it conforms to the provisions of this subpart. Once obtained, REA's approval of a Modernization Plan cannot
be rescinded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (c) The Modernization Plan shall not interfere with REA's authority to issue such other telecommunications standards,
specifications, requirements, and procurement rules as may be promulgated from time to time by REA including, without
limitation, those set forth in 7 CFR part 1755. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (d) The Modernization Plan must, at a minimum, apply to all REA borrowers. If a Modernization Plan is developed by the
PUC or the State Legislature, REA encourages, but does not require, that the Modernization Plan's requirements apply
to the rural service areas of all Telecommunications Providers. A State's decision not to include non-REA borrowers
will not prejudice REA approval of their Plan. The PUC or the State Legislature may also, at its option, extend coverage
of the Modernization Plan to all service areas of all Telecommunications Providers in the State. In addition, while
requirements contained in &sect;1751.106 apply only to wireline services, the State Legislature or PUC, at its discretion,
may extend coverage of Modernization Plans to wireless or other communications services in a State as it deems appropriate.

 to develop a proposed Modernization Plan and deliver it to REA. REA will review and consider for approval all PUC or
State Legislature-developed Modernization Plans received by REA within this one year period. The review and approval,
if any, may occur after the one year period ends even though the PUC or State Legislature is no longer eligible to submit
a proposed Modernization Plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (b) The PUC must notify all Telecommunications Providers in the State that are part of the Public Switched Network
and other interested parties of its intent to develop a proposed Modernization Plan. The PUC is encouraged to consider
all such Providers' and interested parties' views and incorporate these views in the Modernization Plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (c) If the State Legislature or PUC is no longer eligible to develop a Modernization Plan, as described in paragraph
(a) of this section, eligibility to develop the Modernization Plan passes to a numeric majority of the Borrowers within
the State. In this case, the following apply:

For information about loan eligibility requirements in relation to the Modernization Plan, see 7 CFR part 1735. In
particular, one year after publication of the final rule, REA will make hardship loans, REA cost-of-money loans,
and RTB loans for facilities and other RE Act purposes for Telephone Borrowers in a State only if: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (a) The State has an REA approved Modernization Plan; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (b) The Borrower is participating in the Modernization Plan for the State. A Borrower is considered to be participating
if, in REA's opinion, the purposes of the loan requested by the Borrower are consistent with the Borrower achieving
the requirements stated in the Modernization Plan within the timeframe stated in the Modernization Plan unless REA
has determined that achieving the requirements is not technically or economically feasible.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) To obtain REA approval of a proposed Modernization Plan, the Plan Developer must submit the following to REA: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (1) A certified copy of the statute or PUC order, if the State is the Plan Developer, or a written request for REA approval
of the proposed Modernization Plan signed by an authorized representative of the Plan Developer, if a majority of
Borrowers is the Plan Developer; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (2) Three copies of the proposed Modernization Plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (b) Generally, REA will review the proposed Modernization Plan within (30) days and either: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (1) Approve the Modernization Plan if it conforms to the provisions of this subpart in which case REA will return a copy
of the Modernization Plan with notice of approval to the Plan Developer; or, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (2) Not approve the proposed Modernization Plan if it does not conform to the provisions of this subpart. In this event,
REA will return the proposed Modernization Plan to the Plan Developer with specific written comments and suggestions
for modifying the proposed Modernization Plan so that it will conform to the provisions of this subpart. If the Plan
Developer remains eligible, REA will invite the Plan Developer to submit a modified proposed Modernization Plan
for REA consideration. This process can continue until the Plan Developer gains approval of a proposed Modernization
Plan unless the Plan Developer is a PUC or State Legislature whose eligibility has expired. If the PUC's or State Legislature's
eligibility has expired, REA will return the proposed Modernization Plan unapproved. Because REA does not have authority
to extend a PUC's or State Legislature's eligibility, REA recommends that a PUC or State Legislature submit a proposed
Modernization Plan at least 90 days in advance of one year after publication of the final rule to allow time for this
process.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) REA understands that changes in standards, technology, regulation, and the economy could indicate that an REA-approved
Modernization Plan should be amended. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (b) The Plan Developer of the Modernization Plan may amend the Modernization Plan if REA finds the proposed changes
continue to conform to the provisions of this subpart. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (c) The procedure for requesting approval of an amended Modernization Plan is identical to the procedure for a proposed

that REA believes represent more desirable goals for the future course of telecommunications services. Such revisions
will be made in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act. These revisions shall not invalidate Modernization
Plans approved by REA but shall be used by REA to determine whether to approve amendments to Modernization Plans presented
for REA approval after the effective date of the revision.

This proposed rule requires that employees hired by the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR or Agency)
be citizens of the United States of America. This rule exempts EOIR from the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986's
general prohibition of discrimination based on citizenship status and supplements Executive Order 11935 which
requires United States citizenship for almost all Federal employees in the competitive service.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
supplementary information: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule authorizes EOIR to require its employees and volunteers to be citizens of the United States of America.
Because the central task of this Agency is adjudicating immigration-related cases, Agency employees and volunteers
often have access to sensitive information and handle complex and sensitive immigration issues. It is imperative
that individuals who work at EOIR, either as employees or volunteers, demonstrate their allegiance to the United
States by being able to document that they are United States citizens. Pursuant to E.O. 11935, 41 FR 37301 (1976), the
Executive Branch requires United States citizenship for employees hired in the competitive service. This proposed
rule extends the citizenship requirement to all EOIR employees and volunteers. The rule exempts EOIR from the prohibition
of discrimination based on citizenship status, pursuant to the procedures established by the Immigration Reform
and Control Act of 1986. 8 U.S.C. 1324b(a)(2)(C).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Additionally, this proposed rule allows the Agency to exercise its discretion to hire non-citizens when necessary
to accomplish the Agency's mission. For example, this rule would permit the Director of the Agency to authorize hiring
an interpreter skilled in the English language and an unusual foreign language when a United States citizen interpreter
is not available.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Insertion of this rule requires a slight reorganization of 8 CFR part 3.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule does not have a significant adverse economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 5 U.S.C. 605(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been drafted and reviewed in accordance with E.O. 12866 section 1(b), Principles of Regulation. The
Attorney General has determined that this rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under E.O. 12866, section
3(f), Regulatory Planning and Review, and accordingly this rule has not been reviewed by the Office of Management
and Budget.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government
and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore,
in accordance with E.O. 12612, it is determined that this rule does not have sufficient federalism implication to
warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 the Commission is publishing a notice to establish a proposed system notice to establish a new system of records, FEC
12, ``Office of Inspector General Investigative Files,'' under the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, as amended. The following
proposed amendment of the Commission's Privacy Act regulations at 11 CFR 1.14 is necessary to exempt the new system
of records from certain provisions of that Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Privacy Act and the implementing regulations require, among other things, that the Commission provide notice
when collecting information, account for certain disclosures, permit individuals access to their records, and
allow them to request that the records be amended. These provisions could interfere with the conduct of OIG investigations
if applied to the OIG's maintenance of the proposed system of records.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Commission proposes to exempt FEC 12 from these requirements under sections (j)(2) and (k)(2) of
the Act. Section (j)(2), 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), exempts a system of records maintained by ``the agency or component
thereof which performs as its principal function any activity pertaining to enforcement of criminal laws *&blank;*&blank;*.''
Section (k)(2), 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), exempts a system of records consisting of ``investigatory materials compiled
for law enforcement purposes,'' where such materials are not within the scope of the (j)(2) exemption pertaining
to criminal law enforcement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed system of records consists of information covered by the (j)(2) and (k)(2) exemptions. the OIG investigatory
files are maintained pursuant to official investigational and law enforcement functions of the Commission's Office
of Inspector General under authority of the 1988 amendments to the Inspector General Act of 1978. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Public Law 100&hyph;504, amending Public Law 95&hyph;452, 5 U.S.C. app. The OIG is an office within the Commission
that performs as one of its principal functions activities relating to the enforcement of criminal laws. In addition,
the OIG is responsible for investigating a wide range of non-criminal law enforcement matters, including civil,
administrative, or regulatory violations and similar wrongdoing. Access by subject individuals and others to this
system of records could substantially compromise the effectiveness of OIG investigations, and thus impede the apprehension
and successful prosecution or discipline of persons engaged in fraud or other illegal activity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these reasons, the Commission is proposing to exempt proposed FEC 12 under exemptions (j)(2) and (k)(2) of the
Privacy Act, by adding a new paragraph (b) to 11 CFR 1.14, the section in which the Commission specifies its systems
of records that are exempt under the Act. Where applicable, section (j)(2) may be invoked to exempt a system of records
from any Privacy Act provision except: 5 U.S.C. 552a(b) (conditions of disclosure); (c) (1) and (2) (accounting of
disclosures and retention of accounting, respectively); (e)(4) (A) through (F) (system notice requirements);
(e) (6), (7), (8), (10) and (11) (certain agency requirements relating to system maintenance); and (i) (criminal
penalties). Section (k)(2) may be invoked to exempt a system of records from: 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) (making accounting
of disclosures available to the subject individual); (d) (access to records); (e)(1) (maintaining only relevant
and necessary information; (e)(4) (G), (H), and (I) (notice of certain procedures), and (f) (promulgation of certain
Privacy Act rules). The proposed language notes these specific exceptions and exemptions.

The Commission certifies that the proposed rules will not, if adopted, have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. The basis for this certification is that the Privacy Act applies only to ``individuals,''
and individuals are not ``small entities'' within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

On August 30, 1994, SBA published a proposed rule to, among other things, (1) make several clarifications of the eligibility
requirements for admission to SBA's 8(a) program, the need for which has been identified by SBA through the practical
experience gained in operating the program and in defending the agency's actions in 8(a) eligibility appeals brought
before SBA's Office of Hearings and Appeals, (2) authorize participation by business concerns owned by Community
Development Corporations in the 8(a) program in accord with 42 U.S.C. 9815, and (3) make several changes to the 8(a)
contractual assistance requirements, including eliminating 8(a) support levels and the concepts of local buy and
national buy 8(a) requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The rule required that comments concerning its proposed provisions be submitted to SBA for review on or before November
28, 1994. SBA has received a number of comments stating that the 30-day comment period was insufficient to properly
address all of the proposal, and requesting that the comment period be extended. In light of the fact that the end of
the comment period coincided with the end of the Federal fiscal year, a very busy time for any business concerns contracting
with the Federal Government, SBA concurs that an extension of the comment period for this rule is appropriate. Thus,
SBA is extending the comment period for an additional 30 days from the date this notice is published in the

TVA proposes to amend its administrative cost recovery regulations by: Adding a provision requiring payment to TVA
of nonrefundable application processing fees to recover the costs of reviewing plans for the construction, operation,
or maintenance of dams, appurtenant works, or other obstructions affecting navigation, flood control, or public
lands or reservations in the Tennessee River system under Section 26a of the TVA Act; eliminating cost recovery exemptions
for agricultural licenses; firewood cutting permits; permits for the nonexclusive short-term use of TVA land; conveyance
or abandonment of TVA land or landrights to States, municipalities, and political subdivisions and agencies thereof;
and use of TVA land for utility line crossings; authorizing the responsible land manager to establish a standard charge
for each category of action rather than determining the actual administrative costs for each individual action;
increasing the range of fees for certain actions.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to help ensure that TVA land management and permitting activities are self-sustaining to the full extent
possible, the agency has determined that its administrative cost recovery regulations should be expanded to include
a broader range of use, disposal, and permitting activities. This determination is consistent with the objectives
of the current administration to increase government efficiency and to recover the costs of government services
from those who most directly benefit from the services.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Persons who wish to construct dams, appurtenant works, or other obstructions in or along the Tennessee River system
are required by Section 26a of the TVA Act of 1933, as amended, to obtain TVA's approval of plans for the proposed activity
prior to construction. TVA's administrative cost recovery regulations currently provide for recovery of costs
of actions taken by TVA to approve obstructions constructed without prior approval of plans. In order to help ensure
that the agency's entire Section 26a permitting program is self-sustaining to the full extent possible, TVA now proposes
to recover the costs of processing permits for proposed obstructions as well as after-the-fact permit processing.
The proposed amendment would allow the responsible land manager to set a standard permit processing fee, which would
be payable upon submission of a permit application and would be nonrefundable, regardless of whether or not the plans
are approved by TVA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is presently envisioned that the standard application processing fee for private noncommercial Section 26a permit
proposals would be $100, and the standard fee for commercial, industrial, and public Section 26a permit application
processing would be $500. These proposed fees are based in part upon a preliminary review of costs incurred by TVA in
processing these permits. In addition, TVA examined prevailing permit application fees by conducting a comparative
analysis survey of 40 other agencies and utilities. In adjusting application processing fees and in establishing
standard fees for other applicable activities, the responsible land manager will examine average costs incurred
in conducting the various activities.

TVA presently charges a $2 per applicant administrative fee for quota deer hunts and quota turkey hunts at Land Between
The Lakes. The purpose of this fee is to recover the cost of processing applications, conducting a computerized drawing,
and mailing notification of selection status. TVA proposes the application fee increase from $2 to a range of $5 to
$25. This range will allow TVA to recover increasing costs of conducting the drawings and hunts, and allow a range of
pricing for special hunts and drawings.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated May 24, 1994, (Administrative Record No. TX&hyph;576), Texas submitted a proposed amendment to its
program pursuant to SMCRA. Texas submitted the proposed amendment in response to required program amendments at
30 CFR 943.16(c) (1) and (2), (d), (f), (j)(1), (2), (3), and (4), (r), and (s) (59 FR 13200, March 21, 1994). The ownership
and control provisions of the Texas Coal Mining Regulations (TCMR) at 16 Texas Administrative Code (TAC) &sect;11.221
and of the Texas Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Act (TSCMRA) at Article 5920&hyph;11 of the Texas Revised Civil
Statutes Annotated that Texas proposed to amend were: TCMR &sect;778.116(m), identification of interests and compliance
information; TCMR &sect;786.215(e) and (f), review of permit applications; TCMR 786.216(i) through (n), criteria
for permit approval or denial; TCMR &sect;788.225(f), (g), and (h), commission review of outstanding permits; and
section 21(c) of TSCMRA, reporting notices of violations in permit applications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the June 30, 1994, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(59 FR 33705) and invited public comment on its adequacy (Administrative Record No. TX&hyph;576.07). The public
comment period ended August 1, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During its review of the amendment, OSM identified concerns relating to the provisions of the rules and statute at
TCMR &sect;778.116(m), identification of interests and compliance information; TCMR &sect;786.215(e)(1), review
of permit applications; TCMR &sect;788.225(g), commission review of outstanding permits; and section 21(c) of
TSCMRA, reporting notices of violations in permit applications. OSM notified Texas of the concerns by letter dated
August 11, 1994 (Administrative Record No. TX&hyph;576.12). In response to OSM's concerns for these provisions,
Texas, in a letter dated October 6, 1994, submitted a revised amendment (Administrative Record No. TX&hyph;576.13).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Texas proposes to additionally (1) revise TCMR &sect;778.116(m) and TCMR &sect;786.215(e)(1) so that each requires
an application to list violations incurred by the applicant under all SMCRA-approved State programs, including
the Texas program; (2) recodify the previously proposed second sentence of TCMR &sect;788.225(g) as (g)(1) and subparagraphs
(g) (1) through (4) as (g)(1) (i) through (iv); (3) revise TCMR &sect;788.225(g) to provide that if the Commission
elects to rescind an improvidently issued permit it must serve the permittee with a notice of the proposed rescission
and include the reasons under TCMR &sect;788.225(e) for the Commission's findings; (4) revise TCMR &sect;788.225(g)(g)(1)(iv)
to require the Commission to find that, in addition to severing any ownership or control link with the responsible
person, the permittee does not continue to be responsible for the violation, penalty, or fee; and (5) recodify previously
proposed TCMR &sect;788.225(h) and (i), respectively, as TCMR &sect;788.225(g)(2) and (h).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM is reopening the comment period on the proposed Texas program amendment to provide the public an opportunity to
reconsider the adequacy of the proposed amendment in light of the additional materials submitted. In accordance
with the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17(h), OSM is seeking comments on whether the proposed amendment satisfies the applicable
program approval criteria of 30 CFR 732.15. If the amendment is deemed adequate, it will become part of the Texas program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Written comments should be specific, pertain only to the issues proposed in this rulemaking, and include explanations

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory
Planning and Review).

2. Executive Order 12778
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA
(30 U.S.C. 1253 AND 12550) and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed
State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.

3. National Environmental Policy Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).

The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an
economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements
previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule
would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart
Federal regulations.

 EPA today proposes to designate an Ocean Dredged Material Disposal Site (ODMDS) in the Atlantic Ocean offshore Miami,
Florida, as an EPA-approved ocean dumping site for the disposal of suitable dredged material. This proposed action
is necessary to provide an acceptable ocean disposal site for consideration as an option for dredged material disposal
projects in the greater Miami, Florida vicinity. This proposed site designation is for an indefinite period of time,
but the site is subject to continuing monitoring to insure that unacceptable adverse environmental impacts do not
occur.

gives the Administrator of EPA the authority to designate sites where ocean disposal may be permitted. On October
1, 1986, the Administrator delegated the authority to designate ocean disposal sites to the Regional Administrator
of the Region in which the sites are located. This proposed designation of a site offshore Miami, Florida, which is
within Region IV, is being made pursuant to that authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA Ocean Dumping Regulations promulgated under MPRSA (40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter H, Section 228.4) state that
ocean dumping sites will be designated by promulgation in this Part 228. A list of ``Approved Interim and Final Ocean
Dumping Sites'' was published on January 11, 1977 (42 FR 2461 [January 11, 1977]). The list established the existing
Miami (``Miami Beach'') site as an interim site. The site is now listed in 40 CFR 228.12(a)(3). Interested persons
may participate in this proposed rulemaking by submitting written comments within 45 days of the date of this publication
to the address given above.

., requires that federal agencies prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) on proposals for legislation
and other major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. The object of NEPA
is to build into the Agency decision making process careful consideration of all environmental aspects of proposed
actions. While NEPA does not apply to EPA activities of this type, EPA has voluntarily committed to prepare EISs in
connection with ocean disposal site designations such as this (see 39 FR 16186 [May 7, 1974]). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA, in cooperation with the Jacksonville District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE), has prepared a Draft
EIS (DEIS) entitled ``Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Designation of An Ocean Dredged Material Disposal
Site Located Offshore Miami, Florida.'' On September 7, 1990, the Notice of Availability (NOA) of the DEIS for public
review and comment was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (55 FR 36891 [September 7, 1990]). Anyone desiring a copy of the EIS may obtain one from the addresses given above. The
public comment period on the draft EIS was to have closed on October 22, 1990. However, the closing date was changed
to December 7, 1990 due to a request by the State of Florida. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA received 12 comment letters on the Draft EIS. There were three main concerns expressed in those letters: (1) Placement
of beach quality sand in the ODMDS; (2) potential for movement of silt and clay sized particles out of the disposal area
and onto environmentally sensitive hardbottoms and coral reefs to the west during the occurrence of Gulf Stream frontal
eddies; and (3) disposal of contaminated sediments from locations such as the Miami River. Concerns raised by the
State of Florida, regarding use of suitable material for beach nourishment, will be addressed in the FEIS. EPA concurs
with the State of Florida regarding the use of suitable material for beach nourishment, in circumstances where this
use is practical. A real-time monitoring system will be instituted by the Army Corps of Engineers to identify the occurrence
of Gulf Stream frontal eddies. During the occurrence of such eddies, disposal at the ODMDS will discontinue. Details
of the monitoring plan and protocol will be included in the Site Management and Monitoring Plan as part of the FEIS.
Before any material can be placed within an ODMDS, it must be evaluated and shown to be acceptable for ocean disposal
in accordance with ocean dumping regulations (40 CFR 227.13). Certain portions of the sediments proposed to be dredged
from the Miami River have been found to be unacceptable for ocean disposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EIS will serve as a Biological Assessment for purposes of Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act coordination.
By itself, site designation of the Miami ODMDS will not adversely impact any threatened or endangered species under
the purview of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS). Use of the
ODMDS is not expected to adversely impact any threatened or endangered species. Pursuant to Section 7 of the Endangered
Species Act, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) has been asked by EPA to concur with EPA's conclusion that
this site designation will not affect the endangered species under their jurisdictions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has evaluated the proposed site designation for consistency with the State of Florida's (the State) approved
coastal management program. EPA has determined that the designation of the proposed site is consistent to the maximum
extent practicable with the State coastal management program, and has submitted this determination to the State
for review in accordance with EPA policy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a letter dated September 13, 1990, the Florida Department of State agreed that the proposed designation will have
no effect on any archaeological or historic sites or properties listed, or eligible for listing, in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
National Register of Historic Places
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in accordance with the National Preservation Act of 1966 (Public Law 89&hyph;6654), as amended. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed action discussed in the DEIS is the permanent designation for continuing use of the existing interim
ocean disposal site near Miami, Florida. The purpose of the proposed action is to provide an environmentally acceptable
option for the ocean disposal of dredged material. The need for the permanent designation of the Miami ODMDS is based
on a demonstrated COE need for ocean disposal of maintenance dredged material from the Federal navigation projects
in the greater Miami area. However, every disposal activity by the COE is evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine
the need for ocean disposal for that particular case. The need for ocean disposal for other projects, and the suitability
of the material for ocean disposal, will be determined on a case-by-case basis as part of the COE's process of issuing
permits for ocean disposal for private/federal actions and a public review process for their own actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the Miami ODMDS, the COE and EPA would evaluate all federal dredged material disposal projects pursuant to the
EPA criteria given in the Ocean Dumping Regulations (40 CFR Parts 220&hyph;229) and the COE regulations (33 CFR 209.120
and Parts 335&hyph;338). The COE also issues Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA) permits to
private applicants for the transport of dredged material intended for disposal after compliance with regulations
is determined. EPA has the right to disapprove any ocean disposal project if, in its judgment, all provisions of MPRSA
and the associated implementing regulations have not been met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The DEIS discusses the need for this site designation and examines ocean disposal site alternatives to the proposed
action. Non-ocean disposal options have been examined in the previously published Feasibility Report and EIS for
the Miami Harbor Channel Project. Alternatives to ocean disposal may include upland disposal within the port area,
disposal in Biscayne Bay, and beach disposal. Upland disposal in the intensively developed Port of Miami-Biscayne
Bay area has not been found feasible. The Port of Miami itself is built partially on fill in Biscayne Bay. Undeveloped
areas within cost-effective haul distances are environmentally valuable in their own right. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Almost all inshore waters of the Biscayne Bay area are part of the Biscayne Bay Aquatic Preserve. The waters of the southern
portion of Biscayne Bay, now included in the Aquatic Preserve, are to be incorporated, along with some offshore waters,
into the Biscayne National Park in the near future. The Florida Department of Environmental Regulation (DER) has
afforded the waters of these areas special protection as Outstanding Florida Waters. This effectively removes virtually
all of the Biscayne Bay area from consideration for disposal of dredged material. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dredged sand might be placed on beaches in the Miami Beach area. Suitable rock might be placed in nearshore waters.
These options are feasible only where a substantial quantity of the desired type of material is separable from silt
or other undesirable material. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The COE has been authorized to deepen Miami Harbor. For that project, environmental and economic analyses were performed
and an EIS was prepared. The COE examined and documented the feasibility of each of the above-described disposal options
and found none to be feasible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following ocean disposal alternatives were evaluated in the Draft EIS:

1. Alternative Sites on the Continental Shelf 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the Miami nearshore area, hardgrounds supporting coral and algal communities are concentrated on the continental
shelf. Disposal operations on the shelf could adversely impact this reef habitat. Because the shelf is narrow, about
3.3 nmi (6 km) off Government Cut, the transport of dredged materials for disposal beyond the shelf is both practical
and economically feasible. Therefore, alternative sites on the continental shelf are not desirable.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The preferred alternative considered in this document is the final designation of an ODMDS. This site is an area of
approximately one square nautical mile with the following corner coordinates: 25

3. Alternative Sites Beyond the Continental Shelf 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The western edge of the Gulf Stream meanders about one mile east of the candidate site. Dumping in the Gulf Stream was
considered, but the enormous task and expense of monitoring disposal under such conditions caused sufficient concern
to eliminate that option.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
4. No Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the ``no action'' alternative, the interim site would not receive final designation. The Water Resources Act
of 1992, Title V, Section 506(a) prohibits the continued use of ocean dump sites which have not been designated by EPA
as Section 102 dump sites after January 1, 1997. If EPA fails to designate the Miami ODMDS by that date, the continued
foreseeable need to have an appropriate site for disposal of suitable sediments from dredging projects in the Miami
area would place pressure on the Corps and EPA to approve on a project-by-project basis the use of temporary ocean dumping
locations pursuant to either Clean Water Act Section 404 or MPRSA Section 103. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The DEIS presents the information needed to evaluate the suitability of ocean disposal areas for final designation
use and is based on one of a series of disposal site environmental studies. The environmental studies and final designation
are being conducted in accordance with the requirements of MPRSA, the Ocean Dumping Regulations, and other applicable
federal environmental legislation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments received on the DEIS will be addressed in the FEIS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This Proposed Rule is being published between the DEIS and the Final EIS (FEIS). EPA will accept comments on the Proposed
Rule during the 45-day NEPA review period. Comments on the Proposed Rule will be addressed in the Final Rule, which
will be published following the completion of the 30-day NEPA review period of the FEIS. Responses in the Final Rule
may refer to earlier published responses, as appropriate.

C. Proposed Site Designation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed site is located east of Miami, Florida, the western boundary being 3.6 nautical miles (nmi) offshore.
The proposed ODMDS occupies an area of about 1 square nautical mile (nmi2), in the configuration of an approximate
1 nmi by 1 nmi square. Water depths within the area range from 427 to 785 feet. The coordinates of the Miami site proposed
for final designation are as follows:

D. Regulatory Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the Ocean Dumping Regulations, 40 CFR Part 228.5, five general criteria are used in the selection and approval
for continuing use of ocean disposal sites. Sites are selected so as to minimize interference with other marine activities,
to prevent any temporary perturbations associated with the disposal from causing impacts outside the disposal site,
and to permit effective monitoring to detect any adverse impacts at an early stage. Where feasible, locations off
the Continental Shelf and other sites that have been historically used are to be chosen. If, at any time, disposal operations
at a site cause unacceptable adverse impacts, further use of the site can be restricted or terminated by EPA. The proposed
site conforms to the five general criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to these general criteria in Section 228.5, Section 228.6 lists the 11 specific criteria used in evaluating
a proposed disposal site to assure that the general criteria are met. Application of these 11 criteria constitutes
an environmental assessment of the impact of disposal at the site. The characteristics of the proposed site are reviewed
below in terms of these 11 criteria (the EIS may be consulted for additional information). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The boundary and center coordinates of the proposed site are given above. The western boundary of the proposed site
is located about 3.6 nmi offshore of Miami, Florida. The site is an approximate 1 nmi by 1 nmi square configuration.
Water depth in the area ranges from 427 to 785 feet.

2. Location in Relation to Breeding, Spawning, Nursery, Feeding, or Passage Areas of Living Resources in Adult or
Juvenile Phases [40 CFR 228.6(a)(2)]
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many of the area's species spend their adult lives in the offshore region, but are estuary-dependent because their
juvenile stages use a low salinity estuarine nursery region. Specific migration routes are not known in the Miami
area. The site is not known to include any major breeding or spawning area, except for sea turtles which use the entire
beach area of eastern Florida as nesting habitat. Due to the motility of finfish, it is unlikely that disposal activities
will have any significant impact on any of the species found in the area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Location in Relation to Beaches and Other Amenity Areas [40 CFR 228.6(a)(3)]
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The candidate site is located at least 3.6 nautical miles from the coast. Shore-related amenities include Virginia
Key, the Biscayne Bay Aquatic Preserve, Biscayne National Park, and the Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Recreational
Area. Currents in the vicinity trend alongshore in a general north-south orientation. It is therefore unlikely that
detectable quantities of dredged material will be transported onto beaches. Considering the distance that the proposed
disposal site is offshore of beach areas, dredged material disposal at the site is not expected to have an effect on
the recreational uses of these beaches. Modelling performed by the COE indicates that disposed material will not
impact these areas.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Types and Quantities of Wastes Proposed To Be Disposed of, and Proposed Methods of Release, Including Methods of
Packing the Waste, If Any [40 CFR 228(a)(4)]
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is anticipated that the candidate site will be used primarily for disposal of maintenance material from the Port
of Miami. Maintenance dredging has only occurred four times since 1957. Another foreseen use of the site would be the
Miami Harbor Deepening Project. Estimated volume for this project is expected to be 6 million cubic yards. For each
future dredging project, each disposal plan must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to ensure that ocean disposal
is the best alternative and that the material meets the Ocean Dumping Criteria in 40 CFR Part 227. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Feasibility of Surveillance and Monitoring [40 CFR 228.6(a)(5)]
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Due to the proximity of the site to shore, surveillance will not be difficult. Survey vessels, dredges or aircraft
overflights are feasible surveillance methods. However, the depths at this site make conventional ODMDS monitoring
techniques difficult to utilize. The Site Management and Monitoring Plan (SMMP) for the Miami ODMDS has been developed
and was included as an appendix in the DEIS. This SMMP establishes a sequence of monitoring surveys to be undertaken
to determine any impacts resulting from disposal activities. The SMMP may be modified for cause by the responsible
agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Dispersal, Horizontal Transport and Vertical Mixing Characteristics of the Area Including Prevailing Current
Direction and Velocity, If Any [40 CFR 228.6(a)(6)]
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Prevailing currents parallel the coast and are generally oriented along a north-south axis. Northerly flow predominates.
Mean surface currents range from 62 to 95 cm/sec with maximum velocities of about 150 cm/sec. Current speeds are lower
and current reversals more common in near-bottom waters. Mean velocities of 3.5 cm/sec and maximum velocities of
27 cm/sec have been reported for near-bottom waters in the area. A pycnocline occurs in site waters throughout the
year at reported depths ranging from about 60 feet in the summer to 325 feet in the winter. A dredged material dispersion
study conducted by the COE for both the short- and long-term fate of material disposed at the proposed site indicates
little possibility of disposed material affecting near-shore reefs. Measures as discussed in the Management and
Monitoring Plan will be instituted during disposal operations to minimize the possibility of material being transported
to the near-shore reefs.

7. Existence and Effects of Current and Previous Discharges and Dumping in the Area (Including Cumulative Effects)
[40 CFR 228.6(a)(7)]
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed ODMDS was used for the first time in April 1990. Only 225,000 cubic yards of maintenance material was disposed
in the proposed ODMDS. In conjunction with this use of the site, the Corps of Engineers in cooperation with the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) monitored the physical processes and the dispersive characteristics
of the dredged material plume. Monitoring results indicated that the material discharged, except for a low concentration
residual remaining within the water column, reached bottom within the designated site boundaries. During the monitoring,
the resulting plumes were observed to be transported in a north to northeast direction. The full monitoring report
will be included as part of the Final EIS. Due to the limited quantity of material disposed at the site, an effects study
has not been initiated. Effects monitoring is discussed in the Site Management and Monitoring Plan as part of the EIS.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No other discharges or dumping occurs in the site. The Miami-Dade Central publicly owned treatment plant outfall
discharges approximately 1.2 miles west of the site. The effects from this discharge are local and predominantly
in a north-south direction due to prevailing currents and should not have any effect within the site.

8. Interference With Shipping, Fishing, Recreation, Mineral Extraction, Desalination, Fish and Shellfish Culture,
Areas of Special Scientific Importance and Other Legitimate Uses of the Ocean [40 CFR 228.6(a)(8)]
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While shipping is heavy at the Port of Miami, the infrequent use of this site should not significantly disrupt either
commercial shipping or recreational boating. Commercial and recreational fishing activities are concentrated
in inshore and nearshore waters. No mineral extraction, desalination, or mariculture activities occur in the immediate
area. Scientific resources present throughout this area are not geographically limited to the proposed Miami ODMDS
or nearby waters.

9. The Existing Water Quality and Ecology of the Site as Determined By Available Data or By Trend Assessment or Baseline
Surveys [40 CFR 228.6(a)(9)]
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Water quality at the proposed ODMDS is variable and is influenced by discharges from inshore systems, frequent oceanic
intrusions, and periodic upwelling. The proposed disposal site lies on the continental slope in an area traversed
by the western edge of the Florida Current. The location of the western edge of the current determines to a large extent
whether waters at the site are predominantly coastal or oceanic. Frequent intrusions or eddies of the Florida Current
transport oceanic waters over the continental shelf in the proposed ODMDS vicinity. Periodic upwelling/downwelling
events associated with wind stress also influence waters in the area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No critical habitat or unique ecological communities have been identified at the candidate site. Buffer zone protection
has been applied to any existing fish havens, artificial reef communities, turtle nesting areas, and onshore amenities
in the general region of the site.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The disposal of dredged materials should not attract or promote the development of nuisance species. No nuisance
species have been reported to occur at previously utilized disposal sites in the vicinity.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No known natural or cultural features of historical importance occur at or in close proximity to the site. No such features
were noted in a video survey of the proposed disposal area.

E. Site Management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Site management of the Miami ODMDS is the responsibility of EPA as well as the COE. The COE issues permits to private
applicants for ocean disposal; however, EPA/Region IV assumes overall responsibility for site management. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Site Management and Monitoring Plan (SMMP) for the proposed Miami ODMDS was developed as a part of the process of
completing the EIS. This plan provides procedures for both site management and for the monitoring of effects of disposal
activities. This SMMP is intended to be flexible and may be modified by the responsible agency for cause.

F. Proposed Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EIS concludes that the proposed site may appropriately be designated for use. The proposed site is compatible
with the 11 specific and 5 general criteria used for site evaluation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The designation of the Miami site as an EPA-approved ODMDS is being published as Proposed Rulemaking. Overall management
of this site is the responsibility of the Regional Administrator of EPA/Region IV. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should be emphasized that, if an ODMDS is designated, such a site designation does not constitute EPA's approval
of actual disposal of material at sea. Before ocean disposal of dredged material at the site may commence, the COE must
evaluate a permit application according to EPA's Ocean Dumping Criteria. EPA has the right to disapprove the actual
disposal if it determines that environmental concerns under MPRSA have not been met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Miami ODMDS is not restricted to disposal use by federal projects; private applicants may also dispose suitable
dredged material at the ODMDS once relevant regulations have been satisfied. This site is restricted, however, to
suitable dredged material from the greater Miami, Florida vicinity.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
G. Regulatory Assessments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, EPA is required to perform a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis for all rules
that may have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. EPA has determined that this proposed
action will not have a significant impact on small entities since the designation will only have the effect of providing
a disposal option for dredged material. Consequently, this Rule does not necessitate preparation of a Regulatory
Flexibility Analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Executive Order 12866, EPA must judge whether a regulation is ``significant'' and therefore subject to the
requirement of a Regulatory Impact Analysis. This action will not result in an annual effect on the economy of $100
million or more or cause any of the other effects which would result in its being classified by the Executive Order as
a ``significant'' rule. Consequently, this Rule does not necessitate preparation of a Regulatory Impact Analysis.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The State of Utah has applied for final approval of its underground storage tank program under Subtitle I of the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reviewed the Utah application
and has made the tentative decision that Utah's underground storage tank (UST) program satisfies all of the requirements
necessary to qualify for final approval. Notably, the State of Utah's statute authorizes the issuance of regulations
that are broader in scope than the Federal regulations. EPA intends to grant final approval to the State to operate
its program in lieu of the Federal program. The State of Utah's application for final approval is available for public
review and comment.

Section 9004 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) enables EPA to approve state underground storage
tank programs to operate in the State in lieu of the Federal underground storage tank (UST) program. Program approval
is granted by EPA if the Agency finds that the State program: (1) is ``no less stringent'' than the Federal program in
all seven elements, and includes notification requirements of section 9004(a)(8), 42 U.S.C. 6991c(a)(8); and (2)
provides for adequate enforcement of compliance with UST standards (Section 9004(a), 42 U.S.C. 6991c(a)).

B. State of Utah 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In February 1986, the State of Utah established authority through the Utah Solid and Hazardous Waste Act to implement
an underground storage tank program, the State further developed its authority in the UST Act in February 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1989. The State adopted the federal rules and developed some additional rules in February 1989. The State submitted
a draft application for state program approval in September 1992. EPA reviewed and commented on the draft application
and requested additional information to be included in the final application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 20, 1993, Utah submitted an official application for final approval. Prior to its submission, Utah provided
an opportunity for public notice and comment in the development of its underground storage tank program as required
under &sect;281.50(b). EPA has reviewed Utah's application, and has tentatively determined that the State's program
meets all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final approval. Consequently, EPA intends to grant final approval
to Utah to operate its program in lieu of the Federal program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This tentative determination to approve the Utah UST program applies to all activities in Utah outside of Indian Country,
as defined in 18 U.S.C. 1151. The Environmental Protection Agency retains all underground storage tank authority
under RCRA which applies to Indian Country in Utah.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before EPA would be able to approve the State of Utah UST program for any portion of ``Indian Country,'' the State would
have to provide an appropriate analysis of the State's jurisdiction to enforce in these areas. In order for a state
to satisfy this requirement, it must demonstrate to the EPA's satisfaction that it has authority pursuant to applicable
principles of Federal Indian Law to enforce its laws against existing and potential pollution sources within any
geographical area for which it seeks program approval. EPA is not satisfied that Utah has, at this time, made the requisite
showing of its authority with respect to such lands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In withholding program approval for these areas, EPA is not making a determination that the State either has adequate
jurisdiction or lacks such jurisdiction. Should the State of Utah choose to submit analysis with regard to its jurisdiction
over all or part of ``Indian Country'' in the State, it may do so without prejudice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's future evaluation of whether to approve the Utah program for ``Indian Country,'' to include Indian reservation
lands, will be governed by EPA's judgment as to whether the State has demonstrated adequate authority to justify such
approval, based upon its understanding of the relevant principles of Federal Indian law and sound administrative
practice. The State may wish to consider EPA's discussion of the related issue of tribal jurisdiction found in the
preamble to the Indian Water Quality Standards Regulation (see 56 FR 64876, December 12, 1991). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 9004 of RCRA 42 U.S.C. 6991c and 40 CFR 281.50(e), the Agency will accept written comments
on EPA's tentative determination until November 28, 1994. Copies of Utah's application are available for inspection
and copying at the locations indicated in the ``Addresses'' section of this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA will consider all public comments on its tentative determination received during the public comment period.
Issues raised by those comments may be the basis for a decision to deny final approval to Utah. EPA expects to make a final
decision on whether or not to approve Utah's program by January 25, 1995 and will give notice of it in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The notice will include a summary of the reasons for the final determination and a response to all major comments.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order 12866.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this approval will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The approval effectively suspends the applicability of certain
Federal regulations in favor of Utah's program, thereby eliminating duplicative requirements for owners and operators
of underground storage tanks in the State. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This rule, therefore,
does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On April 30, 1994, the Marine Mammal Protection Act (Act) was amended to allow the issuance of permits to import sport-hunted
trophies of polar bears (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Ursus maritimus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) (excluding internal organs) legally taken by the applicant while hunting in Canada, provided certain findings
have been made by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service). These permits may also authorize the importation of
polar bears taken, but not imported, prior to enactment of the Amendments, provided certain conditions are met. The
Service has received a number of inquiries concerning the importation of polar bear trophies. This notice provides
information on the steps the Service is taking to implement this new provision of the Act and the anticipated timeframes.
The Service is working concurrently on developing permit regulations and gathering data to make the legal and scientific
findings required under section 104(c)(5)(A) of the Act. Applications for the import of sport-hunted polar bear
trophies will not be accepted until the completion of the permit rulemaking process early in 1995. The Service will
be able to act on applications once it has resolved several outstanding questions and is able to make the required scientific
findings, in consultation with the Marine Mammal Commission (MMC), and after notice and opportunity for public comment.
In the meantime, a list of interested parties has been established to receive all relevant information as the process
proceeds.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Prior to enactment of amendments to the Act in 1994, those seeking authority to import polar bear trophies from Canada
were required to obtain a waiver of the Act's moratorium on taking and importing marine mammals. The 1994 Amendments
included a streamlined procedure for authorizing such imports by permit. Section 104(c)(5) of the Act sets out a permitting
process, as well as the specific findings that must be made before permits can be issued to import these trophies into
the United States. The Service is developing proposed regulations that will outline the permit application requirements,
procedures, issuance criteria, and fee. The law requires the Service to establish and charge a reasonable fee for
issuing polar bear trophy import permits. As specified in the Amendments, all fees would be used for polar bear conservation
programs being conducted in Alaska and Russia. The Service anticipates publishing a proposed rule promptly so, after
a review of all available data and public comments, a decision can be published as early as possible in calendar year
1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service is unable to accept applications for the import of sport-hunted polar bear trophies until the permit rulemaking
process is complete in early 1995. Once the Service has received comments on the application requirements under the
proposed rule, an application form will be developed and submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for approval
under the Paperwork Reduction Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the same time that the permit rulemaking process is occurring, the Service is working with the Canadian wildlife
authorities to obtain information necessary to make the findings required by section 104(c)(5)(A) of the Act. Prior
to issuing a permit, the Service must find that (1) the applicant has provided the necessary documentation to show
that the polar bear was legally harvested in Canada by the applicant; (2) Canada has a monitored and enforced sport-hunting
program consistent with the purposes of the 1971 International Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears; (3)
Canada's sport-hunting program is based on scientifically sound quotas ensuring the maintenance of the affected
population stock at a sustainable level; (4) the export and subsequent import are consistent with the provisions
of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and other international agreements and conventions;
and (5) the export and subsequent import are not likely to contribute to illegal trade in bear parts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service is to make these findings after notice and opportunity for public comment and in consultation with the
MMC, an independent Federal agency with statutory authority to make recommendations pursuant to Title II of the Act.
Several questions have come to the attention of the Service. A contract report prepared for the MMC in 1993 has questioned
whether Canada's sport-hunting program is fully consistent with Article III of the Agreement. In addition, the Amendments
require the Service to make the determination of sustainability of hunting quotas at the population level, but Canada
manages polar bears at the subpopulation level. The Service is currently pursuing the resolution of these and related
questions concerning its ability to make the required findings. Once these questions have been resolved and the Service
is able to make the findings outlined above, it will be able to act on applications. The Service seeks information regarding
each of these five findings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While conducting these activities, the Service will need to evaluate its actions under the National Environmental
Policy Act (NEPA), as appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By April 30, 1996, the Service is to undertake a scientific review of the impact of permits issued on the Canadian polar
bear population stocks. An opportunity for public comment will be part of this review, with the responses included
in the final report. Permit issuance can continue after September 30, 1996, only if the Service determines, based
on scientific review, that the issuance of permits is not having a significant adverse impact on the polar bear populations
stocks in Canada.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing to amend its current adverse experience reporting regulations
for human drug products and for licensed biological products to provide consistency with the elements of FDA Form
3500A and require the use of this new reporting form; revise certain definitions and reporting periods and formats
as recommended by the International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of
Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) and the World Health Organization's Council for International Organizations
of Medical Sciences (CIOMS); require applicants or manufacturers, packers, and distributors to develop written
procedures for monitoring and reporting adverse experiences; state that reports of adverse experiences that are
forwarded by FDA to the applicant or manufacturer, packer, and distributor should not be resubmitted to the agency;
and make other revisions to the regulations to provide uniformity in adverse experience reporting for human drug
products and licensed biological products. These changes would simplify and facilitate the reporting of adverse
experiences and would enhance agencywide consistency in the collection of postmarketing adverse experience data.
In addition, FDA is proposing to amend the requirements for clinical study design and conduct and the sponsor reporting
requirements in the investigational new drug application (IND) regulations. These amendments are intended to provide
more complete and accurate information that would enable sponsors, investigators, and FDA to determine serious
toxicities of investigational drugs more expeditiously during clinical studies.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of June 3, 1993 (58 FR 31596), FDA announced the availability of a new form for reporting adverse events and product
problems with medications, devices, and other FDA-regulated medical products. This form is available in two versions.
One version of the form (FDA Form 3500) is to be used by health professionals for voluntary reporting; the other version
of the form (FDA Form 3500A) is to be used by applicants or manufacturers (including licensed manufacturers of licensed
biological products), and other persons subject to mandatory reporting requirements under FDA regulations. Under
existing regulations, drug manufacturers, packers, and distributors and applicants for new drug products and generic
drug products must report adverse events under &sect;&sect;310.305 and 314.80 (21 CFR 310.305 and 314.80). Elsewhere
in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, FDA is issuing a final rule establishing new &sect;600.80. This section makes licensed manufacturers of biological
products subject to certain reporting requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new form is part of FDA's Medical Products Reporting Program (MedWatch) and is designed to encourage and facilitate
the reporting of adverse events and product problems for most FDA-regulated human medical products by the entire
health care community, including manufacturers, distributors, user facilities, and health professionals. FDA
issued the new form to simplify and consolidate the reporting of suspected adverse events and product problems with
human drug products, biologics, and medical devices, as well as the reporting of adverse events with other FDA-regulated
medical products, such as dietary supplements. FDA has found that, under the current system, there is some confusion
about what to report to the agency and that the existing assortment of reporting forms and systems can interfere with
the efficient reporting of suspected problems. FDA has attempted to clarify and simplify adverse event reporting
with the new form by eliminating redundant or nonessential elements and by clarifying those areas that have caused
confusion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA Form 3500A replaces current Form FDA&hyph;1639, as well as most other adverse event and product problem reporting
forms currently required by the agency. Adverse events associated with vaccines will continue to be reported through
the FDA and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). FDA is proposing
to amend the adverse experience reporting requirements for human drug products and for licensed biological products
to be consistent with the elements of FDA Form 3500A.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In developing FDA Forms 3500 and 3500A, the agency considered several recommendations from ICH and CIOMS. These organizations
were formed to facilitate international consideration of issues, particularly safety issues, concerning the use
of both foreign and domestic data in the development and use of drugs and biological products. ICH has worked to promote
the harmonization of technical requirements for the registration of pharmaceutical products among three regions:
The European Union, Japan, and the United States. ICH has prepared a draft guideline specific to parts of this issue
entitled: ``Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting.'' In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of July 9, 1993 (58 FR 37408), FDA published this draft guideline for public comment. Several CIOMS working groups
have worked to coordinate and standardize the international reporting of postmarketing adverse drug reactions
by pharmaceutical manufacturers to regulatory authorities. CIOMS Working Group II has proposed an international
system of standardized time intervals, formats, and inclusion criteria in order to lessen confusion and reduce preparation
time among manufacturers and to enable them to report postmarketing adverse experiences more rapidly, efficiently,
and effectively (Refs. 1 and 2). FDA believes that many changes recommended by CIOMS and ICH would result in more effective
reporting of serious adverse experiences to regulatory authorities worldwide. FDA is proposing to amend the adverse
experience reporting requirements for human drug products and licensed biological products in part to be consistent
with certain standardized definitions, procedures, and formats proposed by these international organizations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is also proposing to amend the requirements for clinical study design and conduct and the sponsor reporting requirements
in the IND regulations. These amendments are intended to provide more complete and accurate information that would
enable sponsors, investigators, and FDA to determine serious toxicities of investigational drugs more expeditiously
during clinical studies. A clinical study of fialuridine (FIAU) resulted in several instances of severe liver and
pancreatic injury and five deaths, beginning in June 1993. This incident prompted FDA to establish a task force to
see whether the data available before the study gave any suggestion of the serious toxicity that emerged, and whether
some differences in process or behavior by investigators and sponsors might have made it possible or more likely for
them to have anticipated the toxicity in the 1993 study. The proposed IND amendments contained in this document are
largely the result of recommendations by this task force.

II. Description of the Proposed Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Replacement of Form FDA&hyph;1639 and How to Obtain Copies of FDA Form 3500A
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA's existing regulations at 21 CFR 20.112, 310.305, and 314.80 refer to Form FDA&hyph;1639. The agency is proposing
to amend these regulations to replace references to Form FDA&hyph;1639 with new FDA Form 3500A. This change is necessary
because new FDA Form 3500A replaces Form FDA&hyph;1639 (58 FR 31596).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The existing regulations at &sect;&sect;310.305(d)(4) and 314.80(f)(4)) also provide an address where a person
may obtain copies of Form FDA&hyph;1639. FDA is proposing to amend these regulations to state where a person can obtain
copies of FDA Form 3500A. Ten or fewer copies of FDA Form 3500A and a copy of the instructions for completing the form
can be obtained from the Division of Epidemiology and Surveillance (HFD&hyph;730), Center for Drug Evaluation and
Research, Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857. Large numbers of copies (greater
than 10 copies) may be obtained by writing to the Consolidated Forms and Publications Distribution Center, Washington
Commerce Center, 3222 Hubbard Rd., Landover, MD 20785.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Definitions of ``Data Lock-Point'' and ``International Birth Date'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is proposing to amend &sect;&sect;314.80(a) and 600.80(a) to define the terms ``data lock-point'' and ``international
birth date.'' The ``data lock-point'' is the end of the reporting period (cutoff date) for data to be incorporated
into a specific postmarketing adverse experience periodic report. On this date, the data available to the reporter
are held for review and evaluation by the applicant or licensed manufacturer prior to being submitted to FDA. The international
birth date is the date that the first regulatory authority in the world approved the human drug or biological product
for marketing. As explained further in section II.E. of this document, each 6-month anniversary of the international
birth date is the data lock-point for data to be incorporated into a specific postmarketing adverse experience periodic
report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would define these terms because they describe the standardized international reporting period
developed by CIOMS for submitting postmarketing adverse experience reports. CIOMS developed this standardized
reporting period to lessen confusion and to enable applicants and licensed manufacturers to prepare and submit similar
reports of adverse experiences to regulatory authorities. It would also reduce preparation time among applicants
and licensed manufacturers because it eliminates varying due dates presently required for submitting postmarketing
adverse experience reports to regulatory authorities worldwide. FDA believes the CIOMS reporting schedule, which
decreases reporting rates currently required by FDA for drug and licensed biological products for the first 3 years
of marketing from every 3 months to every 6 months and increases it thereafter from every 12 months to every 6 months,
permits adequate time for reporters to make periodic submissions to regulatory authorities. In addition, the agency
believes that the proposed reporting frequency is sufficient to notify FDA of potential postmarketing safety problems
that do not require expedited reporting.

C. Definition of ``Serious''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA's existing adverse experience reporting regulations (21 CFR 310.305(b)(4), 312.32(a), 314.80(a), and 600.80(a))
define a serious adverse experience as one that is ``fatal or life-threatening, is permanently disabling, requires
inpatient hospitalization, or is a congenital anomaly, cancer, or overdose.'' Consistent with new FDA Form 3500A
and with recommendations by the ICH and CIOMS, the proposed rule would amend this definition to read as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Serious
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 means an adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that is fatal or life-threatening, results in persistent or
significant disability/incapacity, requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization, necessitates medical or
surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure,
or is a congenital anomaly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency is proposing to remove ``cancer'' from the definition because cancer would most often be reported under
the other broader elements in the definition. For example, cancer may be reported as life-threatening or requiring
inpatient hospitalization. Other diseases or conditions that may be life-threatening or require hospitalization,
such as heart disease or myocardial infarction, have not been identified as separate elements in previous definitions,
and the agency believes it is not necessary to single out cancer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment would also remove ``overdose'' from the definition of serious. Reports of overdoses that
had serious outcomes would still be reported under the other broader elements in the definition. Reports of overdoses
that did not lead to outcomes defined as serious would provide the agency with less critical safety information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By adding the phrase ``occurring at any dose'' after ``adverse drug experience'' in the definition, the agency will
ensure that a serious adverse experience at any dose, whether it is the labeled dose or a different dose, including
an overdose or an underdose, should be reported. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is also proposing to clarify the phrase ``is permanently disabling'' by substituting ``results in persistent
or significant disability/incapacity.'' This change is intended to clarify that a disability need not be permanent
to be considered a serious adverse experience. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendments would also modify the phrase ``requires inpatient hospitalization'' to read ``requires
or prolongs inpatient hospitalization.'' This change is intended to cover those situations where a serious adverse
experience occurs while the patient is already hospitalized, and the adverse experience prolongs the patient's
hospital stay. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is also proposing to add the phrase ``necessitates medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment
of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure.'' The agency believes such events should be considered
serious adverse experiences and should be reported. This change is also consistent with ICH's proposed definition
of a serious adverse event. FDA notes that a serious adverse experience would not include the discontinuation of therapy,
changes in dosage, or routine treatment with a prescription medication.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Definitions of ``Disability'' and ``Life-Threatening''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would amend &sect;&sect;310.305(b), 314.80(a), and 600.80(a) to define the terms ``disability''
and ``life-threatening.'' These terms further explain what constitutes a serious adverse experience. ``Disability''
means a substantial disruption of one's ability to carry out normal life functions. ``Life-threatening'' means
that the patient was, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the adverse experience as
it occurred. It does not include an adverse experience that, had it occurred in a more serious form, might have caused
death. For example, product-induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not be considered
life-threatening even though hepatitis of a more severe nature can be fatal. Similarly, an allergic reaction resulting
in angioedema of the face would not be life-threatening, even though angioedema of the larynx, allergic bronchospasm,
or anaphylaxis can be fatal. FDA believes these definitions will help enable reporters to determine when a serious
adverse experience occurs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Periodic Adverse Experience Reports
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current regulations (&sect;&sect;314.80(c)(2)(i) and 600.80(c)(2)(i)) require the submission of periodic postmarketing
reports at quarterly intervals for 3 years from the date of approval of the application, and then annually. Quarterly
reports must be submitted within 30 days of the close of the quarter (the first quarter beginning on the date of U.S.
approval of the application); each annual report must be submitted within 60 days of the date of U.S. approval of the
application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to revise this schedule by requiring the submission of periodic postmarketing adverse reaction
reports every 6 months. The first 6-month anniversary of the international birth date after the application is approved
in the United States is the data lock-point for the first periodic reporting term. Each subsequent 6-month anniversary
of the international birth date is the data lock-point for subsequent periodic reporting terms for that particular
product. The proposed rule would require periodic reports to be submitted to FDA within 45 days after the data lock-point.
For example, a product approved by FDA, or licensed, if a biological product, on June 15, with an international birth
date of April 1, would have its first data lock-point on October 1, which is less than 6 months after FDA approval, but
which is the 6-month anniversary of the international birth date. Therefore, the first periodic report would be for
the period of June 15 to October 1 and would be due at FDA by November 14. The second periodic report would cover October
2 to April 1 and would be due to the agency no later than May 15. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would create the same reporting schedule based on the international birth date and data lock-point
for licensed biological product distribution reports under &sect;600.80(c)(3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This new reporting schedule is consistent with the standardized international reporting period proposed by the
CIOMS II Working Group. This working group has recommended that all international regulatory authorities accept
the same reporting schedule in order to lessen confusion and reduce preparation time by manufacturers, rather than
the current system of varying due dates. FDA believes the CIOMS reporting schedule, which decreases reporting rates
currently required by FDA for drug and licensed biological products for the first 3 years of marketing from every 3
months to every 6 months and increases reporting rates thereafter from every 12 months to every 6 months, permits adequate
time for reporters to make nonexpedited submissions to regulatory authorities. In addition, FDA believes that the
proposed reporting frequency is sufficient to alert the agency to potential postmarketing safety problems that
are not within the categories requiring 15-day ``Alert reports.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants and licensed manufacturers who wish to submit periodic postmarketing adverse experience reports at
different intervals could, under proposed &sect;&sect;314.80(c)(2)(i) and 600.80(c)(2)(i), submit a request
for a waiver under 21 CFR 314.90 or 600.90 to alter the reporting intervals for these periodic reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;&sect;314.80(c)(2)(i) and 600.80(c)(2)(i) would also amend the reporting requirements for periodic
postmarketing adverse experience reports to state that, in cases where the applicant or licensed manufacturer has
received no reports of adverse experiences during a reporting period, the applicant or licensed manufacturer should
submit a copy of the current approved labeling and a letter to the agency in place of a periodic postmarketing adverse
experience report. The letter should identify the product, the application number, and the reporting period, and
state that no adverse experience reports were received during that reporting period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 314.80(c)(2)(ii) and 600.80(c)(2)(ii) set forth the contents currently required for a periodic report:
(1) A narrative summary and analysis of the information in the report and an analysis of the 15-day postmarketing Alert
reports submitted during the reporting interval; (2) a report describing each adverse experience not previously
reported; and (3) a history of actions taken since the last periodic report. FDA is proposing to amend these regulations
to provide a more extensive list of contents for a periodic postmarketing adverse experience report, as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Title Page, Table of Contents, and Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section would provide a summary of the periodic report with page references to detailed data and information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Applicant's Core Safety Data Sheet
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The applicant's core safety data sheet would be a document prepared by the applicant that contains all relevant safety
information, including adverse drug experiences, which the applicant believes should be listed for the drug in all
countries where the drug is marketed. It may be used by the applicant as the reference document by which an adverse drug
experience is judged to be expected or unexpected for purposes of this postmarketing periodic report. For all other
determinations of whether an adverse drug experience is expected or unexpected, the definition in &sect;&sect;314.80(a)
or 600.80(a) would apply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA recognizes that the postmarketing periodic report may be submitted by the applicant to multiple countries and
the product may have different approved labels in the different countries. The use of the applicant's core safety
data sheet as the reference document for determining whether an adverse drug experience is expected or not may result
in some overreporting of unexpected adverse events that actually are expected by the U.S. approved product label.
This is because the approved label for the United States may have more safety information included in it than the manufacturer's
core safety data sheet. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An applicant may also use the approved U.S. label as the reference by which expected and unexpected adverse drug experiences
are determined for the postmarketing periodic report. If an applicant chooses to use the approved U.S. label for this
purpose, it must clearly be stated in this section of the report. In all instances, if an adverse event is not listed
in the U.S. label, but is in the manufacturer's core safety data sheet, this shall be clearly noted in the ``Overall
safety evaluation'' (see section II.E.8. of this document).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This section would also highlight clearly any changes and the reasons for the changes in the applicant's core safety
data sheet since the previous postmarketing periodic report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. The Product's Marketing Status
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section would contain, in tabular form, a chronological history of the marketing status of the product worldwide
(all regulatory and marketing decisions affecting the product) from the date it was first approved through its current
status. Approvals or applications voluntarily withdrawn for safety reasons would have to be included. The product
would be listed by chemical (U.S. Adopted Names, international nonproprietary names, or proper name in accordance
with ``Chemical Abstracts Nomenclature Standards'') and brand name(s). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Regulatory Actions for Safety Reasons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section would identify in narrative form the reasons for significant regulatory authority or manufacturer-initiated
actions taken anywhere in the world, or to be taken imminently, for safety reasons during the reporting period. This
would include, for example, application withdrawal or license suspension or failure to renew, distribution restrictions,
clinical trial suspension, labeling changes due to significant safety concerns, dosage modifications, or pharmaceutical
changes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Patient Exposure
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section would include the product's domestic and foreign marketing distribution data during the reporting
period. This information would be used to calculate the extent of patient exposure. The method used by the manufacturer
to estimate patient exposure would always be described and would include the total number of dosage units of each dosage
form and strength or potency (e.g., 100,000/5-milligram tablets, 50,000/10-milliliter vials).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Individual Case Histories
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These reports would be presented in line listing format with the following 10 columns: country, source, age, gender,
dose, duration of treatment (prior to event), time to onset, description of reaction (as reported), outcome (e.g.,
fatal, resolved), other comments (e.g., manufacturer's report number). This format is consistent with that suggested
by CIOMS. In addition, a tabular summary of the number of adverse events by body system may be included. The individual
case reports would consist of adverse drug experiences that are: (a) Serious, unexpected reports from published
or unpublished clinical studies where it has been concluded that there is a reasonable possibility that the drug or
licensed biological product caused the adverse experience; (b) serious, expected or unexpected spontaneous adverse
drug experience reports and nonserious, unexpected spontaneous adverse experience reports received directly
by the applicant or licensed manufacturer from the initial reporter or received by the applicant or licensed manufacturer
from a drug regulatory authority, both U.S. or foreign; and (c) serious, expected or unexpected individual published
case histories and nonserious, unexpected individual published case histories. This section would end with an analysis
by the reporter, in narrative form, of the cases submitted. The applicant or licensed manufacturer would also attach
to the end of the postmarketing periodic report a completed FDA Form 3500A for all U.S. spontaneous reports of adverse
experiences except those not to be included in the periodic report as specified in proposed &sect;&sect;314.80(c)(1)(i)
and (c)(1)(ii) and 600.80(c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii), or those sent by FDA to the applicant or licensed manufacturer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Safety Studies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section would analyze and discuss fully and critically all toxicological, clinical, and epidemiological studies
containing important safety information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
8. Overall Safety Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section would provide critical analysis of the safety information provided in the periodic report as it pertains
to serious unexpected reactions, increased frequencies of known toxicity, reactions listed in the manufacturer's
core safety data sheet but not included in the U.S. label, drug or licensed biological product interactions, overdose,
drug or licensed biological product abuse, experiences during pregnancy or lactation, chronic treatment, pediatric
or geriatric treatment, and new safety issues. For each of these areas, any absence of significant information would
be reported. The evaluation would indicate whether the safety profile of the product remains consistent with cumulative
experience to date and with the previous manufacturer's core safety data sheet. The evaluation would specify any
action recommended and the reasons for such recommendations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
9. Other Information
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section would consist of important information received after the data lock-point. It may include significant
new cases or followup data that affect the interpretation or evaluation of existing reports.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
10. FDA Form 3500A
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section would consist of a completed FDA Form 3500A for each spontaneous U.S. adverse drug experience not reported
under paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii) in &sect;&sect;314.80 and 600.80. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
11. Location of Adverse Experience Records
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section would identify the current address(es), including street, city, State, and zip code, where all adverse
experience reports and records are maintained.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This revised list of contents for periodic postmarketing adverse experience reports is generally consistent with
the international system of standardized postmarketing periodic reporting procedures and formats proposed by
the CIOMS II Working Group. This standardization would allow applicants and licensed manufacturers to prepare a
single postmarketing periodic report of adverse experiences for regulatory authorities worldwide. The agency
also believes that the proposed rule would improve reporting and would enhance FDA's ability to monitor potential
postmarketing safety problems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of this proposed revised list of contents for periodic postmarketing adverse experience reports, FDA
is proposing to remove &sect;&sect;314.80(c)(2)(iii) and 600.80(c)(2)(iii). These sections state that periodic
reporting does not apply to information obtained from postmarketing studies, reports in the scientific literature,
and foreign marketing experience. The proposed revised list of contents would include such information.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
F. IND Amendments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA regulations governing the use of investigational drugs in clinical investigations are contained in part 312
(21 CFR part 312). In order to conduct a clinical investigation using an investigational drug, a sponsor must first
submit an IND, described in &sect;312.23, which contains, among other things, a description of the drug, the results
of preclinical studies intended to show that the drug can be introduced into humans with reasonable safety, and a proposed
protocol for the investigation. This protocol provides a description of all aspects of the study, including the identity
and qualifications of the investigators conducting the study, procedures and criteria for selecting subjects,
the amount of the drug to be administered, the duration of use, the observations to be made to assess the effects of the
drug, and the clinical procedures, laboratory tests, and other measures carried out to minimize risk to the patient.
After the IND becomes effective and the investigational drug is being administered to human subjects, the sponsor
is required under &sect;312.32 to make both telephone and written safety reports on serious and unexpected adverse
experiences associated with the administration of the drug, as well as written reports only, on other serious adverse
events associated with administration of the drug. Under current &sect;312.33, the sponsor is also required to submit
an annual report containing significant safety and other information. If FDA concludes that a study would place subjects
at unreasonable and significant risk, FDA may place a study on clinical hold. This means that the drug may not be administered
to subjects until the hold is lifted (see &sect;312.42). FDA may also terminate the study under &sect;312.44 based
on such safety concerns.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is concerned that these IND reporting requirements may not be adequate to protect against some unexpected adverse
events. For example, there is a potential for such events to be disguised by patient conditions that might lead the
investigator to conclude that the experimental drug was not implicated in those events. The agency believes that
certain modifications in the way clinical investigations are conducted and reported may help to ensure that drug
toxicity is detected as early as possible. A recent internal task force that examined an incident that involved a fatal
drug toxicity that was not detected in early trials has recommended improvements in IND reporting that the agency
is incorporating into this proposal for public consideration. These improvements, as explained below, are intended
to provide more frequent and more complete evaluations of potentially serious adverse effects so that drug-related
events can be detected earlier by sponsors, investigators, and FDA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A clinical study of a nucleoside analog, FIAU, resulted in several instances of severe liver injury and five deaths,
beginning in June 1993. The study involved 15 subjects with chronic hepatitis B virus infection. FIAU had been considered
a highly promising agent without recognized serious toxicity. This incident prompted FDA to establish a task force
to see whether the data available prior to the study gave any suggestion of the serious toxicity that emerged. The task
force examined data from the 1993 FIAU study as well as data from previous studies on FIAU and a closely related drug
conducted by another sponsor. The data from these previous studies was, or should have been, available to the sponsor
of the 1993 FIAU study. The task force was also to determine whether some differences in process or behavior by investigators
and sponsors might have made it possible or more likely to have anticipated the toxicity. The proposed IND amendments
contained in this document are largely the result of recommendations by the task force (Ref. 3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Focusing on hepatic and pancreatic adverse events, the task force reviewed the data and data analyses that were available
to investigators, sponsors, and FDA at the start of the study to determine whether improvements in the rules governing
design, analysis, and reporting of data from clinical studies were warranted. The task force found a number of observations
and events that suggested an association between FIAU and hepatic and/or pancreatic abnormalities. However, none
of these events was attributed by the sponsors or investigators to FIAU. Rather, each event, even when recognized
as temporally related to a study, was attributed by investigators and sponsors to other factors, such as concomitant
drug administration and/or concurrent illness. The task force found that an overview of the data, in which deaths
and serious adverse experiences were analyzed cumulatively, and, with the hypothesis that the events were drug related,
was not produced and thus was not available for use by the sponsors, the principal investigators, or FDA reviewers.
Rather, the analyses performed focused on each individual event and determined a plausible explanation, other than
drug toxicity, for each occurrence. The task force recommended that, to detect similar patterns of events reflecting
toxicity in future studies, sponsors should conduct cumulative analyses with a systematic consideration of the
possibility that the adverse events are caused by the investigational drug. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed IND amendments would apply to all investigational studies conducted under part 312. However, FDA invites
comments from the public and industry on whether any or all of the proposed requirements should apply only to certain
IND's, whose selection could be determined by application of criteria that could be included in these regulations,
or only to certain phases of drug testing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Clinical Study Design
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is proposing to amend the requirements governing IND format and content in &sect;312.23. Under current &sect;312.23(a)(6),
an IND must contain the protocols for each planned study, including information such as a statement of the study's
objectives and purpose, the criteria for patient selection and exclusion, a description of the study design, the
method for determining the dose(s) to be administered and the duration of individual patient exposure to the drug,
and a description of clinical procedures, laboratory tests, or other measures to be taken to monitor the effects of
the drug in human subjects and to minimize risk.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In several instances, FDA's FIAU task force found that deaths and serious hepatic and pancreatic injuries that appear
in retrospect to have been related to FIAU were attributed by investigators and sponsors to the subjects' underlying
disease or to other drugs the subjects were taking for their conditions. The task force made several recommendations
intended to improve the likelihood that clinical studies will identify, early in drug development, drug toxicity
that mimics the underlying disease or the toxicity of concomitant medications. These recommendations include:
(1) Choosing study designs and safety endpoints that increase a study's ability to distinguish drug toxicity from
underlying disease or other drug toxicity; (2) prospectively identifying observations that will trigger certain
actions by investigators; and (3) summarizing safety data at regular intervals with systematic considerations
of the possibility that adverse events are drug related. The proposed rule would create new &sect;312.23(a)(6)(iii)(h)
to require that the protocols describe any adverse clinical or laboratory outcomes in the study that are to be immediately
reported to the sponsor. These reportable events might include death, any life-threatening event, or any other serious
event that might reflect potential drug toxicity, as suggested by preclinical data, and include abnormal laboratory
results falling outside of a specified range. The identified events and abnormal laboratory values are to include
those that focus attention on toxicity that may target the same organs and body systems as the underlying disease or
concomitant medications. Under the proposal, these events would be reported to the sponsor even if they are potentially
attributable to the patient's underlying disease or concomitant medications. Proposed &sect;312.23(a)(6)(iii)(h)
would also require instructions for investigators, such as reporting requirements, remeasurement or challenge
procedures, or discontinuation of the drug in response to identified events. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The task force also recommended that sponsors consider the use of a control group (for example, placebo, active control,
or historical control) in studies that focus on safety when the underlying disease process is likely to produce adverse
events that might be confused with drug toxicity. The task force concluded that such controls would help detect some
adverse events. Consequently, proposed &sect;312.23(a)(6)(iii)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) states that sponsors should consider the use of a formal control group when the underlying disease is likely to produce
adverse events that might be confused with drug toxicity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The task force also recommended that sponsors attempt to estimate the expected incidence of death and serious adverse
events in the study population that arise from the underlying disease or concomitant medications used to treat the
disease. This recommendation is reflected in proposed new &sect;312.23(a)(6)(iii)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
j
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) that would require sponsors to provide such estimates. Under the proposal, any deaths or adverse events that exceed
the estimates would create the presumption that the events are associated with use of the investigational drug, and
the sponsor would be required to submit a written safety report to FDA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The task force found that the followup periods in some of the FIAU and related studies were too short to detect some of
the adverse events that occurred because significant adverse events sometimes occurred weeks to months after dosing
with FIAU ended.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The task force recommended that all protocols contained in the IND include an explicit description of the length and
type of followup to be performed so that the agency may review the followup procedures (task force report at 57). Accordingly,
FDA is proposing to add new &sect;312.23(a)(6)(iii)(k) to require that the protocol section of an IND specify and
justify the length and type of followup for subjects after the conclusion of dosing. The justification may be brief;
for example, a reference to a study of a similar drug with the same followup period. The followup period would ensure
that clinical studies are adequately designed to detect drug toxicity that occurs after the conclusion of drug dosing.
The sponsor would propose an appropriate followup period based on preclinical data, experience with other members
of the drug class, the drug's mechanism of action, and prior human experience. The intensity of the followup may change
with time; e.g., a full evaluation might be scheduled for 2 weeks postdosing, with a telephone followup for possible
serious events at a later time. Ordinarily, in Phase 1 and 2 studies, telephone followup should occur at 3 months after
the dosing is completed, but alternative timeframes and procedures can be proposed by the sponsor. For some drugs,
like FIAU, a review of available data may suggest that the minimum followup period should be longer than 3 months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current regulations in &sect;312.56 require sponsors to review and evaluate the evidence relating to a drug's safety
and effectiveness as it is obtained from investigators. The regulations also require sponsors to report safety information
to FDA. The task force observed that in the FIAU study sponsors may not have had available adequate resources to evaluate
safety data reported by investigators. The proposed rule would amend &sect;312.56(c) to require sponsors, in addition
to reviewing and evaluating safety and effectiveness information, to develop a safety monitoring and evaluation
program before starting clinical trials. This provision is intended to ensure that sponsors have or will develop
adequate resources to evaluate safety data reported by investigators and is consistent with the task force's recommendations
(see task force report at 57). Consistent with this proposed requirement, FDA is also proposing in new &sect;312.23(a)(3)(v)
that an IND contain a description of any safety monitoring and evaluation program. This description would be in addition
to the introductory statement and general investigational plan that are required under current regulations.

2. Safety Reports
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is proposing several amendments to the requirements for IND safety reports in &sect;312.32. FDA is proposing
to alter the period for submitting written safety reports, under &sect;312.32(c)(1)(i) and (d)(3), from 10 working
days to 15 calendar days, and for submitting safety reports by telephone, under &sect;312.32(c)(2), from 3 working
days to 7 calendar days. FDA is also proposing to allow telephone safety reports to be made by facsimile transmission
as well as orally by telephone. These changes will give sponsors additional time to gather appropriate data to help
interpret the reports before submitting these reports. FDA believes the extended time period would be sufficient
to alert the agency to potential safety problems, especially because of the new investigational reporting requirements
the agency is proposing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;312.32(c) would also permit sponsors to submit IND safety reports to the agency by using FDA Form 3500A.
If FDA determined that insufficient data were submitted on FDA Form 3500A, the agency could require additional narrative
data to be submitted. As explained elsewhere in this proposal, this amendment is consistent with the proposal to use
this form for postmarketing reporting of human drug and licensed biological product adverse experiences.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is also proposing to amend the disclaimer contained in &sect;312.32(e) to emphasize that safety information
submitted to FDA are not to be considered admissions of causation or liability. The proposal would substitute the
word ``part'' for ``section'' so that the revised disclaimer would clearly apply to all safety information submitted
under part 312. Summaries of such safety information would not constitute a statement or admission that there was
a causal link between the administration of the drug and the subsequent adverse event. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Semiannual Reports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is proposing to amend the periodic reporting requirements in &sect;312.33 by adding, in addition to the annual
report, a semiannual death and serious adverse experiences report. This change is intended to ensure that reports
of deaths and other serious adverse experiences in all clinical studies are collected and reviewed in a timely and
comprehensive manner, and that the possibility of drug relatedness is always considered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under current regulations, sponsors must report deaths and serious and unexpected adverse experiences within 3
or 10 working days only if the events are associated with the use of the drug. ``Associated with the use of the drug''
is defined to mean that there is a reasonable possibility that the experience may have been caused by the drug (see &sect;312.32(a)).
Deaths and a summary of serious adverse experiences that occur in a clinical trial that the sponsor concludes are not
associated with use of the drug must be reported only in an IND annual report. The task force found that many adverse
experiences occurring during the FIAU study that appear, in retrospect, to have been drug related were not reported
in safety reports, although, at times, they were reported in the annual report as attributable to causes other than
FIAU. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule, therefore, would create a new ``semiannual report'' to require, among other things, the submission
of reports of all deaths, serious adverse experiences, and study discontinuations resulting from an adverse experience,
whether expected or unexpected and whether or not there was thought to be a possibility that the death or adverse experience
was caused by the drug. In these twice yearly reports, sponsors would also report all deaths and serious adverse experiences
that occurred during the trial or within the prescribed followup period. The report would include data not only from
studies conducted under the IND, but also data from all premarketing studies of the drug conducted worldwide, with
an analysis of all unexpected deaths, serious adverse experiences, and study discontinuations thought to be related
to the study drug from foreign postmarketing clinical trials and from foreign postmarketing spontaneous or required
reporting systems. Serious adverse events should include laboratory changes that result in discontinuation or
that are identified in the study protocol as reportable events. Sponsors would present these data both for the 6-month
reporting interval and cumulatively, and submit an analysis of the data. The agency would expect the analysis to conform
generally to the evaluation of deaths, serious adverse experiences, and discontinuations in the section entitled
``Integrated Summary of Safety Information'' in FDA's ``Guideline for the Format and Content of the Clinical and
Statistical Sections of New Drug Applications.'' FDA also recommends that the sponsor employ, in preparing the analysis,
at least one individual who had no involvement in conducting the clinical study. The proposal would also require a
sponsor to conduct a ``worst-case'' analysis of the safety data, presuming that observed adverse events were the
result of toxicity from the investigational drug, and then attempt to refute this presumption, with appropriate
data and evaluations (task force report at 59). The analysis should include estimates of the rate of an analyzed event
occurring spontaneously in the population and specific analyses of cases.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The sponsor would submit the semiannual report for the 6-month period following the day the IND goes into effect, and
for each 6-month period thereafter, until the end of the followup period specified in the protocol. The report would
be due within 60 days of the end of the reporting period. The semiannual safety report that is due during the same period
as the annual report would be submitted with the annual report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The task force recommended (task force report at 59) that FDA require the submission of all available autopsy reports
and medical reports concerning all deaths reported in these semiannual reports, because, in at least one instance
during the FIAU study, the cause of death originally reported was not fully consistent with the autopsy and terminal
medical reports later obtained for that subject. Proposed &sect;312.33(b)(2) would require the submission of these
reports and would require the sponsor to clarify any inconsistencies between these reports and the cause of death
reported to FDA by the sponsor. FDA is proposing this requirement to help ensure that reports covering deaths submitted
to the agency are complete and accurate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under proposed &sect;312.33(b)(3), at the request of the sponsor, or on its own initiative, FDA may modify certain
semiannual reporting requirements where, for example, the clinical study endpoint is mortality or where the study
is blinded and full compliance with the reporting requirement would require breaking the blind. FDA is proposing
this provision because studies vary concerning the nature and seriousness of the disease to be treated, the number
of subjects exposed to the drug, and the general pace at which the drug's development proceeds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Special Safety Summary
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In new &sect;312.37(a), FDA also proposes an additional mechanism to allow the agency to obtain safety data on investigational
drugs and summaries of these data not otherwise obtained through other reporting requirements if, and when, these
data are necessary. Most investigational drugs do not present unusual safety concerns, so that the safety data contained
in the 6-month and annual reports, as well as the IND safety reports submitted under &sect;312.32, would provide adequate
information to allow FDA to observe drug safety. Some drugs, however, may raise significant safety concerns either
anticipated or unanticipated, so that more comprehensive data on events that do not meet the definition of a serious
adverse reaction as well as those that do are needed. Events that might trigger this heightened scrutiny include agency
experience with similar drugs, animal toxicity study results, and information derived from IND safety, annual,
or semiannual reports. As recommended by the task force (task force report at 59 and 60), the proposed regulation is
drafted in general language to allow the agency, in consultation with the sponsor, flexibility in determining when
a report should be required and what information it should contain. This flexibility is considered necessary because
the specifics of the safety summary may vary from study to study. FDA anticipates that the safety summary will generally
not only contain the results of the cumulative analysis of deaths and serious adverse experiences contained in the
6-month report, but also an analysis of related events of lesser seriousness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the task force recommended that FDA require safety summaries unless an exemption had been granted to the
sponsor, FDA is proposing to require safety summaries only for those studies or products where the agency has determined
that a specific need for them exists. FDA would generally expect safety summaries to be submitted within 30 days after
they are requested; however, the agency recognizes that in cases where large amounts of data are required to be summarized
and those data are not readily available or easily summarized, a longer period of time may be necessary to prepare the
summary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Final Clinical Study Report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Information about FIAU risks and benefits that the sponsor might have derived from the process of collecting and analyzing
study results was delayed or never developed because final reports were not required for the earlier clinical studies
of FIAU and FIAC (a closely related nucleoside analog). Thus, FDA is proposing in &sect;312.37(b) to require sponsors
to submit, when required by FDA, a final report or study summary of a clinical study. FDA anticipates that final reports
usually will not be necessary. Instituting requirements for semiannual reporting of deaths, serious adverse experiences,
and discontinuations, and for summarization of all safety data will largely fulfill the need for more careful monitoring
and analysis of potential drug toxicity during drug testing. In some cases, however, it may still be valuable to have
available an analysis of the results of particular trials; e.g., to provide data on the likely effectiveness of a drug
for purposes of weighing risks against likely benefits to study subjects. The proposal would
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require final clinical study reports to be submitted within 90 days of a request from FDA, but provides for exceptions
under extraordinary circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Clinical Holds
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 312.42 currently allows FDA to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation
under certain circumstances. Under the proposal, FDA would amend &sect;312.42 to allow the agency to place an investigation
on clinical hold if the sponsor fails to submit a special safety summary or final clinical study report. If the same
or a closely related drug is the subject of a concurrent investigation, conducted by the same sponsor, proposed &sect;312.42(b)(1)(v)
would require safety summaries from all investigations or the agency could place any of the investigations on clinical
hold. FDA believes this is appropriate because data from all studies involving the drug or closely related drugs may
help FDA evaluate the safety of each study.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Termination
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is also proposing in &sect;312.44(b)(1)(viii) to amend the regulations regarding termination so that failure
to submit a semiannual report would be grounds for terminating an IND. Failure to submit an annual report is already
grounds for terminating an IND, and FDA is aware of no reason why semiannual and annual reports should be treated differently
in this matter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA considers that failure to implement an adequate safety monitoring and evaluation program, as described in proposed
21 CFR 312.56(c), would be grounds for either a clinical hold under &sect;312.42 or a termination of the IND under &sect;312.44,
since failure to have a program in place would mean that ``[h]uman subjects are or would be exposed to an unreasonable
and significant risk of illness or injury,'' which is currently grounds for either a clinical hold or termination.

8. Review of Ongoing Investigations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is also proposing to amend &sect;312.64(b) to require investigators to submit safety data to sponsors necessary
to allow sponsors to comply with the other proposed safety reporting requirements, such as the proposed semiannual
report. The proposed amendment would require the investigator to comply with safety reporting requirements established
in the protocol for the study. Current &sect;312.64(b) requires investigators to report adverse effects if they
may reasonably be regarded as caused by, or probably caused by, the drug. If the adverse effects are alarming, they
are to be reported to the sponsor immediately. These provisions are being retained as minimal requirements which
must be met, even if the protocol does not require the events to be reported. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
G. Written Procedures for Monitoring Adverse Experiences
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is also proposing to amend &sect;&sect;310.305(a) and 314.80(b) for marketed human drug products and &sect;600.80(b)
for licensed biological products to require applicants or manufacturers, packers, and distributors to develop
written procedures for the surveillance, receipt, evaluation, and reporting of adverse experiences to FDA. This
requirement would improve postmarketing surveillance by applicants or manufacturers and would enhance an applicant's
or manufacturer's ability to evaluate and report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse experiences to the agency. FDA believes that this provision would not impose a new burden on applicants and
manufacturers, because it codifies a practice that is already customary and usual in the pharmaceutical industry
for handling adverse experiences. Based on field inspections, FDA is aware that many manufacturers already have
written procedures for the receipt, evaluation, and reporting of adverse experiences to FDA. The agency also notes
that the current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) regulations for finished pharmaceuticals, which apply to manufacturers
of all marketed human drug and biological products, require written procedures describing the handling of all written
and oral complaints regarding a drug product (21 CFR 211.198). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the agency's ``Guideline For Postmarketing Reporting of Adverse Drug Experiences'' (Ref. 4), which
provides guidance on adverse drug experiences reported under &sect;&sect;310.305 and 314.80, states (at page 17)
that: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Each applicant should develop standardized, formal procedures for the surveillance, receipt, evaluation, and
reporting of ADE's to FDA. * * * All applicants should develop procedures that allow expedited adverse experience
report handling, and the applicant should keep on file documentation of due diligence.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 FDA is announcing the availability of a guideline entitled ``Guideline for Adverse Experience Reporting for Licensed
Biological Products.'' This guideline discusses the reports required by &sect;600.80 and provides guidance concerning
appropriate means of meeting the reporting requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
H. Resubmission of Reports Received From FDA
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the MedWatch program, FDA will transmit reports of spontaneously reported serious adverse experiences received
by the agency to the applicant, manufacturer, packer, or distributor (as appropriate) on an expedited basis. Consequently,
FDA is proposing to revise &sect;&sect;310.305(c), 314.80(b), and 600.80(b) to state that applicants or manufacturers,
packers, and distributors should not resubmit to the agency reports of adverse experiences that the agency has forwarded
to them. In addition, FDA is proposing to revise &sect;&sect;314.80(c)(1)(i) and 600.80(c)(1)(i) to remove the
phrase ``regardless of source'' from the description of which adverse experiences are reported to FDA. These revisions
are intended to reduce duplicate reporting of adverse experiences to the agency, consistent with the reporting instructions
in new FDA Form 3500A. FDA notes, however, that applicants or manufacturers, packers, and distributors receiving
reports forwarded to them by FDA are required to handle these reports as they would any others and that followup, if
obtained, is to be sent to the agency as specified in the regulation. These followup reports should be included, where
appropriate, in the postmarketing adverse experience periodic report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is also proposing that applicants and licensed manufacturers incorporate into any safety analysis (i.e., periodic
reports, increased frequency reports) the expedited reports received from FDA, whether or not additional followup
information was obtained, and any information received through Freedom of Information requests.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Other Revisions to the Reporting Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is proposing to remove &sect;&sect;314.80(c)(2)(iii) and 600.80(c)(2)(iii). These paragraphs state that
periodic reporting for non-15-day Alert reports does not apply to adverse drug experience information obtained
from postmarketing studies and reports in the scientific literature and from foreign marketing experience. FDA
is proposing to remove these paragraphs because this information would now be required under the proposed revisions
to the contents of a periodic report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current regulations, at &sect;314.80(c)(1)(ii), require applicants and, at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;600,80(c)(1)ii), licensed manufacturers to ``review periodically (at least as often as the periodic reporting
cycle)'' the frequency of reports of adverse experiences and report any significant increase in frequency to FDA.
Similarly, current &sect;310.305(c)(4) requires manufacturers, packers,and distributors to ``review periodically
(at least once each year)'' the frequency of reports of adverse experiences and report any significant increase in
frequency to FDA. In order to provide consistency with the proposed semiannual reporting requirements for periodic
adverse experience reports under &sect;&sect;314.80 and 600.80, FDA is proposing to amend &sect;310.305 to require
manufacturers, packers, and distributors to review periodically, at least twice each year, the frequency of adverse
experience reports for the purposes of making increased frequency reports to FDA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is also proposing to amend &sect;&sect;310.305(c) and 314.80(c) by reorganizing, renumbering, and retitling
the paragraphs in these sections to distinguish between postmarketing 15&hyph;day Alert reports, followups to
postmarketing 15&hyph;day Alert reports, and increased frequency reports. The proposed amendments would also
distinguish between the reporting intervals for postmarketing 15&hyph;day Alert reports and the revised intervals
proposed for postmarketing periodic reports.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is also proposing to amend &sect;&sect;310.305(c)(1) through (c)(4) and 314.80(c)(1)(i), through (c)(1)(iv)
to alter the period for submitting postmarketing ``15&hyph;day'' Alert reports from 15 working days to 15 calendar
days. This change should decrease misunderstandings with the reporting requirements as all timeframes would now
be stated in terms of calendar days. In addition, this change would increase consistency between the premarketing
and postmarketing reporting requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is also proposing to amend &sect;&sect;310.305(c)(2), 314.80(c)(1)(ii), and 600.80(c)(1)(ii) to require
applicants or manufacturers, packers, and distributors who have been unable to obtain additional information about
adverse experiences that are the subject of postmarketing 15-day Alert reports to maintain records of their attempts
to seek additional information. These proposed revisions will help ensure that applicants or manufacturers are
making good faith efforts to investigate adverse experiences that are the subject of postmarketing 15-day Alert
reports.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, FDA is proposing to amend &sect;&sect;310.305(d)(3)(ii) and 314.80(f)(3)(ii) to instruct applicants
or manufacturers, packers, and distributors that, before using an alternative reporting form instead of FDA Form
3500A, they must obtain approval from MedWatch: The FDA Medical Products Reporting Program, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville,
MD 20852&hyph;9787. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

J. Distribution Reports
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated earlier, the proposed rule would change the reporting interval for licensed biological product distribution
reports to be consistent with the suggested CIOMS standardized reporting period for postmarketing adverse drug
experience periodic reports. Licensed biological product distribution reports would be based on the international
birth date and data lock-point. The proposal would also remove &sect;600.81 and move the regulatory requirements
for licensed biological product distribution reports to &sect;600.80(c)(3).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
K. Multiple Reports
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is proposing to amend &sect;600.80(g) concerning multiple reports by adding information pertaining to a licensed
biological product for which a licensed manufacturer holds more than one biological product license. This revision
would be consistent with the requirements in &sect;314.80(g).

L. Guidelines
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is proposing to amend &sect;&sect;314.80(j) and 600.80(j) to indicate where guidelines for the submission of
adverse experience reports may be obtained. In addition, FDA is adding this information in &sect;310.305(g) for
the submission of adverse experience reports for prescription drugs without an approved application. For human
drug products, the guidelines may be obtained from the CDER Executive Secretariat Staff (HFD&hyph;8), Center for
Drug Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855, and for licensed
biological products from the Congressional and Consumer Affairs Branch (HFM&hyph;12), Center for Biologics Evaluation
and Research, Food and Drug Administration, 1401 Rockville Pike, suite 200N, Rockville, MD 20852&hyph;1448.

M. Proposed Implementation Scheme
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA proposes that any final rule that may issue based on this proposal become effective 30 days after its date of publication
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. All applications for human drug or licensed biological products approved on or after the effective date of any final
regulation would be subject to the periodic reporting time periods based on the international birth date. All human
drug and licensed biological product applications approved before the effective date of any final regulation would
use the U.S. approval date as the international birth date.

The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(a)(8) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has examined the impacts of the proposed rule under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub.
L. 96&hyph;354). Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory
alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including
potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and
equity). The agency believes that this proposed rule is consistent with the regulatory philosophy and principles
identified in the Executive Order. In addition, the proposed rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined
by the Executive Order and so is not subject to review under the Executive Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The economic costs imposed on the industry as a result of this proposed rule are the costs associated with reporting
deaths, serious adverse experiences, or clinical study discontinuations. Reporting burdens on the industry resulting
from FDA regulations are analyzed under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. Based on an estimated total of 480,602
annual burden hours, FDA has estimated that the total annual reporting cost to the industry as a result of this proposed
rule would be $ 24,030,100 (the estimated per hour cost to the industry is $ 50). In addition, the rule may increase certain
nonpaperwork activities. For example, added costs may result if the formal control groups suggested in &sect;312.23(a)(6)(iii)(i)
prompts additional clinical trial control arms, or if the implementation of the followup plan required in &sect;312.23(a)(6)(iii)(k)
provokes more elaborate monitoring procedures. At this time, FDA cannot predict the extent of these actions, but
welcomes public comment on issues regarding the scope or cost of these activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to analyze regulatory options that would minimize any significant
impact of a rule on small entities. The agency certifies that the proposed rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, no further analysis
is required.

: Adverse Experience Reporting Requirements For Human Drug and Licensed Biological Products.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Description
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: FDA is proposing to amend its current adverse experience reporting requirements to replace current Form FDA&hyph;1639
with new FDA Form 3500A; to revise certain definitions and reporting periods and formats; to require applicants or
manufacturers, packers, and distributors to develop written procedures for monitoring and reporting adverse experiences;
and to make other revisions to provide uniformity to the reporting regulations. These changes would simplify and
facilitate the reporting of adverse events and product problems under a single form and help harmonize international
adverse event reporting requirements. In addition, FDA is proposing to amend the sponsor reporting requirements
in part 312.

Description of Respondents

: Businesses or other for profit and small businesses or organizations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The burden hours for &sect;&sect;310.305 and 314.80 are approved under OMB information collection number 0910&hyph;0230.
The burden hours for &sect;600.80 have been submitted to OMB for approval and can be found elsewhere in this issue of
the

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. FDA estimates no change in the burden hours that have already been approved. OMB has approved use of the new form, under
OMB information collection number 0910&hyph;0291, through December 1994. The new recordkeeping requirements
under &sect;310.305(c)(2), 314.80(c)(1)(ii), and 600.80(c)(1)(ii), that applicants or manufacturers, packers,
and distributors maintain records of unsuccessful attempts to obtain additional followup information on 15-day
``Alert reports,'' would be negligible and would result in no change in the burden hours that have already been approved.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new requirements under &sect;&sect;310.305(a), 314.80(b), and 600.80(b), that applicants or manufacturers,
packers, and distributors develop written procedures for the surveillance, receipt, evaluation, and reporting
of adverse experiences, would not impose a new burden because they codify a practice that is already customary and
usual in the pharmaceutical industry for handling adverse experiences.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The more extensive list of contents for the periodic postmarketing adverse experience report, in proposed &sect;&sect;314.80(c)(2)(ii)
and 600.80(c)(2)(ii), would result in an increased reporting burden on the industry. As indicated in the accompanying
chart, the proposed periodic reporting requirements would require, on an average, 19 additional hours for respondents
to prepare.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal would also increase the reporting requirements for sponsors under part 312. As indicated in the accompanying
chart, the proposed amendments to part 312 would result in an increase of 167,900 burden hours on the industry.

Definitions
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The following definitions of terms apply to this section:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FDA
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means the Food and Drug Administration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Adverse drug experience
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means any adverse event associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related, including
the following: An adverse event occurring in the course of the use of a drug product in professional practice; an adverse
event occurring from drug overdose; an adverse event occurring from drug withdrawal; and any failure of expected
pharmacological action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Disability
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means a substantial disruption of a person's ability to carry out normal life functions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Increased frequency
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means an increase in the rate of occurrence of a particular adverse drug experience, e.g., an increased number of reports
of particular adverse drug experience after appropriate adjustment for drug exposure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Life-threatening
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means that the patient was, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the adverse drug experience
as it occurred. It does not include an adverse drug experience that, had it occurred in a more serious form, might have
caused death. For example, product-induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not
be considered life-threatening even though hepatitis of a more severe nature can be fatal. Similarly, an allergic
reaction resulting in angioedema of the face would not be life-threatening, although angioedema of the larynx, allergic
bronchospasm, or anaphylaxis can be fatal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Serious
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means an adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that is fatal or life-threatening, results in persistent or
significant disability/incapacity, requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization, necessitates medical or
surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure,
or is a congenital anomaly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Unexpected
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means an adverse drug experience that is not listed in the current labeling for the drug product and includes an event
that may be symptomatically and pathophysiologically related to an event listed in the labeling, but differs from
the event because of greater severity or specificity. For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would
be unexpected (by virtue of greater severity) if the labeling only referred to elevated hepatitic enzymes or hepatitis.
Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater specificity)
if the labeling only listed cerebral vascular accidents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reporting requirements
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Each person identified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall report to FDA adverse drug experience information
as described in this section and shall submit one copy of each report to the Division of Epidemiology and Surveillance
(HFD&hyph;730), Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville,
MD 20857.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Postmarketing 15&hyph;Day ``Alert reports''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (i) Any person whose name appears on the label of a marketed prescription drug product as its manufacturer, packer,
or distributor shall report to FDA each adverse drug experience received or otherwise obtained that is both serious
and unexpected as soon as possible, but in any case, within 15 calendar days of initial receipt of the information.
Each report shall be accompanied by a copy of the current labeling for the drug product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A person identified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section is not required to submit a 15-day ``Alert report''
for an adverse drug experience obtained from a postmarketing study (whether or not conducted under an investigational
new drug application) unless the applicant concludes that there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused
the adverse experience.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Postmarketing 15&hyph;Day ``Alert reports''_followup
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Each person identified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section shall promptly investigate all serious, unexpected
adverse drug experiences that are the subject of these 15-day postmarketing Alert reports and shall submit followup
reports within 15 calendar days of receipt of new information or as requested by FDA. If additional information is
not obtainable, records should be maintained of the unsuccessful steps taken to seek additional information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Increased frequency report
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Each person identified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section shall review periodically (at least twice each year)
the frequency of reports of adverse drug experiences that are both serious and expected and reports of therapeutic
failure (lack of effect), received or otherwise obtained, and report any significant increase in frequency as soon
as possible, but in any case within 15 calendar days of determining that a significant increase in frequency exists.
Reports of a significant increase in frequency are required to be submitted in narrative form (including the time
period on which the increased frequency is based, the method of analysis, and the interpretation of the results) rather
than using FDA Form 3500A.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Submission of reports
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In order to avoid unnecessary duplication in the submission of, and followup to, reports required in this section,
including reports required by paragraph (c)(3) of this section, a packer's or distributor's obligations may be met
by submission of all reports of serious adverse drug experiences to the manufacturer of the drug product. If a packer
or distributor elects to submit these adverse drug experience reports to the manufacturer rather than to FDA, it shall
submit each report to the manufacturer within 3 calendar days of its receipt by the packer or distributor, and the manufacturer

to the sponsor immediately. This would ordinarily include any death, any life-threatening event, any serious event
that might reflect potential toxicity, as suggested by preclinical data, laboratory values that exceed specified
limits, or any markedly abnormal laboratory value. The identified events and abnormal laboratory values are to include
those that focus attention on toxicity that may target the same organs and body systems as the underlying disease or
concomitant medications for the disease. The events are to be reported to the sponsor even if they are potentially
attributable to the patient's underlying disease or to other medications the patient may have received. This section
of the protocol shall include instructions for the investigator encountering such an event, such as reporting requirements,
a remeasurement or challenge procedure, or discontinuation of the study drug.

adverse experiences that exceed these estimates would create a presumption that the events are associated with the
use of the investigational drug.

procedures based on preclinical data, experience with other members of the drug class, the drug's mechanism of action,
and prior human experience. The sponsor shall include a brief description of the rationale used in selecting the followup
period and procedures. The intensity of the followup may change with time; e.g., a full evaluation might be scheduled
for 2 weeks after the end of drug dosing, with a telephone followup at a later time. Ordinarily, in Phase 1 and 2 studies,
there should be at least telephone followup for 3 months after drug dosing is completed, but alternative timeframes
and procedures can be proposed by the sponsor. In some cases, available information may dictate followup periods
longer than 3 months.

period following the day the IND goes into effect, and for each 6-month period thereafter, until the end of the followup
period specified in the protocol. The report shall be due within 60 days of the end of the reporting period. The semiannual
safety report that is due during the same period as the annual report required under paragraph (a) of this section shall
be submitted with the annual report. These semiannual reports shall include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A summary and analysis of all deaths, all serious adverse experiences, and all study discontinuations resulting
from an adverse experience that occurred during the study or within the prescribed followup period, whether the deaths
or adverse experiences were expected or unexpected and whether or not there is thought to be a possibility that the
death or adverse experience or study discontinuation was caused by the drug. This summary shall include data not only
from studies conducted under the IND, but also data from all premarketing studies of the drug conducted worldwide,
with an analysis of all unexpected deaths, serious adverse experiences, and study discontinuations thought to be
related to the study drug from foreign postmarketing clinical trials and from foreign postmarketing spontaneous
or required reporting systems. For purposes of this section, serious adverse events shall include laboratory changes
identified in the study protocol as reportable events or that result in discontinuation. The sponsor shall present
in the summary both the data that accumulated during the reporting period and cumulatively. The sponsor shall also
submit an analysis of the data that assumes that the investigational drug is responsible for the deaths, serious adverse
experiences, and study discontinuations, and refute, as feasible, this presumption with appropriate data and evaluations.
The expected incidence of deaths and serious adverse experiences in the study population that may arise from the underlying
disease or from medications used to treat the underlying disease that was estimated in the protocol should be considered
in this evaluation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) All available autopsy reports and terminal medical reports concerning all deaths reported in this summary, with
a discussion of any inconsistencies between autopsy and medical reports and the cause of death reported to FDA by the
sponsor.

death. For example, product-induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not be considered
life-threatening even though hepatitis of a more severe nature can be fatal. Similarly, an allergic reaction resulting
in angioedema of the face would not be life-threatening, even though angioedema of the larynx, allergic bronchospasm,
or anaphylaxis can be fatal.

shall submit two copies of each report described in this section to the Central Document Room, Park Bldg., rm. 2&hyph;14,
12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857. FDA may waive the requirement for the second copy in appropriate instances.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Postmarketing 15-day ``Alert reports''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The applicant shall report each adverse drug experience that is both serious and unexpected as soon as possible but
in any case within 15 calendar days of initial receipt of the information. These reports shall be submitted on FDA Form
3500A.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

. The applicant shall promptly investigate all adverse drug experiences that are the subject of these postmarketing
15-day Alert reports and shall submit followup reports within 15 calendar days of receipt of new information or as
requested by FDA. If additional information is not obtainable, records should be maintained of the unsuccessful
steps taken to seek additional information. These postmarketing 15-day Alert reports and followups to them shall
be submitted under separate cover and may not be included, except for summary or tabular purposes, in a postmarketing
adverse drug experience periodic report.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Increased frequency report
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The applicant shall review periodically (at least as often as the periodic reporting cycle) the frequency of reports
of adverse drug experiences that are both serious and expected and reports of therapeutic failure (lack of effect),
regardless of source, and report any significant increase in frequency as soon as possible but in any case within 15
calendar days of determining that a significant increase in frequency exists. Upon written notice, FDA may require
that applicants review the frequency of reports of serious, expected adverse drug experiences at intervals different
than the periodic reporting cycle. Reports of a significant increase in frequency are required to be submitted in
narrative form (including the time period on which the increased frequency is based, the method of analysis, and the
interpretation of the results), rather than using FDA Form 3500A. 15-day Alert reports based on increased frequency
are required to be submitted under separate cover and may not be included, except for summary purposes, in a periodic
report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Submission of reports
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The requirements of paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii), and (c)(1)(iii) of this section, concerning the submission
of postmarketing 15-day Alert reports, shall also apply to any person (other than the applicant) whose name appears
on the label of an approved drug product as a manufacturer, packer, or distributor. However, in order to avoid unnecessary
duplication in the submission to FDA of reports required by paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii), and (c)(1)(iii) of
this section, obligations of a nonapplicant may be met by submission of all reports of serious adverse drug experiences
to the applicant. If a nonapplicant elects to submit adverse drug experience reports to the applicant rather than
to FDA, it shall submit each report to the applicant within 3 calendar days of its receipt by the nonapplicant, and the
applicant shall then comply with the requirements of this section. Under this circumstance, the nonapplicant shall
maintain a record of this action which shall include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) A copy of the drug experience report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Date the report was received by the nonapplicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Date the report was submitted to the applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Name and address of the applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Report identification
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Each report submitted under this paragraph shall bear prominent identification as to its contents, i.e., ``15-day
Alert report,'' ``15-day Alert report_followup,'' or ``Increased frequency report.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Periodic adverse drug experience reports
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (i) The applicant shall report every 6 months each adverse drug experience not reported under paragraphs (c)(1)(i)
and (c)(1)(ii) of this section. The periodic reporting term shall be based upon the international birth date of the
human drug product. The first 6-month anniversary of the international birth date after the application is approved
in the United States is the data lock-point for the first periodic reporting term. Each subsequent 6-month anniversary
of the international birth date is the data lock-point for subsequent periodic reporting terms for that particular
product. Periodic reports shall be submitted to FDA within 45 days after the data lock-point. Upon written notice,
FDA may require that the applicant submit reports under this section at times other than those stated. An applicant
who wishes to submit periodic reports at different intervals must submit to FDA a request for a waiver under &sect;314.90.
Followup information to adverse drug experiences submitted initially in a periodic report may be submitted in the
next periodic report. If the applicant does not receive any adverse experience reports during the reporting period,
the applicant shall, in place of a periodic report, send a copy of the current approved U.S. labeling and a letter identifying
the product, the application number, and the reporting period, stating that no adverse drug experience reports were
received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reports
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Each periodic report shall contain:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Title page, table of contents, and introduction
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The introduction shall be a summary of the periodic report with page references to detailed data and information.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Applicant's core safety data sheet
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The applicant's core safety data sheet shall be a document prepared by the applicant that contains all relevant safety
information, including adverse drug experiences, which the applicant believes should be listed for the drug in all
countries where the drug is marketed. It may be used by the applicant as the reference document by which an adverse drug
experience is judged to be expected or unexpected for purposes of this postmarketing periodic report. For all other
determinations of whether an adverse drug experience is expected or unexpected, the definition in paragraph (a)
of this section shall apply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) FDA recognizes that the postmarketing periodic report may be submitted by the applicant to multiple countries and
the product may have different approved labels in the different countries. The use of the applicant's core safety
data sheet as the reference document for determining whether an adverse drug experience is unexpected or not may result
in some overreporting of unexpected adverse events that actually are expected by the U.S. approved product label.
This is because the approved label for the United States may have more safety information included in it than the manufacturer's
core safety data sheet. If an adverse event is not listed in the U.S. label, but is in the manufacturer's core safety
data sheet, this shall be clearly noted in the ``Overall safety evaluation'' (see paragraph (c)(2) (ii)(H) of this
section). This section also shall highlight clearly any changes and the reasons for the changes in the applicant's
core safety data sheet since the previous postmarketing periodic report.

(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) An applicant may also use the approved U.S. label as the reference by which expected and unexpected adverse drug experiences
are determined for the postmarketing periodic report. If an applicant chooses to use the approved U.S. label for this
purpose, it shall clearly be stated in this section of the report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The product's marketing status
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This section shall contain a table containing a chronological history of the marketing status of the product worldwide
(all regulatory decisions affecting the product and all market launches) from the date it was first approved through
its current status. Approvals or applications voluntarily withdrawn for safety reasons shall be included at a minimum.
The product shall be listed by chemical (or proper name) and brand name(s).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Regulatory actions for safety reasons
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This section shall contain a narrative identifying the reasons for significant regulatory authority or manufacturer-initiated
actions taken anywhere in the world, or to be taken imminently, for safety reasons during the reporting period. This
includes, for example, application withdrawal or license suspension or failure to renew, distribution restrictions,
clinical trial suspension, labeling changes due to significant safety concerns, dosage modifications, or pharmaceutical
changes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Patient exposure
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This section shall include the product's domestic and foreign marketing distribution data during the reporting
period. This shall be used to calculate the extent of patient exposure. The method used by the manufacturer to estimate
patient exposure shall always be described and shall include the total number of dosage units of each dosage form and
strength or potency (e.g., 100,000/5-milligram tablets, 50,000/10-milliliter vials).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Data lock-point
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means the date designated as the cutoff date for data to be incorporated into a specific postmarketing adverse experience
periodic report. Data available to the licensed manufacturer after this date will not be incorporated into the report,
unless it represents important information.

Life-threatening
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means that the patient was, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the adverse experience
as it occurred. It does not include an adverse experience that, had it occurred in a more serious form, might have caused
death. For example, product-induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not be considered
life-threatening even though hepatitis of a more severe nature can be fatal. Similarly, an allergic reaction resulting
in angioedema of the face would not be life-threatening, even though angioedema of the larynx, allergic bronchospasm,
or anaphylaxis can be fatal.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Serious
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means an adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that is fatal or life-threatening, results in persistent or
significant disability/incapacity, requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization, necessitates medical or
surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure,
or is a congenital anomaly.

Reporting requirements
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The licensed manufacturer shall report to FDA adverse experience information, as described in this section. The
licensed manufacturer shall submit two copies of each report described in this section for nonvaccine biological
products to the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (HFM&hyph;210), Food and Drug Administration, 1401
Rockville Pike, suite 200N, Rockville, MD 20852&hyph;1448. Submit all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vaccine adverse experience reports to: Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), P.O. Box 1100, Rockville,
MD 20849&hyph;1100. FDA may waive the requirement for the second copy in appropriate instances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1)(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Postmarketing 15-day ``Alert reports''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The licensed manufacturer shall report each adverse experience that is both serious and unexpected as soon as possible,
but in any case within 15 calendar days of initial receipt of the information. These reports shall be submitted for
nonvaccine biological products on FDA Form 3500A, and, for vaccines, on a VAERS form.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Postmarketing 15-day ``Alert reports''_followup
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The licensed manufacturer shall promptly investigate all adverse experiences that are the subject of these postmarketing
15-day Alert reports and shall submit followup reports within 15 calendar days of receipt of new information or as
requested by FDA. If additional information is not obtainable, records should be maintained of the unsuccessful
steps taken to seek additional information. These postmarketing 15-day Alert reports and followups to them shall
be submitted under separate cover and may not be included, except for summary or tabular purposes, in a postmarketing
adverse experience periodic report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Increased frequency report
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The licensed manufacturer shall review periodically (at least as often as the periodic reporting cycle) the frequency
of reports of adverse biological product experiences that are both serious and expected and reports of therapeutic
failure (lack of effect), regardless of source, and report any significant increase in frequency as soon as possible
but in any case within 15 calendar days of determining that a significant increase in frequency exists. Upon written
notice, FDA may require that licensed manufacturers review the frequency of reports of serious, expected adverse
biological experiences at intervals different than the periodic reporting cycle. Reports of a significant increase
in frequency are required to be submitted in narrative form (including the time period on which the increased frequency
is based, the method of analysis, and the interpretation of the results), rather than using the form designated by
FDA. 15-day Alert reports based on increased frequency are required to be submitted under separate cover and may not
be included, except for summary purposes, in a periodic report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Submission of reports
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The requirements of paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii), and (c)(i)(iii) of this section, concerning the submission
of postmarketing 15-day Alert reports, shall also apply to any person (other than the licensed manufacturer of the
final product) whose name appears on the label of a licensed biological product as a manufacturer, packer, distributor,
shared manufacturer, joint manufacturer, or any other participant involved in divided manufacturing. However,
in order to avoid unnecessary duplication in the submission to FDA of reports required by paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii),
and (c)(1)(iii) of this section, obligations of a manufacturer other than the licensed manufacturer, including
a licensed manufacturer of the product other than in its final form, may be met by submission of all reports of serious
adverse experiences to the licensed manufacturer of the final product. If a manufacturer, other than the licensed
manufacturer, elects to submit reports to the licensed manufacturer rather than to FDA, it shall submit each report
to the licensed manufacturer within 3 calendar days of its receipt, and the licensed manufacturer shall then comply
with the requirements of this section. Under this circumstance, the manufacturer shall maintain a record of this
action which shall include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) A copy of all adverse biological product experience reports submitted to the licensed manufacturer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Date the report was received by the manufacturer other than the licensed manufacturer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Date the report was submitted to the licensed manufacturer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Name and address of the licensed manufacturer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Report identification
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Each report submitted under this paragraph shall bear prominent identification as to its contents, i.e., ``15-day
Alert report,'' ``15-day Alert report_followup,'' or ``Increased frequency report.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2)(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Periodic adverse experience reports
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The licensed manufacturer shall report every 6 months each adverse experience not reported under paragraphs (c)(1)(i)
and (c)(1)(ii) of this section. The periodic reporting term shall be based upon the international birth date of the
biological product. The first 6-month anniversary of the international birth date after the application is approved
in the United States is the data lock- point for the first periodic reporting term. Each subsequent 6-month anniversary
of the international birth date is the data lock-point for subsequent periodic reporting terms for that particular
product. Periodic reports shall be submitted to FDA within 45 days after the data lock-point. Upon written notice,
FDA may require that the licensed manufacturer submit reports under this section at times other than those stated.
A licensed manufacturer who wishes to submit periodic reports at different intervals must submit to FDA a request
for a waiver under &sect;600.90. Followup information to adverse experiences submitted in a periodic report may
be submitted in the next periodic report. If the licensed manufacturer does not receive any adverse experience reports
during the reporting period, the licensed manufacturer shall, in place of a periodic report, send a copy of the current
approved U.S. labeling and a letter identifying the product, the application number, and the reporting period, stating
that no adverse experience reports were received.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reports
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Each periodic report shall contain:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Title page, table of contents, and introduction
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The introduction shall be a summary of the periodic report with page references to detailed data and information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Licensed manufacturer's core safety data sheet
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The licensed manufacturer's core safety data sheet shall be a document prepared by the licensed manufacturer that
contains all relevant safety information, including adverse experiences, which the licensed manufacturer believes
should be listed for the licensed biological product in all countries where the licensed biological product is marketed.
It may be used by the licensed manufacturer as the reference document by which an adverse experience is judged to be
expected or unexpected for purposes of this postmarketing periodic report. For all other determinations of whether
an adverse experience is expected or unexpected, the definition in paragraph (a) of this section shall apply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) FDA recognizes that the postmarketing periodic report may be submitted by the licensed manufacturer to multiple
countries and the product may have different approved labels in the different countries. The use of the licensed manufacturer's
core safety data sheet as the reference document for determining whether an adverse drug experience is unexpected
or not may result in some overreporting of unexpected adverse events that actually are expected by the U.S. approved
product label. This is because the approved label for the United States may have more safety information included
in it than the licensed manufacturer's core safety data sheet. If an adverse event is not listed in the U.S. label, but
is in the licensed manufacturer's core safety data sheet, this shall be clearly noted in the ``Overall safety evaluation''
(see paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(H) of this section). This section also shall highlight clearly any changes and the reasons
for the changes in the licensed manufacturer's core safety data sheet since the previous postmarketing periodic
report.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) A licensed manufacturer may also use the approved U.S. label as the reference by which expected and unexpected adverse
experiences are determined for the postmarketing periodic report. If a licensed manufacturer chooses to use the
approved U.S. label for this purpose, it shall clearly be stated in this section of the report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The product's marketing status
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This section shall contain a table containing a chronological history of the marketing status of the product worldwide
(all regulatory decisions affecting the product and all market launches) from the date it was first approved through
its current status. Approvals or applications voluntarily withdrawn for safety reasons shall be included at a minimum.
The product shall be listed by chemical (or proper name) and brand name(s).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Regulatory actions for safety reasons
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This section shall contain a narrative identifying the reasons for significant regulatory authority or manufacturer-initiated
actions taken anywhere in the world, or to be taken imminently, for safety reasons during the reporting period. This
includes, for example, licensed application withdrawal or license suspension or failure to renew, distribution
restrictions, clinical trial suspension, labeling changes due to significant safety concerns, dosage modifications,
or pharmaceutical changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Patient exposure
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This section shall include the product's domestic and foreign marketing distribution data during the reporting
period. This shall be used to calculate the extent of patient exposure. The method used by the licensed manufacturer
to estimate patient exposure shall always be described and shall include the total number of dosage units of each dosage
form and strength or potency (e.g., 100,000/5-milligram tablets, 50,000/10-milliliter vials).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

dose, duration of treatment (prior to event), time to onset, description of reaction (as reported), outcome (e.g.,
fatal, resolved), other comments (e.g., manufacturer's report number). This format is consistent with that suggested
by CIOMS. In addition, a tabular summary of the number of adverse events by body system may be included. This section
shall end with an analysis by the reporter, in narrative form, of the cases submitted. The licensed manufacturer shall
also attach to the end of the postmarketing periodic report a completed FDA Form 3500A or VAERS form for all U.S. spontaneous
reports of adverse experiences except those reported under paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii) of this section,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Distribution reports
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The licensed manufacturer shall submit information about the quantity of the product distributed under the product
license, including the quantity distributed to distributors. The interval between distribution reports shall
be 6 months. The reporting term shall be based upon the international birth date of the biological product. The first
6-month anniversary of the international birth date after the application is approved in the United States is the
data lock-point for the first reporting term. Each subsequent 6-month anniversary of the international birth date
is the data lock-point for subsequent reporting terms for that particular product. Distribution reports shall be
submitted to FDA within 45 calendar days after the data lock-point. Upon written notice, FDA may require that the licensed
manufacturer submit distribution reports under this section at times other than every 6 months. The distribution
report shall consist of the bulk lot number (from which the final container was filled), the fill lot numbers for the
total number of dosage units of each strength or potency distributed (e.g., 50,000/10-milliliter vials), the label
lot number (if different from fill lot number), labeled date of expiration, number of doses in fill lot/label lot,
date of release of fill lot/label lot released for distribution at that time. If any significant amount of a fill lot/label
lot is returned, include this information. Disclosure of financial or pricing data is not required. As needed, FDA
may require submission of more detailed product distribution information. Upon written notice, FDA may require
that the licensed manufacturer submit reports under this section at times other than those stated. A licensed manufacturer
that wishes to submit reports at times other than those stated should submit a request for a waiver under &sect;600.90.
