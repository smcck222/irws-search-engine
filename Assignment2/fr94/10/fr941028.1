SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This document proposes the supersedure of an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Boeing
Model 747SP series airplanes, that currently requires repetitive inspections for cracks in the web of the wing front
spar over engine numbers 2 and 3, and repair, if necessary. This action would require additional inspections in an
area beyond that specified in the existing AD. This action also would provide for a new, optional terminating modification,
which, if accomplished, would constitute terminating action for the repetitive inspections. This proposal is prompted
by a report of cracking in the web in an area outside the inspection zone specified in the existing AD. A crack in the web
that is not detected before it extends outside the chord footprints can allow fuel leakage. The actions specified
by the proposed AD are intended to prevent fuel leakage onto an engine and a resultant fire due to cracking in the web
of the wing front spar.

Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On August 6, 1990, the FAA issued AD 90&hyph;17&hyph;18, amendment 39&hyph;6702
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(55 FR 33279, August 15, 1990), applicable to certain Boeing Model 747SP series airplanes, to require inspections
for cracks in the web of the wing front spar between front spar station (FSS) 636 and FSS 675 over engine numbers 2 and
3, and repair, if necessary. That AD also provides for an optional modification, which, if accomplished, constitutes
terminating action for the required inspections. That action was prompted by a report of a 26-inch crack on the front
spar web. The requirements of that AD are intended to prevent fuel leakage onto an engine and a resultant fire.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the issuance of that AD, the FAA received a report of cracking in the web of the wing front spar in an area outside
the inspection zone specified in AD 90&hyph;17&hyph;18 on a Model 747SP series airplane that had been inspected previously
in accordance with that AD. The report involved a 31-inch fatigue crack between front spar station (FSS) 628 and FSS
659. The crack was initiated by sonic fatigue. In addition, fuel was leaking adjacent to the number 3 engine. The FAA
also received a report of a 24-inch fatigue crack between FSS 646 and FSS 670 on another Model 747SP series airplane.
A crack in the web that is not detected before it extends outside the chord footprints can allow fuel leakage. Fatigue
cracking on the web of the wing front spar, if not detected and corrected in a timely manner, can result in fuel leakage
onto an engine and a resultant fire.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on these findings, the FAA has determined that additional actions are necessary on airplanes that were inspected
or modified in accordance with AD 90&hyph;17&hyph;18. The FAA finds that an ultrasonic inspection must be performed
in an area that extends beyond that specified in the existing AD. In addition, a high frequency eddy current inspection
of an area of the web one inch below the upper chord and one inch above the lower chord footprints between FSS 628 and FSS
675 must be performed. Additionally, the FAA finds that these inspections must be performed on airplanes on which
the ``terminating modification,'' which was provided in AD 90&hyph;17&hyph;18, was previously installed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747&hyph;57A2259, Revision 2, dated June 9, 1994,
which describes procedures for additional inspections of an expanded inspection zone. This revised alert service
bulletin describes the following repetitive inspections to detect cracks in the web between FSS 628 and FSS 675:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Ultrasonic inspections of the web under the upper and lower chord footprints;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. High frequency eddy current inspections of the web in an area one inch below the upper chord and one inch above the
lower chord footprints; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Detailed visual inspections of the forward face of the web of the wing front spar at fastener locations in the web-to-stiffeners
and web-to-rib posts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The alert service bulletin also describes procedures for accomplishment of an optional terminating modification.
That modification involves removing a section of the web of the wing front spar between FSS 623 and FSS 670 inboard of
the inboard engine, splicing in a new thicker web section, and adding a new stiffener outboard of the web splice. If
this modification is accomplished, the repetitive inspections of the web, as described in the alert service bulletin,
are no longer necessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would supersede AD 90&hyph;17&hyph;18 to require various repetitive inspections to detect
cracks in the web of the wing front spar in an area beyond that specified in the existing AD, and modification, if cracking
is found. Installation of the modification would constitute terminating action for the repetitive inspections.
The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the alert service bulletin described previously.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operators should note that this NPRM would supersede the existing AD with new, additional inspections and a new terminating
modification. Airplanes on which the previous ``terminating'' modification provided for in AD 90&hyph;17&hyph;18
had been installed would be required to be inspected in accordance with the new inspections proposed in this notice.
Installation of the new terminating modification, specified in paragraph (e) of this notice, would constitute terminating
action for the requirements of the AD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The manufacturer has advised that it is currently developing a modification program for the engine struts on these
airplanes that will positively address the fatigue cracking condition and other items associated with the engine
struts. Once this modification program is developed and approved, the FAA may consider additional rulemaking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 35 Model 747SP series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates
that 11 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that it would take approximately 22 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed inspections
(between FSS 628 and FSS 675) specified in this AD, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these
figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $13,310, or $1,210 per airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Should an operator elect to accomplish the terminating modification that would be provided by this AD action, it would
take approximately 644 work hours to accomplish it, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. The cost of required
parts would be $21,800. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the terminating modification would be $57,220
per airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Canadair
Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;2B19 (Regional Jet) series airplanes. This proposal would require various modifications
of the passenger doors. This proposal is prompted by reports that some passenger doors froze shut during flight and
could not be opened after landing the airplane. The actions specified by the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AD are intended to prevent the passenger doors from freezing shut, and consequently, prohibiting the passengers
from exiting the airplane in the event of an emergency.

Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Transport Canada Aviation, which is the airworthiness authority for Canada, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe
condition may exist on certain Canadair Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;2B19 (Regional Jet) series airplanes. Transport
Canada Aviation advises that some passenger doors froze shut during flight and could not be opened after landing of
the airplane. In some cases, the passenger door outer handle mechanism froze; in others, the latching mechanism seized
as a result of frost in the latch pins of the door. In addition, there have been cases where passenger door pull-out handles
have been found to be damaged as a result of freezing, which can result in failure of the door operating mechanism to
function correctly. Investigation also revealed that the temperature at the passenger and service door area is noticeably
cooler than in other areas of the airplane, due to insufficient insulation of the doors. These conditions, if not corrected,
could result in the inability of passengers to exit the airplane in the event of an emergency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bombardier, Inc., has issued the following service information:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Canadair Alert Service Bulletin S.B. A601R&hyph;52&hyph;002, Revision `C,' dated December 1, 1993. This alert
service bulletin describes procedures for applying an anti-ice agent to the operating mechanisms of the passenger
and service doors. The alert service bulletin also describes procedures for applying a dry lubrication agent to the
seals of those doors and to the seals of the overwing emergency exits and greasing the passenger door latch pins. Accomplishment
of those actions will decrease the possibility of seizure of the doors and exits as a result of frozen moisture in the
mechanisms and seals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Canadair Service Bulletin S.B. 601R&hyph;52&hyph;007, Revision `B,' dated December 1, 1993. This service bulletin
describes procedures for applying grease to the passenger door latch pins and latch pin fittings. Accomplishment
of this service bulletin will decrease the possibility of seizure of the latching mechanisms as a result of frost in
the mechanisms and seals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Canadair Alert Service Bulletin S.B. A601R&hyph;52&hyph;008, Revision `B,' dated December 1, 1993. This alert
service bulletin describes procedures for temporarily isolating the pull-out handle from the door latch mechanism.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Canadair Service Bulletin S.B. 601R&hyph;52&hyph;006, Revision `B,' dated December 1, 1993. This service bulletin
describes procedures for installing sealed insulation packages to the interior of the passenger door/stairway,
service door, and service door surround. Accomplishment of this service bulletin will increase the insulation value
of the passenger and service doors and will reduce heat loss conditions within the passenger and service door areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Canadair Alert Service Bulletin S.B. A601R&hyph;52&hyph;009, Revision `B;' dated December 1, 1993. This alert
service bulletin describes procedures for reaming the passenger door latch pin fittings; installing a grease retainer,
greasing the tube and nipple assembly; and applying grease to the door latch pins and anti-ice compound to the door
outer handle mechanism. Accomplishment of this alert service bulletin will decrease the possibility of seizure
of the latching mechanism as a result of frost in the latch pins of the door.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Canadair Alert Service Bulletin S.B. A601R&hyph;52&hyph;021, Revision `A,' dated December 7, 1993. This alert
service bulletin describes procedures for reworking the passenger door outer handle mechanism, installing a waterproof
boot, and greasing the door. Accomplishment of this alert service bulletin will ensure that the outer handle mechanism
on the passenger door does not freeze during flight of the airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Canadair Service Bulletin S.B. 601R&hyph;11&hyph;007, dated December 1, 1993. This service bulletin describes
procedures for installing new placards on the passenger door structure to advise the crew that when a green witness
mark is visible, the latch pin is in the correct locked position.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transport Canada Aviation classified these service bulletins and alert service bulletins as mandatory and issued
Canadian Airworthiness Directive CF&hyph;93&hyph;02R1, dated March 31, 1994, in order to assure the continued
airworthiness of these airplanes in Canada.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in Canada and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the
provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, Transport Canada Aviation has kept the FAA informed
of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of Transport Canada Aviation, reviewed all available
information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for
operation in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require various modifications of the passenger doors.
The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the alert service bulletins and service bulletins
described previously.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 17 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
67 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour.
Required parts would cost approximately $10,945 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the
proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $254,405, or $14,965 per airplane.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES.

The Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class
E airspace at Saratoga, Wyoming, to accommodate a new instrument approach procedure at Shively Field Airport. The
area would be depicted on aeronautical charts for pilot reference. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based
on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace areas extending upward from 700 feet or more above the surface of the earth
are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective September 16, 1994, which is
incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class E airspace designation listed in this document would be published
subsequently in the Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On August 16, 1993, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``Commission'') published a notice of petitions for
exemptive relief submitted by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (``CME'') and the Board of Trade of the City of Chicago
(``CBOT'') and request for comment. The petitions requested exemptions from most of the requirements of the Commodity
Exchange Act (``CEA'' or ``Act'') and Commission regulations for certain exchange-traded futures and option contracts
pursuant to Section 4(c) of the Act, added October 28, 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The comment period closed December 15, 1993, and the Commission has carefully considered the comments received.
Based upon its review of the comments and its own consideration of the exemption requests, the Commission is proposing
rules which will permit certain contract market transactions (as defined herein) meeting specified criteria to
trade pursuant to exemption from certain requirements under the Act and Commission regulations on a section 4(c)
contract market. The Commission is also seeking comment on whether Part 35 (exemption of swap agreements) should
be amended to include stand-alone prohibitions on fraud and price manipulation.

I. Statutory Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 2(a)(1)(A) of the Act grants the Commission exclusive jurisdiction over ``accounts, agreements (including
any transaction which is of the character of *&blank;*&blank;* an 'option' *&blank;*&blank;*), and transactions
involving contracts of sale of a commodity for future delivery traded or executed on a contract market *&blank;*&blank;*
or any other board of trade, exchange, or market *&blank;*&blank;*'' 7 U.S.C. 2. The CEA and Commission regulations
require that transactions in commodity futures contracts and commodity option contracts, with narrowly defined
exceptions, occur on or subject to the rules of contract markets designated by the Commission.

Sections 4(a), 4c(b) and 4c(c) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 6(a), 6c(b), and 6c(c). Section 4(a) of the CEA specifically provides,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
, that it is unlawful to enter into a commodity futures contract that is not made ``on or subject to the rules of a board
of trade which has been designated by the Commission as a `contract market' for such commodity.'' 7 U.S.C. 6(a). This
prohibition does not apply to futures contracts made on or subject to the rules of a foreign board of trade, exchange
or market. 7 U.S.C. 6(a).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 28, 1992, the Futures Trading Practices Act of 1992 (``1992 Act'') was signed into law. P.L. No. 102&hyph;546.
This legislation added new subsections (c) and (d) to Section 4 of the Act. New Section 4(c)(1) authorizes the Commission,
by rule, regulation, or order, to exempt any agreement, contract or transaction, or class thereof, from the exchange-trading
requirements of Section 4(a) or any other requirement of the Act other than Section 2(a)(1)(B), 7 U.S.C. 2.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 New Section 4(c)(2) provides that the Commission may not grant an exemption from the exchange-trading requirement
of the Act unless, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the agreement, contract or transaction being exempted will be entered into solely between ``appropriate persons''
as defined in new Section 4(c)(3)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 subject to such limitations as may be deemed appropriate by the Commission, in the public interest.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In granting such an exemption, the Commission must also determine that the agreement, contract or transaction in
question will not have a material adverse effect on the ability of the Commission or any contract market to discharge
its regulatory or self-regulatory duties under the Act and that the exemption would be consistent with the public
interest and the purposes of the Act.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In vesting the Commission with this new exemptive authority, Congress recognized the need to create legal certainty
for instruments that may contain some features similar to those of regulated exchange-traded products but that are
sufficiently different in their purpose, function or design, or other characteristics such that traditional futures
regulation may be unnecessary.

Specifically, Section 4(c)(1), 7 U.S.C. 6(c)(1), provides: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to promote responsible economic or financial innovation and fair competition, the Commission by rule, regulation,
or order, after notice and opportunity for hearing, may (on its own initiative or on application of any person, including
any board of trade designated as a contract market for transactions for future delivery in any commodity under section
5 of this Act) exempt any agreement, contract, or transaction (or class thereof) that is otherwise subject to subsection
(a) (including any person or class of persons offering, entering into, rendering advice or rendering other services
with respect to, the agreement, contract, or transaction), either unconditionally or on stated terms or conditions
or for stated periods and either retroactively or prospectively, or both, from any of the requirements of subsection
(a), or from any other provision of this Act (except section 2(a)(1)(B)), if the Commission determines that the exemption
would be consistent with the public interest.

II. The Petitions for Exemptive Relief 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 16, 1993, the Commission published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a notice of petitions for exemption submitted by the CME and CBOT pursuant to Section 4(c) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 6(c),
and a request for comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
7
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In its petition, submitted on April 8, 1993 (and supplemented June 18, 1993), the CME sought an exemption from most
of the provisions of the Act and Commission regulations with regard to the purchase and sale of certain contracts denominated
by the CME as Rolling Spot
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
TM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 futures and options contracts (``Rolling Spot Contracts''). The CBOT's petition, submitted on June 30, 1993, requested
that the Commission establish a ``professional trading market exemption'' from most of the provisions of the Act
and regulations for trading in any instrument of the CBOT and other boards of trade, including those designated previously
as contract markets by the Commission. Under both petitions, trading in exempted instruments would have been limited
to certain participants, and trades would have been cleared through an exchange clearing system approved by the Commission.

comment on approximately 100 issues under the following general headings, corresponding to the determinations
that the Commission must make in order to grant an exemption under Section 4(c), 7 U.S.C. 6(c): (1) Whether the exemption
is consistent with the public interest and purposes of the Act; (2) whether the contracts to be exempted will be entered
into solely between ``appropriate persons'' as defined in Section 4(c)(3) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 6(c)(3); and (3) whether
the exemption will have a material adverse effect on the ability of the Commission or any contract market to discharge
its regulatory or self-regulatory duties under the Act.

In addition, on November 23, 1993, the Commission held a roundtable discussion, during which industry experts, including
representatives of end users and dealers in over-the-counter (``OTC'') and exchange-traded derivatives, presented
their views on the exchange petitions. A number of concerns were expressed regarding the way in which the exchanges'
``professional trading market'' would operate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There were three general sets of commenters: those who expressed unqualified support in favor of the petitions; those
who were generally in favor of the petitions but who thought they should be modified somewhat, either by limiting the
scope of the exemptions and/or by granting the exemptions on a trial basis; and those who were generally against the
petitions. The CME and the CBOT were joined by six other exchanges in expressing their support for the proposals. The
group in favor of the exemptions also included certain futures professionals and academics. The industry's views,
however, were not uniform. Futures trade associations as well as other futures professionals comprised the group
giving their qualified support to the CME and CBOT petitions. Those opposing the petitions largely consisted of regulatory
agencies, both foreign and domestic. In addition, portions of the petitions were criticized by some investment professionals.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those supporting the petitions generally believed that the exchanges are operating at a handicap in competing with
the OTC markets because of what they characterized as burdensome, costly, and unnecessary federal regulation. Removing
such regulation would, according to supporters, enhance the competitive posture of the U.S. exchanges in the world
marketplace. Supporters further asserted that professional and institutional traders do not require the same level
of regulatory protection as the small retail speculator. They argued that the Commission should treat transactions
occurring in centralized ``professional trading markets'' the same way that it did swaps, hybrids, and certain energy
transactions, all previously exempted from most or all of the provisions of the Act and Commission regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some supporters commented that the exemptions would allow flexible product development, the hallmark of the OTC
market, but in a far more structured regulatory environment. According to these commenters, exchange self-regulation
over derivatives is preferable to no market regulation, the present situation in connection with OTC transactions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those giving the petitions qualified support generally also endorsed permitting more flexible approaches than
the current designation process as well as enhancing the exchanges' ability to respond to the needs of sophisticated
and institutional market participants and competitive demands of the international marketplace. Nonetheless,
commenters in this category expressed concerns with the petitions, and highlighted the need to ensure the integrity
of both the non-exempt as well as the exempt markets, particularly with regard to financial requirements, customer
funds protections, trade practice rules, market surveillance, exchange governance, and the integrity of the clearing
system. In addition, some of these commenters were not thoroughly convinced that the rules for preventing fraud and
manipulation proposed by the CME and CBOT would be as effective as the current procedures.
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 The commenters further noted the importance of maintaining public confidence in the integrity of the futures markets.
Some emphasized that public markets like the CME and CBOT imply a comprehensive regulatory environment, including
the imposition of fitness standards for commodity professionals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
11
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, two commenters suggested that the CBOT's proposed antifraud rule might exceed the Commission's jurisdictional
scope. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, some commenters giving the petitions qualified support believed that the absence of defining criteria
for the proposed transactions made their evaluation of the potential consequences of the exchanges' petitions difficult.
Accordingly, commenters in this group generally recommended caution_either by limiting the commodities which
could be traded on a ``professional trading market'' or by granting the exemptions on a trial basis, or both. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters opposing the petitions, in particular other financial regulatory agencies, essentially contended
that the exemption proposals were too broad and lack sufficient justification. Specifically, according to some
commenters, the exchanges failed to make their case that approval of their proposals would be in the public interest.
They further argued that the exchanges have not presented evidence showing that the existing regulatory structure
is so harmful to competition that such broad relief is necessary in order for exchanges to compete effectively. Commenters
against the petitions contended that granting such broad exemptions may have unintended effects on market integrity,
in particular, unexpected consequences for the non-exempt markets and the safety of the clearing system.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters stated that although the exchanges have indicated that they do not intend to trade identical exempt
and non-exempt contracts, the theoretical possibility of allowing such two-tier trading would raise a number of
concerns, including the drain of liquidity from the non-exempt market and the resulting implications for price discovery,
the potential for manipulation, trading ahead, and other issues relating to the integrity of both the exempt and non-exempt
markets.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters further noted that Congress warned the Commission to use its new exemptive authority sparingly,
and not as a means of effecting wholesale deregulation of the futures markets. Commenters stated that, contrary to
the exchanges' assertions, there are distinctions between the OTC derivative markets (including the instruments
previously exempted by the Commission) and the contracts traded on the CME, CBOT, and other exchange markets. Whereas
swaps and other OTC derivatives are primarily dispersed, non-fungible, privately-negotiated, principal-to-principal
transactions in which individual credit determinations have been made about disclosed counterparties, exchange-traded
futures contracts are traded among anonymous counterparties and on an agency basis in a public market established
by a third party. Commenters in this category emphasized that an appropriate level of federal regulatory oversight
of exchange markets is necessary to maintain market integrity, and, moreover, that the need for such oversight is
not diminished by the exclusion of certain market participants since exchange regulation is designed to address
the characteristics of that market and many regulatory provisions are designed to protect the market itself. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, according to some commenters, the ultimate and the appropriate regulatory structure for OTC derivatives
is not settled; rather, Congress and financial regulators are reviewing the need for OTC derivatives regulation.
Some commenters asserted that the entire derivatives market requires more, not less, regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. The Proposed Rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In granting the Commission exemptive authority, Congress cautioned the Commission to use its authority ``sparingly''
and not as a way of prompting a ``wide-scale deregulation of markets falling within the ambit of the Act.''
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 In light of this admonition as well as the advice of commenters, in particular that of other financial regulators,
the Commission believes that the scope of the exchanges' petitions, which requested exemptive relief from most of
the provisions of the Act and regulations for all instruments traded by sophisticated participants, is too broad.
Notwithstanding the exchanges' assertions to the contrary, the Commission's previous exemptions for swaps, hybrids,
and certain energy contracts, granted shortly after the Commission was provided with exemptive authority,
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 cannot be equated with the exchanges' requests for exemptive relief. The previous exemptions, which followed extensive
periods of consideration of the issues raised by such instruments,

 arose out of a need specifically recognized by Congress to enhance the legal certainty as to the regulatory status
of those instruments. Each such exemption related to types of transactions that the Commission had previously found
to be beyond the scope of the CEA or unsuitable for regulation thereunder because of the nature of the transaction,
the parties, the applicability of other regulatory regimes or otherwise.

The Commission exempted from most provisions of the Act and regulations the following: (1) hybrid instruments that
are not predominantly composed of a commodity interest (17 CFR Part 34; 58 FR 5580 (Jan. 22, 1993)), (2) swap transactions
meeting certain criteria (17 CFR Part 35; 58 FR 5587 (Jan. 22, 1993)), and (3) certain contracts between commercial
participants for the deferred purchase or sale of energy products (58 FR 21286 (April 20, 1993)).

Each of the Commission's exemptions for swaps, hybrids, and energy products was a culmination of a deliberate and
cautious exercise by the Commission of its regulatory authority that spanned several years. Specifically, the Commission's
consideration of an appropriate regulatory approach for swaps began in December 1987 with the publication of an Advanced
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking which addressed a number of types of off-exchange instruments and which solicited
public comments on a wide range of issues. Subsequently, in July 1989, after a second notice-and-comment period,
the Commission issued a policy statement which established a safe harbor for swap agreements meeting certain specified
criteria. This was the foundation upon which the Commission ultimately adopted final rules in January 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission's examination of a regulatory approach with regard to hybrid instruments also began with the same
December 1987 Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and request for comments. Based upon the comments received
and its subsequent experience, the Commission in January 1989 proposed rules to exempt certain types of hybrid instruments
meeting specified criteria, and adopted a statutory interpretation which recognized an exclusion from regulation
for other types of hybrids. Following an extensive comment period on its proposed rules, the Commission adopted final
rules in July 1989. These rules and the statutory interpretation, together with the experience gained by the Commission
in administering them, served as the basis for the proposal and ultimate adoption by the Commission in January 1993,
pursuant to its new authority, of rules exempting certain hybrid instruments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, with respect to commercial contracts involving energy products, the Commission received inquiries concerning
the applicability of the Act to transactions of this type following the issuance of the judicial decision in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 738 F. Supp. 1472 (S.D.N.Y. 1990). In response, the Commission in September 1990 issued a statutory interpretation
taking the position that commercial transactions of this type which met certain criteria were excluded from regulation
under the Act as ``cash forward'' contracts. Following the enactment of the 1992 Act, the Commission in November 1992
received a petition for exemptive relief concerning similar transactions. In response, the Commission published
a proposed order which would provide exemptive relief to certain persons engaged in contracts involving energy products
that meet certain criteria and, following a public comment period, adopted a final order in this regard in April 1993.

In granting exemptive authority to the Commission under new Section 4(c), the Conferees on the 1992 Act recognized
the need to create legal certainty for a number of existing categories of instruments which traded outside the forum
of a designated contract market. These instruments were noted to contain some features similar to those of regulated
exchange-traded products but are sufficiently different in their purpose, function, design or other characteristics
that, as a matter of policy, traditional futures regulation and the limitation of trading to the floor of an exchange
may be unnecessary to protect the public interest and may create an inappropriate burden on commerce. H.R. Rep. No.
978, 102d Cong., 2d Sess. 80 (1992).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Moreover, the Commission does not subscribe to the exchanges' apparent view that there are no significant distinctions
between dispersed dealer and central auction markets that would be reflected in assessing the appropriate level
and manner of regulation of transactions undertaken in either forum or that should cause the Commission, in applying
the exemptive criteria of the Act, to treat OTC and central exchange products identically. This is true irrespective
of whether further regulation of the dealer market may be found, as a result of ongoing inquiries, to be desirable.
The federal regulation of futures exchange markets dates from 1922. In 1974, Congress expressly expanded coverage
of the CEA to ``all services, rights and interests in which contracts for future delivery are presently or in the future
dealt in,'' to assure that the prices generally quoted and disseminated from those contracts could be used as a fair
basis for determining consumer and producer prices.
<FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>
 To reflect the public interest in the appropriate functioning of price discovery markets and to assure market integrity
and customer protection, a number of regulatory protections are currently required. These requirements reflect
the fact that exchange transactions are conducted between anonymous counterparties and support the financial integrity
of such transactions with marking-to-market, daily or more frequent cash settlement, segregation of customer funds,
capital requirements, margin, recordkeeping and inspection rules, and clearing guarantees.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Thus, the fact that a centralized market is composed solely of institutional or ``sophisticated'' participants
does not obviate the need to ensure market integrity, price dissemination, and adequate protections against fraud,
manipulation, and other trading abuses by continued Commission regulation and oversight. In this regard, the term
``institutional'' may encompass customers with a wide range of financial experience, acumen and resources. The
Commission believes, moreover, that the Act and Commission regulations serve a vital function, even where such a
market includes only sophisticated participants, in that the regulatory requirements substitute for individualized
credit determinations and permit increased access to the markets by secondary participants and customers. Further,
a premise of the CEA for over 70 years has been that all traders require not only an efficient, but also a fair marketplace
in which to trade, which Congress has previously determined to be best effectuated by a regulatory framework in which
federal regulation is paramount. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, notwithstanding the exchanges' arguments to the contrary, since the enactment of the CEA the exchanges
have grown and thrived, not despite, but at least in part, because of the regulatory scheme under which they operate
and the resulting public confidence in the fairness of the markets. The Commission agrees with the commenters who
stated that regulatory safeguards promote public confidence in the integrity of the markets, confidence likely
to be eroded without federal oversight. Accordingly, the Commission is not convinced that a broad exemption of the
kind requested by the exchanges is in the public interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nevertheless, the Commission has in the past taken into account in fashioning its regulations, granting exemptions,
and establishing policies, whether the general public is excluded from a market or transaction or is permitted to
participate. The Commission considers the exclusion of non-sophisticated market participants as the single most
important rationale supporting the various forms of relief proposed herein. The proposed relief from certain aspects
of exchange regulation should enhance the exchanges' ability to innovate and their competitive posture. Indeed,
the Commission is cognizant, as the exchanges and other commenters noted, that its exemptive authority is ``intended
to promote responsible economic and financial innovation and fair competition.''

 In issuing its study on U.S. market competitiveness, the Commission stated that it was committed to keeping its regulatory
programs under continuous review to assure that ``consistent with our responsibilities for market integrity and
customer protection, they: (1) keep pace with changes in the marketplace; and (2) do not unnecessarily impede domestic
exchanges from evolving to remain competitive, especially with regard to the cost of compliance relative to non-U.S.
exchanges.''

To that end, the Commission recognizes that some regulatory controls, such as certain procedures for Commission
review and approval of new instruments, could be streamlined in order to facilitate the introduction of products
and the on-exchange offering of more varied contract designs. More flexibility to permit some customizing of exchange-traded
products also may attract certain institutional participants for which the efficiency of exchange markets and other
protections they afford may be preferable to off-exchange transactions where prices are often opaque and credit
risk is a more profound issue. The Commission also believes that exchange transactions traded by professional traders
may not require the full panoply of regulatory requirements. In that regard, the Commission believes that a more flexible
approach to risk disclosure for products offered to sophisticated market participants may be preferable to existing
requirements. In addition, the Commission preliminarily agrees with the commenters who suggested that certain
registration requirements could be streamlined for professional traders licensed with other financial regulators
to facilitate new entrants to the exchange markets by persons currently selling OTC products to sophisticated customers.
Finally, the Commission preliminarily believes that the long-standing traditional requirements of open and competitive
trading could be relaxed for sophisticated, eligible participants in order to facilitate the execution of large
orders, as long as appropriate post-trade transparency, customer, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other market protections from trading abuses are maintained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these reasons, after reviewing the exchanges' petitions and the general comments, the Commission is proposing
to test some ways of giving the exchanges flexibility and greater latitude in order to enhance their ability to devise
innovative responses both to other centralized and to less regulated, non-centralized markets. The Commission
believes that the exemptive relief that it is proposing preserves regulatory safeguards but also acknowledges that
non-centralized markets have a far lower regulatory burden and that several comparable markets of other jurisdictions
provide certain trading mechanism concessions not currently afforded the U.S. futures markets. In that regard,
the Commission proposes a new Part 36, which exempts contracts termed ``section 4(c) contract market transactions''
meeting specified criteria from certain specific requirements and regulations under the Act. There are four main
proposed limitations on the exemption: (1) The duration, (2) the scope, (3) the persons who are eligible to enter into
the transactions, and (4) the transactions which may trade as section 4(c) contract market transactions. The Commission
believes that this proposal strikes the appropriate balance between the need to detect and deter abuses and the need
for an innovative central market tailored to the needs of sophisticated and institutional market participants.
The Commission requests comments concerning the specifics of the proposed criteria for the transactions as well
as the proposed provisions from which the transactions will be exempt.

A. Duration and Scope of Exemption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In &sect;36.1(a), the Commission proposes to implement the exemption under a three-year pilot program. The pilot
program is designed to give the exchanges and the Commission a trial period to test the operation of the exemption.
More importantly, it affords the Commission an opportunity to determine the effect of section 4(c) contract market
transactions on the integrity of the marketplace as a whole and whether continued trading under the exemption would
be in the public interest. The trial nature of the program reflects the Commission's belief that the exemption constitutes
a significant departure from the regulatory scheme under which futures and option contracts have been trading for
over 70 years. The Commission believes that the pilot program will enable the Commission to obtain sufficient data
on which to base a permanent program. In this regard, at the conclusion of the pilot program, the Commission intends
to evaluate section 4(c) contract market transactions exempted by this Part in order to determine whether to extend
the exemptive relief granted herein, and whether it would be appropriate to alter the requirements of this Part or
expand the exemptive relief provided to other transactions or markets. The Commission requests comment specifically
addressed to whether a pilot program is feasible and appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;36.1(b) sets forth the scope of the exemption. It states that each board of trade on which section 4(c)
contract market transactions are traded is deemed to be a contract market and must comply with all provisions of the
Act and Commission regulations, including the requirement of a clearing facility subject to Commission oversight,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
20
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 except for those provisions which are ``specifically inconsistent'' with Part 36. Moreover, new markets that seek
to use this exemption must submit all rules relative to governance, disciplinary proceedings, financial requirements,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et cetera,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 under the current provisions of Section 5a(a)(12) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 7a(12). Therefore, the Commission intends
that section 4(c) contract market transactions trade pursuant to the following provisions: 36.3 (trading rules),
36.4 (listing of transactions), 36.5 (reporting requirements), 36.6 (registration requirements), 36.7 (risk
disclosure), and 36.9 (fraud and manipulation). Except where specifically indicated in Part 36, the provisions
of Part 36 govern in lieu of the provisions of the Act and Commission regulations that would otherwise apply to futures
and option transactions. Thus, these provisions of Part 36, explained in detail below, constitute the scope of the
exemption for section 4(c) contract market transactions; all other provisions of the Act and Commission rules, including,
among other things, segregation, net capital, supervision, bankruptcy, exchange emergency actions, availability
of reparations, and private rights of action, would continue to apply. In any submission under proposed Part 36, a
contract market should specify those provisions of the Act and Commission rules which the contract market deems to
be specifically inconsistent with the contract market rules being submitted. The Commission requests comments
concerning the scope of the exemption.

1.41(a)(3), 17 CFR 1.41(a)(3) (1994). The term ``contract market'' includes a clearing organization that clears
trades for the contract market. The Commission does not intend to alter this aspect of the markets it regulates by virtue
of this proposal.

In proposed &sect;36.1(b), the Commission does not intend to limit contract markets in section 4(c) contract market
transactions to current contract markets or exchanges. In order to qualify, such an entity would be treated similarly
to a board of trade seeking an initial designation as a contract market. In addition, under the structure of the Act,
the Commission's regulations, and this exemption, any entity wishing to offer a facility for trading section 4(c)
contract market transactions would be required to become a contract market in these transactions.

B. Appropriate Persons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In considering the persons that may enter into section 4(c) contract market transactions, that is, ``eligible participants,''
the Commission is proposing to use a list of ``appropriate persons'' modeled on the list set forth in Section 4(c)(3)
(A) through (J) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 6(c)(3) (A) through (J), with revisions tailored to this particular market and
reflecting the Commission's experience in applying similar concepts in other exemptions. In this regard, the Commission
is requesting comment whether these proposed requirements should be applied to the Commission's previously-granted
exemptions as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of note is that under proposed &sect;36.1(c)(1), all eligible participants may enter into section 4(c) contract
market transactions for their own accounts; in addition, futures commission merchants (``FCMs'') and floor brokers
may trade section 4(c) contract market transactions on behalf of other eligible participants. In addition, under
proposed &sect;36.1(c)(2)(vii), the Commission is intending to limit eligible employee benefit plans to those
with total assets exceeding $5 million 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (rather than the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``or'' provided in Section 4(c)(3)(G) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 6(c)(3)(G)) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whose investment decisions are made by a bank, trust company, insurance company, investment adviser under the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940, or a commodity trading advisor under the CEA. In this regard, the Commission specifically seeks
comment concerning whether there is an asset level for such employee benefit plans which should qualify them as an
eligible participant irrespective of whether their investment decisions are made by a bank, trust company, insurance
company, investment adviser or commodity trading advisor. In addition, in the context of proposed &sect;36.1(c)(2)(viii),
the Commission seeks comment on whether municipalities should be included as ``eligible participants,'' and, if
so, what, if any, limitations would be appropriate in this context. Finally, the Commission is interested in comments
addressing whether the list of appropriate persons as proposed would exclude any individuals, entities, collective
investment vehicles or others who should be considered suitable to engage in section 4(c) contract market transactions,
and in particular whether Part 36 should be conformed to Part 35 in this regard.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4(c)(3)(K) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 6(c)(3)(K), also authorizes the Commission to determine other persons to
be ``appropriate persons'' for section 4(c) contract market transactions in light of their financial or other qualifications,
or if appropriate regulatory protections are applicable. The Commission is therefore proposing under &sect;36.1(c)(2)(xi)
to permit persons, including natural persons, to enter into section 4(c) contract market transactions provided
their total assets exceed $10 million. The Commission requests comments specifically addressed to whether these
thresholds are appropriate and whether any additional or different financial criteria (such as net worth standards)
should be added to any other category of ``eligible participants'' and, if so, whether part 36 should be conformed
to part 35. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is proposing, in Rule 36.1(c)(2)(x), to include floor brokers and floor traders within the class of
``appropriate persons'' that may participate in section 4(c) contract market transactions. Furthermore, proposed
Rule 36.1(c)(1) would permit floor brokers to enter into section 4(c) contract market transactions on behalf of other
eligible participants. The Commission is not proposing separate financial standards for eligible floor brokers
and floor traders at this time based upon its understanding that each such participant would, by necessity, be a member
in good standing of the section 4(c) contract market whose transactions thereon would be guaranteed by an exchange
clearing member. The Commission seeks comment on whether it should make a requirement of a clearing member guarantee
explicit in the rule and whether it should impose separate financial requirements on floor brokers and floor traders.

C. Transactions Eligible to Trade 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;36.2 establishes the breadth of the exemption, delineating those transactions eligible to trade
as section 4(c) contract market transactions. In that sense, proposed &sect;36.2 modifies the broad definition
of section 4(c) contract market transactions set forth in proposed &sect;36.1(c)(1). Proposed &sect;36.2(a)(1)
provides that except for a major foreign currency, the transaction must be settled either in cash, at a price that meets
the existing Commission requirements for cash-settled contracts set forth in Guideline No. 1, 17 CFR part 5, Appendix
A, ``or by means other than the transfer or receipt of any commodity.'' The phrase ``or by means other than the transfer
or receipt of any commodity'' would permit the delivery of a subsequent contractual agreement, such as a subsequent
position in a swaps agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;36.2(a)(2) states that the transaction must be cleared through a clearing organization subject
to Commission oversight, a provision originally part of the CME and CBOT's petition for exemptive relief. The rules
of clearing organizations subject to Commission oversight as adjuncts to contract markets must be submitted to the
Commission pursuant to section 5a(a)(12) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 7a(12).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
21
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Additionally, as the result of section 4d(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 6d(2), such organizations must settle accounts or
positions daily. The rules would require section 4(c) contract market transactions to be separately identified
on the books of the participant in clearing records to facilitate surveillance of these transactions.

Proposed &sect;36.2(a)(3) prohibits section 4(c) contract market transactions on the agricultural commodities
enumerated in section 1a of the Act, except for contracts on a broad-based index thereof. In this regard, the Commission
notes that it did not provide specifically for an exemption from Commission rules concerning speculative position
limits. Under Rule 150.2, 17 CFR 150.2 (1994), the Commission directly administers position limits for futures contracts
on those agricultural commodities. Commission Rule 1.61, 17 CFR 1.61 (1994), requires contract markets to adopt
speculative position limits for futures and option contracts which do not have Commission-set speculative limits.
While in theory Rule 1.61 would apply to section 4(c) contract market transactions, the exemption from that requirement,
1.61(e), 17 CFR 1.61(e) (1994), has been interpreted flexibly to permit the exchanges to substitute for speculative
position limits various position accountability rules for certain futures and option contracts.

 Therefore, the exchanges have already been afforded substantial flexibility in this area. In addition, additional
flexibility in this regard would be afforded by proposed Rule 36.3 which should permit exempt contract markets to
implement trading rules more expeditiously and without formal approval by the Commission. The Commission requests
comment on whether any further relief is appropriate for section 4(c) contract market transactions.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In &sect;36.2(a)(4), the Commission is proposing to limit section 4(c) contract market transactions to those transactions
which can ``reasonably be distinguished'' from futures or option contracts designated by the Commission for trading
on a traditional contract market at the time of application to trade a section 4(c) contract market transaction. The
distinguishing factors are described in relation to the contract's hedging function and/or pricing basis. The Commission
will base determinations as to whether section 4(c) contract market transactions are ``reasonably distinguished''
from traditional designated futures and option contracts on the same considerations that it now applies in deciding
whether proposed new futures and options contracts shall be treated as separate designation applications. Proposed
&sect;36.2(a)(4) is intended to address, among other things, the concerns expressed by some commenters regarding
the problems of a two-tier marketplace. Although the CME and CBOT have indicated that they do not intend to trade the
same contract on both a section 4(c) contract market and a traditional contract market, this provision would prevent
a section 4(c) contract market transaction from trading if a traditional contract were already trading on any existing
contract market. A section 4(c) contract market transaction could potentially be submitted for designation for
traditional trading. If so, the full 5a(a)(12) process, including publication for comment, would be followed and
further attention directed to whether delisting as a section 4(c) contract market transaction would be required.
As a consequence, the concern of side-by-side trading of identical contracts subject to different trading regimes
without further review is addressed by this proposal. General disclosure obligations nonetheless would require
purveyors of section 4(c) contract market transactions to clarify that different rules are applicable to those transactions
than for transactions traded pursuant to traditional requirements.

Under proposed &sect;36.2(a)(4), the Commission contemplates that a broad array of contracts would be eligible
for section 4(c) contract market transactions. Thus, the following are examples of potentially permissible section
4(c) contract market transactions in that they are cash-settled and can reasonably be distinguished from currently
designated futures and options contracts: (1) Newly-issued 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds, which are cash-settled
based on either cash transaction prices or firm quotes obtained from electronic information vendors; (2) six-month
London interbank offered rates (LIBOR), which are cash-settled based on a survey of British Bankers Association
rates; and (3) two-year interest rate swaps, which are cash-settled based on a survey of swap dealers to obtain the
rates they are willing to pay or to receive for fixed-rate payments on generic two-year swaps, given a specified notional
amount.

The Commission notes that while these specific, hypothetical contracts can reasonably be distinguished from currently
designated futures and option contracts and therefore permitted to trade under these proposed rules, that may not
necessarily be true at the time a board of trade applies to trade a specific section 4(c) contract market transaction.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, proposed &sect;36.2(a)(4) provides for certain specific contracts to be eligible section 4(c) contract
market transactions. First, flexible commodity options, which trade under contract market option rules, but are
not separately designated, may trade as section 4(c) contract market transactions.

 Contracts, the subject of the CME's petition for exemptive relief, as well as five- and ten-year interest rate swaps

as section 4(c) contract market transactions.

Eligible swaps contracts include the contract markets of the CBOT which the Commission designated in cash-settled
three- and five-year interest rate SWAP (IR-SWAP) futures contracts on January 29, 1991. Options based on those futures
contracts were approved by the Commission on February 26, 1991. On September 4, 1992, the Commission approved amendments
submitted by the CBOT to convert the three-year IR-SWAP contracts to 10-year IR-SWAP contracts.

Finally, proposed &sect;36.2(a)(5) provides that any transaction subject to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
2, including stock index futures contracts, is not within the scope of the exemptive rules. Because of special considerations
applicable to such transactions, including the approval procedures of Section 2(a)(1)(B), the Commission believes
that such contracts may not be appropriate for exemption under the proposed rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission requests comment on whether the proposed restrictions on section 4(c) contract market transactions
are appropriate.

D. Section 4(c) Contract Market Trading Rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed Section 36.3, which permits a board of trade to submit for Commission approval trading procedures for section
4(c) contract market transactions, is intended to facilitate trading in section 4(c) contract market transactions
which do not comply in all respects with certain Commission regulations setting forth trading standards and related
recordkeeping requirements for an open outcry double auction trading environment. In general, Section 36.3 is intended
to permit, subject to certain conditions, section 4(c) contract market transactions to trade pursuant to innovative
trading strategies which may not satisfy existing competitive trading requirements and other trading standards
relative to the exposure of orders and trades. In proposing &sect;36.3 the Commission intends to provide the flexibility
for transactions in a section 4(c) contract market to occur either on the exchange floor, off the floor, or in both locales
subject to immediate post-trade reporting and clearing requirements. The Commission regulations for which exchange
alternatives could be submitted include Regulations 1.35, 1.38(a), 1.39, 155.2, 155.3, and 155.4, 17 CFR 1.35, 1.38(a),
1.39, 155.2, 155.3 and 155.4 (1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed Section 36.3 represents a substantial change in the assumptions underlying the method of trading futures
and options contracts. Section 4c(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 6c(a), enumerates certain trading practices which are prohibited,
namely, wash sales, cross trades, accommodation trades, and fictitious sales.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
26
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission has viewed the ``common denominator'' of the abuses prohibited by Section 4c(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
6c(a), as the ``use of trading techniques that give the appearance of submitting trades to the open market'' while
in reality ``negating the risk or price competition incident to such a market.''

The Commission has shown some flexibility in the methods it has permitted to implement this competitive execution
requirement. Historically, execution of orders in the futures industry has been conducted by open outcry on the floor
of an exchange. The Commission has indicated, however, that other methods are acceptable under the Act. In this regard,
in 1989, the Commission approved trading on GLOBEX, an electronic computerized trading system for trading futures
and options contracts after regular hours. Under GLOBEX, trading is generally conducted on computer terminals through
a competitive auction process pursuant to an algorithm, under which orders at the best prices would be executed first.
Each terminal provides an equal opportunity for obtaining order execution.

The principal statutory basis for Regulation 1.39 is Section 4b(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 6b (as amended 1992), which
addresses simultaneous buying and selling orders of different principals. The provision states that such orders
can be executed ``at the market price,'' but requires that the orders be executed ``on the floor of the exchange'' and
``at public outcry across the ring.'' The Commission stated that the legislative history of this provision indicates
that its purpose was to ensure that one order was not disadvantaged to the benefit of the other order or that both orders
were not disadvantaged to the benefit of the broker. According to the Commission, since the statute did not prescribe
the way in which this was to be accomplished, the Commission had the discretion to craft an appropriate method or methods
``to provide for the protection of customers in this area,'' including the discretion to amend Rule 1.39. 56 FR at 12338.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;36.3 goes beyond LOX in that it not only allows off-floor discussion prior to execution but also allows
execution without exposing the trades to the pit. In proposing a means of permitting these procedures, it is the Commission's
intention to provide a way for exchanges to develop new trading procedures and standards intended to address the needs
of their increasingly institutional market participants. The Commission did not attempt to describe whether there
should be other limits on the procedures as it had no specific proposals to change pending methodologies before it
and wanted to leave the exchanges free to develop designs consistent with the parameters set forth herein.

 This also reflects the Commission's willingness to experiment through a pilot program with rules that relax, for
certain market participants, the traditional Commission requirements for competitive trading. Specifically,
the approach taken affords those participants the opportunity to execute large transactions with greater immediacy
than might be available under existing contract market trading procedures. The Commission preliminarily believes
that by permitting section 4(c) contract market participants to trade in this manner, the futures exchanges' ability
to draw institutional participants to the more transparent exchange (as opposed to OTC) markets will be enhanced.

At the same time, however, the Commission is concerned with maintaining essential market and appropriate customer
protections. Therefore, it is proposing regulatory safeguards with which the exchanges must comply in formulating
any innovative trading procedures. Proposed &sect;36.3(b) lists those requirements which must be satisfied by
a contract market seeking to establish such rules for section 4(c) contract market transactions. In this connection,
the Commission requests comment as to whether additional or different requirements should apply.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
First, transactions generally must satisfy Commission recordkeeping and audit trail requirements. Proposed paragraph
(b)(1) of Rule 36.3 requires the contract market to provide for record maintenance and retention consistent with
Regulation 1.31, 17 CFR 1.31 (1994). Under proposed &sect;36.3(b)(2), the audit trail for such transactions must
meet the trade register, trade timing, and contract market oversight requirements in Regulations 1.35(e), (g),
and (i), 17 CFR 1.35(e), (g), and (i) (1994), respectively. In addition, the recordkeeping requirements set forth
in Regulation 1.38(b), 17 CFR 1.38(b) (1994), for noncompetitive trades and the audit trail documentation required
under the other provisions of Regulation 1.35, 17 CFR 1.35 (1994), must be satisfied to the extent they are applicable
to the subject trading procedures.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A contract market must demonstrate in a clear and convincing manner that these and any other regulations referenced
in paragraph (b) that it believes are inapplicable to its proposed trading procedures are, in fact, inapplicable.

For example, Regulation 1.35, 17 CFR 1.35 (1994), provides for two orders, an office order (1.35(a&hyph;1)(1)) and
a floor order (1.35(a&hyph;1)(2)(i)). A contract market's proposed procedures may render the requirement for a
floor order inapplicable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Second, the Commission is proposing to maintain customer protection standards. Commission Regulations 155.2,
155.3, and 155.4, 17 CFR 155.2, 155.3 and 155.4 (1994), set forth customer protection trading standards for floor
brokers, FCMs, and introducing brokers (``IBs'') respectively. Under proposed &sect;36.3(b)(3), the contract
market's proposed procedures must comply with these provisions to the extent they are applicable.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
For example, Regulation 155.2, 17 CFR 155.2 (1994), sets forth standards for floor brokers. If, however, under proposed
section 4(c) contract market trading rules, a function analogous to that of a floor broker does not exist, that rule
would not apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Third, the transactions must be transparent. The Commission is proposing in paragraphs (b)(4) and (b)(5) of Rule
36.3 certain requirements for the reporting and identifying of section 4(c) market transactions after they are executed.
Specifically, in addition to the trade recordation requirements listed above, the transactions are to be reported
immediately to the floor of the exchange and are to be disseminated immediately on the relevant market floor, trading
screen, and/or vendor services through the exchange's market quotation system. Records must be maintained of the
time of execution to this end.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
40
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The information to be so reported must include, at a minimum, price, quantity, and contract. To the extent that a proposal
for section 4(c) contract market transactions might provide for trading when the exchange floor is closed, the Commission
would still require the immediate report and dissemination of that transaction information. Brokers engaging in
such transactions will need to have supervisory procedures in place reasonably designed to achieve such post-trade
transparency. The Commission believes that these proposed requirements to report and specifically identify section
4(c) contract market transactions will provide the public with notice of the way in which the prices in this market
have been reached. As such, persons relying on these prices for price basing purposes will have the opportunity to
take that information into account. The Commission requests comment on these requirements.

records.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Fourth, the Commission is proposing requirements intended to ensure the financial integrity of the transactions.
Proposed paragraph (b)(5) of Rule 36.3 requires section 4(c) contract market trading rules to provide that section
4(c) contract market transactions be reported to clearing and be cleared by the contract market on the same schedule
as required for trades subject to Regulations 1.38 and 1.39. Should there be no such schedule, then the report to clearing
must be immediate. The Commission requests comment as to whether clearing procedures should be further articulated
in that case. In this connection, the Commission notes that the clearing arrangements would be subject to Commission
oversight and that proposed clearing rules would require prior Commission review under Section 5a(a)(12)(A) of
the Act, 7 U.S.C. 7a(12), and Regulation 1.41, 17 CFR 1.41 (1994). The section 4(c) contract market clearing organization
would have an affirmative duty under the Act and Commission regulations to enforce its rules, and would be subject
to recordkeeping, document retention, and other applicable requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to NYSE market surveillance staff, block trades are not separately identified as such on the exchange's
audit trail/time and sales register. However, NYSE would be able to ascertain whether a trade is a block trade by contacting
the transacting members, each of whom must keep a record reflecting which of its trades are blocks. Interestingly,
while not separately identifying block trades in its audit trail, NYSE and its vendors do have a separate ``block trade''
ticker which runs throughout the day reflecting size and price of block trades alone. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission requests comment on whether to require the dissemination of separate pricing information for block
trades. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to proposed paragraph (c), any submission made hereunder for proposed section 4(c) contract market transactions
must describe fully the contract market procedures and systems that will assure compliance with Sections 4b and 4c(a)
of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 6b and 6c(a), with respect to prohibitions on abuse of customer orders, including frontrunning
of such orders, misuse of information, and wash sales and fictitious trades. This provision reflects, among other
things, the Commission's continuing concern that customer orders receive appropriate priority and that trading
between markets or locations does not cause distortions in prices or provide advantages to one class or user of the
markets over others. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this connection, proposed paragraph (g) of Rule 36.3 states that trades entered into in compliance with section
4(c) contract market trading rules shall not be in violation of Sections 4b(a)(iv), 4b(b) or 4c(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
6b(D), 6b or 6c(a), ``based solely on having been executed noncompetitively.'' Failure to comply explicitly with
such contract market rules will render the conduct involved subject to Commission action under Sections 4b and 4c(a)
of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 6b and 6c(a), and Regulations 1.38 and 1.39, 17 CFR 1.38 and 1.39 (1994), in addition to any other
applicable provisions of the Act and Regulations.

further provides that any modification to the terms and conditions of a section 4(c) contract market transaction
shall be submitted to the Commission. Such modification shall be subject to the same procedures applicable to the

As noted above, a board of trade which is not currently an exchange must first get initial designation as a contract
market pursuant to Sections 5 and 5a of the Act (other than Section 5a(a)(12), which sets forth the procedures for Commission
approval of terms and conditions of contracts and contract market rules). An initial designation generally requires
the Commission to review and approve the applicant's core rules regarding, among other things, clearing, governance,
and discipline.

Section 2(a)(8)(B)(ii) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 4a(g), allows forty-five days for the Department of the Treasury and the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to comment on any application by a board of trade for designation as
a contract market involving transactions for the future delivery of any security issued or guaranteed by the United
States or any agency thereof. In light of the ten-day time frame for new filings and amendments, the Commission intends
to waive Section 2(a)(8)(B)(ii) for section 4(c) contract market transactions. The Commission requests comment
on waiving this provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This limited, ten-day advance notice period for new filings and for amendments to existing terms and conditions is
designed to remove potential impediments to the development of new products which are eligible for the proposed section
4(c) contract market transactions. The Commission believes that a streamlined approach will not only give the exchanges
flexibility but also will permit them to launch new products rapidly to meet the competitive demands of the marketplace
and to take advantage of opportunities in a fast-changing market. This procedure is limited to certain cash-settled
contracts in order to avoid issues related to delivery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the proposed ten-day notification requirement for section 4(c) contract market transactions does not
contemplate the same level of prior Commission review and approval of terms and conditions as is required by Commission
Rule 1.41(b), 17 CFR 1.41(b) (1994), for contracts traded on traditional contract markets, the Commission has continuing
authority to ensure that section 4(c) contract market transactions remain consistent with the public interest and
the purposes of the Act. In this regard, proposed &sect;36.8 provides that the Commission can suspend or revoke an
exemption if it fails to meet these requirements.

The Commission is proposing that contract markets, FCMs, and large traders who conduct section 4(c) contract market
transactions comply with certain reporting requirements similar to those currently in effect for persons trading
in non-exempt commodity futures and/or options. These requirements are being proposed in lieu of the requirements
set forth in Parts 16, 17, 18, and 19 of the Commission regulations, 17 CFR Parts 16, 17, 18, and 19 (1994).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Reporting Requirements for Contract Markets
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is proposing in &sect;&sect;36.5 (c)(1) and (e) that contract markets operating pursuant to this
section provide information daily to the Commission and to the public concerning total open interest, transactions,
and prices for each commodity or type of contract similar to that required under Rule 16.01 for non-exempt futures
and options. This information is intended to give the Commission an overview of the size and development of these markets
and provide potential participants with important information concerning the depth and breadth of the markets as
well as the opportunity to compare transaction prices against other markets trading the same commodity. In addition,
in &sect;36.5(c)(2), the Commission is proposing that contract markets provide open interest and transaction information
for each clearing member similar to that required under Rule 16.00, 17 CFR 16.00 (1994). This information is necessary
for market surveillance, providing needed input into the Commission's financial monitoring system for clearing
member FCMs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Last, in &sect;36.5(c)(3), the Commission is proposing that contract markets supply information concerning large
traders conducting section 4(c) contract market transactions, but only on call by the Commission. In order to ensure
that the financial integrity protections currently provided by using such reports are maintained, the Commission
anticipates that contract markets trading section 4(c) contract market transactions will by rule require members
to file daily reports concerning accounts carried by large traders similar to the information now provided by FCMs,
clearing members, and foreign brokers under Rules 16.02, 17.00, and 17.02, 17 CFR 16.02, 17.00, and 17.02 (1994),
for large traders in non-exempt futures and options. The Commission will rely on contract markets to define, subject
to Commission approval, position levels at which a trader is considered large. Under this proposal, the Commission
would monitor the development of the markets to determine if and when it would require that the contract markets submit
large trader reports. If these exempt contract markets develop rapidly, the Commission may require large trader
reports on a daily basis to augment the information it currently receives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is proposing that all information, with the exception of account identification forms, be provided
in machine-readable form using a format and coding structure approved in writing by the Commission or its designee.
Contract markets currently provide option and futures data pursuant to similar requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Reporting Requirements for FCMs, Introducing Brokers and Traders
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is proposing to incorporate into &sect;36.5 the provisions of Commission Rules 15.05 and Part 21,
17 CFR 15.05 and Part 21 (1994). Section 15.05 states that any FCM who makes or causes to be made any futures or option
contract for the account of any foreign broker or foreign trader, and any IB who introduces such an account to an FCM
is deemed to be the agent of the foreign broker or the foreign trader for purposes of accepting delivery and service
of any communication issued by or on behalf of the Commission to the foreign broker or the foreign trader with respect
to any futures or option contracts maintained in such accounts carried by the FCM.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

information from foreign traders for market surveillance purposes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The FCM or IB is considered an agent only if the foreign broker or trader has not duly executed or does not maintain a written
agency agreement with a person domiciled in the United States. 17 CFR 15.05(d) (1994).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The provisions of Part 21 provide that FCMs, IBs, foreign brokers, and foreign traders must furnish on call by the Commission
certain information concerning their futures and options trading. Special calls under Part 21 may be made to obtain
market-wide summary information on demographics and market uses of participants (&sect;&sect;21.02 and 21.02a,
17 CFR 21.02 and 21.02a (1994)) or, in the case of special market situations (&sect;21.03, 17 CFR 21.03 (1994)), when
information is needed about all, rather than only reportable, traders in a market. The Commission believes that it
is important to retain this authority with respect to participants operating under Part 36 so that the Commission
can make informed decisions and take appropriate action as special situations warrant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is also proposing that eligible participants in section 4(c) contract market transactions be subject
to requirements similar to those contained in &sect;&sect;18.00, 18.04, and 18.05, 17 CFR 18.00, 18.04, and 18.05
(1994), for large futures and options traders trading in the non-exempt market. The requirements proposed in &sect;36.5(f)
paragraphs (2) (i) and (ii) would require large traders to file, on call by the Commission, information concerning
their positions and transactions in the subject market as well as identifying and other information contained on
CFTC Form 40. Proposed &sect;36.5(f)(1) would require large traders to maintain books and records concerning section
4(c) contract market transactions and commercial activities that the trader hedges in the commodity underlying
such transactions. Reports concerning these transactions and activities would have to be furnished on request to
the Commission or the U.S. Department of Justice.

G. Special Temporary License, Registration or Principal Listing Procedures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is also proposing, in &sect;36.6, to allow special procedures that would be available to a person associated
with an FCM or IB who limits his or her activities to certain specified instruments. If this rule were to be adopted,
the Commission would expect to set forth in an Appendix A to Part 36 those instruments to which the special registration
procedures would apply. An instrument would be included in such an Appendix A only upon petition by a contract market
demonstrating that it is not contrary to the purpose of the Act and the registration rules promulgated thereunder
or to the public interest to permit special temporary license, registration or principal listing procedures for
persons licensed with another federal financial regulatory authority and involved only with that instrument. Although
to obtain a temporary license, such persons would have to certify that they are not subject to statutory disqualification
under Section 8a(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 12a(2), the National Futures Association (``NFA'') could, for example, waive
the fingerprint requirement. Further, the Commission notes that although proficiency testing requirements are
governed by NFA Rules 401 and 402 and interpretive notices related thereto, such a contract market petition could
also address whether alternative proficiency testing requirements would be appropriate. Registration, of course,
could continue to be denied under Sections 8a(3) or 8a(4) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 12a(3) or 12a(4). If the Commission were
to approve the contract market petition, NFA could then adopt and submit for Commission approval special registration
procedures to govern those persons involved only with the particular instrument that is the subject of the petition.
The Commission, nonetheless, wishes to make clear that a contract market seeking special registration procedures
with respect to persons limiting their activities to a particular new instrument may consult with NFA and develop
such procedures to be submitted in conjunction with the contract market application for simultaneous consideration
by the Commission. Such NFA rules could vary depending upon the instrument involved and would be considered by the
Commission on a case-by-case basis. The Commission would expect to include in Appendix A to Part 36 those instruments
covered by the pending petitions of the CBOT and the CME to which Part 36 applies. This authority would be comparable
to that already established under Part 3 of the Commission's regulations.

H. Risk Disclosure
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is proposing, in &sect;36.7, to permit accounts to be opened for section 4(c) contract market transactions
without furnishing an eligible participant with the basic risk disclosure statements applicable generally to non-exempt
futures and option contracts under Commission Rules 1.55, 1.65, 33.7, and 190.10, 17 CFR 1.55, 1.65, 33.7, and 190.10
(1994), or the Commission's newly-adopted generic risk disclosure statement.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
46
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 These basic risk disclosure statements are intended to provide a brief description of some of the risks attendant
to futures and options trading and are designed to be understood by all customers. Since section 4(c) contract market
transactions would be entered into only by sophisticated or high net worth persons or those engaged in the futures
industry, and since the products themselves may be different from traditional futures and option contracts, the
Commission believes that it may be appropriate to substitute for standard disclosure statements such disclosure
as may be appropriate to the customer's expertise and financial capacity, tailored to the particular product. Therefore,
in lieu of requiring a specific statement or format, the proviso to proposed &sect;36.7(a) would require an FCM or,
in the case of an introduced account, an IB, to furnish an eligible participant with disclosure appropriate to the
particular instrument and the eligible participant prior to the eligible participant's entry into the first section
4(c) contract market transaction involving a particular instrument.

59 FR 34376 (July 5, 1994). This statement currently can be used in the U.S., in the United Kingdom, in Ireland and in
Belgium. Several other jurisdictions are considering its adoption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this regard, the Commission notes that Rule 1.55(f), 17 CFR 1.55(f) (1994), currently states that furnishing the
required disclosure statement under that rule does not relieve an FCM or IB from any other disclosure obligation it
may have under applicable law.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
47
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission further notes that exchanges with non-traditional trading systems have required, on their own initiative,
special risk disclosures applicable to such systems.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
48
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission further notes that in order to qualify for the exemption of swap agreements under Part 35 of its rules,
an agreement must be entered into by an eligible swap participant, the definition of which is closely followed by proposed
Rule 36.1(c)(2), and there are no specific disclosure requirements under Part 35 of the Commission's rules, 17 CFR
Part 35 (1994).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
49
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission therefore preliminarily believes that it is striking the appropriate balance in proposed Rule 36.7
with respect to disclosure in light of the eligible participants and products involved. The Commission requests
comment concerning the risk disclosure requirements for section 4(c) contract market transactions.

The Commission notes that proposed &sect;36.7(b), which provides that ``[t]his section does not relieve a futures
commission merchant or introducing broker from any other disclosure obligations it may have under applicable law,''
is included as a reminder that Section 4b of the Act requires all material information to be disclosed. The fact that
other proposed sections of Part 36 do not have a similar ``catch-all'' provision should not be interpreted to mean
that the Act or Commission regulations do not apply to those sections.

Proposed &sect;36.8 mirrors the requirements for exemptive relief under Section 4(c) of the Act, namely that any

&sect;36.8 provides that, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, the exemption may be suspended or revoked.

, those provisions of Sections 6(c), 6(d), and 9(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 9, 15, 13b and 13(a), that prohibit price manipulation,
and Commission Rules 33.9 and 33.10, 17 CFR 33.9 and 33.10 (1994), which prohibit fraudulent conduct and price manipulation
in connection with commodity option transactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its petition for exemption, the CBOT included a rule specifically prohibiting fraud and manipulation relating
to professional market transactions. The CBOT petition explains:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Fraud and manipulation are the core proscriptions of the Commodity Exchange Act*&blank;*&blank;*. Rather than
engage in a hyper-technical legal effort to mesh certain exempt transactions with the requirements of the CEA's existing
fraud and manipulation provisions, the proposal contains a special antifraud and antimanipulation provision.
That approach will make certain that any party committing fraud or engaging in manipulative practices in connection
with an otherwise exempt transaction *&blank;*&blank;* would not be able to wriggle out of liability under the CEA
under some legal technicality.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
58 FR 43414, 43433 (August 16, 1993). The CME did not suggest the adoption of a specific fraud and manipulation rule;
nonetheless, it did not request an exemption from the antifraud and antimanipulation provisions of the Act and Commission
regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its consideration of the petitions and the comments received thereon, the Commission is also considering whether
to adopt specific stand-alone rules prohibiting fraud and manipulation to supplement proposed &sect;36.9. In this
regard and as noted above, the exemption being proposed would relieve the exchanges and their members from some provisions
of the Act and regulations that are intended to provide prophylactic protection for customers. In the absence of these
protections, it may be appropriate to apply broader antifraud and antimanipulation prohibitions to effectively
control certain abusive conduct, such as trading ahead of customer orders in any form and failure to disclose material
information. As a result, the Commission is proposing, in &sect;36.9(a), a free-standing antifraud rule for section
4(c) contract market transactions modeled after Commission Rule 33.10, 17 CFR 33.10 (1994). The Commission specifically
requests comments concerning whether it should adopt such a rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is also requesting comment concerning whether those provisions of the Act and rules thereunder reserved
in the manipulation provision, &sect;36.9(b), are adequate in this regard or whether the Commission should also
adopt an additional free-standing antimanipulation rule. Should commenters believe that a free-standing antimanipulation
rule is warranted, comment is requested concerning whether a rule prohibiting manipulation or attempted manipulation
of the price of any section 4(c) contract market transaction or of any commodity in interstate commerce or any contract
of sale of a commodity for future delivery on or subject to the rules of any contract market, would be appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a related matter, the Commission is also seeking comment on whether Part 35 of its rules, 17 CFR Part 35 (1994), which
provides an exemption for certain swap transactions, should be amended to include specific stand-alone prohibitions
of fraud and price manipulation like those discussed above.
<FOOTCITE>50</FOOTCITE>
 While Section 4b of the Act has provided an adequate tool to address fraud in traditional futures contract trading,
and Section 4o (which is also reserved in Part 35) addresses the giving of advice, questions have been raised about
the efficacy of these provisions as applied to certain of the transactions included in the ambit of Part 35. An amendment
to Part 35 in this regard would eliminate any such questions and could also provide desirable consistency in the legal
standards applicable to both section 4(c) contract market transactions and exempt swap transactions. Comment is
requested concerning the type of antifraud and antimanipulation rules that the Commission should adopt if it determines
to do so.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

The Commission believes that to the extent that firms defined as small businesses under section 3 of the Small Business
Act could offer or be offered section 4(c) contract market transactions, the proposed rules would not add any legal,
accounting, consulting or expert costs. No one is required to trade section 4(c) contract market transactions. The
proposed rules would merely provide exemptive relief for those trading such transactions. The determination of
whether a section 4(c) contract market transaction would qualify for the proposed exemption requires minimal analysis
of data that will be readily accessible to the offeror. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Chairman, on behalf of the Commission, certifies pursuant to section 3(a) of the RFA, 5 U.S.C. 605(b),
that the proposed rules will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Nonetheless,
the Commission invites comment from any firm which believes that these proposed rules would have a significant economic
impact on its operations.

, the EPA is announcing a 3-month stay and reconsideration of certain portions of the ``National Emission Standards
for Hazardous Air Pollutants from the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing Industry and Other Processes Subject
to the Negotiated Regulation for Equipment Leaks'' (collectively known as the ``hazardous organic NESHAP'' or the
``HON''). The EPA is issuing the stay pursuant to Clean Air Act section 307(d)(7)(B), 42 U.S.C. 7606(d)(7)(B), which
provides the Administrator authority to stay the effectiveness of a rule during reconsideration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action is a proposal to extend the compliance date for certain compressors and for surge control vessels and bottoms
receivers to allow the time necessary for installation of controls. Changes are also being proposed to the applicability
of control requirements for surge control vessels and bottoms receivers. This action also proposes a temporary extension
of the applicable compliance dates beyond the 3 months of the stay, but only as necessary to complete reconsideration
(including appropriate regulatory action) of the rule in question.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 22, 1994 (59 FR 19402), and June 6, 1994 (59 FR 29196), the EPA promulgated in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (``NESHAP'') for the synthetic organic chemical manufacturing
industry (SOCMI), and for several other processes subject to the equipment leaks portion of the rule. These regulations
were promulgated as subparts F, G, H, and I in 40 CFR part 63, and are commonly referred to as the hazardous organic NESHAP,
or the HON. The final rule required existing sources to comply with subpart H beginning October 24, 1994 for some groups
of SOCMI processes and for processes subject to subpart I. These compliance dates were the same as the proposed compliance
dates and were consistent with the agreement on the negotiated rule for equipment leaks. The final rule required existing
sources to comply with subpart G no later than April 22, 1997. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public comments on the proposed rule included a substantial number of requests for a compliance schedule for subpart
H similar to the 3-year schedule provided under subpart G. Several commenters argued that the 6-to-18-month compliance
period in proposed subpart H did not take into consideration the implementation problems that could arise during
installation of required equipment. A few commenters thought that proposed subpart H did not permit applications
for compliance extensions. The EPA did not revise the compliance schedule as requested because the commenters did
not provide any information that would justify establishing a source-category-wide compliance schedule similar
to that provided in subpart G. Due to the lack of detailed information on equipment changes and installation schedules,
the EPA thought that case-by-case compliance extensions would be sufficient to address any implementation problems
that might arise. In issuing the final rule, the EPA added a provision, &sect;63.182(a)(6), to clarify that individual
extensions of compliance may be requested for installation of equipment required by subpart H.

The second major area of public comment concerned the proposed definition of product accumulator vessel and its overlap
with the definitions for process vents and storage vessels. Major concerns expressed included: (1) The proposed
definition did not distinguish between product accumulator vessels and process vents, storage vessels or other
in-process vessels; (2) multiple standards (process vents under subpart G and equipment leaks under subpart H) would
apply to the same vent; and (3) product accumulator vessels, which are point sources, would be regulated under provisions
that were intended for fugitive emissions (i.e., equipment leaks). These commenters suggested eliminating the
inconsistencies by: (1) Deleting the subpart H requirements for product accumulator vessels and regulating them
as process vents or storage vessels under subpart G; or (2) allowing sources to select whether to comply with the requirements
of subpart G or subpart H. Several commenters representing the non-SOCMI processes subject to subpart H also suggested
deleting requirements for product accumulator vessels for those processes from subpart H. A few of these commenters
thought that the EPA had added these provisions to the negotiated rule after the conclusion of the negotiations. The
commenters preferred regulating such vessels under future MACT standards for the appropriate source category.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As described in the April 22, 1994 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 19440), the EPA concluded that, of the equipment included in the definition of ``product accumulator vessels,''
only surge control vessels and bottoms receivers were outside the scope of process vents, storage vessels, and wastewater.
Therefore, the term ``product accumulator vessel'' was removed from subpart H, and replaced with ``surge control
vessels and bottoms receivers.'' This change was intended to clarify the applicability of the rules and was not a change
in the substance or effect of the negotiated rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the final rule was issued, it has become apparent that compliance with the provisions of &sect;63.164 and &sect;63.170
involves more equipment modifications and changes than originally believed. Additionally, the EPA has determined
that an administrative process needs to be added to subparts F and I to establish these case-by-case compliance extensions.
A petition for reconsideration has been submitted to the EPA requesting reconsideration of the compliance dates
for compressors, &sect;63.164, and for surge control vessels and bottoms receivers, &sect;63.170.

II. Summary of and Rationale for Proposed Revisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this proposal is to revise the compliance dates for compressors and for surge control vessels and bottoms
receivers to provide sufficient time to make the equipment changes necessary for compliance with the provisions
of &sect;63.164 and &sect;63.170. It is proposed to add new paragraphs &sect;63.100 (k)(4) through (k)(7) and &sect;63.103(g)
to subpart F to revise the compliance dates for existing sources and to document the use of the compliance extensions.
Similar changes are also being proposed for subpart I, as new paragraphs &sect;63.190 (e)(3) through (e)(5). This
action also proposes a revised &sect;63.170 to address issues that have arisen over technical feasibility of these
control provisions and confusion over the distinction between surge control vessels, on the one hand, and process
vents or storage vessels, on the other hand. This action also proposes to add paragraph (k)(8) to &sect;63.100 and
paragraph (h) to &sect;63.103 providing a compliance extension for processes that plan to eliminate the use of or
production of HAP.

1. Compliance Schedule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Compliance with the provisions of &sect;63.170 requires that the surge control vessel or bottoms receiver be routed
to the process or to a control device. Since the rule was issued, the EPA has received numerous inquiries regarding
the feasibility of complying in the specified compliance period given the nature of the process changes required
for either of the compliance options. Based on this information and review of the rulemaking record, the EPA has concluded
that the nature of the equipment changes required is similar to the changes required for compliance with the provisions
for process vents, storage vessels, etc. subject to subpart G. The scope of the equipment changes is, thus, more complex
than was originally envisioned when the 6-month compliance date was selected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new information that the EPA has received demonstrates that at many facilities major equipment modifications
or replacements are necessary in order to comply with the standard. The process changes involved include rerouting
of a vent stream to a control device or to the process; replacement of a surge control vessel operated at atmospheric
pressure with another that can be operated at a pressure greater than atmospheric; replacement, removal or addition
of other equipment; and process redesign. Such process changes take more than a few months to effect, especially considering
planning, approval of permits, and in some cases approval by the Food and Drug Administration or other government
entities. All these changes require the same degree of engineering design and evaluation that the controls required
for process vents and storage vessels require. Furthermore, from the range of situations reported, it appears that
the need for additional time to implement the required equipment changes is not limited to specific processes or kinds
of equipment.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In light of new information received since publication of the final rule, the EPA has concluded that the compliance
date for surge control vessels and bottoms receivers should be the same as that for process vents and other equipment
subject to subpart G, i.e., April 22, 1997. Due to the widespread need for the additional time to design, purchase,
install, and permit new equipment, the EPA proposes to revise the compliance date to April 22, 1997 for all sources
subject to the provisions of &sect;63.170. This proposed language is presented in &sect;63.100(k)(7) of subpart
F and &sect;63.190(e)(6) of subpart I.

2. Revisions to &sect;63.170
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the concern with the achievability of the compliance dates, the EPA has received numerous inquiries
regarding the definition of surge control vessels and the distinction between surge control vessels (and bottoms
receivers) and storage vessels. The EPA has concluded from these discussions that this confusion is partially attributable
to the fact that the present definition for surge control vessel is too broad and implies that any vessel that is not
a storage vessel, e.g., knockout pot, is a surge control vessel. A revised definition for ``surge control vessel''
is being proposed to clarify that the term is limited to vessels that are within the process unit to provide in-process
storage, mixing or management of flow rates or volumes to assist in production of a product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even with this revised definition, the EPA recognizes that considerable overlap will remain between vessels used
for storage of materials, storage vessels, and equipment that meets the definition of surge control vessels or bottoms
receivers. This is expected because the equipment is frequently indistinguishable in terms of structure, size,
materials of construction, and materials stored. In many cases, these items of equipment may be distinguished only
after reviewing process diagrams to determine whether the chemicals in the vessel will undergo further processing
steps at the chemical manufacturing process unit. The EPA is aware that in some cases surge control vessels and other
unit operations have been regulated as storage vessels although the function of the particular vessels was not for
storage of feed materials or product. This classification probably occurred because the equipment is physically
indistinguishable from other containers used for storage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To minimize the confusion over appropriate categorization of equipment, the EPA believes it would be most appropriate
to apply the same control criteria to surge control vessels and bottoms receivers that are applied to storage vessels
in subpart G. This approach should provide a workable solution to the problem by eliminating the remaining differences
between the two categories of equipment and should avoid creating unforeseen problems. An additional consideration
in this decision was that this approach would involve only minimal changes to the present text of the rule. Given the
length and complexity of the HON as a whole, the EPA thinks such a change would be understood more readily and with fewer
implementation delays. If surge control vessels and bottoms receivers were addressed in subpart G, substantial
redrafting would be required throughout subpart G. Therefore, the EPA considered this alternative to have a greater
potential for creating more issues and confusion than if the problem were addressed in subpart H. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of the storage vessel control criteria is also considered appropriate for the following reasons. First, it
would take considerable time, perhaps as much as 1 to 2 years, to gather the necessary information and establish separate
control requirements for surge control vessels and bottoms receivers. Second, information presently available
to the EPA indicates that surge control vessels and bottoms receivers have been regulated as storage vessels in a number
of cases. Third, the range of physical characteristics and operating conditions of surge control vessels and bottoms
receivers appears to substantially overlap that of storage vessels. Although the EPA does not have quantitative
data on the characteristics and controls of surge control vessels and bottoms receivers, EPA considers the storage
vessel information to provide the best available data on the characteristics of surge control vessels and bottoms
receivers. Therefore, the EPA believes the MACT floor analysis and selection of the standard analysis for storage
vessels are adequate for surge control vessels and bottoms receivers.

The provisions of &sect;63.164 require the use of mechanical seals equipped with a barrier-seal system and controlled
degassing of the barrier fluid or enclosure of the compressor seal area and venting of emissions through a closed-vent
system to a control device. The standard also allows designation of a compressor as being subject to a 500 ppm performance
standard. These provisions are consistent with the provisions in existing equipment leak standards in 40 CFR parts
60 and 61. Because no public comments were received that identified categories of compressors or types of changes
that justified compliance times longer than the 6 to 18 months provided in the proposed rule, the EPA concluded that
case-by-case extensions would be sufficient to address any implementation problems that might arise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the final rule was issued, the EPA has received new information that indicates it is infeasible for some sources
subject to the October 24, 1994 compliance date to comply with the compressor provisions in the allotted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6-month compliance period. In the development of the equipment leak rule, the EPA treated control of compressors
as requiring similar lead times and control measures as those required for control of pumps. It has since been determined
that significant differences exist in the time required to make the necessary equipment changes for compressors.
In particular for some compressors, compliance with the provisions of &sect;63.164 requires replacement of an existing
mechanical seal system or identification of an alternative barrier fluid system. Because compressors are individually
designed for each process and for the expected range of operating conditions (pressure, temperature, chemicals
in the process, etc.), selection of replacement seal or barrier fluid systems requires case-by-case engineering
evaluation and equipment specification. Replacement of a seal system or barrier fluid system for a compressor could
involve significant capital outlay and always requires careful planning and evaluation to ensure continued proper
operation of the compressor. For projects of this nature, the time required to conduct and complete such an assessment,
write equipment specifications, bid and purchase the equipment is roughly 1 year. Actual installation of the replacement
seal or barrier fluid system reportedly can be completed within 1 week. Thus, the EPA believes that 1 year is the minimum
feasible period for installation of required equipment. Therefore, the EPA is proposing to revise the compliance
date for compressors at process units subject to the October 24, 1994 and January 23, 1995 compliance dates to April
24, 1995. The proposed language is presented in new paragraph &sect;63.100(k)(4) in subpart F and &sect;63.190(e)(3)
in subpart I.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA has also determined that provisions need to be added to subparts F and I to provide a mechanism for owners or operators
to request case-by-case compliance extensions for delays due to unavailability of parts. Since replacement seal
systems and barrier fluid systems are designed for the compressor and the unit, it is possible that the vendor company
may not be able to provide the replacement system on schedule and there would be no other vendor who could quickly provide
the parts. When the EPA established the compliance date for the compressor provisions, the possible need for such
a compliance extension was not recognized. Therefore, the EPA is proposing to allow application for a compliance
extension in cases where replacement of the seal system or barrier fluid system is required and additional time is
necessary due to unavailability of parts. The proposed language is presented in new paragraph &sect;63.100(k)(5)
to subpart F and paragraph &sect;63.190(e)(4) to subpart I. The EPA expects that this compliance extension provision
will be used only in those rare cases where, despite proper planning and scheduling by the owner or operator, the replacement
seal or barrier fluid system is not available on time. The EPA expects that with the proposed revisions to the compliance
date the vast majority of compressors will not need compliance extensions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In reevaluating the compliance period provided in the rule for compressors, the EPA also reconsidered whether it
was appropriate to allow compliance extensions in cases where a process unit shutdown is necessary to permit installation
of the replacement seal system or barrier fluid system. Typically, in a shutdown of a process unit with a compressor,
the entire system is depressurized and the equipment is cleared of process fluids. Even with good air pollution control
practices, such a process unit shutdown could involve substantially more emissions than if the compressor were allowed
to operate with seals that do not meet the technical specifications of the standard. Whether delaying installation
of replacement seals or barrier fluid systems is environmentally beneficial depends on the particular circumstances
of each case as well as the length of the delay. Therefore, after evaluating the tradeoffs, the EPA concluded that compliance
extensions until the next scheduled process unit shutdown should be allowed in certain circumstances. The EPA also
judged that, based on estimates of the expected tradeoffs in emissions reduction, all compressors should be in compliance
with the requirements of &sect;63.164 no later than April 22, 1996. These proposed changes to the compliance dates
are presented in paragraph &sect;63.100(k)(5) of subpart F and &sect;63.190(e)(5). The EPA wants to emphasize that
these proposed compliance extensions would be available only in cases where a process unit shutdown is necessary
to allow installation of a new seal system or a new barrier fluid system or requires changes to the existing barrier
fluid system.

The EPA is proposing to allow compliance extensions for processes that plan to eliminate the use or production of HAP
from their process. Subpart I presently provides, in &sect;63.190(e), additional time for such process changes.
The proposed new paragraph &sect;63.100(k)(8) would be added to subpart F to address an oversight in the drafting

, the EPA is announcing, pursuant to Clean Air Act section 307(d)(7)(B), reconsideration of the equipment leak provisions
of the HON dealing with compressors and with surge control vessels and bottoms receivers (40 CFR 63.164, 63.170).
In that action the EPA is also announcing a 3-month partial stay of those provisions during the reconsideration. However,
the EPA may not be able to complete reconsideration of, and any appropriate curative regulatory action to, the rule
within the 3-month period expressly provided by Clean Air Act section 307(d)(7)(B). If the EPA does not complete the
reconsideration and rulemaking in this timeframe, then it will be necessary to temporarily extend the applicable
compliance dates until the EPA completes final rulemaking action upon reconsideration. By this action the EPA proposes,
pursuant to section 301(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7601(a)(1), a temporary extension of the compliance
dates beyond the 3 months provided for Group I sources that had been required to comply with subpart H by October 24,
1994, and for sources required to comply as of January 23, 1995 or later, only as necessary to complete reconsideration
and revision of the rule in question. As the EPA expects to be able to complete reconsideration of these regulatory
provisions expeditiously, the EPA does not believe this temporary extension will, as a practical matter, affect
the compliance dates for sources in Groups III, IV, or V since completion of the rulemaking is expected before April
24, 1995. If, following consideration of public comment, the EPA takes final action to extend these compliance dates,
the dates would be extended until the effective date of the EPA's final action following reconsideration of these
rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA is proposing this temporary extension of the compliance dates in order to complete reconsideration of the
rule, as discussed above. The EPA intends to complete its reconsideration of the rule and, following the notice and
comment procedures of section 307(d) of the Clean Air Act, take appropriate action as expeditiously as practicable.
The EPA will seek to ensure that the affected parties are not unduly prejudiced by the EPA's reconsideration.

A. Surge Control Vessels and Bottoms Receivers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed revisions to the compliance date and the control requirements for surge control vessels and bottoms
receivers will not affect the estimated emissions reduction and control cost for the rule. In the background analyses
used to characterize emissions, emission reductions, and control costs for this rule, the EPA treated surge control
vessels and bottoms receivers as either process vents or storage vessels. This approach was taken due to the lack of
sufficient data to characterize surge control vessels and bottoms receivers and the EPA's view that this equipment
could be best characterized as a storage vessel. Consequently, the proposed revisions to the compliance date and
the requirements of &sect;63.170 have no effect on the emission reductions or cost estimates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Compressors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed revisions to the compliance date for compressors provisions are estimated to have a negligible effect
on the emissions reduction due to the equipment leak control requirements. Emissions from compressors contribute
only a small portion of the estimated emissions from equipment leaks because there are very few compressors located
in SOCMI process units. Information from earlier EPA studies also shows that the majority of compressors in SOCMI
already meet most, if not all, of the equipment specifications in &sect;63.164. Moreover, because of the nature of
the equipment changes and the long lead time, the EPA believes the proposed revisions will not result in delays of installation
of required controls. These proposed revisions to subpart H are not expected to affect the estimated cost of compliance
with the rule.

The information collection requirements of the previously promulgated NESHAP were submitted to and approved by
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). A copy of this Information Collection Request (ICR) document (OMB control

Protection Agency; 401 M Street, SW; Washington, DC 20460 or by calling (202) 260&hyph;2740. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's changes to the NESHAP would have a minor impact on the information collection burden estimates made previously.
The added provisions provide a mechanism to request compliance extensions and are not required reports. Therefore,
the ICR has not been revised.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The HON rule promulgated on April 22, 1994 was considered ``significant'' under Executive Order 12866 and a regulatory
impact analysis (RIA) was prepared. The amendments proposed today would revise compliance dates to provide the time
necessary for installation of controls and do not add any additional control requirements. The EPA believes that
these proposed amendments would have a negligible impact on the results of the RIA and the change is considered to be
within the uncertainty of the analysis. For the reasons discussed in section III, the impacts on emissions reduction
are also believed to be negligible.

The Department intends to encourage broad State and local flexibility in implementing programs under Title I. In
particular, the Department intends to issue regulations only where absolutely necessary_for example, where the
statute requires a regulation or where a regulation would provide flexibility for States, school districts, and
schools. The Department will also provide nonbinding guidance, including through a Policy Manual, respecting legal
and policy issues under the Title I programs. This nonregulatory guidance can serve to inform parents, schools, school
districts, States, and other affected parties of the flexibility that exists under the statute, including multiple
approaches that may be available in carrying out the statute's requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Assistant Secretary invites advice and recommendations from interested parties_including Federal, State,
and local administrators, parents, teachers, and members of local boards of education_concerning issues on which
regulations may be necessary or with respect to which nonregulatory guidance would be helpful to clarify statutory
ambiguities and to provide for flexibility.

Negotiated Rulemaking
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1601 of Title I requires that, before publishing any proposed regulations to implement programs under Title
I, the Assistant Secretary will establish a negotiated rulemaking process on issues involving a minimum of two key
provisions in the statute_``schoolwide programs'' and ``standards and assessment.'' Therefore, the Assistant
Secretary specifically invites comments on these two provisions, including whether and where regulations are necessary
and nonregulatory guidance would be helpful. The appendix to this notice describes the two statutory provisions
in greater detail and raises questions for consideration. Commenters should use this discussion to guide their thinking.
The discussion, however, is not intended to restrict the issues that commenters may address.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Assistant Secretary will select individuals to participate in the negotiated rulemaking sessions to be held
in Washington, DC from among the individuals or groups providing advice and recommendations. The Secretary will
publish a separate notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Invitation to Comment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This request for comments is designed to elicit the views of interested parties, particularly Federal, State, and
local administrators, parents, teachers, and members of local boards of education on regulatory issues under Title
I. In addition to inviting specific comments on schoolwide programs and standards and assessment, the Assistant
Secretary invites comments on other potential regulatory issues concerning provisions under Title I. Since the
Department intends to minimize regulations and support flexibility, the Assistant Secretary also seeks recommendations
concerning where guidance might be necessary. The Assistant Secretary requests that each commenter identify his
or her role in education and the perspective from which he or she views the educational system_either as a representative
of an association, agency, or school (public or private), or as an individual teacher, student, parent, or private
citizen. The Assistant Secretary urges each commenter to be specific regarding his or her recommendations, including
identifying the particular section of Title I pertinent to the comment.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Listed below are discussions and related questions for consideration on two Title I provisions_schoolwide programs
and standards and assessment_that are required by statute to be addressed during the negotiated rulemaking process.
The Assistant Secretary specifically invites comments on these questions but welcomes other comments, as well,
including whether regulations are necessary and whether nonregulatory guidance would be helpful.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 1114 of Title I, a local educational agency (LEA) may use funds received under Part A of Title I, in combination
with other Federal, State, and local funds, to upgrade the entire educational program in schools in which not fewer
than 50 percent of the children enrolled are from low-income families or that are located in school attendance areas
in which not fewer that 50 percent of the children are from low-income families. (The poverty threshold is 60 percent
for the 1995&hyph;96 school year and decreases to 50 percent in subsequent school years.) A schoolwide program school
must conduct a comprehensive needs assessment of the performance of

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

strategies that provide opportunities for

_Under section 1114(b)(1)(B)(iv), each school operating a Title I schoolwide program must address the needs of all
children in the school, particularly children who are members of the target population of any program included in
the schoolwide program, and determine if those needs have been met.

_For the Migrant Education Program (MEP), under section 1306(b)(3), a schoolwide program school must address the
needs of migratory children, identified through a Statewide migrant comprehensive plan required under section
1306(a), that result from the effects of the children's migratory lifestyle or that are needed to permit them to participate
effectively in school. Unlike the Part A program, a State MEP establishes a set of service priorities to govern the
expenditure of MEP funds within the State.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
What guidance, if any, should the Department provide to clarify this provision, particularly in the context of overall
school reform envisioned by schoolwide programs? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
Standards and Assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 1111, each State must develop or adopt challenging content standards and student performance standards
that will be used by the State, its LEAs, and its schools to carry out Part A programs. These standards must include challenging
content standards in academic subjects that specify what children are expected to know and be able to do, contain coherent
and rigorous content, and encourage the teaching of advanced skills. The standards must also include challenging
student performance standards that are aligned with the State's content standards, describe two levels of high performance_proficient
and advanced_to determine how well children are mastering the State's content standards, and describe a third level
of performance_partially proficient_to provide complete information about the progress of lower-performing
children toward achieving the proficient and advanced levels of performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each State must also develop or adopt a set of high-quality assessments, including assessments in at least mathematics
and reading or language arts, that will be used as the primary means of determining the yearly performance of each Title
I LEA and school in enabling children served under Part A and each State and local operating agency under Part C to meet
the State's student performance standards. Among other things, these assessments must be the same assessments used
to measure the performance of all children if the State measures the performance of all children, be aligned with the
State's content and performance standards, be used for purposes for which they are valid and reliable, and assess
progress in the academic subjects in which the State has adopted content and performance standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a State has content and performance standards and assessments for all students developed under the Goals 2000:
Educate America Act or another process, the State must use those standards and assessments, modified if necessary,
to meet these requirements. If a State has not adopted State content and performance standards or assessments for
all students, the State must develop standards and assessments for students served under Part A and, where feasible,
Part C (according to section 1304(c)(5)) in subjects determined by the State, but including at least mathematics
and reading or language arts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Under section 1111(b)(1), States are not required to submit their content and performance standards to the
Secretary. However, a State must demonstrate in its State plan that it has developed challenging content and performance
standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
What guidance, if any, should the Department provide to clarify what information a State must submit to enable the
Secretary to evaluate this portion of the State plan? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Under section 1111(b)(7), a State that does not yet have the required assessments may propose to use a transitional
set of yearly Statewide assessments that will measure the performance of complex skills and challenging subject
matter. For any year during which a State uses transitional assessments, the State must devise a procedure for identifying
LEAs and schools in need of improvement that relies on accurate information about the educational progress of each
Title I LEA and school. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
What guidance, if any, should the Department clarify the provisions governing transitional assessments? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
What guidance, if any, should the Department provide to promote high quality assessment systems? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Under section 1111(b)(3), a State's assessments must be administered at some time during grades 3&hyph;5,
grades 6&hyph;9, and grades 10&hyph;12. Under section 1116(c)(1)(B)(ii), a targeted assistance school (i.e.,
one that is not operating a schoolwide program) may be reviewed for accountability purposes on the progress of those
students that have been or are served under Part A. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
What guidance, if any, is necessary to address accountability provisions for Title I schools that do not serve the
grade levels covered by the State's assessments or for schools in which Title I services are not provided at those grade
levels? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 1111 requires that States use challenging standards and high-quality assessments in examining the
effectiveness of the Part A program at the school, LEA, and State levels. For the MEP, section 1304(c)(5) requires
that the effectiveness of State programs and their local projects will be assessed, where feasible, using the same
approaches and standards that will be used to assess the performance of students, schools, and LEAs under Part A. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
What guidance, if any, should the Department provide on how to assess the effectiveness of State Migrant Education
programs, their local projects, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
LEAs under Part A, that serve children who move across State lines? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 1111(b)(2) requires that a State plan demonstrate what constitutes ``adequate yearly progress''
of Title I LEAs and schools toward enabling children to meet the State's performance standards. The statute further
specifies that States must define ``adequate yearly progress,'' consistent with guidelines established by the
Secretary, that results in continuous and substantial yearly improvement of each LEA and school sufficient to achieve
the goal of all children served under Part A meeting the State's proficient and advanced levels of performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
What guidelines should the Secretary establish? Should the guidelines be contained in regulations or in nonregulatory
guidance? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Under section 1111(b)(3)(I), a State's set of student assessments must ``enable results to be disaggregated''
within each State, LEA, and school for several categories of children. Likewise, under section 1114(b)(2)(A)(v),
a schoolwide program plan must provide ``for the collection of data on the achievement and assessment results of students''
disaggregated by the same categories. However, a schoolwide program must publicly report disaggregated data only
if statistically sound. Finally, section 1116(a)(4) requires an LEA to publicize the results of its annual review
of schools served under Part A in individual school performance profiles that include statistically sound disaggregated
results. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
What clarification, if any, should the Department provide on the various provisions in Part A concerning disaggregation
of data? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Given the requirement of section 1111(b)(3)(E) that assessments involve multiple measures of student performance,
what guidance, if any, should the Department provide to help clarify how schools, LEAs, and SEAs review results to
determine whether adequate progress is being made?
