SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(AD) that is applicable to certain Airbus Model A300 and A300&hyph;600 series airplanes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposal would require modification of the fuel tank jettison system. This proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is prompted by a quality survey which revealed that the electrical bonding of the fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jettison system has insufficient protection from a lightning strike. The actions specified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the proposed AD are intended to prevent electrical arcing and resultant fire in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
event of a lightning strike.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthiness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority for France, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain Airbus Model A300 B4&hyph;2C, B4&hyph;103, and B4&hyph;203 series airplanes, and Model 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A300&hyph;600 B4&hyph;620, B4&hyph;622, B4&hyph;603, and B4&hyph;601 series airplanes. The DGAC advises 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the results of a quality survey, conducted by Airbus Industrie, revealed that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electrical bonding of the fuel jettison system has insufficient protection from a lightning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
strike. Investigation revealed that the existing lightning protection could fail to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequately safeguard the fuel jettison pipe against a lightning strike at the fuel pipe exit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This condition, if not corrected, could result in electrical arcing and resultant fire in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
event of a lightning strike. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Airbus has issued Alert Service Bulletin A300&hyph;28A065, Revision 1, dated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
February 14, 1994 (for Model A300 series airplanes), and Alert Service Bulletin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A300&hyph;28A6033, Revision 1, dated February 14, 1994 (for Model A300&hyph;600 series 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplanes), which describe procedures for modification of the fuel tank jettison system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This modification involves removing the bonding strap that bridges the flexible hose and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
installing a new thicker bonding strap from the fuel jettison pipe to the No. 5 flap track 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beam, which will improve the electrical bonding at both ends. Accomplishment of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modification will improve the bonding method at the interface of the fuel jettison pipe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the adjacent fuel tank. The DGAC classified these service bulletins as mandatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and issued French Airworthiness Directive 93&hyph;074&hyph;144(B), dated May 12, 1993, in order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in France. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation in the United States under the provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the DGAC has kept the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the DGAC, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would require modification of the fuel tank jettison system. The actions would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletins described 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 34 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed AD, that it would take approximately 21 work hours per airplane to accomplish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour. Required parts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be supplied by the manufacturer at no cost to the operators. Based on these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$42,840, or $1,260 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federalism Assessment.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to all British Aerospace
Model BAe 146&hyph;100A, &hyph;200A, and &hyph;300A series airplanes. This proposal would require conducting
closed loop tests to determine the setting of the underfrequency trip level on suspect generator control units (GCU),
and either the correction of discrepancies or replacement of the GCU. This proposal is prompted by several malfunctions
of in-service GCU's due to the effects of setting the underfrequency trip level too high. The actions specified by
the proposed AD are intended to correct GCU's that may have the underfrequency level set too high, which could result
in the unwanted shut down of an electrical generator; this condition may lead to loss of all generated electrical power
on the airplane when other generator faults or failures occur.

Discussion

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, recently notified
the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on all British Aerospace Model BAe 146&hyph;100A, &hyph;200A, and &hyph;300A
series airplanes. The CAA advises that reports have been received of several malfunctions of in-service generator
control units (GCU). Investigation revealed that GCU's repaired or adjusted by workshops other than GEC-Marconi
may have the underfrequency trip level set too high. The cause has been attributed to the fact that the GEC-Marconi
Component Maintenance Manual does not recommend that the underfrequency trip level be checked during the closed
loop test. (GEC-Marconi is the manufacturer of the subject GCU's.) Setting the underfrequency level too high could
lead to the shut down of an electrical generator. If an electrical generator shuts down when other generator faults
or failures occur, all generated electrical power on the airplane may be lost. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Avro International Aerospace (a division of British Aerospace) has issued Service Bulletin S.B. 24&hyph;103, dated
March 24, 1994, which describes procedures for checking the part and serial number on the data plate of each GCU to identify
discrepant units, replacing the discrepant GCU with a serviceable unit, and conducting post assembly testing. The
CAA classified this service bulletin as mandatory. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GEC-Marconi has issued Service Bulletin HGE 24&hyph;23, dated March 11, 1994, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which describes procedures for conducting closed loop tests to determine the setting of the underfrequency trip
level, adjusting the underfrequency trip level, and conducting post assembly testing. This service bulletin also
describes the part and serial number of affected GCU's. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations
(14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness
agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of
the CAA, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type
design that are certificated for operation in the United States.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would require checking the part and serial number on the data plate of each GCU to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identify discrepant units, and conducting closed loop tests on affected GCU's to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine the setting of the underfrequency trip level. The proposed AD would also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require either adjusting the underfrequency trip level or replacing the discrepant GCU 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with a serviceable unit, and conducting post assembly testing. The actions would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletins described 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 43 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed AD, that it would take approximately 1 work hour per airplane to accomplish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour. Based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be $2,580, or $60 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to realign Jet Route
J&hyph;15 to include the Twin Falls, ID, VORTAC. This would enhance traffic flow and reduce controller workload on
a frequently used high altitude route. Jet routes are published in paragraph 2004 of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18,
1994, and effective September 16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The jet route listed in this
document would be published subsequently in the Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) Is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February
26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal.
Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that
this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The FHWA proposes to issue a regulation on value engineering (VE) that would require its application to selected Federal-aid
highway projects, when funded under the FHWA's grant-in-aid process. The proposed regulation would require State
highway agencies (SHA) to establish and administer VE programs; it outlines minimum VE program requirements and
provides guidance in establishing, administering, and monitoring a VE program. This proposed regulation is considered
necessary to implement 23 U.S.C. 106(d), which provides that, in such cases as the Secretary deems advisable, the
Secretary may require a value engineering or other cost reduction analysis of plans, specifications, and estimates
for proposed projects on any Federal-aid highway.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The FHWA recognizes VE as an effective and proven technique for reducing cost, increasing productivity, and improving
quality when applied in the development of highway projects. This document solicits public comments regarding the
VE requirements being considered by the FHWA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1991, the Congress required the FHWA to study its VE program. Section 1091 of the Intermodal Surface Transportation
Efficiency Act of 1991, Public Law 102&hyph;240, 105 Stat. 1914 (Dec 18, 1991), required the Secretary of Transportation
to ``study the effectiveness and benefits of value engineering review programs applied to Federal-aid highway projects,''
and to ``report to Congress on the results of the study *&blank;*&blank;* including recommendations on how value
engineering could be utilized and improved in Federal-aid highway projects.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA's evaluation of the effectiveness of its VE program, as described in a report submitted to Congress in June
1993,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 concluded that the application of VE in the development of highway projects has the potential to result in substantial
cost savings without adversely affecting any of the highway projects' design, aesthetics, or construction standards
while assuring that environmental and ecological goals are maintained. During the study made to prepare this report,
the FHWA examined VE data covering fiscal year (FY) 1988 to FY 1991 and found that only a limited number of States had
active and effective VE programs.

``Value Engineering on Federal-aid Projects,'' a report to Congress by the Secretary of Transportation is available

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The study found that FHWA's policy of the past 20 years of promoting VE through education, encouragement, and technical
assistance has had limited success in persuading all States to implement VE programs on a continuing basis. This finding
is despite overwhelming evidence that VE can be a very effective way to improve projects and control costs from States
with active VE programs. The FHWA has, therefore, concluded that in order to improve the effectiveness of the VE program
nationwide, all States need to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have active VE programs. As a result, the FHWA proposes to require the use of VE in all States on selected Federal-aid
highway projects.

This regulation, if promulgated, would significantly improve the effectiveness of VE in the Federal-aid highway
program by requiring VE to be applied in all States, thereby ensuring that the requirements of 23 U.S.C. 106(d) are
met. The regulation would provide nationwide application of VE to the FHWA's grant program in the same way that the
FHWA's direct federally funded VE program is covered by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A&hyph;131
(Revised June 8, 1993, 58 FR 32964 (June 14, 1993)). The OMB Circular A&hyph;131 requires ``Federal Departments and
Agencies to use value engineering (VE) as a management tool, where appropriate, to reduce program and acquisition
costs.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulation would require States to establish, administer, and monitor VE programs. Each State would determine
the administrative details of its VE program and institute VE program requirements to carry out the VE program. States
would have up to 1 year from the effective date of the final rule to establish VE programs.

of selected Federal-aid highway projects. The regulation would apply to contracts for early project development,
design, and construction of selected projects funded with Federal-aid highway funds and may include studies of project
elements, project procedures, specifications, and standard plans.

This section would require States to establish VE programs which meet minimum VE program requirements and to develop
procedures to administer and monitor their VE programs. This section would require States to be adequately staffed
to effectively manage and monitor their VE programs, allow States to employ VE consultants to perform VE studies,
and authorize the cost of the VE studies as eligible for Federal-aid participation. In addition, this section would
require VE program staffs to receive VE training. Value engineering training is available through courses and workshops
offered by the National Highway Institute (NHI), various VE consulting firms, and some SHAs with active VE programs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section would require States to report to the FHWA the yearly results achieved through the application of VE to
projects financed with Federal-aid highway funds. This information should be readily available from the SHA's internal
tracking and documenting of its VE program. The FHWA is required to report certain data and other information about
its VE program to the Department of Transportation (DOT), which then forwards the information to the OMB. The information
provided in the State reports would provide the data and information needed for FHWA's report and would help the FHWA
and States monitor the effectiveness of State VE programs. The information contained in the report will be made available
to FHWA field offices and State agencies.

Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review) and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FHWA has determined that a savings of more than $100 million per year is likely to occur as a result of the implementation
of the regulation. Therefore, this action is a significant regulatory action within the meaning of Executive Order
12866 and significant within the meaning of DOT regulatory policies and procedures. Because it is anticipated that
the economic impact of this rulemaking will be significant, the FHWA has prepared the following regulatory evaluation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA collected and evaluated considerable amounts of VE data in 1992 while preparing and writing its VE Report
to Congress. During FHWA's 1992 evaluation of the effectiveness of its VE program, the FHWA analyzed data for all SHAs
(50 States plus Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia) describing their VE usage for the 4-year period from fiscal
year (FY) 1988 to FY 1991. The data showed that the SHAs performed over 1500 VE studies, recommended an accumulative
$3.6 billion in VE savings, and implemented VE savings worth $615 million. The majority (71 percent) of these 1,500
VE studies were made by just seven States. These seven SHAs, with ``active'' VE programs, averaged 39 studies per year.
Nearly all of the remaining VE studies were made by 27 other SHAs, an average of only 4 VE studies per year, with the 18
remaining SHAs performing only 12 VE studies over the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4-year study period. The overall results showed the SHAs implementing an average of $154 million per year in VE savings.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

In order to evaluate the reported VE savings, the FHWA analyzed the FY 1991 bid information reported and published
in its Bid Opening Report (Pub. No. FHWA-PD&hyph;92&hyph;017). In FY 1991, the SHAs accumulatively awarded $10 billion
worth of Federal-aid highway construction projects. The seven ``active'' VE States awarded construction contracts
worth $2.5 billion, the 27 ``limited'' VE States awarded construction contracts worth $5.0 billion, and the 18 ``inactive''
VE States awarded construction contracts worth $2.5 billion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA has concluded that because the seven SHAs (accounting for 25 percent of FHWA's construction program) with
``active'' VE programs and the 27 States (accounting for 50 percent of FHWA's construction program) with ``limited''
VE programs were able to save $154 million per year, that an opportunity exists to save significant additional Federal-aid
highway funds if all SHAs develop ``active'' VE programs. With 25 percent of FHWA's $10 billion construction program
not exposed to any VE analysis and 50 percent of its program having only a ``limited'' exposure to the VE process, the
FHWA believes that additional savings of more that $100 million would occur by requiring all States to develop and
administer VE programs as proposed in this regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The additional annual savings that would result from the implementation of this regulation would remain with the
affected SHAs. The funds saved through VE could then be used to design or construct additional highway projects, thereby
allowing SHAs to get additional work accomplished each year with the same overall amount of Federal-aid highway funds.
By being able to expand the amount of work accomplished with their Federal-aid highway funds, SHAs would also be able
to save or free-up State funds for other projects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on more recent VE information collected by FHWA field offices for FY 1993, the FHWA found that during FY 1993,
27 SHAs had performed at least 1 VE study, while 18 of these 27 SHAs performed at least 5 studies, and 9 of the 27 SHAs performed
10 or more studies. The FHWA believes that these States either have VE programs in place or are familiar with the VE process
that would be required under this regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule will not significantly increase the burden upon State governments. This regulation would require SHAs
to develop VE programs where a sufficient number of projects, representing at least 50 percent of the Federal-aid
highway funds expended by the State, will be identified for VE studies each year. An average VE study takes 4 to 5 days
to complete and requires a 4 to 6 person team. In FY 1993, 349 VE studies of various highway projects were made by 27 SHAs.
According to the information provided to the FHWA, the average cost per project for the 349 VE studies was $9,600 while
the recommended savings (if all recommendations were accepted) was $3.4 million per project. Assuming a recommendation
acceptance rate of 25 percent, implementation of the VE recommendations would result in a cost savings of approximately
$0.86 million per study. The VE cost savings should more than offset any VE study or redesign costs to the agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the past, some State highway agencies have resisted establishing VE programs for various reasons. Many were concerned
about the additional staffing requirements and potential delays to projects. Some considered the application of
VE to be superfluous in light of the review processes already applied in developing projects. These concerns have
been considered and addressed in this rulemaking.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under an established VE program (which operates on a continuing basis), the application of VE to the highway projects
need not adversely affect or delay any project because the VE studies are normally performed in the early project development
phase, where they can be integrated into the process. In addition, the overall effect of employing VE is generally
positive, rather than duplicative of the engineering analysis already completed on any project, because VE uses
a multi-disciplinary team, creative thinking, and functional analysis to improve quality and productivity, foster
innovation, eliminate unnecessary and costly design elements, and ensure that projects are cost effective. The
regulation may affect staffing levels in SHAs that do not currently utilize VE. Establishing, administering, and
monitoring a VE program will require each SHA to assign staff to carry out specific VE functions, although it is expected
that staffing assignments will be minimal. States with existing VE programs probably already have adequate staff
assigned to carry out the VE functions. Individuals serving as VE study team leaders or members should be selected
from existing SHA staffs that are trained in VE. Agencies may also hire VE consultants to perform the VE studies. In
either case the study costs are eligible for reimbursement with Federal-aid funds at the appropriate pro-rata share
for the type of project studied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Historically, any additional costs due to the need to hire or reassign staff to manage the VE program have been more
than offset by the overall monetary savings resulting from the application of VE studies to highway projects. In general,
States with active VE programs report return on VE investments of between 30 to 1 and 50 to 1, giving the opportunity
for substantial overall savings. In 1993, California, Florida, and Massachusetts reported savings in excess of
$100 million as a result of VE study recommendations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since VE programs would be geared primarily toward analyzing the larger and more complex projects, most local agencies
(those receiving small amounts of Federal-aid highway funds) would find themselves exempt from the process. Large
local agencies receiving substantial amounts of Federal-aid highway funds would have to apply VE to some of their
larger projects in the same manner as the SHAs and would achieve analogous benefits. Like State highway agencies,
local agencies that are required to perform VE studies may perform the studies themselves or hire a VE consultant to
perform the study. The cost to local agencies of performing VE studies is project related and is therefore eligible
for reimbursement with Federal-aid highway funds, as stated above.

In compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612), the FHWA has evaluated the effects of
this rule on small entities. Based on the evaluation, the FHWA hereby certifies that this action will not have a significant
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The FHWA has determined that most small entities (those receiving
small amounts of Federal-aid highway funds) will probably not perform VE studies because their projects are small
and do not fit the project selection criteria set forth in this proposal for performing VE studies. Still, due to the
many benefits that accrue through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applying the VE process, States should encourage local agencies to use VE in the development of Federal-aid highway
projects.

This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612.
Under the Federal-aid highway program, the FHWA reimburses States for costs incurred in highway 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
construction projects. This regulation would simply provide that, as a condition of receiving such grants, States
must ensure that project costs are controlled and project quality is maintained. This regulation recognizes the
role of the States in employing VE. It gives States wide latitude in establishing, administering, and monitoring
their VE programs and in selecting projects to be constructed using VE. Therefore, the FHWA has determined that this
action does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a separate federalism assessment.

(a) This part will improve project quality and productivity, foster innovation, eliminate unnecessary and costly
design elements, and ensure efficient investments by requiring the application of value engineering (VE) to selected
highway projects financed with Federal-aid highway funds. This part requires each State highway agency (SHA) to
establish a VE program, outlines minimum VE program requirements, and provides guidance on establishing, administering,
and monitoring VE programs. State programs shall be in effect no later than [one year after the effective date of the
final rule]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) This part applies to contracts involving the early development, design, and construction of selected Federal-aid
highway projects. States shall develop VE programs that will apply the VE review process to selected highway projects.
States may exempt certain projects, such as railroad and utility work, projects financed with highway planning and
research 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funds, certain projects authorized under the State's highway safety program, and emergency relief projects from
the VE project selection phase.

(1) The VE program shall include procedures to insure that the VE process is actively applied to applicable Federal-aid
highway projects. The VE procedures shall require the identification of candidate projects for VE studies early
in the development of the State's annual Federal-aid program. As a minimum, a sufficient number of projects representing
at least 50 percent of the Federal-aid highway funds expended by the State shall be identified for VE studies each year.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The VE program should establish specific criteria and guidelines for selecting Federal-aid highway projects
for a VE review. Consideration should be given to projects that have shown recent substantial cost increases; projects
with complex designs or construction phases; projects involving major structures; projects with unique specifications,
standards, or processes; multi-modal projects; projects with repetitive work elements; projects with high right-of-way
costs; projects with unique or experimental features; projects with high maintenance, user impact, or traffic control
costs; and projects specifically requested for review by State agency program offices or management. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The VE program should establish specific criteria and procedures for granting waivers of the VE study requirement
on certain types of projects or programs. The agency's procedures may allow for certain types of projects to be eliminated
from consideration for VE when there is little likelihood that they would yield any opportunity for improvements
or savings.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) Value engineering studies should follow the systematic problem-solving process defined by the VE job plan. Value
engineering studies should be performed using a team consisting of individuals from different disciplines, such
as: Design, construction, environment, maintenance, planning, right-of-way, and other specialty areas depending
upon the project being reviewed. Individuals from the public and other agencies may also be included as team members
when their inclusion is found to be in the public interest. The study leader should be trained in VE, understand the
VE process, and be able to serve as the coordinator and facilitator of the VE team. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Studies should be employed as early as possible in the project development or design process so that valid VE recommendations
can be implemented without delaying the progress of the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Each study should conclude with a formal report outlining the study team's recommendations for improving the
project and reducing its overall cost. As a part of the formal report process, a presentation of the VE team's recommendations
should be made to upper management and documentation of the presentation included with the final report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The VE program should include procedures to ensure that the VE recommendation approval process involves appropriate
reviews and concurrences from applicable staff offices, such as: Design, construction, environment, air quality,
safety, materials, traffic operations, right-of-way, and other offices when the proposed VE change impacts their
specialty areas. All reviews by external staff offices should be performed promptly to minimize delays to the project.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The VE program should promote the development and submission of VECPs by construction contractors, provide for
their prompt review, assure their prompt approval or disapproval and, if approved, assure the implementation of
the proposed changes. State highways agencies shall include a VE or cost reduction incentive clause in their standard
specifications or project special provisions that clearly allows construction contractors to submit VECPs. This
clause should include a provision allocating, by percentage, the cost savings that is to be shared between the agency
and the contractor. States should retain the right to accept or reject all VECPs and acquire the rights to use accepted
VECPs in current and future projects without restrictions.

(7) The VE program should include procedures for monitoring the implementation of the recommendations to ensure
that proper documentation is maintained for accepted and rejected VE and VECP recommendations, the projected or
actual cost savings associated with the recommendations, and the total costs involved in performing the VE studies.
The monitoring procedures should also include a mechanism to assure that applicable VE alternatives employed on
one projects are included in other similar projects.

and monitor its VE efforts. Individuals assigned to administer and monitor the VE program should have sufficient
authority to insure the vigorous implementation of the VE program and be actively involved in all phases of the VE program
including the development of the agency's annual VE plan.

VE training.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The VE program should include procedures for identifying formal VE training needs and for coordinating training
efforts to ensure that an adequately trained staff is available to perform the number of VE studies required in the
annual VE plan and to assure a continuing VE program. Key VE program managers, VE team leaders and members, and individuals
involved in the VECP review and approval process shall receive VE training.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Use of consultants.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Consultants that have experience in VE may be retained by SHAs to conduct VE studies on Federal-aid projects or elements
of Federal-aid projects. Members of consultant VE study teams should be experienced in VE, have completed a recognized
VE course or workshop, and have participated in previous VE studies. A consultant firm should not be retained to conduct
a VE study of its own design unless the firm maintains separate and distinct organizational separation of its VE and
design sections.

Funding eligibility.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The cost of performing VE studies is project related and is therefore eligible for reimbursement with Federal-aid
highway funds at the appropriate pro-rata share for the project studied.

Each SHA shall report yearly the results it achieved through the application of VE to selected highway projects financed
with Federal-aid highway funds. States should report data for the Federal fiscal year, the twelve month period beginning
October 1 and ending September 30. States should submit these reports to the FHWA division office by November 10 of
the calendar year. This information may be transmitted to the FHWA electronically. The suggested report format is

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM is announcing receipt of a proposed amendment to the Virginia regulatory program (hereinafter referred to as
the Virginia program) under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The proposed amendment
includes changes to &sect;&sect;480&hyph;03&hyph;19.816/817.102(e) of the Virginia program relative to the
disposal of coal processing waste and underground development waste in mined-out areas. The amendment is intended
to clarify what provisions of the coal mine waste disposal regulations apply when disposal of coal processing waste
or underground development waste occurs in mined-out areas for the purpose of backfilling a disturbed area.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background on the Virginia Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On December 15, 1981, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Virginia program. Background information
on the Virginia program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the conditions of
approval can be found in the December 15, 1981, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (46 FR 61085&hyph;61115). Subsequent actions concerning the conditions of approval and program amendments can
be found at 30 CFR 946.12, 946.13, 946.15, and 946.16.

II. Discussion of the Proposed Amendment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated October 31, 1994 (Administrative Record No. VA&hyph;839), Virginia submitted a proposed amendment
to its program pursuant to SMCRA. Virginia proposes to amend &sect;480&hyph;03&hyph;19.816/817.102(e) to clarify
the Virginia regulations that are applicable when coal processing waste and underground development waste is used
as backfill material for mined-out areas. If approved the proposed amendment will settle interpretational differences
between Virginia and OSM relative to how the coal mine waste regulations apply to waste materials placed in backfills.
The text of the existing regulation is presented below with proposed changes italicized:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Disposal of coal processing waste and underground development waste in the mined-out area as a refuse pile and
not to backfill disturbed areas shall be in accordance with 480&hyph;03&hyph;19.816/817.81 and 480&hyph;03&hyph;19.816/817.83.
The Division may approve a variance to 480&hyph;03&hyph;19.816/817.83(a)(2) if the applicant demonstrates that

In accordance with the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17(h), OSM is now seeking comment on whether the amendments proposed
by Virginia satisfy the applicable program approval criteria of 30 CFR 732.15. If the amendments are deemed adequate,
they will become part of the Virginia program.

Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory
Planning and Review).

Executive Order 12778
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that, to the extent allowed by law, this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections
(a) and (b) of that section. However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory
programs and program amendments since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM.
Under sections 503 and 505 of the SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1253 and 1255) and 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions
on proposed State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.

No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C).

The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon corresponding Federal regulations for which
an economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements
previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule
would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart
Federal regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is proposing to approve revisions to the Colorado Ozone State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted by the Governor
on September 27, 1989, and August 30, 1990. The revisions consist of amendments to Regulation No. 7, ``Regulation
To Control Emissions of Volatile Organic Compounds.'' In its review of the September 27, 1989 State submittal, EPA
identified several areas where the regulation still did not meet EPA requirements. On August 30, 1990, the State submitted
additional revisions to Regulation No. 7 to address these deficiencies. This

 action applies to both of these submittals. The amendments were made to conform Regulation No. 7 to federal requirements,
and to improve the clarity and enforceability of the regulation. EPA's approval will serve to make the revisions federally
enforceable and was requested by the State of Colorado.

 Section 110(a)(2)(H)(i) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), as amended in 1990, provides the State the opportunity to amend
its SIP from time to time as may be necessary. The State is utilizing this authority of the CAA to update and revise existing
regulations which are a part of the SIP.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 3, 1978, EPA designated the Denver-Boulder metropolitan area as nonattainment for the National Ambient
Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone (43 FR 8976). This designation was reaffirmed by EPA on November 6, 1991 (56
FR 56694) pursuant to section 107(d)(1) of the CAA, as amended in 1990. Furthermore, since the Denver-Boulder area
had not shown a violation of the ozone standard during the three-year period from January 1, 1987 to December 31, 1989,
the Denver-Boulder area was classified as a ``transitional'' ozone nonattainment area under section 185A of the
amended Act. In order to meet the Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) requirements of the CAA, transitional
areas must correct any RACT deficiencies regarding enforceability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current Colorado Ozone SIP was approved by EPA in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 12, 1983 (48 FR 55284). The SIP contains Regulation No. 7 (Reg 7), which applies RACT to stationary sources
of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC). Reg 7 was adopted to meet the requirements of Section 172(b)(2) and (3) of the
1977 CAA (concerning the application of RACT to stationary sources.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) However, the approved Ozone SIP did not rely on the emissions reduction credit that Reg 7 would produce in order to
demonstrate attainment; rather, the SIP relied only on mobile source controls in order to demonstrate attainment.

The requirement to apply RACT to existing stationary sources of VOC emissions was carried forth under the amended
Act in section 172(c)(1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During 1987 and 1988, EPA Region VIII conducted a review of Reg 7 for consistency with the Control Techniques Guidelines
documents (CTGs) and regulatory guidance, for enforceability and for clarity. The CTGs, which are guidance documents
issued by EPA, set forth measures that are presumptively RACT for specific categories of sources that emit VOCs. A
substantial number of deficiencies were identified in Reg 7. In 1987, EPA published a proposed policy document that
included, among other things, an interpretation of the RACT requirements as they applied to VOC nonattainment areas
(52 FR 45044, November 24, 1987, Post-87 Policy). On May 25, 1988, EPA published a guidance document entitled ``Issues
Relating to VOC Regulation Cutpoints, Deficiencies, and Deviations, Clarification to Appendix D of the November
24, 1987

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Notice'' (the ``Blue Book''). A review of Reg 7 against these documents uncovered additional deficiencies in the
regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 26, 1988, EPA notified the Governor of Colorado that the Carbon Monoxide (CO) SIPs for Colorado Springs and Fort
Collins were inadequate to achieve the CO NAAQS. In that letter, EPA also notified the Governor that the Ozone SIP had
significant deficiencies in design and implementation, and requested that these deficiencies be remedied. EPA
did not make a formal call for a revised Ozone SIP in the May 1988 letter,

 even though the Denver-Boulder area was, and continues to be, designated nonattainment for ozone. The reason for
this decision was that no violations of the ozone NAAQS had been recorded in the nonattainment area for the previous
three years. However, EPA indicated that the deficiencies, if uncorrected, could jeopardize the area's ability
to obtain eventual redesignation as an attainment area for ozone.

Under the pre-amended Act, EPA had the authority under section 110(a)(2)(H) to issue a ``SIP Call'' requiring a State
to correct deficiencies in an existing SIP. Section 110(a)(2)(H) was not modified by the 1990 Amendments. In addition,
the amended Act contains new section 110(k)(5) which also provides authority for a SIP Call.

In a letter dated September 27, 1989, the Governor of Colorado submitted revisions to Reg 7 to address EPA's concerns
with how the State was addressing RACT for major non-CTG sources of VOC. A detailed description of the specific revisions
to the regulation is contained in the Docket for this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 document. Based upon the reasons stated below, EPA is approving the State's non-CTG rule for its strengthening effect
on the SIP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Areas of the country which requested extensions of the attainment date for the ozone NAAQS beyond the initial 1982
target specified in the CAA, as amended in 1977, were required to submit SIP revisions by July 1, 1982 (46 FR 7182, January
22, 1981). This requirement applied to the Denver-Boulder metropolitan area. The 1982 submittal was required to
include RACT regulations for all sources of VOC covered by a CTG and for all remaining stationary sources in the nonattainment
area with potential to emit VOC emissions (before control) of 100 tons per year or greater (``major non-CTG sources'').

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This 1982 Ozone SIP revision was submitted to EPA on June 24, 1982. Among other deficiencies, the SIP did not contain
regulations requiring RACT on major non-CTG sources of VOC. EPA noted this deficiency in February 3, 1983, but proposed
approval of the submitted SIP revision (48 FR 5030). The State responded by committing to adopt RACT for any VOC sources
covered by a CTG and EPA approved this revision on December 12, 1983 (48 FR 55284).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA's review of the Ozone SIP during 1987 and 1988 revealed that the intent of the requirement for RACT for major non-CTG
sources had not been met. EPA tentatively identified several stationary sources which should have applied RACT since
1982, but were as yet unregulated. Reg 7 contained no mechanism for requiring control of these sources, other than
a ``General Emission Limitation,'' for sources not specifically regulated by Reg 7, of 450 pounds per hour or 3000
pounds per day. This general limitation allowed sources to have actual emissions of up to nearly 550 tons per year before
control was required. This provision clearly did not meet the 1982 SIP requirement, which was reiterated in the May
25, 1998, Appendix D Clarification document.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To address this concern, the State revised Reg 7 to delete the existing ``General Emission Limitation'' and to require
RACT for stationary sources with potential emissions of VOC of 100 tons per year or more, under certain conditions.
Section 7.II.C. applies this new RACT requirement to sources not specifically covered by the regulation as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Sources with actual emissions of 100 tons per year or more of VOCs must apply RACT.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Sources with potential emissions of 100 tons per year or more of VOCs, but with actual emissions of less than 100
tons per year, may avoid having to apply RACT by obtaining a federally enforceable permit to limit production or hours
of operation to keep actual emissions below 100 tons per year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Sources with potential emissions of 100 tons per year or more of VOCs, but with actual emissions of less than 50 tons
per year on a 12-month rolling average, may avoid RACT and permit requirements by: (1) Submitting a report each year
demonstrating that the 50 tons per year threshold has not been exceeded; and (2) maintaining monthly records of VOC
usage and emissions to enable the State to verify these reports.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State developed this approach to regulating 100 tons per year non-CTG sources after receiving comments on the
proposed Reg 7 revisions from several industries in the Denver-Boulder area. These sources indicated that their
processes involved a number of non-CTG category operations that are performed infrequently (such as painting letters
on four production units per year), resulting in low actual emissions, but which would result in large potential emissions
when calculated on an 8760 hour per year basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is approving section 7.II.C. of the State's rules for its strengthening effect on the SIP. The submitted rule is
stronger than the pre-existing non-CTG RACT rule because it specifically applies to sources that have a potential
to emit more than 100 tons per year of VOCs and that are not yet covered by a CTG. The rule requires those sources to adopt
RACT on a case-by-case basis. The previous rule, which was a commitment of the State and did not directly affect non-CTG
sources, only applied to those sources for which EPA subsequently issued a CTG. Therefore, the submitted rule strengthens
the SIP because it applies to major sources not covered by a CTG. It should be noted that EPA is not addressing whether
this rule establishes RACT for major stationary sources not subject to a CTG.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Denver-Boulder metropolitan area is classified as ``transitional'' for ozone under the CAA. This means that
the area is legally designated as an ozone nonattainment area, although it did not experience violations of the ozone
NAAQS during the 1987&hyph;1989 period used to classify areas under the 1990 CAA amendments. Therefore, the Denver-Boulder
metropolitan area is not subject to the RACT fix-up requirement of Section 182(a)(2)(A) of the CAA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the transitional ozone classification, EPA must review the available ambient air quality data and make a determination
whether the Denver-Boulder metropolitan area has, in fact, attained the ozone NAAQS. In a letter dated October 22,
1992, from Jack McGraw, EPA Region VIII Acting Regional Administrator, to Governor Roy Romer, EPA Region VIII advised
the State that EPA had reviewed ambient air quality data which had been entered by the State into the Aerometric Information
and Retrieval System (AIRS) national database. EPA further advised that these data indicated that the Denver-Boulder
metropolitan transitional ozone area, as defined in the November 6, 1991 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (56 FR 56694, codified at 40 CFR 81.306), had not violated the ozone NAAQS during the period beginning January 1, 1987,
and ending on December 31, 1991. EPA's October 22, 1992 letter was not a determination that the Denver-Boulder nonattainment
area had met the CAA's Section 107(d)(3)(E) criteria for redesignation to attainment, but rather served as an affirmation
that no violation of the ozone standard for this area was found.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State has indicated, in the current State-EPA Agreement (SEA), that it will begin developing an ozone redesignation
request and maintenance plan for the Denver-Boulder metropolitan area. The maintenance plan must demonstrate that
the ozone NAAQS will be maintained for an initial period of 10 years after the redesignation request is approved by
EPA. The maintenance plan must be updated, after 8 years into the initial 10-year period, to demonstrate that the NAAQS
will be maintained for an additional 10 years. During the development of the maintenance plan, the State may consider
additional revisions to the ozone control strategy in order to demonstrate maintenance of the ozone standard; such
revisions could include further modification of the VOC control requirements of Reg 7. For a maintenance plan to be
approved and the Denver-Boulder metropolitan area to be redesignated as attainment pursuant to Section 107(d)(3)(E),
the State may have to develop specific RACT regulations for major non-CTG sources. Information available to EPA suggests
that there has been growth in emissions from some non-CTG sources in the area; RACT regulations for these sources may
be necessary to ensure maintenance of the NAAQS for the initial 10-year redesignation attainment period, as is required
by Section 175A of the Act.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, the revised Reg 7 ( as submitted by the Governor on September 27, 1989) met the CAA requirements, which were
interpreted in the CTGs, the Blue Book, and the Post-87 Policy. However, in its review, EPA identified two remaining
issues where the regulation did not explicitly follow EPA guidance: A. The compliance schedule, and B. Clarification
of the Graphic Arts definition for potential to emit. These remaining two issues were addressed by the State in its
August 30, 1990 submittal and are described below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a letter dated August 30, 1990, the Governor of Colorado submitted revisions to Reg 7 to address EPA's remaining
concerns with the September 27, 1989 Ozone SIP revision. A detailed description of the additional specific revisions
to Reg 7 is contained in the Docket for this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 document. Revisions were made to the following sections of Reg 7:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Compliance Schedule: Reg 7 did not contain an explicit deadline for compliance with the revised regulation. In
response to EPA comments, the State adopted additional revisions (Section 7.I.B. and 7.I.C.) to Section 7.I. (Applicability)
of Reg 7, requiring all sources to come into compliance with the revised Reg 7 by October 31, 1991. EPA considered a 2-year
timeframe for compliance with the Reg 7 revisions to be acceptable because no ozone SIP Call was made in 1988 (no violations
of the ozone NAAQS have been monitored in the Denver-Boulder area since 1984) and thus, the revisions were not immediately
necessary for the area to attain the NAAQS. The 2-year compliance timeframe applies only to the regulation revisions,
and not to requirements which existed prior to October 30, 1989. Sources which were in existence prior to the regulation
revisions and which were covered by the regulations at that time were required to maintain compliance with those provisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. Graphic Arts definition: The Graphic Arts definition of potential to emit, contained in Section 7.XIII.A.2. of
Reg 7, was somewhat unclear. The definition referenced the EPA requirement that potential to emit be determined at
maximum capacity before control (per the Appendix D Clarification document), but also included a requirement that
potential emissions be based on historical records of solvent and ink consumption (per the previous regulatory guidance
document, Guidance to State and Local Agencies in Preparing Regulations to Control Volatile Organic Compounds from
Ten Stationary Source Categories, September, 1979). As a result, the definition could have been interpreted to require
potential to emit to be calculated at both maximum and historical operating rates, which in most cases will be different.
EPA's interpretation of this definition was that potential to emit should be calculated at maximum capacity before
control; historical records of solvent and ink consumption should be used to determine VOC emissions at a given operating
rate, not to determine the historical maximum operating rate. The Reg 7 revisions, submitted by the Governor on August
30, 1990, addressed this concern by not including a reference to the historical records.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. Capture Efficiency: As a final issue, on January 13, 1992, EPA notified the State that, prior to proposing this action,
it was necessary to document the State's position with regard to capture efficiency (CE) determination. During earlier
reviews of the State's VOC regulations, EPA Region VIII indicated that, because EPA had not issued final, generally-applicable
CE test methods, an acceptable State approach to CE was a commitment to develop test methods consistent with the most
recent EPA guidance on CE testing on a case-by-case basis as needed, and a commitment to adopt test methods after EPA
issued final CE test methods. The CE provision adopted by the State in Section IX.A.5.e of Reg 7 does address the requirement
that testing for CE be performed on a case-by-case basis, and that this testing be consistent with EPA guidance. In
a letter dated February 5, 1992, from John Leary, Acting Director, Colorado Air Pollution Control Division, to Douglas
Skie, Chief, Air Programs Branch, EPA Region VIII, the State committed to adopt and use all new CE methods as they are
developed and promulgated by EPA's rule-making process. In that same letter, the State indicated that until changes
are promulgated, the Air Pollution Control Division will use the CE protocols that were published by EPA on June 29,
1990 (55 FR 26814, codified at 40 CFR 52.741(a)(4)(iii) and Appendix B).

Due to additional information received after the adoption of revisions to Reg 7 in September, 1989, the State reconsidered
its regulation of coal tar under Section 7.XI. (Use of Cutback Asphalt). In revisions submitted on August 30, 1990,
Section 7.XI.D., covering coal tar, was deleted. Regulation of coal tar is not covered by the CTG for cutback asphalt
use; EPA believes that it is not needed to meet the RACT requirement of the CAA.

Under section 193 of the amended CAA, States cannot delete control requirements in effect prior to enactment of the
amendments unless the modification ensures equivalent or greater emission reductions of the same air pollutant.

greater emissions that may result from the deletion of the coal tar regulation.

In this action, EPA is proposing to approve the State's VOC definition as submitted in the 1989 and 1990 revisions to
Reg 7. However, on February 3, 1992, EPA published a revised definition of volatile organic compounds (57 FR 3941).
The definition excludes a number of organic compounds from the definition of VOC on the basis that they are of negligible
reactivity and do not contribute to tropospheric ozone formation. The State's definition excludes some, but not
all, of these compounds. Therefore, the State's definition of VOC provides for the regulation of some compounds which
are no longer considered VOCs by EPA. In light of EPA's most recent definition of VOC, EPA will not enforce against sources
for failure to control the emission of compounds that are exempt from the federal VOC definition. EPA has informed
the Region VIII States of the revised definition of VOC and will request that future SIP revisions reflect the most
recent federal VOC definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above revisions, EPA believes that Colorado has met the ozone RACT requirement of the CAA as it applies
to the Denver-Boulder metropolitan area. Colorado has corrected its RACT rule deficiencies regarding enforceability.

This action was previously published as a Direct Final Rule on June 26, 1992 (57 FR 28614). This Direct Final Rule was
withdrawn on August 12, 1992 (57 FR 36004) as EPA Region VIII received a letter, dated July 16, 1992, from William Owens,
Executive Director of the Colorado Petroleum Association (CPA), to Jeff Houk of EPA Region VIII, expressing adverse
comments. These comments will be considered by EPA during the comment period, along with any other comments that are

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the federal SIP-approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its
actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

This proposed rule would amend existing regulations governing the Health Education Assistance Loan (HEAL) program
to establish performance standards against which lender and holder default rates would be measured, as mandated
by the Health Professions Education Extension Amendments of 1992. The proposal also amends the regulations to reflect
various statutory provisions related to HEAL performance standards for schools, lenders, and holders, including
the following: The formula for calculating default rates; the requirement that certain schools develop default
management plans; the borrower's option to reduce his or her insurance premium by obtaining a credit worthy cosigner;
the waiver of penalty fees for schools, lenders, and holders with a low volume of loans; and the option to pay off defaulted
loans to reduce default rates.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 707(a) of the Public Health Service Act (the Act) requires that, not later than 1 year after enactment of the
Health Professions Education Extension Amendments of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;408), the Secretary shall establish
performance standards for lenders and holders of HEAL loans, including fees to be imposed for failing to meet such
standards. In the report accompanying Public Law 102&hyph;408, the Congress stated that it expects ``*&blank;*&blank;*
schools, lenders, and holders to assume and share the responsibility for minimizing HEAL defaults *&blank;*&blank;*''
(Conference Report 102&hyph;925, p. 112).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the above, this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) proposes to amend the HEAL regulations to
establish performance standards for lenders and holders of HEAL loans. Under this proposal, the Secretary would
establish requirements and fees to be imposed on a HEAL lender or holder based on the lender or holder's HEAL default
rate. The default rate for lenders and holders would be calculated in accordance with the statutory default formula
set forth in section 719(5) of the Act, except that loans made to students at Historically Black Colleges and Universities
(HBCUs) prior to the end of the first 3 years that the lender/holder performance standard is in effect would be excluded
from the default rate calculation. The proposed performance standard requirements, including the risk-based fee
to be assessed on each lender and holder, are described below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In developing these proposals, the Department has relied heavily on section 708 of the Act, which sets forth fees and
performance requirements for HEAL schools with default rates greater than 5 percent. Schools, lenders, and holders
all play a significant role in helping to assure the collectibility of HEAL loans, and all benefit from participation
in the HEAL program. Accordingly, this approach is designed to assure similar measures of accountability for all
parties involved in the HEAL program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposal also clarifies various statutory provisions related to HEAL performance standards for schools, lenders,
and holders, including the following: (1) The formula for calculating default rates; (2) the requirement that certain
schools develop default management plans; (3) the borrower's option to reduce his or her insurance premium by obtaining
a credit worthy cosigner; (4) the waiver of penalty fees for schools, lenders, and holders with a low volume of loans;
and (5) the option to pay off defaulted loans to reduce default rates. The specific amendments proposed are described
below according to the subparts, section numbers, and headings of the HEAL regulations affected.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 60.2&blank;HEAL Default Rate
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is proposing to add a new section to the HEAL regulations which would address the HEAL default rate.
Paragraph (a) of this section, ``Default rate formula,'' would explain that the default rate of each school, lender,
and holder is calculated in accordance with the formula set forth in section 719(5) of the Act, except that for lenders
and holders, loans made to students at HBCUs prior to the end of the first 3 years that the lender/holder performance
standard is in effect would be excluded from the default rate calculation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This approach for calculating lender and holder default rates is consistent with the statutory school performance
standard set forth in section 708 of the HEAL stature. Section 708(d)(3) provides HBCUs with a 3-year period during
which they remain eligible for participation in the HEAL program regardless of their default rates. In granting HBCUs
a 3-year reprieve from termination due to high default rates, the Congress indicated concern that the performance
standard provision not cause these schools to lose access to HEAL funding during the initial years of its implementation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In developing this proposed rule, the Department was concerned that lenders and holders, in an effort to maintain
low default rates, might choose not to make or purchase loans for students at HBCUs, which historically have higher
than average default rates. To assure that the lender/holder performance standard provisions do not unwittingly
undermine the Congress' expressed desire that access to HEAL loans be maintained for HBCUs, the proposed rule exempts
any loans made to students at HBCUs prior to the end of the first 3 years that the standard is in effect from being included
when lender/holder default rates are calculated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b) of this section would establish the effective dates of the default rate calculations, for purposes
of determining risk-based insurance premiums and program eligibility. The Department is proposing in this paragraph
that default rates be calculated as of September 30 of each year, and that these rates be used to determine risk-based
insurance premiums and program eligibility, for purposes of loans made or purchased on or after July 1 of the following
year. These timeframes are designed to provide adequate time for schools, lenders, and holders to pay off defaulted
loans, if desired, in order to reduce their risk category or maintain eligibility, and to plan for the costs associated
with continued HEAL activity if their default rates are greater than 5 percent. The Department developed this provision
in response to concerns that the initial implementation of the school risk-based premiums on January 1, 1993, did
not provide adequate time for schools with default rates greater than 5 percent to evaluate their options regarding
the pay off of defaulted loans and to prepare for the costs of continued participation in the HEAL program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c) of this section would set forth the procedures for schools, lenders, and holders to follow if they want
to pay off defaulted HEAL loans to reduce their risk category or maintain eligibility. This proposal would require
that if a school, lender, or holder chooses to pay off one or more HEAL loans, it must, for each borrower it chooses, pay
off the outstanding principal and interest of all HEAL loans held by the Department for that borrower. This proposal
is designed to prevent the confusion that is likely to arise during the collection process if a borrower's HEAL portfolio
were divided, with a portion sold to the purchasing entity and a portion remaining with the Department. The proposal
also would clarify that any defaulted HEAL loans paid off by a school, lender, or holder are assigned to that entity
and may be collected by that entity using any collection methods available to it. Finally, this provision would require
that a payoff be completed by May 31 in order to reduce the school, lender, or holder's default rate that would be used
to determine the risk category (or program eligibility) for loans made or purchased on or after July 1 of the same year.

The Department is proposing to change the heading of this section to ``Risk-based insurance premiums.'' The section
would be amended to reflect the new statutory provisions for determining borrower and school insurance premiums
and to include the proposed lender and holder premiums.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a)(1) of this section would be redesignated as paragraph (a), and would be amended to state that a risk-based
insurance premium is charged to the borrower, school, lender, and holder, in accordance with the procedures set forth
in paragraph (b) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reference in paragraph (a)(1) to the date that the premium is due to the Secretary would be moved to newly designated
paragraph (c), described below, which would address procedures for collecting insurance premiums. In addition,
existing paragraphs (a)(2) through (5), which also deal with the collection of the insurance premiums, would be moved
to newly designated paragraph (c) and amended as described below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b), which addresses the insurance premium rate, would be amended to reflect the various insurance premium
rates for borrowers, schools, lenders, and holders. Paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) would set forth the statutory insurance
premium rates that apply to borrowers and schools, including the borrower's option to reduce the insurance premium
by 50 percent by obtaining a credit worthy cosigner, and the 3-year special consideration provided for Historically
Black Colleges and Universities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) also would include clarification of the statutory provision which provides special consideration
in determining the borrower and school insurance premium rate for schools with a low volume of HEAL loan activity.
Under this proposal, any school which, for purposes of the default rate calculation, has made a total of 50 or less loans
would be placed in the low-risk category, regardless of its default rate. In establishing the low volume threshold,
the Department first considered the Conference report language accompanying Public Law 102&hyph;408, which states
the following:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
``The Secretary may grant an institution a wavier of the requirements of the risk categories only if the Secretary
determines that the default rate is not an accurate indicator because the volume of loans has been insufficient. For
example, some schools of public health may have default rates that exceed 30%. However, since these default rates
are based on a small number of loans (in some cases, only two to five loans) they may be a misleading measure of the institution's
ability to control defaults.'' (Conference Report 102&hyph;925, p.111)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It seems apparent from this language that the Congress, while not defining ``low volume,'' intended for this exclusion
to be limited to schools with a small amount of HEAL activity. The Department next considered the Department of Education's
(ED) low-volume threshold for default penalties. ED uses a threshold of 30 loans for determining whether schools
are subject to modified procedures for determining default rates. However, the ED procedures involve a comparison
of data over a 3-year period for low volume entities, whereas the HEAL statute requires that any entity not meeting
the low volume exclusion be subject to the same default formula applied to high volume entities. As a result, the Department
determined that it would be most equitable to allow a higher threshold for the HEAL ``low volume'' definition. At the
same time, given the Conference report language, the Department could not justify a level that would be so high as to
reduce the effectiveness of the performance standard requirements. Further analysis of HEAL school data supported
a threshold of 50 loans, since this level resulted in 34.6% of HEAL schools, representing only 1.3% of HEAL loans in
repayment, being excluded from the performance standard penalties during Fiscal Year 1993. Based on the above, the
Department considers a threshold of 50 loans to be more than adequate to prevent unfair penalties being imposed on
schools with a small volume of HEAL activity, while at the same time assuring that this exemption is not so lenient as
to make the performance standard requirements meaningless.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraphs (b)(3) and (4) would describe the proposed insurance premium rates for lenders and holders. The proposed
rates for lenders included in paragraph (b)(3) would be as follows:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Low-risk: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A lender with a default rate of not to exceed 5 percent would not be required to pay an insurance premium. In addition,
a lender whose volume of HEAL loans made (for purposes of the default rate calculation) is 50 or less, would not be required
to pay an insurance premium.

The proposed lender and holder insurance premiums are the same as the school insurance premiums which were enacted
as part of Public Law 102&hyph;408 and became effective January 1, 1993. The proposal to make lenders and holders with
default rates greater than 20 percent ineligible for the HEAL program is also consistent with Public Law 102&hyph;408,
which generally prohibits students at schools with default rates in excess of 20 percent from borrowing from the HEAL
program at all. Since schools, lenders, and holders all play an important role in assuring the collectibility of HEAL
loans, and all benefit from participation in the HEAL program, the Department considers it most equitable for all
parties to be subject to the same basic insurance premium rate structure. This is also consistent with the Conference
report language accompanying Public Law 102&hyph;408, which indicated that schools, lenders, and holders should
assume and share the responsibility for minimizing HEAL defaults.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the Department's proposed approach is modeled after the school risk-based insurance premiums established
in the HEAL statute, the Department is interested in comments on an alternate approach which would create a more gradual
continuum of risk-based premiums for lenders and holders. This alternate approach would be structured such that
lenders and holders with default rates: (1) Greater than 5 percent but less than 6 percent pay a 1 percent premium; (2)
Greater than 6 percent but less than 7 percent pay a 3 percent premium; (3) Greater than 7 percent but less than 8 percent
pay a 5 percent premium; (4) Greater than 8 percent but less than 9 percent pay a 7 percent premium; and (5) Greater than
9 percent but less than 10 percent pay a 9 percent premium. This approach would still result in an average risk premium
of 5 percent for lenders and holders in the 5&hyph;10 percent range, but would phase the penalties in more gradually
and provide less harsh penalties for lenders and holders at the lower end of the default rate spectrum. The Department
is interested in comments regarding whether this alternate approach would be considered preferable to the ``notched''
approach that is being proposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new paragraph (b)(5) would prohibit schools, lenders, or holders from passing their insurance premium costs to
borrowers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Existing paragraphs (c) (1) and (2), which address the method of calculating the insurance premium for loans made
before July 22, 1986, when premium amounts were determined based on the amount of time remaining until graduation,
would be deleted and replaced by a new paragraph (c), which would set forth procedures for the collection of insurance
premiums. New paragraph (c)(1), dealing with the borrower premium, would address provisions previously included
in paragraphs (a) (1) and (2). This paragraph would state that the premium charged to the borrower must be collected
by the lender through a deduction from the HEAL loan proceeds and is due to the Secretary, along with documentation
identifying the loan for which the premium is being paid, no later than 30 days after the date of disbursement of the
HEAL loan. It also would require the lender to identify clearly to the borrower the amount of the borrower's insurance
premium.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New paragraph (c)(2), addressing the school premium, would state that for schools required to pay an insurance premium,
in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the premium would be collected by the Secretary on a quarterly
basis, and would be due to the Secretary no later than 30 days after the date of the quarterly billing notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New paragraph (c)(3), addressing the lender premium, would state that for lenders required to pay an insurance premium,
in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the premium, including documentation identifying the loan
for which the premium is being paid, would be due to the Secretary 30 days after the date of disbursement of the HEAL loan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New paragraph (c)(4), addressing the holder premium, would state that for holders required to pay an insurance premium,
in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the premium, including documentation identifying the loan
for which the premium is being paid, would be due to the Secretary 30 days after the date that the loan transfer takes
place.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Existing paragraph (a)(3), which establishes penalties for late payment of the insurance premium, would be redesignated
as paragraph (c)(5)(i). As amended, this paragraph would require that if the insurance premium due from a school,
lender, or holder is not paid by the due date, a late fee will be charged in accordance with the Department's Claims Collection
Regulation (45 CFR part 30). This paragraph also would prohibit the late fee from being passed on to the borrower.

Existing paragraph (a)(4) would be redesignated as paragraph (c)(5)(ii). As amended, this paragraph would state
that if the borrower or lender insurance premium is not paid within 60 days of disbursement of the loan, the Secretary
may deny insurance coverage on the loan. This paragraph also would state that if the school premium is not paid within
60 days of the date of the quarterly billing notice, the Secretary may immediately suspend the school and may initiate
termination proceedings against the school. Finally, if the holder premium is not paid within 60 days of the loan transfer,
the Secretary may cancel the insurance coverage on the loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Existing paragraph (a)(5), which addresses refunds of premiums, would be redesignated as paragraph (c)(6) and would
be amended to clarify that premiums are not refundable except in cases of error, or unless the loan, including any accrued
interest, is canceled within 120 days of the date of disbursement. Previously, the regulations did not provide for
the refund of the insurance premium once a loan was disbursed, even if it was canceled soon thereafter. Accordingly,
this amendment is intended to assure that if cancellation of the loan, including any accrued interest, occurs within
a reasonable period of time, a full refund of the premium(s) may be made. This is consistent with Department of Education
policies governing the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

to state that a credit worthy parent or other responsible individual, other than a spouse, may cosign the loan note.
This is consistent with section 708(c) of the Act, which allows a HEAL borrower to obtain a cosigner to reduce the cost
of the borrower insurance premium by 50 percent.

A new paragraph (e) would be added to this section to state that any lender or holder which is in the medium- or high-risk

management plan must specify the detailed short-term and long-term procedures that the lender or holder will have
in place to minimize defaults on loans to HEAL borrowers. Under the plan the lender or holder must, among other measures,
assure that borrowers receive information concerning repayment options, deferments, forbearance, and the consequences
of default. This requirement is consistent with a statutory provision which requires default management plans from
schools in the medium- or high-risk categories. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new paragraph (f) would be added to this section to state that a lender or holder with a HEAL default rate, as calculated

by the Secretary. The default management plan must specify the detailed short-term and long-term procedures that
the school will have in place to minimize defaults on loans to HEAL borrowers. Under the plan the school must, among
other measures, assure that borrowers receive information concerning repayment options, deferments, forbearance,
and the consequences of default. This provision is consistent with section 708(b) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new paragraph (a)(4) would be added to this section to state that a school must have a HEAL default rate that does not
exceed 20 percent in order to be eligible to make HEAL loans, except as follows: (1) A default rate in excess of 20 percent
does not affect the eligibility of a Historically Black College or University until after October 13, 1995; and (2)
a default rate in excess of 20 percent does not affect the eligibility of any school that has 50 or less loans in repayment,
for purposes of the HEAL default rate calculation described in &sect;60.2. This provision is consistent with section
708(d) of the Act and with the low volume threshold proposed in &sect;60.14(b).

Economic Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12866 requires that all regulations reflect consideration of alternatives, of costs, of benefits,
of incentives, of equity, and of available information. Regulations must meet certain standards, such as avoiding
unnecessary burden. Regulations which are ``significant'' because of cost, adverse effects on the economy, inconsistency
with other agency actions, effects on the budget, or novel legal or policy issues, require special analysis. The Regulatory
Flexibility Act requires that we analyze regulatory proposals to determine whether they create a significant impact
on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes that the resources required to implement the proposed requirements in these regulations
are minimal. The proposed rule would establish performance standards against which lender and holder default rates
would be measured, and would establish fees which would be paid by lenders and holders with default rates over 5 percent
as a condition for continued program participation. Since most active HEAL lenders and holders do not have default
rates over 5 percent, these provisions should not require significant additional resources for the majority of lenders
and holders. Therefore, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, the Secretary certifies that
these regulations will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OMB has reviewed this proposed rule under Executive Order 12866. The Department requests comments on whether there
are any aspects of this proposed rule which can be improved to make the HEAL program more effective, more equitable,
or less costly.

 The HEAL default rate for each school, lender, and holder is calculated in accordance with the formula set forth in
section 719(5) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 292o), except that for lenders and holders, loans made to

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A school, lender, or holder may pay off the defaulted loans of one or more HEAL borrowers to reduce its default rate.
If a school, lender, or holder chooses to exercise this option, it must, for each defaulted HEAL borrower chosen, pay
the outstanding principal and interest for all of the borrower's HEAL loans held by the Secretary. Any defaulted HEAL
loans paid by a school, lender, or holder are assigned to that entity, and may be collected using only collection methods
available to that entity. In order to reduce the school, lender, or holder default rate used to determine the level
of the risk-based insurance premium (or program eligibility) for loans made or purchased on or after July 1 of any year,
a payoff must be completed by May 31 of that same year.

(e) Any lender or holder in the medium-risk or high-risk categories, as described in &sect;60.14, must submit a default
management plan with its application to be a HEAL lender or holder. The default management plan must specify the detailed
short-term and long-term procedures that the lender or holder will have in place to minimize defaults on loans to HEAL
borrowers. Under the plan the lender or holder must, among other measures, assure that borrowers receive information
concerning repayment options, deferments, forbearance, and the consequences of default.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) A lender with a default rate that exceeds 20 percent (except for a lender with a total loan volume, for purposes of

HEAL loan collection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A lender or holder must exercise due diligence in the collection of a HEAL loan with respect to both a borrower and any
endorser or cosigner. In collecting a loan with an endorser or cosigner, the lender or holder must apply to the endorser
or cosigner collection procedures that are at least as stringent as those it would follow in attempting to collect
a commercial or private loan with an endorser or cosigner. At a minimum, in order to exercise due diligence, a lender
or holder must implement the following procedures when a borrower fails to honor his or her payment obligations:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a)(1) When a borrower is delinquent is making payment, the lender or holder must remind the borrower within 15 days
of the date the payment was due by means of a written contact. If payments do not resume, the lender or holder must contact
both the borrower and any endorser or cosigner at least 3 more times at regular intervals during the 120-day delinquent
period following the first missed payment of that 120-day period. The second demand notice for a delinquent account
must inform the borrower that the continued delinquent status of the account will be reported to consumer credit reporting
agencies if payment is not made. Each of the required four contacts must consist of at least a written contact which
has an address correction request on the envelope. The last contact must consist of a telephone contact, in addition
to the required letter, unless the borrower and any endorser or cosigner cannot be contacted by telephone. The lender
or holder may choose to substitute a personal contact for a telephone contact. A record must be made of each attempt
to contact and each actual contact, and that record must be placed in the borrower's file. Each contact must become
progressively firmer in tone. If the lender or holder is unable to locate the borrower and any endorser or cosigner
at any time during the period when the borrower is delinquent, the lender or holder must initiate the skip-tracing
procedures described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the lender or holder is unable to locate either the borrower or any endorser or cosigner at any time, the lender
or holder must initiate and use skip-tracing activities which are at least as extensive and effective as those it uses
to locate borrowers delinquent in the repayment of its other loans of comparable dollar value. To determine the correct
address of the borrower and any endorser or cosigner, these skip-tracing procedures should include, but need not
be limited to, contacting any other individual named on the borrower's HEAL application or promissory note (or the
endorser or cosigner's application), using such sources as telephone directories, city directories, postmasters,
drivers license records in State and local government agencies, records of members of professional associations,
consumer credit reporting agencies, skip locator services, and records at any school attended by the borrower. All
skip-tracing activities used must be documented. This documentation must consist of a written record of the action
taken and its date and must be presented to the Secretary when requesting preclaim assistance or when filing a default
claim for HEAL insurance.

Background

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All five mussels have undergone significant reductions in range and now exist as relatively small, isolated populations.
The Cumberland elktoe exists in very localized portions of the upper Cumberland River system in Kentucky and Tennessee.
The oyster mussel and Cumberland combshell persist at extremely low numbers in portions of the Cumberland and Tennessee
River basins in Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia. The purple bean and rough rabbitsfoot currently survive in a few
river reaches in the Tennessee River system in Tennessee and Virginia. These species were historically eliminated
from much of their range by impoundments. Presently, they and their habitat are impacted by water quality and habitat
deterioration resulting from siltation contributed by poor land use practices and coal mining practices and by other
water pollutants. The mussels' limited distribution also makes them vulnerable to toxic chemical spills.

 (59 FR 35900) a proposal to list these five mussels. Section 4(b)(5)(E) of the Act provides for a public hearing on a
proposed listing if requested within 45 days of the proposal's publication. The Service received several public

In response to the public hearing requests, the Service is reopening the comment period and has scheduled two public
hearings on the proposal to list these five mussels as endangered species. The comment period on the proposal originally
closed on September 12, 1994. The comment period is being reopened from November 23, 1994, through December 30, 1994,
to accommodate the hearings and to allow additional time for written comments. Written comments received during
this time period will become a part of the administrative record and will be given the same consideration as oral comments
presented at the hearings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first public hearing will be held December 13, 1994, in the Auditorium at the York Institute, Route 127 North, Jamestown,
Tennessee, from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. central standard time. The second hearing will be held December 15, 1994, in the 3rd
floor Circuit Courtroom, Marshall County Courthouse, Public Square, Lewisburg, Tennessee, from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m.
central standard time. Those parties wishing to make an oral statement for the record are encouraged to provide a copy
of their statement to the Service at the start of the hearing. In the event there is a large attendance, the time allotted
for oral statements may have to be limited. However, there is no restriction on the length of written statements.
