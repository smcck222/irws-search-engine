SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing a final rule to abolish the Aroostook, Maine, nonappropriated
fund (NAF) Federal Wage System wage area and to redefine Aroostook and Washington Counties, Maine, as areas of application
to the Cumberland, Maine, NAF wage area for pay-setting purposes. With the scheduled closing of Loring Air Force Base
(AFB) on September 30, 1994, and the current downsizing of the Army and Air Force Exchange Service and Loring AFB Morale,
Welfare and Recreation Department, there was not a sufficient number of employees to conduct the wage change survey
scheduled in July 1994. Further, there was not a sufficient number of employees to meet regulatory requirements for
establishing a survey area.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 18, 1994, OPM published an interim rule (59 FR 36351) to abolish the Aroostook, Maine, NAF wage area for pay-setting
purposes and reassign its constituent counties to the Cumberland, Maine, NAF wage area. The interim rule provided
a 30-day period for public comment. OPM received no comments during the comment period. Therefore, the interim rule
is being adopted as a final rule.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The final rule requires FDIC-insured mutual state-chartered savings banks that are not members of the Federal Reserve
System (State Savings Banks) that propose to convert to stock ownership to file with the FDIC a notice of intent to convert
to stock form and to comply with new substantive provisions of the FDIC's regulations when proposing to convert to
the stock form of ownership. The intended effect of the final rule is to assure that mutual-to-stock conversions of
FDIC-regulated institutions do not raise safety-and-soundness concerns, breaches of fiduciary duty or other violations
of law. The final rule confirms, with modifications, an interim rule that has been in effect since February 15, 1994.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

III. The Proposed Rule and Other Recent FDIC Regulatory Initiatives on Mutual-to-Stock Conversions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In June 1994 the FDIC issued a proposed rule to add specific substantive requirements to its mutual-to-stock conversion
regulations (Proposed Rule) (59 FR 30316 (June 13, l994)). The requirements were similar to the interim final regulations
issued by the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) the prior month (59 FR 22725 (May 3, l994)) (OTS Interim Final Rule).
The OTS, with whom the FDIC has coordinated on the substantive provisions of the final rule, has informed the FDIC that
it intends to finalize the OTS Interim Final Rule (OTS Final Rule) at or about the same time as the FDIC publishes this
final rule. The OTS Interim Final Rule and OTS Final Rule are referred to herein collectively as the ``OTS Revisions''.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Proposed Rule would have: Required the submission of a full appraisal report, including a complete and detailed
description of the elements that make up an appraisal report, justification for the methodology employed and sufficient
support for the conclusions reached therein; required a depositor vote on all mutual-to-stock conversions of State
Savings Banks and prohibited management's use of previously executed (or ``running'') proxies to satisfy depositor
voting requirements; for one year following the date of the conversion, among other things, required that any management
recognition plans (MRPs) or stock option plans be implemented only after shareholder approval is received, required
that stock options (if any) be granted at no lower than the market price at which the stock is trading at the time of grant
and prohibited MRPs funded by conversion proceeds; required that the record date for determining depositors eligible
to receive rights to participate in the subscription offering of the conversion stock not be less than one year prior
to the date of adoption of the plan of conversions by the converting bank's board of trustees; required that the subscription
offering provide a preference to eligible depositors and others in the bank's ``local community'' (as defined in
the proposed rule) or within 100 miles of the bank's home office or branch(es); required that employee stock ownership
plans (ESOPs) not have a priority over subscription rights of ``eligible depositors'' (as defined in the proposed
rule); required the submission of a business plan, including, among other things, a detailed discussion of how management
intends to deploy the capital raised through the sale of stock in the conversion; prohibited stock repurchases within
one year following the conversion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Proposed Policy Statement and Interim Final Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FDIC had taken other regulatory actions in this area prior to the issuance of the Proposed Rule. Because of concerns
about prior and potential abuses in the conversion process, in February l994, the FDIC issued a proposed policy statement
on the conversions of State Savings Banks from mutual to stock ownership (Proposed Policy Statement). 59 FR 4712 (Feb.
1, l994). The general purpose of the Proposed Policy Statement was to solicit public comment on the issues involved
in mutual-to-stock conversions and whether and how the FDIC should regulate this activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequent to the issuance of the Proposed Policy Statement the Board of Directors of the FDIC (Board) determined
that, during the pendency of the Proposed Policy Statement, it was necessary for the FDIC to review applications filed
by State Savings Banks with their respective state banking regulator and any other applicable state and federal banking
and/or securities regulators to determine whether the proposed conversions contain any safety and soundness issues
and/or issues of insider abuse that reflect negatively on the integrity and competence of the management of the converting
institution. The Board's concerns had been caused by several mutual-to-stock conversions of State Savings Banks
that gave rise to questions related to management abuse and excessive enrichment of insiders, fairness to depositors
and general safety and soundness concerns. Those conversions had been the subject of Congressional hearings and
numerous news articles and reports. The FDIC also had received direct complaints from depositors of State Savings
Banks about unfair treatment and insider abuse in mutual-to-stock conversions.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Thus, on February 15, 1994, the FDIC issued an interim final rule adding a new section to Part 303 of the FDIC's regulations
prohibiting State Savings Banks from converting to stock form without complying with the requirements of the interim
rule (Interim Rule). 59 FR 7194. The Interim Rule, which remains in effect until the effective date of the final rule,
requires State Savings Banks that propose to convert to stock ownership to file with the FDIC a notice of intent to convert
to stock form consisting of a description of the proposed conversion accompanied by a copy of all documents and application
materials filed with the applicable state and federal regulators. Pursuant to the Interim Rule, the FDIC currently
reviews all conversion materials regarding State Savings Banks with a special interest in: the use of the proceeds
from the sale of stock, as prescribed in the business plan; the adequacy of the disclosure materials; the participation
of depositors in approving the transaction; the form of the proxy statement required for the vote of the depositors/members
on the conversion; any increased compensation and other remuneration (including stock grants, stock option rights
and other similar benefits) to be obtained by officers and trustees of the bank in connection with the conversion;
the adequacy and independence of the appraisal of the value of the mutual savings bank for purposes of determining
the price of the shares of stock to be sold; the process by which the bank's trustees approved the appraisal, the pricing
of the stock and the compensation arrangements for insiders; the nature and apportionment of stock subscription
rights; and the extent of any existing and planned contributions to or investments in the community.

3. The Notice and Request for Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On the same date as the FDIC issued the Proposed Rule it also issued a notice and request for comments (Notice) on the
possible need for fundamental changes to the mutual-to-stock conversion process. 59 FR 30357 (June 13, 1994). The
comment period on the Notice ended on August 12, 1994. The Notice indicated that_despite recently initiated remedial
actions taken, or proposed to be taken, by the FDIC, the OTS, or state bank supervisory agencies_in the view of some,
the current design of the mutual-to-stock conversion process encouraged management abuses and windfalls, flawed
and sometimes disingenuous appraisal methodology, and under-deployment of capital. The general purpose of the
Notice was to elicit an open and free discussion on a range of issues involving mutual-to-stock conversions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In particular, the Notice included a suggestion to provide ``rightholders'' of converting mutual institutions
with certain stock subscription rights (or ``value'') which would only be provided after a legitimate decision to
convert had been made by the trustees or directors of a converting institution. The Notice acknowledged that such
a proposed approach likely would require specific legislative authorization from the Congress and the FDIC was thus
assessing whether it would be in the public interest for it to pioneer such a proposed approach by recommending legislative
action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In an effort to obtain information about whether the public concurred in both the assessment of these fundamental
problems and the suggested solution, the Notice requested comments on 9 specific issues. In response to the Notice,
over 1,000 comments were submitted by mutual institutions, financial industry groups, state banking or thrift supervisory
agencies, municipalities, state legislators, members of Congress, industry attorneys and individuals. Commenters
generally opposed the ``creation'' of the suggested ``rightholders''' interests as a matter of public policy. It
was also argued that mutuality would be threatened because depositors, armed with the prospect of new rights, would
pressure and force management of a mutual to convert to stock form_a situation leading to the eventual extinction
of ``mutuality'' for insured depository institutions. Several commenters also specifically noted that complex
tax and accounting issues would be raised by the creation of such rights.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Only a relatively small percentage of the comments received, however, focused on the 9 specific issues targeted for
comment, though an overwhelming majority of the comments remarked that recent regulatory initiatives taken by the
FDIC, OTS, and state bank supervisory agencies were more than adequate to prospectively curb potential management
abuses and windfalls and appraisal deficiencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments received by the FDIC on the Notice were helpful and informative. In all, the FDIC believes that the Notice
was a useful means for the FDIC to obtain views from industry members and others on the issues surrounding mutual-to-stock
conversions. The FDIC will continue to monitor the conversion process and will continue to be mindful of potential
abuses; however, in light of comments received on the Notice, the Board has decided not to further pursue the suggestions
in the Notice or any other avenues to address the issues discussed in the Notice. The Board believes that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Any fundamental re-design of the conversion process should involve the appropriate legislative bodies, Congress
or State legislatures; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The industry and associated interests should offer their own solutions to any flaws in the current conversion
process.

The FDIC requested public comment on each of the specific requirements in the Proposed Rule and on other issues individually
identified in the Proposed Rule. In the Proposed Policy Statement and the Interim Rule the FDIC requested comment
on more general issues, including: What abuses are prevalent in mutual-to-stock conversions and why the FDIC should
take action against such abuses; whether federal oversight in conversions of State Savings Banks is necessary; whether
the FDIC should issue a regulation closely following the OTS conversion regulations or the FDIC should take a less
formal approach; whether the FDIC should seek Congressional action in this area; and the mechanics and substantive
provisions of the Interim Rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FDIC received 65 comments on the Proposed Rule: 29 from banks, savings banks, cooperative banks and savings associations;
11 from consultants, law firms and conversion agents; 9 from banking and thrift industry trade groups; 7 from state
banking and thrift regulators; 6 from consumer groups and individuals; 2 from United States Senators; and 1 from a
delegation of 10 United States Congressmen. In addition, the FDIC had received 85 written comments on the Proposed
Policy Statement and Interim Final Rule: 60 from banks, savings banks, cooperative bank and saving associations;
7 from bank and thrift industry trade groups; 6 from state banking and thrift regulators; 5 from individuals; 5 from
law firms; 1 from a bank holding company; and 1 from a regulatory ``shadow'' group.

1. The FDIC's Oversight Role 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, the comments acknowledged that there had been notable examples of insider abuse in mutual-to-stock conversions
of State Savings Banks in the recent past and suggested how future potential abuses could be avoided. Many of those
who commented recommended that the FDIC continue to play an oversight role in the mutual-to-stock conversions of
State Savings Banks, noting that federal oversight will continue to safeguard the integrity of the process. One noted
that ``present abuses in several recent and proposed conversions have demonstrated the need for the FDIC to maintain
oversight of the conversion process, to ensure that issues of both safety and soundness and of fiduciary care are identified
and adequately addressed''. A trade group commented that ``with recent publicity over some apparent abuses in the
[conversion] process and resulting Congressional concerns, *&blank;*&blank;* it is most appropriate and important
for the FDIC to assert regulatory jurisdiction over conversions by state nonmember banks''. One state regulator
noted that the Interim Final Rule was an ``excellent set of rules'' with a ``very conservative, realistic approach
to a situation which could have gotten out of hand if left to go unchecked''. One savings bank said simply that ``past
abuses [in mutual-to-stock conversions] support the need for FDIC oversight''.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters suggested that the FDIC have oversight authority of State Savings Bank mutual-to-stock conversions,
but with prescribed limitations. For example, a trade group noted that it ``deplores instances in which it can be demonstrated
that insiders involved in mutual-to-stock conversions received benefits so large that they bear no reasonable relationship
to the institution's performance *&blank;*&blank;*. Unjustifiable windfall profits, depletion of capital without
concern for safety and soundness and manipulation of the value of the institution to benefit limited interests are
practices that deserve close scrutiny and action by the appropriate authorities *&blank;*&blank;*. In responding
to these issues, the FDIC should act quickly and decisively in concert with the state authorities''. The trade group
further commented that the ``cornerstone'' for the FDIC's response to issues arising from the mutual-to-stock conversion
issue is the state regulatory authorities. One state thrift regulator expressed support for FDIC oversight of conversions
if such involvement assures ``reasonableness and relative uniformity of benefits for both state- and OTS-regulated
institutions *&blank;*&blank;* and allows state variation from OTS requirements if such variations benefit the
institution and the depositors''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One mutual savings bank noted that the FDIC should focus on broad safety-and-soundness issues and that detailed regulations,
like the OTS's, are not necessary. Another state mutual savings bank said that the FDIC should be involved in conversion
oversight, but only in terms of setting minimum standards rather than superseding state regulation. Many savings
banks in Massachusetts and a banking trade association in that state commented that the FDIC should issue conversion
regulations similar to the OTS and Massachusetts mutual-to-stock conversion regulations, noting that the FDIC
has broad statutory authority to regulate issues that affect safety and soundness. They commented that the FDIC's
focus should be to eliminate abuses in stock evaluation, depositor disclosures, depositors' ability to purchase
stock at conversion and insider compensation programs. They also asserted that state statutory and regulatory conversion
rules should not be superseded by federal law. Some who commented in this vein said that exemptions from FDIC regulation
should be granted on a state-wide (not bank-by-bank) basis for conversions subject to regulation by states that have
adequate conversion laws and rules. One mutual savings bank noted that promulgating federal laws or regulations
``should not be allowed when it is determined that state requirements are generally consistent or more stringent
than existing federal rules''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters contended that state regulation was sufficient in the area of mutual-to-stock conversions and that
the requirements in the Interim Rule and Proposed Rule are not necessary. One mutual savings bank asserted that the
``averments made by the FDIC in support of the Interim Rule that it is needed for safety and soundness reasons and to
protect the interest of depositors are without merit and are being offered only to support continued federal intrusion
into issues which are primarily the concern of state law and regulation.'' One state mutual savings bank stated that
the ``proposed policy statement is overkill'' and that ``state regulation can handle insider abuse issues.'' One
state banking and thrift regulator asserted that state regulators are not to blame for insider abuses in conversions
and that ``states' rights should not be tramped on''. The regulator suggested that a committee of state and federal
regulators work together to address issues and concerns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All those who commented on the issue expressed objection to Congressional legislation to address current issues
in mutual-to-stock conversions. One mutual savings bank commented that ``if the FDIC does not act, Congress will_in
an uninformed manner''. Another mutual savings bank noted that ``regulation is far preferable than legislation''.
A national banking industry trade group noted that the ``FDIC has full statutory authority in the conversion area
to ensure the integrity of the conversion process and no new legislation is necessary to address these issues''.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board has determined that each of the requirements in the final rule is necessary to satisfy specific FDIC concerns
about safety and soundness, breaches of fiduciary duty and other violations of law in connection with mutual-to-stock
conversions. At the same time, the FDIC believes that it is essential to consider the existence of state regulation
and supervision in determining the proper role in the conversion process for the FDIC as the primary federal regulator
of State Savings Banks. As discussed above, many of the comments that the FDIC received on the Proposed Policy Statement,
the Interim Rule and the Proposed Rule expressed agreement with the FDIC's federal oversight role in mutual-to-stock
conversions of State Savings Banks, but several also suggested the FDIC have a limited role in conversions of State
Savings Banks and that deference be paid to states' rights on issues outside the FDIC's areas of concern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the issuance of the final rule, the Board is attempting to strike the proper balance in this regard. In particular,
the final rule includes a provision stating that, in the event that a State Savings Bank proposing to convert determines
that compliance with any provision of the final rule would be inconsistent or in conflict with applicable state law,
the bank may file with the FDIC a written request for waiver of compliance with the provision. The request must demonstrate
that the requested waiver would not be detrimental to the safety and soundness of the bank, entail a breach of fiduciary
duty by the bank's management, or otherwise be detrimental or inequitable to the bank, its depositors, any other insured
depository institution(s), the federal deposit insurance funds or the public interest. In this connection, the
Board does not believe that state-wide exemptions from the requirements of the final rule are appropriate or practical.
Establishing exemption criteria and applying those criteria equitably and consistently would prove very difficult,
if not unrealistic. The Board prefers the case-by-case approach contained in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTS's concerns about avoiding insider abuses in mutual-to-stock conversions of federal and state savings associations
are the same as the FDIC's concerns about insider abuses in conversions of State Savings Banks. Thus, as noted above,
to the extent necessary and appropriate, the FDIC's final rule and the OTS Revisions include most of the same requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated in the Proposed Rule, many of the requirements of the final rule are prompted by the Board's concerns about
bank management's proper exercise of its fiduciary duties. As discussed in the preambles to the Interim Rule and the
Proposed Rule, the duties and obligations of directors/trustees and officers of mutual savings banks are identical
to the responsibilities the FDIC has historically enunciated and enforced concerning directors and officers of
commercial banks.

Directors/trustees (as well as officers) of mutual savings institutions are held to the same standard of care and
loyalty as directors and officers of stock banks. Thus, the directors/trustees and officers of mutual State Savings
Banks must fulfill their duty of loyalty to the institution by administering its affairs with the utmost candor, personal
honesty and integrity. They are prohibited from advancing their own personal or business interests or those of others
at the expense of the bank. This general fiduciary duty has been frequently interpreted to include an element of fairness
and good faith which, in the context of mutual-to-stock conversions, affords protection to the various stakeholders
(particularly depositors) of mutual savings banks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FDIC, through the final rule, also requires the directors/trustees and officers of mutual savings banks to adhere
to the same standards of loyalty and care that are required of directors and officers of stock institutions in order
to prevent insider abuse. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated throughout, the requirements in the final rule are rooted in concerns about safety and soundness, breaches
of fiduciary duty and/or other violations of law.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Appraisals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Proposed Rule included a requirement that State Savings Banks intending to convert to stock ownership submit
to the FDIC, along with the other required materials, a full appraisal report on the value of the converting bank and
the pricing of the conversion stock. As discussed in the Proposed Rule, many states require that a converting mutual
savings bank sell its capital stock at a total price equal to its estimated 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro forma
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 market value, based on an independent valuation. Despite this requirement, many converted institutions have exhibited
significant increases in the immediate post-conversion trading market price for the stock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As explained in detail in the Proposed Rule, the FDIC is concerned that the history of increases in market prices resulted
from appraisal reports (submitted in connection with these conversions) that significantly undervalued the stock_the
effect of which has several ramifications. If an appraisal is too low and the shares of stock are underpriced, the institution
receives less of an increase in capital than it should from the sale of conversion stock and the deposit insurance fund
is provided with less of a capital cushion than would have resulted if the stock sales price was based on a proper and
adequate appraisal. Also, an underpriced appraisal enriches the insiders who purchase or are granted a significant
interest in the converting institution by enticing them to undertake a conversion (in order to acquire shares below
their fair value) that may not be in the best interest of the institution. Sophisticated investors also are able to
benefit, undeservedly, from the sale of underpriced conversion stock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As also noted in the Proposed Rule, appraisers historically have set the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro forma
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 market value of the converting institution at a significant discount to a defined peer group. This gives rise to problems
involving selection of an inappropriate peer-group, inconsistencies between the assumptions in the appraisal
report and the business plan and unfounded justification for substantial new-issue discounts in stock offerings
that have been well oversubscribed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these reasons, the FDIC proposed requiring that a full appraisal be provided to the FDIC in a proposed mutual-to-stock
conversion of a State Savings Bank, and that the appraisal report be prepared by an independent appraiser and include
a complete and detailed description of the elements that make up the report, justification for the methodology employed
and sufficient support for the conclusions reached therein. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FDIC received several comments on the proposed appraisal requirements. Most who commented on this issue favored
the required submission of a full appraisal report. Some expressed concern, however, that an over-emphasis on immediate
post-conversion share price increases might force appraisers to overvalue the stock of converting institutions,
resulting in a detriment to the institution and its stockholders. They also suggested that there must be some expectation
of an early increase in stock price to entice investors to purchase stock of a converting mutual. A few of those commenting
said the FDIC should publish the standards it will use in judging appraisals. One suggested that the OTS and the FDIC
should issue joint appraisal standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A state savings association noted that one of the basic problems with conversions is the appraisal of the institution.
It stated that ``the FDIC needs to be satisfied that the various states are as well equipped [as the OTS staff] to perform
a definitive analysis of the appraisals as well as know with certainty that the appraiser is qualified to assess a financial
institution's value''. The commenter also noted that fairness and moderation are the keys to governing stock conversions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the comments received and the FDIC's view that the proper valuation of a converting mutual savings bank is
a crucial factor in assuring an equitable mutual-to-stock conversion, the Board has decided to adopt the appraisal
requirements in the Proposed Rule. Thus, the FDIC will continue to review appraisal reports to ensure that converting
institutions are properly valued and will continue to object to proposed conversions supported by unacceptable
appraisal reports. In reviewing appraisal reports, the FDIC also will continue to consider the appraisal standards
and guidelines, if any, of the applicable state and/or the appraisal guidelines issued by the OTS. The FDIC believes
that it is unnecessary to develop and implement a separate set of appraisal guidelines inasmuch as the various state
and the OTS guidelines are sufficient to provide the depository institutions' and the appraisal industry with parameters
necessary to prepare and furnish an acceptable appraisal report. In addition, the FDIC is aware of the Uniform Standards
of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP), especially Standards 9 and 10 which relate to business appraisals.
The Business Valuation Committee of the American Society of Appraisers commented that the USPAP standards are an
appropriate frame of reference for mutual-to-stock-conversion appraisals especially when such transactions
directly impact safety and soundness or involve issues of fundamental fairness to depositors and other stakeholders
in insured institutions. Adherence to those standards is expected in the appraisal process.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One specific issue that the FDIC received comments on is whether the appraiser employed to value a State Savings Bank
also should be permitted to serve as underwriter or selling agent in the bank's mutual-to-stock conversion. The main
concern is the possibility of a conflict of interest if the appraiser, or its affiliate, also is involved in the sale
of conversion stock. In reviewing the comments the Board has determined that the appraisal process and the independence
of the appraiser should not be tainted by an actual or even an appearance of a conflict of interest. Thus, under its appraisal
review the FDIC will object to appraisals prepared by an appraiser, or its affiliate, who also will serve as an underwriter
or selling agent in the same mutual-to-stock conversion. The FDIC will not raise this objection, however, where procedures
have been implemented and representations are made to ensure that an appraisal subsidiary is truly separate from
the selling agent subsidiary and the selling agent does not make recommendations on, or in any other way have an impact
upon, the appraisal.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Voting Requirement/Prohibition Against Running Proxies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Proposed Rule included a requirement that depositors and other stakeholders of a State Savings Bank vote in favor
of a mutual-to-stock conversion in order for the FDIC not to object to the proposed conversion. It also proposed a prohibition
on the use of running proxies in mutual-to-stock conversions of State Savings banks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in detail in the Proposed Rule, the Board believes that, in order for a board of directors or trustees of
a mutual savings bank to properly exercise its fiduciary responsibilities to the bank and its depositors, the board
should obtain a vote of depositors in favor of the proposed conversion before the proposed conversion is completed.
Most states, but not all, require a depositor vote for mutual-to-stock conversions. The OTS also requires both federal
and state savings associations to obtain a majority vote of association members as one of the pre-conditions to converting.
Some states, however, require only that the board of directors or trustees (or similar group) approve the plan of conversion
and do not require a vote of members. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As also discussed in the Proposed Rule, in the same vein, the Board also believes that a proxy specifically designed
for the proposed conversion should be used to obtain a depositor vote on the conversion. In some states the management
of converting banks and savings associations, subject to certain conditions, may use so-called ``running proxies''
(proxies obtained when a depositor opened his or her account with the institution) to vote in favor of the proposed
conversion. The former OTS mutual-to-stock conversion regulations also permitted the use of running proxies, under
certain circumstances. Running proxies are prohibited by the OTS Revisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FDIC received numerous comments on these related issues. Several of the comments voiced opposition to ``voting
rights'' for depositors in states that do not provide such rights. One state bank asserted that ``voting rights should
be left to state law. To impose some sort of depositor approval requirement in a state that does not have depositor voting
could lead to expanded ownership claims by depositors that could operate to the detriment of mutuals''. One state
regulator asserted that ``any FDIC requirement of a depositor vote in a mutual-to-stock conversion *&blank;*&blank;*
[would be] wholly unsupported by any expressly preemptive federal statute''. Many banks in Massachusetts commented
that any depositor voting right requirements imposed by the FDIC would put undue pressure on mutuals in that state
to convert to stock ownership. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An individual noted that general proxies should be prohibited and that all conversions should be subject to a special
proxy, or proxies should be entirely eliminated in favor of a majority-rules scheme. Others commented that the proposed
voting requirement and prohibition against running proxies would increase the cost of mutual-to-stock conversions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to these comments, the Board continues to believe that it is necessary and appropriate for the FDIC to require
a depositor vote on proposed conversions. Such a requirement will not necessarily contradict state laws (that do
not require a depositor vote), but will supplement the state law by requiring the member vote. The FDIC's concern is
with the board of directors'/trustees' proper exercise of its fiduciary duties of loyalty and care to the bank and
its depositors. The Board believes that the proper exercise of such duties requires that depositors, as stakeholders
of the bank, have the opportunity to approve or disapprove the proposed conversion. This requirement is, in part,
rooted in the concern that bank insiders often benefit personally from bank conversions. This almost inherent conflict
of interest (between self interest and the interests of the bank) may be mitigated by the existence of a depositor vote
on the proposed conversion. The Board also believes that any additional expense caused by the voting requirement
and prohibition against running proxies is outweighed by the need to ensure the proper participation of depositors
and other stakeholders in the proposed conversion. The final rule, therefore, adopts the requirement in the Proposed
Rule for a depositor vote in favor of the proposed conversion of a State Savings Bank to stock form.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board notes, however, that under the final rule the Board may grant exceptions, for good cause shown, from the requirements
of the final rule. In response to comments on this issue, on a case-by-case basis the Board will consider waiving the
depositor voting requirement if it is demonstrated, to the Board's satisfaction, that the alternative voting mechanism
established under the applicable state law satisfies the concerns expressed above about the need for a vote on the
conversion by parties that are not insiders and do not have a potential conflict of interest in reviewing the proposed
conversion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board also continues to believe that, given the material change in structure represented by the bank's conversion
to stock form, it is imperative that any vote on the proposed conversion be made on the basis of full and current information
on the proposed transaction. For that reason, the final rule prohibits the use of running proxies in such transactions.
This is in keeping with the FDIC's interest in assuring full disclosure of all information on the proposed conversion
in order to assure that approval of the proposed conversion is fully informed. Thus, the final rule adopts the prohibition
in the Proposed Rule on the use of running proxies in the mutual-to-stock conversion process.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Restrictions on Management Stock Benefit and MRPs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Proposed Rule included certain restrictions on insider benefits in mutual-to-stock conversions of State Savings
Banks. In particular, no converted savings bank would be permitted, for one year from the date of the conversion, to
implement a stock option plan or management or employee stock benefit plan, other than a tax-qualified employee stock
ownership plan, unless: Each of the plans is fully disclosed in the proxy solicitation and conversion stock offering
materials; all such plans are approved by a majority of the bank's stockholders, or in the case of a recently formed
holding company, its stockholders, prior to implementation and no sooner than the first annual meeting following
the conversion; in the case of a savings bank subsidiary of a mutual holding company, all such plans are approved by
a majority of stockholders other than its parent mutual holding company prior to implementation and no sooner than
the first annual meeting following the stock issuance; for stock option plans, stock options are granted at no lower
than the market price at which the stock is trading at the time of grant; and for management or employee stock benefit
plans, no conversion stock is used to fund the plans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These proposed restrictions were prompted by the FDIC's concerns about abuses in many past mutual-to-stock conversions.
As indicated in the Proposed Rule, based on a review of numerous proposed conversions, the Board believes that some
bank insiders may sacrifice the interests of their institutions and depositors in order to acquire significant amounts
of conversion stock and other benefits more advantageously than depositors. Also, in some instances, the issuance
of conversion stock to an MRP decreases the opportunity for depositors to obtain conversion stock. Moreover, the
issuance of stock options at the conversion price, rather than at the aftermarket trading price, which in many cases
has been substantially higher than the conversion price, creates the impression that insider enrichment may be the
main reason for the conversion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These factors can reflect negatively on management's fulfillment of its fiduciary obligations. In fact, it may be
an inherent conflict of interest for management to decide to convert the bank to stock form when, as part of the proposed
conversion, management will reap significant benefits. Independent business judgment is essential to the proper
carrying out of a manager's obligations. This judgment may be severely clouded when MRPs are provided as part of the
conversion transaction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FDIC received many comments on the issue of management benefits in conversions and on the proposed FDIC restrictions.
Several of them stated that insiders should share in the benefits of conversions because the insiders managed the
institution in a safe-and-sound manner. One state thrift regulator (and other commenters) suggested that MRPs be
based on the size of the institution and not on ``straight across-the-board percentages''. One national industry
trade group noted that ``avoiding the use of across-the-board percentages for MRPs and tailoring their availability
more to the size of the institution and their specific business plan objectives and needs would be a reasonable approach''.
One mutual savings bank noted that MRPs, stock option plans and employee stock ownership plans ``all encourage more
stock ownership and cement an identity among outside shareholders and those who run and work for the company''. It
also noted that OTS rules are workable in this regard and should be adopted by the FDIC. Another savings association
commented that conversions should not be permitted where there is excessive compensation for insiders, but ``without
benefits to insiders there will be no conversions''.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An individual commented that the FDIC should not regulate director remuneration in conversions of healthy mutuals
because those conversions do not place the insurance fund at risk and shareholders' votes are dispositive under the
``corporate waste'' doctrine. A law firm, commenting on behalf of a state thrift industry trade group, also noted
that compensation benefits are not a safety-and-soundness concern if the institution meets the applicable capital
requirements. In addition, it stated that a ``uniformity of benefits between state- and OTS-regulated conversions''
is necessary to assure the end of ``regulatory arbitrage''. A state regulator (and several other commenters) suggested
that the FDIC and OTS publish joint MRP guidelines permitting or prohibiting MRPs, along with specific rules therefore.
It noted that ``proper resolution of the MRP issue will have a substantial impact on fairness to depositors in conversions''.
One savings bank commented that ``when an institution contemplates going public for the right reasons (expansion,
market share, competitive advantage) the benefits should go to those willing to risk their careers (board and management
team) or their capital (shareholders) not to the faceless non-entity group known as the existing depositors''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A consumer group stated that the FDIC should impose specific limits on MRPs and stock options. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon consideration of the comments, the Board has decided to include in the final rule the requirements in the Proposed
Rule on insider benefits. The Board does not disagree that management of converting institutions should receive
reasonable benefit from the conversion because such insiders are responsible for the bank's success and will undertake
additional and perhaps more difficult challenges upon the bank's conversion to stock form. While the Board believes
that management and directors/trustees would have increased responsibilities as a public company, the Board believes
that, in most cases, market-based management compensation should be determined by the stockholders after the conversion
is completed. Such a determination is required by the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above, the Proposed Rule would have required that all MRPs be approved by a majority of the bank's stockholders,
or in the case of a recently formed holding company, its stockholders, prior to implementation and no sooner than the
first annual meeting following the conversion. The FDIC received several comments questioning whether stockholder
approval could be obtained at a special meeting, instead of an annual meeting.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
They noted that, with the existence of securities and corporate law requirements, there is no need for the FDIC to regulate
either the timing or type of the shareholder meeting at which shareholders vote on proposed insider benefits. In response
to these comments, the Board has determined that such approval may be obtained at any duly called meeting of shareholders,
either annual or special, to be held no sooner than six months after the completion of the conversion. The FDIC believes
that the six-month period will give the marketplace sufficient time to obtain and consider the financial data and
the shareholders sufficient time to become familiar with the finances and operations of the converted bank in order
to make an informed decision in voting to adopt such plans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The restrictions in the final rule on MRPs do not include specific percentage limitations. The FDIC believes that
the restrictions in the final rule will help safeguard against potential management self-interest in mutual-to-stock
conversions. The FDIC also will continue to look to MRP percentage limitations in the OTS regulations, as well as in
the applicable state law and regulations, as a frame of reference for reviewing proposed conversions of State Savings
Banks. The FDIC will presume that MRPs that do not conform with the applicable OTS MRP limitations constitute excessive
insider benefits and thereby evidence a breach of the board of directors' or trustees' fiduciary responsibility.
Bank management would have the burden of convincing the FDIC otherwise.

5. Eligibility Record Date, Priority to Depositors Residing in the Bank's Local Community (Local Depositor Preference),
Priority of ESOPs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Eligibility Record Date
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Proposed Rule included a requirement that the eligibility record date for determining the stock subscription
purchase priority for depositors of a State Savings Bank be set at no less than one year prior to the date of the board
of directors'/trustees' adoption of the plan of conversion (from mutual to stock form). As indicated in the Proposed
Rule, the Board believes that, in order for a board of directors/trustees of a State Savings Bank to carry out its fiduciary
responsibilities to the bank and its depositors, the board must assure an equitable and lawful conversion process.
From the numerous comments received and from a review of proposed and completed conversions, it is apparent that so-called
``professional depositors'', who place funds in mutual banks and savings associations in order to gain a purchase
priority if the institution converts to stock form, have reaped substantial profits on conversions of mutual institutions.
A proper exercise of fiduciary responsibilities toward the bank and its longer-term depositors dictates that ``professional
depositors'' not be allowed to experience windfall gains in conversions. Requiring that the eligibility record
date be no less than one year prior to the board's adoption of the plan of conversion will help assure that longer-term
depositors are more likely than professional depositors to benefit from the stock purchase priority.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many of those who commented on this issue expressed support for it. A state banking commissioner and a consumer group
each commented that a one-year eligibility record date would help curb insider abuses. One person said the FDIC should
not set an eligibility record date. Another person expressed support for the one-year eligibility requirement but
suggested that it might not weed out professional depositors because many of them have deposits with savings banks
for over a year. Another state regulator said a 90-day eligibility requirement might be sufficient. One bank said
180 days might be sufficient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Proposed Rule requested specific comment on whether the one-year period would be sufficient and on whether the
date chosen should be based on the board of directors'/trustees' first consideration of whether the bank should be
converted to the stock form of ownership. In general, those who commented on these issues were against extending the
record date beyond one year and relating it to a board of directors'/trustees' first consideration of whether the
bank should convert to stock form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the comments received on this issue, the Board has determined that the one-year period is sufficient and that,
given the factual nature of the requirement, attempting to establish a starting period based on when a bank's board
of directors/trustees first considered whether to convert to stock ownership would be very difficult to implement
and regulate. Thus, the Board has decided to adopt the eligibility record date requirement of the Proposed Rule because,
as stated in the comments, it properly protects the legitimate interests of core depositors and provides sufficient
assurance that long-term supporters of an institution are given priority. Also, as stated in the Proposed Rule, the
one-year period is a minimum time period. Converting State Savings Banks are encouraged to designate longer time
periods if appropriate to encompass longer-term depositors in the local communities served by the bank.

B. Local Depositor Preference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Proposed Rule also included a required stock purchase preference for eligible depositors in the bank's ``local
community'' or within 100 miles of a home or branch office of the converting bank. The FDIC proposed the Local Depositor
Preference requirement to promote local community participation by long-term depositors in the conversion process
and to ensure that the opportunity for local depositors to fully participate in the subscription offering in a mutual-to-stock
conversion is not diminished by large purchases made by ``professional depositors''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FDIC received numerous comments on this proposed requirement. Thirteen expressed support for the rule, contending
that the preference would rightfully promote local control of the bank and limit the participation of ``professional
depositors'' in conversions. They also noted that the Local Depositor Preference would give depositors in the local
community a more meaningful opportunity to participate in the conversion and reduce the problem of outside investors
tending to put undue pressure on management to achieve a higher stock value more rapidly than may be feasible through
safe and sound operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eight of those who commented on the proposed requirement opposed it, asserting that the rule constituted an unlawful
geographic discrimination. They contended that all depositors have ownership, voting and liquidation rights and,
thus, a subscription purchase priority should not be related to where a depositor lives. Several of those who commented
said that the rule should at least be modified to provide for long-term depositors who moved away from the bank; they
and others criticized the 100-mile rule as unworkable.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After a review of the comments and an internal review of the issue, the Board has decided to defer to the judgment of the
converting bank's board or directors or trustees and the applicable state law on whether a stock purchase priority
is provided to local depositors. The FDIC continues to believe, generally, that local depositors, collectively,
should be granted a preference because they typically have made significant long-term contributions to the financial
success of the converting State Savings Bank, in contrast to certain non-local depositors who have made deposits
solely in anticipation of a conversion. The FDIC also believes, however, any potential abuse by professional depositors
can and should be handled on a case-by-case basis by the converting bank's management, under the applicable state
law. Thus, the final rule does not require the local depositor preference contained in the Proposed Rule. The FDIC
will consider, on a case-by-case basis, the reasonableness of any local depositor preference included in a proposed
conversion. In that connection, the Board notes that it will not object to a local depositor preference based on the
definition of ``local community'' contained in the OTS Revisions.

C. Priority for ESOPs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule included a provision requiring that ESOPs not be accorded a higher subscription right priority
than ``eligible depositors''. As noted above, the term ``eligible depositors'' was defined as depositors holding
qualifying deposits at the bank as of a date designated in the bank's plan of conversion that is not less than one year
prior to the date of adoption of the plan of conversion by the converting bank's board of directors/trustees. This
proposed requirement was prompted by the Board's belief that ESOPs (tax-qualified or otherwise) should not be accorded
higher purchase priority rights than long-term depositors. This is in keeping with the principle of fiduciary duty
requiring that the board of directors/trustees of a State Savings Bank put the interest of long-term depositors ahead
of the interests of management and employees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FDIC received several comments on this proposed requirement. In essence, they were evenly divided between those
for and against the proposal. Those in favor of the requirement argued that eligible depositors of a converting State
Savings Bank should be accorded the first priority in purchasing stock in the conversion. Those opposed asserted
that the employees make the bank successful and, thus, should be accorded the first subscription priority. One group
commented that ESOP participants and eligible depositors should share priority on a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board does not disagree that ESOPs promote greater employee productivity and motivation and that the employees
of a State Savings Bank should be permitted to benefit, through the purchase of subscription stock by an ESOP, in the
bank's mutual-to-stock conversion. The Board continues to believe, however, that, under general principles of
fiduciary duty, ESOPs should not be accorded higher purchase priority rights than long-term depositors. Thus, the
Board has decided to include in the final rule the requirement that ``eligible depositors'' be accorded a higher subscription
priority than ESOPs.

6. Business Plans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Proposed Rule included a requirement that State Savings Banks that propose to undergo a mutual-to-stock conversion
submit a business plan including, among other things, a detailed discussion of how management intends to deploy the
capital raised through the sale of stock in the conversion, expected earnings resulting from the plan, and the justification
for any intended stock repurchases. The FDIC received five comments on this proposed requirement. All agreed that
a business plan should be required in connection with a proposed mutual-to-stock conversion of a State Savings Bank.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated in the Proposed Rule, for safety and soundness purposes the FDIC must know the institution's business
plan for post-conversion operation, growth and investment of any newly injected capital. The reason is that institutions
converting from mutual form undertake a major restructuring that possibly could lead to significant changes in the
nature or volume of business conducted. Converted institutions become answerable to shareholders for the first
time, and the shareholders are concerned with obtaining reasonable earnings on their investment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these reasons and upon consideration of the comments, the Board has adopted in the final rule the business plan
requirements of the Proposed Rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Stock Repurchases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Proposed Rule included a provision to prohibit State Savings Banks from repurchasing stock for one year following
the bank's conversion to stock form. After that period the FDIC would consider such proposed repurchases on a case-by-case
basis under section 18(i)(1) of the FDI Act (12 U.S.C. 1828(i)(1)) (Section 18(i)). Section 18(i) prohibits state
nonmember banks from reducing or retiring capital without the prior consent of the FDIC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FDIC received several comments on this issue, the majority of which opposed stock repurchase restrictions. Those
against it asserted that the inability to repurchase stock for one year would constitute an unnecessary and inappropriate
restriction on the ability of officers and trustees to carry out their duty to maximize the value of the shares of the
bank. Those for the restriction stated that it would help prevent insider abuse. One state regulator said any such
restriction should be determined by the bank's primary regulator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated in the Proposed Rule, the Board is concerned that a substantial stock buyback program begun immediately
after the bank's conversion to stock form may not have a legitimate business purpose and would raise issues about whether
the conversion stock was appropriately valued. The Board is also concerned that a recently converted institution
have a capital base adequate to safeguard against possible unexpected losses that may occur under the new organizational
structure. Thus, upon consideration of the comments, the Board has decided to implement the one-year restriction.
To allow for some flexibility in this respect, however, the final rule modifies the restriction to allow limited stock
repurchases up to 5 percent during the first year where compelling and valid business reasons are established. This
would give the FDIC the explicit ability to permit repurchases during the first year after the conversion where it
is in the best interests of the bank and its shareholders. All proposed stock repurchases by State Savings Banks are
considered by the FDIC on a case-by-case basis under section 18(i).

8. Merger/Conversions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In some cases mutual institutions convert to stock ownership simultaneously with a merger or acquisition transaction
with another depository institution or holding company. This is generally known as a merger/conversion. In merger/conversions
depositors of the converting institutions obtain the right to purchase stock in the acquiring institution and not
the converting savings bank. In exercising its fiduciary responsibilities the board of directors/trustees of a
mutual State Savings Bank must assure that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The value of the converting institution is fairly determined; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) That value is distributed to the proper constituents of the bank. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated in the Proposed Rule, based on the proposed conversions the FDIC has reviewed in the recent past and other
merger conversions it has studied, the Board has observed that, in virtually every merger conversion, the acquiring
institution has captured a large portion of the value of the converting institution. It has not been uncommon in merger/conversions
for the management of the converting mutual institution to receive extremely generous compensation and benefit
packages. Thus, an apparent conflict of interest exists: whether the management of a mutual institution is opting
for a merger/conversion, instead of a standard conversion or no conversion at all, based on the best interests of the
institution and its depositors or in response to the level of benefits offered to management by the acquiring entity.
As noted in the preamble to the Interim Rule and in the Proposed Rule, there have been numerous complaints by depositors
and others that permitting healthy mutual savings banks to be acquired by means of a merger/conversion has resulted
in some savings bank insiders putting their interests ahead of the interests of the converting bank and its constituents.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the Proposed Rule, the FDIC requested specific comment on this topic and specifically whether a moratorium should
be placed on merger/conversions involving sufficiently capitalized State Savings Banks. Most of those who commented
on the issue said the FDIC should not prohibit merger/conversions and that the FDIC should review such proposed transactions
on a case-by-case basis. A bank holding company commented that merger/conversions are desirable because they increase
competition in the industry and support safety and soundness. It noted that state law is the ``proper authority''
to regulate management compensation issues in merger/conversions. A state banking and thrift regulator suggested
that the FDIC and OTS collaborate in a joint determination on whether merger/conversions will be approved in the future
and, if so, adopt specific requirements to provide parity among savings associations and savings banks. A state banking
and thrift industry trade group recommended that merger/conversions be permitted only in the case of undercapitalized
institutions or at the discretion of the regulators on a case-by-case basis. A law firm commented that the FDIC should
publish the criteria that it intends to use in evaluating proposals. Another suggested that the OTS and the FDIC take
the same approach to merger/conversions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Others expressed general opposition to merger/conversions. A national consumer group said merger/conversions
should be prohibited. An individual commented that merger/conversions should not be allowed because they ``only
serve management's interests and not the depositors''. He suggested that any merger take place only after an initial
``free-standing'' standard conversion. A national banking and thrift industry trade group said it would not oppose
a ``regulatory pause by the FDIC to evaluate its rules governing merger/conversions''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon consideration of the comments and based on the factors discussed above, the Board continues to believe that merger/conversions
should, in most cases, be permitted only in situations where a State Savings Bank is ``undercapitalized'' ``significantly
undercapitalized'' or ``critically undercapitalized'', as defined in the FDIC's capital maintenance regulations.
The Board still believes, however, that it is unnecessary at this time to impose a blanket prohibition on non-supervisory
merger/conversions. Such merger/conversions may be considered in situations where the value of a State Savings
Bank is determined in a fair manner and that value is delivered to the rightful recipients, as determined by the directors/trustees
of the bank in the proper exercise of their fiduciary responsibilities under the applicable state law. In no instance
will an acquiring institution be considered a rightful recipient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to comments requesting that the FDIC specify, in its mutual-to-stock conversion regulations, the terms
and conditions of a merger/conversion that would be acceptable to the FDIC, the FDIC notes only the general criteria
that: (1) The value of the converting institution be fairly determined, and (2) the value be proposed to be distributed
to the proper constituents of the bank. Industry innovation is encouraged in this regard. State law factors also are
an important consideration. As noted above, because historically merger/conversions have been a source of considerable
insider abuse, the FDIC will continue to closely scrutinize such proposed transactions, particularly for potential
breaches of fiduciary duty. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Owing to the same historical concerns in this area, the OTS Revisions continue to prohibit non-supervisory merger/conversions.
In response to the comment that the FDIC and the OTS adopt similar regulations on merger/conversions, the FDIC notes
that, in its conversion regulations, the OTS retains its general waiver authority to permit a merger/conversion
under the appropriate circumstances. Thus, the OTS approach (that it would not prohibit a non-supervisory merger/conversion
in certain circumstances) is consistent with the FDIC's approach of considering merger/conversions on a case-by-case
basis.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As specified in the Interim Final Rule, one of the factors the FDIC currently considers in reviewing proposed conversions
of State Savings Banks is ``the extent of any existing and planned contributions to or investments in the community''.
In the Proposed Rule, the Board requested specific comment on whether the FDIC could and should consider imposing
a convenience-and-needs requirement in connection with the mutual-to-stock conversions of State Savings Banks.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FDIC received eight comments on this issue. Generally, they were evenly divided. Some argued that a convenience-and-needs
requirement should not be imposed because a conversion involves only a financial recapitalization and not a change
in services. Others said they favored such a requirement. Two comments that opposed the proposal questioned the FDIC's
legal authority to impose such a requirement. They also noted that the FDIC has ample opportunity to review a savings
bank's CRA performance in the context of a post-conversion CRA evaluation. One commenter suggested that it was a legislative,
not a regulatory, matter.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the comments received and an internal review of this issue, the Board has decided to consider, as part of its
review of proposed mutual-to-stock conversions of State Savings Banks, how the bank intends to serve, or continue
to serve, the convenience and needs of its community. This provision adds a convenience-and-needs component to the
factors the FDIC considers in reviewing proposed conversions of State Savings Banks, but does not impose a convenience-and-needs
or CRA requirement upon banks proposing to convert. In that regard, the FDIC will review the bank's business plan to
determine how the bank intends to serve, or continue to serve, the needs of its community. The final rule amends the
applicable provision in the Interim Final Rule to state that the FDIC will ``consider the bank's plans to fulfill its
commitment to serving the convenience and needs of its community''. To avoid confusion about whether a converting
bank is required to use conversion proceeds for community purposes, the reference in the Interim Final Rule to ``planned
contributions or investments in the community'' is deleted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, as indicated in the Proposed Rule, the ``convenience and needs of the community to be served'' by the applicant
is one of the statutory factors required to be considered by the Board in acting on applications for deposit insurance
(12 U.S.C. 1816). Thus, in connection with the review of mutual holding company reorganizations of insured depository
institutions_in which a deposit insurance application is required to be filed with the FDIC_the FDIC already does,
and will continue to, apply a convenience-and-needs test.

10. Comparison With OTS Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The requirements imposed by the final rule essentially parallel the OTS Revisions. As indicated in the Proposed Rule,
there are numerous other provisions in the OTS' mutual-to-stock conversion regulations (12 CFR 563b) that are not
included in either the FDIC Interim Rule or the Proposed Rule. Those OTS regulations include specific and detailed
requirements on, among other things: Items to be included in the plan of conversion, stock purchase priorities, percentage
limitations on stock purchases and MRPs, proxy solicitation and the form and content of proxy statements, the form
and content of offering circulars, accounting rules, liquidation accounts, notices of filing, availability of
conversion documents and pricing and sale of securities. In the Proposed Rule the FDIC requested specific comment
on whether, in order to achieve greater uniformity with the OTS's conversion regulations, the FDIC's conversion
regulations should be expanded to match the scope and depth of the OTS rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FDIC received very few comments on this issue. One argued that, because conversions overall are a matter of state
law, the FDIC should not issue detailed, OTS-type regulations. A national consumer group argued that the FDIC regulations
should be as encompassing as the OTS'. A law firm commented that the FDIC regulations should include the anti-takeover
provisions in the OTS rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board continues to believe that the requirements imposed by the final rule will enable the FDIC, in accordance
with its governing statutes, to monitor the conversions of State Savings Banks for issues involving safety and soundness,
fiduciary duty and violations of law. Under the final rule, the FDIC will continue to use the OTS regulations as a frame
of reference in reviewing proposed mutual-to-stock conversions of State Savings Banks. The FDIC also will continue
to look to the applicable state law and regulations in reviewing proposed conversions. The FDIC has a different statutory
basis for exercising its authority in this area than does the OTS and has not identified a need to adopt a more comprehensive
set of regulations addressing all aspects of the mutual-to-stock conversion process.

11. Mutual Holding Companies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Proposed Rule provided that the FDIC's mutual-to-stock conversion regulations also would apply, to the extent
appropriate, to reorganizations of State Savings Banks into the mutual holding company form of ownership. The FDIC
received few comments on the applicability of the Proposed Rule to mutual holding company reorganizations and corresponding
issuances of stock. One said that the final rule should either provide special rules for mutual holding companies
or defer to state laws on such reorganizations/conversions. Another person noted that the Proposed Rule was unclear
to what extent, if any, the FDIC would rely on OTS regulations regarding mutual holding company reorganizations.
The FDIC also received three comments that mutual holding companies should not be prohibited from waiving rights
to dividends paid by the subsidiary State Savings Bank. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule retains the statement included in the Proposed Rule that the FDIC's mutual-to-stock conversion rules
apply, where appropriate, to mutual holding company reorganizations of State Savings Banks. The Board continues
to believe that the FDIC's rules on mutual-to-stock conversions of State Savings Banks should apply, where applicable,
when a State Savings Bank reorganizes into the mutual holding company form of ownership. The valuation and insider
benefits issues in mutual holding company reorganizations are essentially the same issues present in standard mutual-to-stock
conversions. Thus, the FDIC has the same concerns about safety and soundness, breaches of fiduciary duty and other
violations of law in the context of mutual holding company reorganizations as it does regarding traditional mutual-to-stock
conversions. In this connection, the FDIC will use the applicable state law and the regulations issued by the OTS (12
CFR 575) as a frame of reference for reviewing proposed State Savings Bank mutual holding company reorganizations
and (contemporaneous and post-reorganization) stock issuances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FDIC also is directly involved in the mutual holding company reorganizations of federal and state savings associations.
That involvement entails FDIC action on the application for deposit insurance required to be filed with the FDIC in
such transactions for the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de novo 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
stock depository institution organized to facilitate the reorganization. In acting on applications for deposit
insurance the FDIC must consider the factors listed in section 6 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1816),
one of which is the ``general character and fitness of the management of the depository institution''. In the course
of that review the FDIC considers, among other things, the same issues of fiduciary duty that it considers in reviewing
proposed mutual-to-stock conversions of State Savings Banks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the typical interrelationship between the management of a mutual holding company and its subsidiary bank,
the FDIC will closely scrutinize for potential conflicts of interest mutual holding company reorganizations of
State Savings Banks and stock issuances simultaneous with or subsequent to a mutual holding company reorganization.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In that connection, as noted above, the FDIC received 3 comments that a mutual holding company should not be prohibited
from waiving rights to dividends paid by its subsidiary insured depository institution. Retaining at the insured
institution level dividends that otherwise would go to the mutual holding company increases the ownership interests
of the minority owners of the depository institution. Conversely, the owners of the mutual holding company lose an
interest in dividends that otherwise would be paid to them. This raises a conflict-of-interest issue where the directors/trustees
of the mutual holding company, who request the dividend waiver, also are the minority shareholders of the subsidiary
depository institution inasmuch as they will personally benefit from the waiver. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board believes that an effective way to address this apparent conflict of interest is to condition the FDIC's decision
not to object to a proposed mutual holding company reorganization (of a State Savings Bank) or deny a deposit insurance
application (in proposed mutual holding company reorganizations of savings associations) on such waived dividends
not being available for any distribution to minority shareholders. The FDIC intends to consider, on a case-by-case
basis, imposing such a condition in all mutual holding company reorganizations of State Savings Banks, as well as
in all deposit insurance applications filed in connection with mutual holding company reorganizations.

12. Securities Disclosure and Proxy Statement Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FDIC received a few comments suggesting that the FDIC indicate the standards it uses in reviewing the securities
disclosure documents and proxy materials involved in conversions of State Savings Banks. The Board believes that
full and meaningful disclosure to all parties is a critical element underlying the fairness of a proposed conversion.
Existing depositors and potential investors should be provided with readily understandable disclosures of material
facts and information as a basis for reaching an informed decision to vote or participate in the conversion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is the responsibility of the State Savings Bank proposing to convert to stock form to prepare offering and proxy
materials in accordance with acceptable disclosure standards for the industry. At a minimum, the notice of proposed
conversion filed with the FDIC should include offering and proxy materials that disclose the facts and considerations
sufficient to allow an interested recipient to make informed decisions on voting on the plan of conversion and/or
purchasing stock in the conversion. The State Savings Bank may choose whether to provide to the FDIC the minimum disclosures
in separate documents or in a ``wrap around'' form with the proxy statement attached. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The disclosure materials provided to the FDIC generally should consist of: (1) A proxy statement to solicit proxies
for a depositors' or members' special meeting to vote on the plan of conversion, and (2) an offering circular to be used
in a subscription and community offering of the newly created stock institution's common stock. In addition, the
FDIC staff reviews financial disclosures to check conformance with generally accepted accounting principles.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, the FDIC reviews disclosure materials for several different types of mutual-to-stock conversions and mutual
holding company reorganizations. These include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The formation of a new stock financial institution which is the successor to the mutual financial institution,
and which conducts a subscription and community offering of its common stock; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The formation of a stock holding company which is the owner of a newly created successor stock financial institution
and which conducts a subscription and community offering of the holding company's common stock; and (3) The formation
of a mutual holding company which owns a majority interest in a newly created successor stock financial institution
and which generally conducts a subscription and community offering of a minority interest in such subsidiary's common
stock.

13. Other Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two law firms suggested that the FDIC's review time on conversion notices be reduced from 60 days to 45 days because
of the potential that financial information might become ``stale'' under rules issued by the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the converting institution would have to go through the expense of producing updated financial statements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the issuance of the Interim Final Rule in February 1994 the FDIC has considered numerous proposed conversions.
Its experience to date indicates, generally, that the time periods of &sect;303.15 do not conflict with the conversion-review
time periods of other applicable state and federal regulators. The FDIC will continue to process notices of proposed
mutual-to-stock conversions as expeditiously as possible, but will retain the current 60-day time periods in &sect;303.15.
As discussed below, the final rule also includes an alternative time limit of up to 20 days after the last applicable
state or other federal regulator has acted on the proposed transaction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
V. Explanation of the Final Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Overview 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule adopts, with certain modifications, the provisions of the Interim Final Rule and the Proposed Rule.
Thus, it imposes certain substantive and procedural requirements upon State Savings Banks that propose to undergo
mutual-to-stock conversions. The Board has decided that it is necessary to issue the final rule to safeguard against
potential safety-and-soundness problems, breaches of fiduciary duty and other violations of law in mutual-to-stock
conversions of State Savings Banks. As part of the issuance of the final rule, the Board is withdrawing the Proposed
Policy Statement. That issuance served as a vehicle for the FDIC to obtain public comment on issues involved in mutual-to-stock
conversions and the appropriate role for the FDIC in the process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule will apply to all notices of proposed conversions (and mutual holding company reorganizations) filed
with the FDIC on and after January 1, 1995. Until that time, the FDIC intends to continue to use the case-by-case methodology
explained in the Interim Rule in reviewing notices of proposed conversions of State Savings Banks. Under the final
rule the FDIC intends to continue to use a case-by-case approach in reviewing aspects of proposed conversions that
are outside the scope of the specific requirements in the final rule. As part of that review the FDIC will consider the
applicable state laws and regulations and relevant OTS regulations. The overall determinant in the FDIC's consideration
of proposed conversions of State Savings Banks will be whether the proposal raises concerns about safety and soundness,
breaches of fiduciary duty and violations of law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Notice Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by the Interim Final Rule, the final rule requires State Savings Banks that propose to convert to stock
ownership to file with the FDIC a notice of intent to convert to stock form consisting of a description of the proposed
conversion accompanied by a copy of all documents and application materials filed with the applicable state and federal
regulators. The notice may be in letter form and must be provided to the FDIC (along with copies of the application materials)
at the same time the application materials are filed with the institution's primary state regulator. State Savings
Banks are prohibited from converting to stock form without complying with the substantive and procedural requirements
of the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FDIC will continue to review all conversion materials regarding State Savings Banks with a special interest in:
the use of the proceeds from the sale of stock, as prescribed in the business plan; the adequacy of the disclosure materials;
the participation of depositors in approving the transaction; the form of the proxy statement required for the vote
of the depositors/members on the conversion; any increased compensation and other remuneration (including stock
grants, stock option rights and other similar benefits) to be obtained by officers and directors/trustees of the
bank in connection with the conversion; the adequacy and independence of the appraisal of the value of the mutual savings
bank for purposes of determining the price of the shares of stock to be sold; the process by which the bank's directors/trustees
approved the appraisal, the pricing of the stock and the compensation arrangements for insiders; the nature and apportionment
of stock subscription rights; and the bank's plans to fulfill its commitment to serving the convenience and needs
of its community.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FDIC generally expects proposed conversions to substantially satisfy the standards found in the mutual-to-stock
conversions regulations of the OTS (12 CFR Part 563b). Any variance from those regulations will be closely scrutinized.
Compliance with OTS requirements will not, however, necessarily be sufficient for FDIC regulatory purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A bank's notice to the FDIC will not be deemed complete until the State Savings Bank provides the materials required
by the final rule, including any materials specifically requested by the FDIC after the bank's initial submission.
The FDIC will notify the institution when the notice is complete. The FDIC will issue to the converting bank a notice
of intent not to object to the proposed conversion, if the FDIC determines that the proposed conversion would not pose
a risk to the safety and soundness of the bank, violate any law or regulation or present a breach of fiduciary duty. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Interim Final Rule currently provides that when the FDIC intends to object to a proposed mutual-to-stock conversion
of a State Savings Bank it must do so within 60 days of receiving a complete notice of the proposed conversion. The FDIC,
in its discretion, may extend the initial 60-day period by another 60 days. The Interim Final Rule also provides that,
if the FDIC fails to object to a proposed conversion within those prescribed periods, an institution may consummate
the proposed conversion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon consideration of numerous proposed conversions since the issuance of the Interim Final Rule, the Board has found
that, in some cases, the maximum 120-day period prescribed in the Interim Final Rule is about to expire before the applicable
state or other federal regulator(s) (who also must act on the proposed transaction) has or have acted on the proposed
conversion. In order to provide the FDIC with sufficient time to act on a proposed conversion, the Board has included
in the final rule an alternative time limit of up to 20 days after the last applicable state or other federal regulator
has acted on the proposed transaction.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Appraisals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule requires that a full appraisal be provided to the FDIC in a proposed mutual-to-stock conversion of a
State Savings Bank, and that the appraisal report be prepared by an independent appraiser and include a complete and
detailed description of the elements that make up the report, the justification for the methodology employed and
sufficient support for the conclusions reached therein. This includes a full discussion of the applicability of
each peer group member and documented analytical evidence supporting any variance (above or below) the converting
institution may have from the peer group statistics. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FDIC requires a complete analysis of the institution's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro forma 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
earnings which should include the bank's full potential once it fully deploys the new capital pursuant to its business
plan. In reviewing appraisal reports the FDIC will continue to consider the appraisal standards and guidelines,
if any, of the applicable state and/or the appraisal guidelines issued by the OTS and the USPAP.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Voting Requirement and Prohibition on the Use of Running Proxies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule requires that a proposed conversion be approved by a vote of at least a majority of the bank's depositors
and, as reasonably determined by the bank's directors or trustees, other stakeholders of the bank who are entitled
to vote on the conversion, unless the applicable state law requires a higher percentage, in which case the higher percentage
must be used. The final rule also prohibits the use of running proxies in mutual-to-stock conversions of State Savings
Banks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Restrictions on Management Stock Benefit and MRPs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule provides that no converted savings bank shall, for one year from the date of the conversion, implement
a stock option plan or management or employee stock benefit plan, other than a tax-qualified employee stock ownership
plan, unless: each of the plans is fully disclosed in the proxy solicitation and conversion stock offering materials;
all such plans are approved by a majority of the bank's stockholders, or in the case of a recently formed holding company,
its stockholders, prior to implementation at a duly called meeting of shareholders, either annual or special, to
be held no sooner than six months after the completion of the conversion; in the case of a savings bank subsidiary of
a mutual holding company, all such plans are approved by a majority of stockholders other than its parent mutual holding
company prior to implementation at any duly called meeting of shareholders, either annual or special, to be held no
sooner than six months after the stock issuance; for stock option plans, stock options are granted at no lower than
the market price at which the stock is trading at the time of grant; and for management or employee stock benefit plans,
no conversion stock is used to fund the plans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The MRP restrictions do not include specific percentage limitations. The FDIC will continue to look to MRP percentage
limitations in the applicable state law and regulations, as well as in the OTS regulations, as a frame of reference
for reviewing proposed conversions of State Savings Banks. The FDIC will presume that MRPs that do not conform with
the applicable OTS MRP limitations constitute excessive insider benefits and thereby evidence a breach of the board
of directors' or trustees' fiduciary responsibility. Bank management would have the burden of convincing the FDIC
otherwise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Eligibility Record Date and Priority of Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Eligibility Record Date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule requires that the eligibility record date for determining stock subscription rights be no less than
one year prior to the date the board of directors/trustees approves the plan of conversion to convert from the mutual
to stock form of ownership. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Priority for ESOPs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule requires that ``eligible depositors'' be accorded a higher subscription priority than ESOPs. ``Eligible
depositors'' are defined as depositors holding qualifying deposits at the bank as of a date designated in the bank's
plan of conversion that is not less than one year prior to the date of adoption of the plan of conversion by the converting
bank's board of directors/trustees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Submission of Business Plans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule requires that State Savings Banks that propose to undergo a mutual-to-stock conversion submit a business
plan which must include, in part, a detailed discussion of how the capital acquired in the conversion will be used,
expected earnings resulting from the plan and a justification for any proposed stock repurchases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
8. Post-Conversion Stock Repurchases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule provides that an insured mutual state savings bank that has converted from the mutual to stock form of
ownership may not repurchase its capital stock within one year following the date of its conversion to stock form,
except that stock repurchases of no greater than 5% of the bank's outstanding capital stock may be repurchased during
this one-year period where compelling and valid business reasons are established, to the satisfaction of the FDIC.
Any stock repurchases are subject to the requirements of Section 18(i). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
9. Mutual Holding Companies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule retains the statement included in the Proposed Rule that the FDIC's mutual-to-stock conversion rules
apply, where appropriate, to mutual holding company reorganizations of State Savings Banks. The FDIC will use the
applicable state law and the regulations issued by the OTS (12 CFR 575) as a frame of reference for reviewing proposed
State Savings Bank mutual holding company reorganizations and (contemporaneous and post-reorganization) stock
issuances.

 In addition to complying with the substantive requirements in &sect;333.4 of this chapter, an insured state-chartered
mutually owned savings bank that proposes to convert from mutual to stock form shall file with the FDIC a notice of intent
to convert to stock form and copies of all documents filed with state and federal banking and/or securities regulators
in connection with the proposed conversion. An institution that is in the process of converting to stock form that
has filed a proposed stock conversion application with the applicable state and federal regulators (or otherwise
has initiated a stock conversion) prior to the effective date of this section shall file the required materials with
the FDIC as soon as practicable. An insured mutual savings bank chartered by a state that does not require the filing
of application materials to convert from mutual to stock form that proposes to convert to the stock form shall notify
the FDIC of the proposed conversion and provide the materials requested by the FDIC.

Review by FDIC.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) The FDIC shall review the materials submitted by the institution seeking to convert from mutual to stock form.
The FDIC, in its discretion, may request any additional information it deems necessary to evaluate the proposed conversion
and the institution shall provide such information to the FDIC expeditiously. Among the factors to be reviewed by
the FDIC are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The use of the proceeds from the sale of stock, as prescribed in the business plan; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The adequacy of the disclosure materials; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The participation of depositors in approving the transaction; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The form of the proxy statement required for the vote of the depositors/members on the conversion; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Any increased compensation and other remuneration (including stock grants, stock option rights and other similar
benefits) to be obtained by officers and directors/trustees of the bank in connection with the conversion; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) The adequacy and independence of the appraisal of the value of the mutual savings bank for purposes of determining
the price of the shares of stock to be sold; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) The process by which the bank's trustees approved the appraisal, the pricing of the stock and the compensation
arrangements for insiders; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) The nature and apportionment of stock subscription rights; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ix) The bank's plans to fulfill its commitment to serving the convenience and needs of its community. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In reviewing the materials required to be submitted under this section, the FDIC will take into account the extent
to which the proposed conversion conforms with the various provisions of the mutual-to-stock conversion regulations
of the Office of Thrift Supervision (12 CFR Part 563b), as currently in effect at the time the FDIC reviews the required
materials related to the proposed conversion. Any non-conformity with those provisions will be closely scrutinized.
Conformity with the OTS requirements, however, will not be sufficient for FDIC regulatory purposes if the FDIC determines
that the proposed conversion would pose a risk to the institution's safety and soundness, violate any law or regulation
or present a breach of fiduciary duty. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notification of completed filing of materials.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The FDIC shall notify the institution when all the required materials related to the proposed conversion have been
filed with the FDIC and the notice is thereby complete for purposes of computing the time periods designated in paragraphs
(e) and (g) of this section.

 If the FDIC determines, in its discretion, that the proposed conversion would not pose a risk to the institution's
safety and soundness, violate any law or regulation or present a breach of fiduciary duty, then the FDIC shall issue
to the bank seeking to convert, within 60 days of receipt of a complete notice of proposed conversion or within 20 days
after the last applicable state or other federal regulator has acted on the proposed conversion, whichever is later,
a notice of intent not to object to the proposed conversion. The FDIC may, in its discretion, extend by written notice

shall not be consummated until such letter is rescinded. A copy of the letter of objection shall be furnished to the
institution's primary state regulator and any other state or federal banking and/or securities regulator involved
in the conversion. The letter of objection shall advise the institution of its right to petition the FDIC for reconsideration
under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;303.6(e). Such action shall not, in any way, prohibit the FDIC from taking any other action(s) that it may deem

Scope.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This section applies to the conversion of insured mutual state savings banks to the stock form of ownership. It supplements
the procedural and other requirements for such conversions in &sect;303.15 of this chapter. This section also applies,
to the extent appropriate, to the reorganization of insured mutual state savings banks to the mutual holding company
form of ownership. As determined by the Board of Directors of the FDIC on a case-by-case basis, the requirements of
paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of this section do not apply to mutual-to-stock conversions of insured mutual state savings
banks whose capital category under &sect;325.103 of this chapter is ``undercapitalized'', ``significantly undercapitalized''
or ``critically undercapitalized''. The Board of Directors of the FDIC may grant a waiver in writing from any requirement
of this section for good cause shown.

Conflicts with state law.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the event that an insured mutual state savings bank that proposes to convert to the stock form of ownership finds
that compliance with any provision of this section would be inconsistent or in conflict with applicable state law,
the bank may file a written request for waiver of compliance with such provision by the FDIC. In making such request,
the bank shall demonstrate that the requested waiver, if granted, would not result in any effects that would be detrimental
to the safety and soundness of the bank, entail a breach of fiduciary duty on part of the bank's management or otherwise
be detrimental or inequitable to the bank, its depositors, any other insured depository institution(s), the federal
deposit insurance funds or to the public interest.

Requirements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In addition to other requirements that may be imposed by the applicable state statutes and regulations and other federal
statutes and regulations, including &sect;303.15 of this chapter, an insured mutual state savings bank shall not
convert to the stock form of ownership unless the following requirements are satisfied: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Eligible depositors shall have higher subscription rights than employee stock ownership plans; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The proposed conversion shall be approved by a vote of at least a majority of the bank's depositors and, as reasonably
determined by the bank's directors or trustees, other stakeholders of the bank who are entitled to vote on the conversion,
unless the applicable state law requires a higher percentage, in which case the higher percentage shall be used. Voting
may be in person or by proxy; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Management shall not use proxies executed outside the context of the proposed conversion to satisfy the voting
requirement imposed in the previous paragraph; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) In addition to the materials to be submitted to the FDIC pursuant to &sect;303.15(c) of this chapter, the bank must

(i) A full appraisal report on the value of the converting bank and the pricing of the stock to be sold in the conversion.
The report must be prepared by an independent appraiser and must include a complete and detailed description of the
elements that make up an appraisal report, justification for the methodology employed and sufficient support for
the conclusions reached therein, including a full discussion of the applicability of each peer group member and documented
analytical evidence supporting any variance (above or below) the institution proposing to convert may have from

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 An insured mutual state savings bank that has converted from the mutual to stock form of ownership may not repurchase
its capital stock within one year following the date of its conversion to stock form, except that stock repurchases
of no greater than 5% of the bank's outstanding capital stock may be repurchased during this one-year period where
compelling and valid business reasons are established, to the satisfaction of the FDIC. Any stock repurchases shall
be subject to the requirements of section 18(i)(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1828(i)(1)).

Stock benefit plan limitations.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The FDIC will presume that a stock option plan or management or employee stock benefit plan that does not conform with
the applicable percentage limitations of the regulations issued by the Office of Thrift Supervision constitutes
excessive insider benefits and thereby evidences a breach of the board of directors' or trustees' fiduciary responsibility.
In addition, no converted insured mutual state savings bank shall, for one year from the date of the conversion, implement
a stock option plan or management or employee stock benefit plan, other than a tax-qualified employee stock ownership
plan, unless each of the following requirements is met: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Each of the plans was fully disclosed in the proxy solicitation and conversion stock offering materials; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) All such plans are approved by a majority of the bank's stockholders, or in the case of a recently formed holding
company, its stockholders, prior to implementation at a duly called meeting of shareholders, either annual or special,
to be held no sooner than six months after the completion of the conversion; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) In the case of a savings bank subsidiary of a mutual holding company, all such plans are approved by a majority of
stockholders other than its parent mutual holding company prior to implementation at a duly called meeting of shareholders,
either annual or special, to be held no sooner than six months following the stock issuance; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) For stock option plans, stock options are granted at no lower than the market price at which the stock is trading
at the time of grant; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) For management or employee stock benefit plans, no conversion stock is used to fund the plans.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS or Agency), is issuing a final rule to revise its regulations governing conversions
from mutual-to-stock form and mutual savings and loan holding companies. On May 3, 1994, the OTS issued an interim
final rule with request for comment and a proposed rule with request for comment. The interim final rule contained
amendments to the OTS's mutual-to-stock conversion regulations (conversion regulations) designed to strengthen
the standards governing conversions and to ensure the integrity of the conversion process. The proposed rule contained
a new ``convenience and needs'' test to be added to the approval standards for conversion transactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule includes revisions made to the interim final rule that reflect OTS's consideration of the comments
it received during the 45-day comment period following publication of the interim final rule. In addition, this final
rule also addresses the comments received by the OTS during the 75-day comment period following publication of the
proposed rule and adopts the proposed rule without modification. Finally, this final rule incorporates certain
technical changes to the regulations governing mutual-to-stock conversions and mutual savings and loan holding
companies.

local community; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(F) prohibited management stock benefit plans in a conversion; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(G) limited merger conversions to institutions that qualify for a conversion, i.e., financially-weak institutions;

(J) prohibited the repurchase of a converted association's stock within one year of conversion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim final rule did not propose any changes to the prohibition in the OTS conversion regulations on the transfer
or sale of subscription rights or similar ``free distribution'' schemes, but did request comment on whether subscription
rights should continue to be nontransferable, or if transferability is recommended, the reasons for, and the manner
in which to allow for, such transfer. Finally, the interim final rule made preliminary conversion proxy materials
available to the public and incorporated certain technical changes to the OTS's regulations governing mutual savings
and loan holding companies.

Separately, the OTS published a proposal to amend the conversion regulations and the regulations governing stock
offerings by savings association subsidiaries of mutual holding companies (MHC stock offerings) by adding a new
``convenience and needs'' standard to existing approval standards for such transactions.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The public comment period for the interim final rule closed on June 17, 1994. The OTS received 75 comment letters. Twenty-seven
comment letters were submitted by financial institutions or their holding companies, including 20 letters from
federally-chartered savings associations and seven letters from other financial institutions and holding companies.
Of the remaining 48 comment letters, persons in their individual capacity submitted 15, law firms submitted 13, state
trade associations submitted six, a national trade association submitted one, city and state banking commissioners
submitted three, various groups representing financial institutions submitted seven, a financial regulatory
``shadow'' group submitted one and certified public accountants submitted two. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment period on the proposed convenience and needs rule closed on July 18, 1994. The OTS received 12 comment letters,
including five from trade associations and similar groups representing financial institutions, two from law firms
representing thrifts, two from persons in their individual capacity, one from a state thrift regulatory authority,
one from an association of state thrift regulatory authorities and one from a federally-chartered savings bank.

A. Revisions to the Appraisal Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted in the preamble to the interim final rule, the integrity of the OTS' current conversion program rests, in large
part, on the existence of independent and accurate appraisals of converting associations.

 When the initial conversion regulations were adopted in 1974, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the predecessor agency
to the OTS, expressed concerns about underpricing conversion stock and stated that no method of conversion could
be considered equitable unless the conversion stock was accurately appraised and sold at its

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OTS believes that the appraisal process has adequately addressed conversion valuation issues during most of
the period since 1974. As also noted in the preamble to the interim final rule, however, the OTS has been concerned that
some recent appraisals were setting 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro forma
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 market values that were significantly below the market value of the converting association. In response to these
concerns, the OTS, in the interim final rule, revised the conversion regulations to formalize the current practice
of requiring a full appraisal report and justification for the methodology employed. The OTS also clarified the provision
in the conversion regulations that requires that the conversion applicant submit information demonstrating, to
the satisfaction of the OTS, the independence and expertise of the appraiser. The revised regulations allow the OTS
to censure, suspend or bar an appraiser from practicing before the OTS in egregious cases of consistent undervaluation
on the part of an appraiser.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OTS further revised the appraisal rules to provide that in those instances where the initial appraisal report is deemed
to be materially deficient and/or substantially incomplete, the OTS may deem the entire conversion application
materially deficient and/or substantially incomplete, and require the filing of a new application.

The OTS has recently issued updated staff guidance for conversion appraisers that provides specific details on appraisal
methodology as well as report content, and also incorporates provisions 9 and 10 of the Uniform Standards of Professional
Appraisal Practice. In adopting the guidelines, the OTS consulted with the FDIC to ensure uniform appraisal standards.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, the OTS requested public comment on whether it should amend its regulations to prohibit an appraiser or its
affiliates from also serving as an underwriter or selling agent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approximately 25% of the comments addressing appraisal standards affirmatively supported the requirement that
a full appraisal report and justification for methodology employed be required to insure a ``fair value'' assessment
of an institution. One commenter cautioned against an attempt to eliminate any ``pop'' or ``post conversion windfall,''
and suggested management of such price increases instead, by limiting them to a reasonable percentage. Eleven commenters
expressed concern that market forces cannot be regulated, that appraisals and pricing of stock are not exact sciences,
and that the revisions may force the stock to be overvalued. One of the eleven stated that the stock market is not predictable
enough to institutionalize an expectation that the stock of every institution will trade within a fixed parameter
following conversion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requested that the terms ``materially deficient'' and ``consistently undervalued'' be defined and
another commenter requested that the term ``independence'' be defined and that the OTS provide guidance as to the
appropriate degree of participation by management in the appraisal process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stated that the OTS should deal with the appraiser directly when an initial appraisal report is materially
deficient or substantially incomplete and should not penalize the thrift; another commenter stated that the OTS
should give institutions time to correct inappropriate appraisals without the need to file costly new conversion
applications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eleven commenters addressed the issue of whether to prohibit appraisers or their affiliates from also serving as
underwriters or selling agents. Six stated that appraisal firms should be separate from firms that market conversion
stock so as to avoid all potential conflicts of interest. One of the six further stated that underwriters or selling
agents in one situation may not be able to be objective as appraisers in another situation and that if an attorney continually
uses the same appraiser, that appraiser becomes a quasi-affiliate of the attorney, with questionable independence.
Five expressed the view that there was no evidence of abuse where the appraiser and selling agent are the same parties,
that the two functions can be impartially carried out and that to require different parties is costly and detrimental
to small thrifts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In implementing revisions to the appraisal regulations, the OTS was not attempting to create an appraisal system
that would result in precise conformity between appraisal values and post-conversion stock prices. The OTS, however,
remains concerned about significant discrepancies between appraisal values and immediate post-conversion trading
prices. The OTS also recognizes that there will be circumstances that could not reasonably have been foreseen by an
appraiser that may result in pricing discrepancies in a particular transaction. As noted in the preamble to the interim
final rule, however, when there is a consistent pattern of discrepancies by a particular appraisal firm, the independence
and competence of the appraiser is called into question.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The terms ``materially deficient'' and ``consistently undervalued'' as used in the regulation are heavily dependent
upon the facts and circumstances of each transaction or group of transactions. Because there is no ``bright-line''
test that can be applied to these terms, the OTS does not believe that it would be useful to further define these terms.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the comment that the converting association should not be penalized for a materially deficient or
substantially incomplete appraisal and the comment that the converting association should be given the opportunity
to correct the faulty appraisal, the OTS does not believe that any change to the interim final rule is warranted. While
management of a converting association may properly rely on the opinion of an independent appraiser in valuing conversion
stock, it is ultimately the fiduciary responsibility of management to ensure that the converting association is
properly priced for sale. The converting association also is ultimately responsible for the quality of the work of
all of its agents, including its attorneys, accountants and selling agent, as well as its appraiser, and thus, should
exercise due care in the hiring of such parties to ensure that qualified advisors and experts have been retained on
behalf of the association. In any instance where a materially deficient conversion application is submitted, whether
as a result of significant legal, accounting, appraisal or other deficiencies, the OTS retains the right to deem the
application materially deficient and reject it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As to the issue of permitting ``corrections'' to inadequate appraisals submitted to the OTS, the purpose of rejecting
conversion applications containing faulty appraisals is to encourage applicants to file applications that are
substantially complete and that comply with regulatory requirements. If there are no consequences of filing an application
that is substantially incomplete, there is less incentive to submit an adequate appraisal. In addition, given limited
OTS staff resources, it is unfair to delay review of complete conversion applications with adequate appraisals by
devoting inordinate amounts of OTS staff time to multiple reviews of applications with inadequate appraisals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTS believes that there is an appropriate role for officers of a converting association in the preparation of an
appraisal. The OTS expects that the appraiser will consult with officers of the association in preparing the appraisal
because the officers will often be the sole source of information about certain aspects of the current and future business
operations of the association. It is not appropriate, however, for the officers to attempt to influence or to interfere
with the independence of the appraiser. Similarly, appraisers seeking engagement with a converting institution
should not in any manner suggest that they can provide a ``lower'' valuation than other appraisers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The board of directors has a primary responsibility to hire the appraiser and to review the appraisal report. The board
of directors is entitled to rely on the appraiser's expertise. As with officers, it would be inappropriate for the
board of directors to influence or interfere with the independence of the appraiser.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The board of directors also retains the authority to reject an appraisal or to dismiss an appraiser. In such a case,
the OTS would conduct the same type of review that it does when a savings association dismisses its accounting firm
or rejects an accounting firm's opinion.

The interim final rule requested comment on whether appraisers or their affiliates should be prohibited from also
serving as underwriters or selling agents in a conversion. A majority, albeit a narrow one, of those who commented
on this aspect of the interim final rule were in favor of a prohibition on firms serving in both roles. Upon review of
the comments, the OTS has determined that, as discussed in the interim final rule, the appraisal process and the independence
of the appraiser should not be tainted by even the appearance of a conflict of interest. Although the same firm infrequently
performs both these services and the OTS is not aware of any serious problems when it has, the final rule generally prohibits
a firm from this dual service, except where procedures are followed and representations made to ensure that an appraiser
is separate from the underwriter or selling agent affiliate and the underwriter or selling agent affiliate does not
make recommendations or in any way impact the appraisal. Additionally, the final rule prohibits the appraiser from
receiving any fees other than the fees for services rendered in connection with the appraisal.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Prohibition on Use of ``Running'' Proxies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The conversion regulations have been revised to prohibit the use of ``running'' proxies and to require the use of a
proxy specifically designated for the conversion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The majority of commenters addressing the revision supported the prohibition of ``running'' proxies because it
better ensures that members understand the proposed change in the association's organization. A few commenters
expressed concern for the high costs of using professional proxy solicitation firms but none thought the costs were
overly burdensome. Those commenters who opposed the prohibition asserted that there were already sufficient safeguards,
that the old rule worked well since ``running'' proxies were only used if a member did not send a proxy or vote in person,
that detailed disclosure was included in the proxy statements, and that the prohibition is an added expense for converting
institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter recommended adoption of a requirement that 50% of those voting approve the conversion, rather than
the existing requirement that the conversion be approved by a 50% vote of all depositors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTS agrees with the majority of commenters and continues to believe that the prohibition of ``running'' proxies
is the most effective manner in which to assure an increased role for an association's membership in the conversion
process. Accordingly, no change has been made to the interim final rule. Thus, 12 CFR 563b.6(e) will continue to require
approval of the plan of conversion by at least a majority of the total outstanding votes of the association's members,
unless state law requires a higher percentage for a state-chartered converting savings association, in which case
the higher percentage will be used. Finally, the final rule revises section 575.13(a)(4) of the mutual savings and
loan holding companies regulation to clarify the prohibition on the use of ``running'' proxies and the requirement
for the use of a specifically designated proxy for a mutual holding company reorganization, mutual-to-stock conversion
undertaken either by a mutual savings association or a mutual holding company, or any other material transactions.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Re-Prioritize Stock Purchase by Tax-Qualified Employee Stock Ownership Plans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its interim final rule, the OTS revised the stock purchase priorities so as to give eligible account holders first
priority and tax-qualified employee stock benefit plans second priority. The conversion regulations continue
to give supplemental eligible account holders third priority and all other voting members who have subscription
rights fourth priority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A majority of the commenters recommended that the ESOP be given first priority; a few commenters affirmatively supported
giving the ESOP second priority. The commenters that recommended giving the ESOP first priority asserted that employees
make the organization successful and should have the first stake in the company's performance, that the plans do not
favor higher paid officers, but promote greater productivity and motivation, that the plans do not prevent long-term
depositors from purchasing conversion stock, and that they protect institutions from hostile takeover situations.
These commenters further asserted that if the ESOP is not established in the conversion, it will be established later
and will dilute shareholders' ownership interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters requested that the methodology for distribution of shares in the event of oversubscription be clarified.
The commenters requested that the regulation be written to make clear the intent that the ESOP would be able to purchase
stock through open market purchases or through authorized but unissued shares in the event of an oversubscription.
If this was not the intent of the regulation, one commenter requested that the OTS clarify that it will grant a waiver
or no-action letter to permit the ESOP or any other tax-qualified plan to purchase shares in the open market immediately
following conversion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated in the preamble to the interim final rule, although the OTS believes that it is still appropriate to provide
management incentives and to encourage employee stock ownership in the converted association, these interests
have been overshadowed by other factors. The former provision which granted a first priority to tax-qualified employee
benefit plans was a means to afford undercapitalized mutual savings associations a measure of anti-takeover protection
through the opportunity to place a significant block of conversion stock in friendly hands, and thus, encourage capital
raising through conversion. Because most mutual savings associations are now healthy, there is a need to balance
the interests of management and employees against those of account holders by providing core depositors at mutual
savings associations the first opportunity to buy conversion stock. The final rule will continue to give eligible
account holders first priority. The wording of 12 CFR 563b.3(c)(23) has been revised to clarify that eligible account
holders have first priority to purchase conversion stock, tax-qualified employee stock benefit plans have second
priority, supplemental eligible account holders have third priority, and other voting members who have subscription
rights have fourth priority.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Also, as prescribed by 12 CFR 563b.3(c)(23), and further clarified in the final rule, if the final conversion stock
valuation exceeds the maximum conversion stock offering range, up to ten percent of the total offering of shares may
be sold to the tax-qualified employee stock benefit plans. This provision generally will allow ESOPs to be allocated
stock during periods of an active and strong thrift securities market; however, such allocation generally will not
be available when the final pro forma market value as approved by the OTS and disclosed in the stock offering materials
does not exceed the maximum conversion stock offering range.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 If the ESOP is not able to purchase conversion stock, the ESOP or any other tax-qualified plan may purchase shares in
the open market or utilize authorized but unissued shares only with prior OTS approval. Disclosure must be made in
the conversion stock offering materials of the potential open market purchases or use of authorized but unissued
shares to fund the ESOP and its effect on the association and its shareholders. The final rule reflects these clarifications.

D. Revision to Eligibility Record Date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OTS currently requires that the eligibility record date (ERD) be set at a date no less than one year prior to board
of director approval of the plan of conversion. In the interim final rule, the OTS also requested public comment as
to whether a longer minimum time period would be appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The majority of commenters supported the revision to the ERD based on the reasoning that it properly protects the legitimate
interests of core depositors and provides sufficient assurance that long-term supporters of an institution are
given priority. A couple of commenters recommended setting a maximum time limit of two years and one recommended not
extending beyond one year; one requested that ``depositor'' be defined as one who has ``savings in any type of a deposit
account of at least $100 continuously during the eligibility period.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters disagreed with the revision because it eliminates legitimate local depositors and is impractical
since accurate records about depositors are not readily available. One commenter noted that directors and executive
officers will have to plan further ahead, maintaining records for longer periods of time. Two commenters stated that
the revision has no effect since professional investors are in place for a considerable period. One commenter recommended
waivers for institutions of $100 million or less that can demonstrate that information is not available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters suggested eliminating the supplemental eligible account holder category, because the date for
determining such account holders is close to the record date, and therefore duplicative, or in the alternative, setting
a supplemental eligibility record date (SERD) only if the ERD is more than 18 months prior to the date of the latest application
amendment filed before OTS approval. One commenter suggested moving the SERD from the current 15 month period to a
24 month period; and also noted that the ERD revision and the local community depositor preference create three additional
categories, making for extraordinary processing difficulties.

One commenter suggested: (1) giving purchase preference to both depositors and borrowers as of the ERD; (2) giving
preference to the eligible and supplemental eligible account holders whose accounts remain open at the voting record
date over those who terminated their account relationship; and (3) amending the regulation to replace the 100 share
initial allocation
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 with a provision that the initial allocation may be tailored to the circumstances of the thrift's offering.

The interim final rule will continue in effect without change for the reason stated by most commenters and supported
by OTS: it properly protects the legitimate interests of core depositors and provides sufficient assurance that
these depositors are given priority. ``Eligible account holders'' are defined as those holders with savings accounts
in place for a minimum of one year prior to board of director adoption of the plan of conversion. The OTS also believes
there is no compelling reason to set a maximum time limit for an ERD. As stated in the interim final rule, the one year
period is a minimum time period. Converting associations may designate such longer time periods as they may deem appropriate
to encompass longer term depositors in the local communities served by the institution.

The definition of qualifying deposit will continue as stated in 12 CFR 563b.3(e). Also, the OTS believes that there
is no compelling reason to eliminate or revise the current supplemental eligibility record date. Thus, supplemental
eligible account holders, as currently defined in the regulation, will continue to be a category with a priority immediately
following that of tax-qualified employee benefit plans. In addition, the OTS believes that there is no compelling
reason to revise the current regulation that: 1) gives a purchase preference to all depositors (but not borrowers);
2) does not differentiate between eligible and supplemental eligible account holders whose accounts remain open
at the voting record date over those who terminated their account relationship after board of director approval of
the plan of conversion; and 3) requires the 100 share initial allocation.

E. Preference for Depositors in Local Community 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Prior to promulgation of the interim final rule, the OTS conversion regulations required a converting association
to conduct a community offering of conversion stock in the local community, prior to a general public offering,
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 but did not permit converting associations to give account holders and voting members in those local communities
a priority to purchase stock in the initial subscription offering.
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 However, to minimize conversion expenses, the OTS permitted converting associations to not register under state
blue sky laws in those states where there was a relatively small number of depositors compared to the overall depositor
base, even though this resulted in some depositors being precluded from purchasing stock in the conversion offering.
In addition, the OTS has, on a case by case basis, permitted thrift subsidiaries of mutual holding companies to prioritize
stock purchases by account holders and voting members in the local communities.

The interim final rule

required
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that a stock purchase preference be given to eligible account holders, supplemental eligible account holders and
voting members residing in the association's local community. Those having preference in

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, eligible account holder, supplemental eligible account holder and voting member) are persons who reside in the
association's ``local community'' or within 100 miles of a home or branch office of the converting association. The
interim final rule defined ``local community'' to include all counties in which the converting association has a
home or branch office, each county's standard metropolitan statistical area or the general metropolitan area of
each of these counties and such other similar area(s) as provided for in the converting association's plan of conversion,
as approved by the OTS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Over one-half of the commenters on the interim final rule expressed views on the local depositor preference (LDP)
provision. Approximately one-half of those commenters supported the LDP provision for various reasons such as:
it promotes local control and involvement and is more sensitive to the community's needs; it serves the community
first and gives depositors in the local community a more meaningful opportunity to participate; it is a good way to
maintain local control of community-oriented associations; and it deals with the problem of outside investors who
tend to put undue pressure on management to achieve a higher stock value more rapidly than may be feasible through safe
and sound operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A majority of the supporters of the LDP provision also suggested various changes to the interim final rule. Three suggested
eliminating the 100 mile rule; one suggested using 50 instead of 100 miles; and three requested that the OTS clarify
the parameters of 100 miles, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, from headquarters or branch, to residence or town of residence, within certain counties, etc. One commenter noted
that the standard metropolitan statistical area (SMSA) is no longer in general use in delineating communities and
markets and has been replaced by ``metropolitan statistical area'' and ``consolidated metropolitan statistical
area.'' The same commenter also noted that the term ``general metropolitan area'' is not a term of general usage nor
is it explained in the interim final rule. This commenter suggested eliminating the 100 mile priority and restricting
priority to persons living within the local community defined by reference to counties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters suggested using zip codes corresponding to delineated CRA service areas, and three commenters suggested
allowing each institution voluntarily to establish a local priority and identify local depositors. Four commenters
requested that the rule be clarified to include, as local depositors, long-term account holders who lived in the area
and kept accounts open but have retired and moved from the area, and long-term account holders who work or regularly
vacation in the local community but do not reside there. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One selling agent had concerns with the definition of ``local community'' and concerns with the word ``reside,''
including the problem with multiple residences. This commenter suggested that the test for the geographic area for
the domicile of an account include the whole of any zip code that is partially within the geographic area. The commenter
also suggested developing an affidavit to accompany the stock order form and requested that OTS not require any independent
verification by the selling agents.

Commenters that opposed the LDP provision asserted that all association members, regardless of location, should
be treated the same and be allowed to participate in the conversion process on an equal basis. The objections raised
by commenters opposing the LDP provision included the following: all depositors have ownership, voting and liquidation
rights, deposits are used indiscriminately, and the definition of customer should not be related to location; the
LDP provision is an artificial distinction between depositors based upon geography; non-local persons with long-term
accounts and/or more money in accounts would have a lower priority than local persons with shorter-term accounts
and/or less money; the LDP is arbitrary, capricious, unfairly discriminatory, ill-suited to advancing any legitimate
public policy objective, and in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
13
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the LDP deprives non-locals, who have had long-term accounts with significant amounts of money and who maintain banking
relationships, of rightful opportunity to participate in attractive conversions; it is unconscionable for a federal
agency to require U.S. citizens to be treated differently based on their residence; and the LDP provision conflicts
with the takings, due process and equal protection clause of the United States Constitution.

One of the most detailed comment letters came from counsel representing Thrift Depositors of America, Inc. (TDA),
a trade association of mutual savings association depositors. A lawsuit by TDA (TDA vs. OTS, Civil Action No. 94&hyph;1008,
U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia) alleged that the OTS's implementation of the LDP in the interim final
rule without a notice and comment period violated the APA. On September 29, 1994, the Court ruled that because the OTS
had failed to adequately justify waiving notice and comment for the LDP, it would enjoin the OTS from proceeding with
mutual-to-stock conversions containing the LDP provision until a new rule was finalized in accordance with the notice
and comment procedures of the APA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several of the commenters objected to the LDP provision because they believe that it violates federal and state policies
and laws that prohibit discrimination. The OTS acknowledges that the effect of the rule is to authorize a preference
to a certain type of depositor. The LDP rule, however, does not discriminate against any person based on age, race,
sex, ethnic background, religion or any other impermissible category. Its purpose is to reward those who have and
will maintain a banking relationship with the institution. While using residency as the basis for determining this
category of depositors is inexact, it is valid to assume that generally local depositors fall into that category and
non-local depositors do not. The OTS believes that providing for a LDP provision will assist in achieving the goals
of (1) recognizing those depositors who have maintained long-term banking relationships with the converting institution
and thereby contributed to its financial success, and who are likely to continue to do so in the future,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
14
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and (2) promoting ownership by persons who have close ties to the community. Thus, in the OTS's view, the rule does not
violate federal or state policies against discrimination.

OTS cannot, in a regulation, identify with exactitude every single instance in which a depositor has maintained a
long-term banking relationship with a converting institution and thereby contributed to its financial success.
However, it is both rational and convenient, for reasons discussed elsewhere in this preamble, to identify this group
as the local depositors. Moreover, as discussed more fully below, the OTS has provided a mechanism to enable converting
institutions, in applying the LDP, to take account of unique and compelling circumstances posed by persons who are
not local depositors.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OTS also believes that the constitutional arguments raised by certain commenters are without merit. As has been
recognized by a number of courts, the property rights of mutual account holders are extremely limited.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
15
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the OTS conversion regulations, the limited rights that depositors have to share 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in the surplus of a liquidated mutual savings association is recognized by the establishment of a liquidation account
in the converted association. No distinction is made between local and non-local depositors in the establishment
of these accounts and nothing in the interim rule or this final rule would diminish a depositor's interest in his or
her liquidation account. Similarly, the OTS does not believe that authorizing the LDP provision violates the Equal
Protection Clause of the Constitution. Although the LDP provision does make a distinction between depositors, the
OTS believes, for the reasons discussed above, that there is a rational basis for authorizing an institution to make
the distinction and that the provision reasonably relates to legitimate policy objectives.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OTS instituted the LDP rule in the interim final rule to promote local community ownership of converting institutions,
and to reward a group that, collectively, typically has made significant contributions to the financial success
of the institution. The LDP rule sought to provide the opportunity for local depositors to participate more fully
in the subscription offering without competition from large purchases by out-of-area depositors. The OTS has become
aware in recent years of the evolution of a class of depositors, sometimes referred to as ``professional depositors''
or ``flippers,'' who have opened accounts in a large number of mutual associations.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
16
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 These ``professional depositors,'' who often reside outside the local community of the mutual savings association,
make deposits in anticipation of the mutual savings association converting to stock form. Often, these depositors
subscribe for a significant number of shares in the subscription offering phase with the intent of selling all or a
significant number of the shares in a short period of time following the conversion to take advantage of a lucrative
after-market. Once a conversion is complete, these depositors often withdraw their deposits and have no further
relationship with the converted savings association.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed below, OTS continues to believe that local depositors should be given preference over out-of-area depositors
in purchasing stock of a converting mutual savings association. Upon further consideration of the issues presented
in this area and review of the comment letters, however, OTS has determined in the final rule to authorize, but not require,
a savings association to give a conversion stock purchase preference to account holders residing in the local community.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTS has taken this position, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
making the LDP provision optional, for a number of reasons. First, the OTS does not oppose the full participation of
those other than local depositors in the conversion process. The nationwide interest in thrift stock has enabled
many thrifts to recapitalize, thereby preventing thrift failures and a burden on the taxpayers. In addition, the
OTS notes that the conversion eligibility record date, the primary determinant for prioritized eligibility to purchase
conversion stock, has always been keyed to the length of time a depositor has had an account with a converting institution,
not to geographic location. Also, as noted below, many mutual associations have exercised their authority to accept
deposit accounts only from persons residing in the association's local community. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of the foregoing, and in response to the comments noted above, the OTS believes that the LDP provision need
not be a requirement of conversion; rather it should be at the option of each converting savings association which
will decide whether its particular situation warrants its use. A savings association may conclude that an LDP for
stock purchases is important to ensure ownership by local depositors who made significant long-term contributions
to the financial success of the institution by virtue of their deposit and borrowing relationships, and who, it expects,
will continue to maintain financial relationships with the institution after the conversion. The final rule includes
the LDP provision as an optional provision in the subscription phase of the conversion.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To assist converting institutions who elect to include the LDP provision, the final rule continues to provide a definition
of the ``local community.'' In response to comments, however, the final rule substantially revises the definition.
First, the 100-mile standard is eliminated. In addition, the definition of local community has been revised to delete
the reference to the ``standard metropolitan statistical area'' and the ``general metropolitan area.'' Finally,
the definition also has been revised to include ``metropolitan statistical area'' (which replaced the SMSA), all
zip code areas corresponding to the converting institution's delineated CRA service area, and such other area(s)
or category as designated by the institution and provided for in the plan of conversion.
<FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>
 In this regard, the OTS will review, on a case by case basis, the proposals by converting associations to define local
community other than as defined in the final rule.

For example, a number of commenters suggested other categories of depositors, such as retirees, who may be equivalent
to local depositors in terms of their long-term relationship with the institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OTS also specifically solicited comments as to whether a savings association, in anticipation of conversion, should
be permitted to: (1) refuse to open accounts for potential depositors residing outside the local community, or (2)
close accounts of depositors residing outside the local community. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of 18 commenters addressing this issue, 13 stated that a savings association should be able to refuse to open accounts
for non-local depositors, with three of the 13 requesting that OTS confirm the association's right to refuse to accept
deposits. Five commenters believed that associations should not be allowed to refuse to open accounts, with two of
the five stating that OTS should prohibit associations from refusing to open or maintain accounts of non-local depositors.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of 18 commenters, 10 stated that savings associations should be allowed to close accounts of non-local depositors,
with one commenter stating that an account should be required to be closed at least 6 months prior to the adoption of
a plan of conversion. Two of the 10 stated that OTS should confirm an association's right, as a general matter, to close
accounts of, and return monies to, depositors who do not reside in the community served by the association. Eight commenters
opposed the closing of accounts in contemplation of conversion, with one stating that the closing would violate fundamental
fairness and deprive valid property rights without due process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the interim final rule, the OTS noted that federal associations generally have the authority to open and maintain
savings accounts within their discretion.
<FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>
 State chartered savings associations are subject to state laws governing the opening and closing of deposit accounts.
Based upon its review of the comments, the OTS has determined not to make any changes to the conversion rules in this
area. It is the opinion of the OTS that federal associations have the authority to open and close deposit accounts,
including those accounts of non-local depositors, provided they do not violate applicable laws that prohibit discrimination
on the basis of age, race, sex, ethnic background, religion or any other impermissible category.

The OTS, however, would not consider it to be a legitimate exercise of that authority if a savings association, in anticipation
of conversion, closed an account for the purpose of preventing a depositor from participating in a conversion as an
account holder. The OTS believes that this could result in the perception that insiders were acting out of self-interest
and not in the interests of the savings association.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the interim final rule, the OTS substantially revised and codified its policies regarding the establishment of
management recognition plans (MRPs) and stock option plans (SOPs) during the conversion process. The new provisions
require that any decision to implement MRPs and SOPs after conversion be voted on and approved by a majority of the shareholders
no earlier than the first annual meeting following the conversion, and that prior to implementation, all such plans
be reviewed and approved by the Regional Director. The provisions also prohibit the use of conversion stock to fund
MRPs, require that MRPs be awarded and stock options be granted only after shareholder approval is received and require
that stock options be granted at the market price at which the stock is trading at the time of grant. The regulation also
codifies the OTS's policies regarding permissible amounts that may be included in SOPs and MRPs formed within one
year of conversion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approximately 17 commenters recommended allowance of a reasonable amount of stock benefits at the time of conversion,
rather than a flat prohibition. A majority of the 17 commenters stated that the level of stock benefit plans should
be tailored to the size, health and performance of the association, the business plan objectives and needs, the size
of the offering, and the specific contribution and tenure of management. One commenter suggested 1% for MRPs and 5%
for stock options, subject to the normal five-year vesting period. Another commenter suggested allowing a small
MRP amount at the time of conversion with the remainder reserved for future performance-based awards and a SOP that
is structured so that the exercise price is based on an averaging formula or an indexed price. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four commenters supported the prohibition of stock benefit plans at conversion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of eight commenters addressing the issue, six supported the requirement for shareholder approval of management
plans. One of the six supported the delaying of implementation until approval is received and two commenters stated
that shares should be allocated at the time of conversion but contingent on shareholder approval. One commenter requested
a revision in the wording of the regulation to clarify that plans must be approved by an affirmative vote of the holders
of a majority of the securities of the issuer present, or represented and entitled to vote, at the meeting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of ten commenters addressing the issue, two supported the provision that shareholder approval be at the first annual
meeting, and eight requested that the timing aspect be revised to allow approval at any duly called meeting of shareholders,
either annual or special. One commenter suggested that the regulation require that a meeting be at least two months
after completion of the conversion. One commenter expressed concern for differences in flexibility with annual
meeting dates for state holding companies and federal savings associations. One of the eight commenters stated that
by waiting for the first annual meeting, awards are expensed based upon the fair market value of common stock on the
date of the meeting which increases the financial accounting expenses for the institution. This same commenter also
noted that the date the MRPs are implemented is inconsequential to officers and directors, because the financial
benefit of the MRPs is in the full value of the shares, not in their appreciation as in stock options. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three commenters stated that associations should be given flexibility to obtain a reasonable and appropriate number
of shares to fund stock plans through open market purchases or through authorized but unissued shares. Another commenter
requested that the regional office review and act upon stock plans at the time of conversion, that no conditional approval
be allowed, and that plans not acted upon within a certain time be deemed approved automatically. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with the discussion in the preamble to the interim final rule, the OTS believes that while there are valid
business reasons for thrifts to adopt stock benefit plans in order to attract and retain qualified management, these
plans are now more appropriately implemented subsequent to the conversion and with shareholder approval. A waiting
period allows shareholders to decide whether to permit dilution of their interests after reviewing management's
performance. Moreover, the stock price stabilizes once the marketplace has sufficiently digested the financial
data of the association. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim final rule required that stock options be granted at the market price at which the stock is trading at the
time of grant. The OTS has revised the interim final rule so as to require that stock options be granted at no less than
the market price at which the stock is trading at the time of grant. This revision is consistent with the current practices
and rules relating to the granting of stock options. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The shareholder vote required by the final rule will be uniform for both savings associations and holding companies,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the affirmative votes of the holders of a majority of the total votes eligible to be cast at a legal meeting.

This voting requirement coincides with the voting requirement of Section 5 of 12 CFR 552.3, the Federal Stock Charter
provision. As noted, it will apply to savings and loan holding companies formed in the conversion process that implement
management stock benefit plans within one year following conversion.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Shareholder approval is required prior to implementation of MRPs or stock option plans within the first year of conversion.
In response to the comments and mindful that a uniform meeting time may be justifiable for the reasons cited by the commenters,
the timing aspect in the interim final rule is being revised to allow approval at any duly called meeting of shareholders,
either annual or special, to be held no earlier than six months after completion of the conversion. The OTS believes
a six-month ``cooling off'' period will give the marketplace sufficient time to digest the financial data and the
shareholders sufficient time to become familiar with the finances and operations of the converted association in
order to make an informed investment decision in considering whether to vote to adopt such plans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim final rule did not specify the vesting schedule of the management stock benefit and stock option plans.
As a matter of policy under both the conversion regulations and the safety and soundness authority governing management
compensation, the OTS has generally required such plans to vest beginning one year from the date the plans are approved
by shareholders, and at a rate not in excess of 20% a year. A provision has been added to the final rule codifying these
policies. Also, in furtherance of the foregoing policy, an additional provision in the final rule generally prohibits
accelerated vesting except in the case of disability or death. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTS agrees with the commenters that savings associations should be given flexibility to obtain a reasonable and
appropriate number of shares to fund stock plans through open market purchases or through authorized but unissued
shares. In funding these plans, the board of directors and the compensation committees are reminded of their fiduciary
duties to the association or holding company, its shareholders and the association's members. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the interim final rule required that management and stock option plans be subject to approval of the appropriate
OTS Regional Director prior to plan implementation. The final rule removes the requirement for OTS Regional Director
approval in advance of a stockholder vote and implementation. The final rule provides that management stock benefit
plans and stock option plans comply with all of the regulatory requirements. Disclosure in all proxy and related material
distributed to the shareholders shall indicate that the plans in no way have been approved or endorsed by the OTS, and
no written or oral representation to the contrary shall be made by the association, its management, employees or professional
advisors. The final rule also adds the requirement that subsequent to shareholder approval of the plans, the association
will be required to file with the OTS a copy of the plans approved by shareholders and written certification that the
plans approved by shareholders are the same plans submitted to the OTS in the proxy materials.

G. Merger Conversions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the interim final rule, the OTS amended its conversion regulations to limit merger conversions to institutions
that qualify for a supervisory conversion, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 financially-weak institutions. OTS also solicited comment as to whether merger conversions involving healthy
savings associations should be permitted in the future, and if so, under what circumstances. The OTS was particularly
interested in how merger conversions should be structured to avoid the safety and soundness concerns raised by such
transactions that were discussed in the preamble to the interim final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of approximately 43 commenters addressing merger conversions, approximately 33 expressed the view that merger
conversions should be permitted for healthy thrifts. Of these 33 commenters, 13 proposed a small savings association
exception, with ``small'' being defined as anywhere from $5 million to $300 million in assets. The bases for the exception
were the cost of doing two transactions (a standard mutual-to-stock conversion followed by a merger transaction)
in order to accomplish a merger; the business reasons (access to capital markets, choice of partner, long-term survival,
technological advancement, access to a strong management team and enhancement of service to communities); and the
economic necessity for market-driven consolidations to occur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those commenters who favored authorization of merger conversions involving healthy thrifts believed that the OTS
should regulate and supervise these transactions and address concerns over insider abuse, excessive management
compensation and stock incentive packages. They argued that OTS could set narrow approval guidelines but should
not ban or eliminate merger conversions. One commenter stated that merger conversions should be allowed on a case-by-case
basis taking into account the size and strategic needs of the institution. Another commenter stated that OTS should
allow submission on a test case basis so as to develop a structure that would address the issues.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A few commenters thought that depositors should be able to vote on whether a stand-alone or merger conversion would
be in the best interest of the association. Several commenters stated that the board of directors should decide whether
to undertake a merger conversion based on their business judgment. Two commenters thought that for a merger conversion
to be approved, an institution would have to document specific business, economic and fiscal reasons and be required
to demonstrate that the transaction would provide opportunities for customers and depositors to participate in
the institution's value. Another commenter stated that the prohibition punishes forward-thinking thrift managers
and further endangers the health of the industry by closing off avenues for generating capital. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter stated that the institution should be free to negotiate the terms of a merger conversion, including
reasonable compensation arrangements and purchase discount percentages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some suggestions regarding the windfall gains and other problems and the valuation issue included: allow subscribers
to subscribe to the stock of the acquiring association at a 15% to 20% discount, based on the stock price either at the
time of acquisition or at the time the transaction is announced; require the acquiring entity to pay a control premium;
assure that value is made available to appropriate constituencies through community foundations, special interest
payments on deposits, and/or a special class of preferred stock made available to depositors without cost; make bonus
interest payments equal to a certain percentage of principal on all eligible account holder deposits maintained
at resulting institution for a specific time period after the acquisition is consummated
<FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>
; require the acquiror to hold the thrift as a separate subsidiary or be an OTS-regulated institution itself; require
all net conversion proceeds to go to the association; allow compensation only to the extent allowed in stand alone
conversions; or require a CRA rating of outstanding or satisfactory.

with a conversion.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter recommended using a two-step approach, allowing the mutual to enter into a definitive merger conversion
agreement prior to doing a stand-alone conversion, disclosing the intended transaction in the stand-alone conversion,
and then requiring a 90-day period between completion of the stand-alone conversion and consummation of the merger.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the approximately ten commenters that supported the prohibition against merger conversions, two did so only until
guidelines can be drawn to protect the rights of members of the disappearing association and to prevent insider abuse.
One of the ten stated that merger conversions should be prohibited except in cases of undercapitalized institutions
or at the discretion of the regulators on a case by case basis. A fourth supporter noted that what is beneficial to the
board of directors and insiders may not always be in the best interest of the institution or the community it serves.
A fifth supporter stated that depositors are best served by forcing acquiring entities to bid for a converted institution's
stock in the open market. A sixth commenter supported the prohibition because of the windfall and valuation problems.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon review of the comments, the OTS has determined to continue to generally limit merger conversions to cases involving
financially weak institutions. Although several commenters made suggestions that attempted to address the concerns
raised in the interim final rule, including the valuation problem and accrual of ``windfall gains'' by the acquiror,
the OTS remains concerned with the problems raised by merger conversions of healthy institutions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In line with the commenter who suggested that the OTS allow test case submissions in order to develop a structure that
would address the issues, the OTS emphasizes that it retains its general waiver authority under part 563b to permit
a merger conversion transaction under appropriate circumstances.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
21
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 An institution seeking a waiver of the merger conversion limitation will bear the burden of demonstrating how a proposed
transaction specifically addresses the concerns set forth above and in the interim final rule, and will also be required
to document specific business, economic and corporate reasons for a merger conversion. As discussed in the interim
final rule, however, the OTS has identified a number of significant structural abuses and regulatory problems inherent
in merger conversions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
22
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Thus, while the OTS continues to remain open to the development of a transaction structure that addresses these problems,
a healthy institution faces significant hurdles in demonstrating its transaction will resolve these problems.

One situation suggested by some commenters and to which the OTS would give serious consideration is where a converting
association could demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that a standard conversion would not be economically
feasible, based on the ratio of expenses to gross proceeds, because of the asset size of an institution. Very small
institutions, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.

In the interim final rule, the OTS stated that merger conversions could be done as a two-step process in which the mutual
account holders are initially granted an opportunity to purchase stock of a converting savings association or its
holding company and then following the conversion, vote to merge with or be acquired by another institution, subject
to certain limitations. One of the limitations is 12 CFR 563b.3(i)(2), under which no person is permitted to make an
offer for any security of a converting savings association issued in connection with the conversion. The other limitation
is 12 CFR 563b.3(i)(3), under which no person is permitted for a period of three years following the conversion, to
make an offer to acquire or acquire more than 10% of any class of equity security of a converted savings association
without the prior written approval of the OTS.

Clearly, with respect to the latter limitation, the opportunity is present for converted institutions contemplating
a merger to seek approval from the OTS to undertake such a transaction even within the first year following conversion.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the OTS has generally imposed a condition in connection with approval of a conversion transaction that
prohibits, without prior OTS approval, the converting association or its holding company from taking any action
within the first year following conversion that could lead to a transaction that would require stockholder approval
if such transaction were subject to 12 CFR 552.13. These provisions are intended to preserve the integrity of the independent
appraisal process, deter manipulation of the conversion process by insiders or other sophisticated third parties
to the detriment of the account holders, and permit the OTS to monitor post-conversion acquisition activities of
recently converted associations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By this regulatory oversight of merger and acquisition activities following the conversion, a converting institution
is provided with a reasonable period of time to implement its post-conversion business plan and to invest the conversion
proceeds. With respect to the appraisal issue, the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro forma
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 valuation of converting institutions assumes that no acquisition of the converting association will take place
for a reasonable period of time following the conversion. If there are ongoing discussions about a takeover of a converting
thrift during the conversion process, the ability of an appraiser to prepare an appraisal that satisfies the requirements
of 12 CFR 563b.7 is severely diminished because of the uncertainty that such takeover speculation would generate.

Eight of ten commenters endorsed the new requirement, with one of the eight suggesting that OTS include a requirement
for wider distribution, in a timely manner, of the conversion notices contemporaneously with the filing of the conversion
application. One of the eight noted that too long a comment period may cause significant delays and related inappropriate
costs to the converting associations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stated that the ten day comment period provided ample time for any person desiring to comment on an application,
and if the 20-day period is used, suggested that an association be permitted to publish the 4(b) notice immediately
upon filing the application with OTS, without waiting for OTS authorization. Another commenter stated that the revision
served no useful purpose, but if kept, also suggested that the 4(b) notice should be able to be given immediately after
the filing to ensure no delay due to the longer public comment period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTS continues to believe that the longer public comment period will give sufficient time for interested parties
to review and comment on a detailed conversion application. In order to accommodate the concern noted by some commenters,
the final rule requires that the 4(b) notice be given immediately after the filing of the application with the OTS.
However, the final rule also clarifies that if a conversion application is later deemed not properly executed or is
materially deficient or substantially incomplete, the applicant may be required to refile the application, republish
the accompanying 4(b) notice, and provide for another 20-day public comment period.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OTS now requires that all conversion transactions, with or without holding company formations, include a business
plan, and that the business plan address in detail how the capital acquired in the conversion will be utilized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All commenters addressing this issue affirmatively supported the provision. Two wanted assurance of confidentiality
of the business plan to protect associations from unfair competition. One of the commenters stated that the business
plans should not be used to deny a conversion application, unless the plan raises significant safety and soundness
concerns, and two urged OTS not to put itself in the position of deciding how much capital a business may need in future
years, nor to require a converting institution to justify the need for capital in order to be able to convert. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim final rule will continue in effect without change. As noted in the preamble to the interim final rule, in
order to ensure that a business plan is given confidential treatment, the applicant should follow the procedures
set forth at 12 CFR 563b.4(c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants for conversions must submit their business plans to the Regional Director prior to the filing of the conversion
application. OTS may deny a conversion application where the business plan does not sufficiently address the deployment
of conversion proceeds, raises significant safety and soundness concerns, or does not otherwise address convenience
and needs standards as required in the final regulation.

J. Revision to Post-Conversion Stock Repurchase Rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its interim final rule, the OTS revised the conversion regulations to prohibit stock repurchases by the converting
association for one year following conversion. After one year, a converted association may file with the appropriate
Regional Director an open market repurchase program in which it may propose stock repurchases of no more than 5% of
the outstanding capital stock during any twelve month period in the second and third years after the conversion. The
Regional Director also may disapprove repurchases if the association does not demonstrate a valid business purpose
for the stock repurchase; and also may approve amounts greater than 5% in the second and third years if there are circumstances
that would justify such repurchases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A majority of the commenters addressing this issue disagreed with the revisions, six commenters proposed alternative
revisions, and one commenter supported the prohibition of stock repurchases for one year following conversion.
The majority felt the blanket prohibition was not sound public policy, was not justified or necessary, was detrimental
to thrift stock prices, and reduced the ability of thrifts to compete in capital markets. Most stated that the repurchase
of stock is standard corporate practice that should be left to the decision of the board of directors (consistent with
fiduciary responsibilities), subject to safety and soundness concerns. Most also felt that thrifts need to retain
flexibility in using repurchase programs because markets are fluid and subject to change due to various forces. Most
viewed the prohibition on stock repurchases as taking away the institution's and the OTS's ability to follow market
dictates and react to stock price fluctuations and other market conditions. A few commenters stated that by limiting
repurchases, the regulation may cause institutions to use excess capital unwisely, to engage in unsound and risky
ventures in an attempt to provide better returns for shareholders, and could unintentionally increase pressure
on thrift management to produce better returns on equity by taking greater risks in daily operations. A few commenters
found no valid justification for distinguishing newly converted thrifts and stated that, in deciding whether a repurchase
is for valid business reasons, the OTS should look at whether the association has excess capital, whether the stock
is trading below book value, and whether the repurchase is an attractive investment given the association's business
prospects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requested that the rule specify in greater detail the circumstances that would warrant repurchase
amounts greater than the 5% repurchase limit in the second and third years following conversion. Another commenter
requested that the rule require all regions to be uniform in permitting repurchases greater than 5% during that time.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eight commenters stated that recently converted thrifts should be allowed to operate under the regulations in place
at the time they converted, and that the OTS should grandfather all associations that converted prior to the effective
date of the interim final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the OTS continues to believe that stock repurchase programs may serve valid business purposes,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 maintaining the value of a converting association's stock in an active trading market, the OTS also continues to have
concerns with substantial buyback programs that commence immediately after conversion and are not based on a valid
business purpose. In addition, and as noted in the preamble to the interim final rule, repurchases commenced immediately
after conversion raise substantial issues regarding whether conversion stock has been appropriately valued.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To address these concerns, but also to allow for some flexibility for repurchase programs, the final rule continues
to discourage stock repurchases for one year after conversion, but gives the OTS discretion to allow limited stock
repurchases in the first year where exceptional circumstances are established.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This would give the OTS the ability to permit repurchases where it may be in the best interests of the association and
its shareholders; however, such repurchases will be allowed in the first year only when deemed necessary by the OTS.

The interim final rule stated that repurchases within two years after the conversion must be part of an open-market
stock repurchase program that does not allow for a repurchase of more than 5% of the association's outstanding capital
stock during a twelve month period. The final rule has been revised to clarify that repurchases in years two and three
after conversion must be part of an open-market stock repurchase program and generally will be limited to no more than
5% of the association's outstanding capital stock. However, the final rule allows the OTS to approve repurchase programs
in amounts greater than 5% in the second and third years, if exceptional circumstances are established. As stated
above, this would give the OTS the ability to permit additional repurchases where it may be in the best interests of
the association and its shareholders; however, such repurchases will be allowed only when deemed necessary by the
OTS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTS continues to believe that ensuring an equitable conversion process and consistency in that process require
that the final rule apply to all associations that converted in the three years preceding the May 3, 1994 effective
date of the interim final rule. Any previous repurchases that occurred prior to May 3, 1994 will be grandfathered,
however, grandfathered repurchases will count toward compliance with the current requirements.

Three commenters favored adoption of the new standard and nine opposed the new standard. Favorable comments expressed
the view that the proposal would serve a valid public purpose and adequately respond to community and Congressional
concerns regarding allocation of conversion proceeds. Comments opposed to the proposal focused primarily on the
OTS' authority to adopt the proposal and on questions relating to implementation, such as whether the proposal is
necessary or appropriate given existing laws and regulations; whether the OTS will consider CRA-related protests
during application processing; and whether the OTS would mandate allocation of transaction proceeds to specific
community credit or lending programs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted in the preamble to the convenience and needs proposal, a convenience and needs standard has not, to date, been
applied to mutual-to-stock conversions of savings associations. Similarly, a convenience and needs standard generally
has not been applied to MHC stock offerings.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Upon review of this area, however, the OTS proposed amendments to its regulations to impose a convenience and needs
standard on these transactions. The proposal was issued, among other reasons, to enhance the OTS' ability to ensure
that savings associations undertaking these transactions recognize their responsibility to consider their community's
credit needs.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and the CRA. These commenters stated that the CRA limits the types of applications that may be subject to review under
the CRA; that Congress intended the CRA to cover only those transactions resulting in new charters or expanded facilities,
not conversions and MHC stock offerings. On this point, these commenters asserted that a convenience and needs standard
is not appropriate in conversions because conversions are fundamentally a capital-raising technique, not an expansion
of operations. One commenter believed that section 5(c) is the only provision of the HOLA
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
30
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that enumerates thrift powers and authorities, and that no affirmative housing credit obligation exists in section
5(c) that would permit the OTS to direct the allocation of conversion proceeds to community lending programs.

The OTS has concluded that it has ample statutory authority for the amendments. As noted in the proposal, the OTS has
broad authority under sections 5(i)(1) and 5(i)(2) of the HOLA to regulate mutual-to-stock conversions, and under
section 10(o)(7) of the HOLA to regulate mutual holding companies.

Thus, the OTS' authority to address convenience and needs concerns in the context of applications is not limited to
the applications specifically mentioned in the CRA. While the application review sections of the CRA arguably focus
primarily on transactions that involve some type of expansion of operations in a geographical market,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Finally, the amendments are consistent with section 5(c) of the HOLA. Section 5(c) of the HOLA generally sets forth
permissible investments and investment limitations for federal savings associations, but in no way limits the OTS'
authority to ensure that these investment powers are exercised in a manner that is consistent with the convenience

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated in the proposal, the amendments are intended to enhance the OTS' ability to ensure that savings associations
undertaking conversions and MHC stock offerings recognize their responsibility to consider their community's
credit needs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters questioned the wisdom of a convenience and needs standard, suggesting the OTS has sufficient
regulations and policies to implement the CRA and ensure that the convenience and needs of the community are met by
all thrifts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons stated above in support of the OTS' authority to adopt the amendments, the OTS believes it is appropriate
to impose a convenience and needs standard on applications for conversions and MHC stock offerings. In addition,
the OTS believes the amendments will enhance current regulations and policies designed to ensure that thrifts meet
their community's credit needs.

3. Consideration of CRA-Related Protests During Application Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal did not address whether the OTS would consider CRA-related protests during agency review of conversion
and MHC stock offering applications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters objected to OTS consideration of CRA protests during the public comment period. These commenters
emphasized that the timing of a conversion, in particular, is critical to stock pricing and appraisal considerations.
The mere prospect of a delay due to a CRA protest may unfairly subject an institution to pressure to make concessions
to protestants, according to these commenters. They suggested limiting public comments on applications subject
to the rule to issues relating to eligibility of purchasers and fairness of the appraisal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTS realizes that conversions and MHC stock offerings are time-sensitive transactions and that protests may
affect their success. Nevertheless, the OTS does not believe it is appropriate to preclude the public from commenting
on a savings association's performance in meeting a community's convenience and needs. Accordingly, the OTS will
consider these types of comments filed as part of a public comment period on conversion and MHC stock offering applications.
The OTS emphasizes that it will address these comments as promptly as possible. The CRA protest and oral argument procedures
at 12 CFR 543.2 will not apply, however.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A few commenters objected to any regulation or policy that would impose an allocation scheme on transaction proceeds.
They argued that the OTS has no statutory authority for such action; that a regulatory allocation scheme would place
artificial limits on capital planning and business strategy; and that specific allocations should be within the
discretion of the management of the applicant, consistent with safety and soundness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTS agrees with many of the comments on this issue. In proposing the amendments, the OTS did not intend to impose
any specific allocation scheme on proceeds from conversions or MHC stock offerings. The OTS agrees that the allocation
of transaction proceeds is largely a matter within the discretion of the converting association, consistent with
the safety and soundness of the savings association. Nevertheless, as suggested in the proposal, the OTS will require
applicants to submit business plans that demonstrate how transaction proceeds will be used to further the convenience
and needs of the community. Business plans should describe specifically the lending and credit programs to which
transaction proceeds will be directed. OTS policies encourage savings associations to consider traditional lending
programs as well as more innovative methods to meet the credit needs of the communities they serve.

Where an applicant's business plan does not adequately address how transaction proceeds will help meet the credit
and lending needs of its community, the OTS may deny the application or impose appropriate conditions of approval
designed to ensure that the applicant will address these concerns. The OTS generally will not view commitments included
in a savings association's business plan as remedying pre-existing CRA-related deficiencies. However, commitments
may be appropriate in addressing CRA performance in the context of the conversion of a troubled savings associations.
The OTS intends to give substantial weight to an applicant's previous CRA record, consistent with long-standing
policy of the OTS.

1. Subscription Rights 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The conversion regulations require that prior to the completion of a conversion, no person may transfer, or enter
into any agreement or understanding to transfer, the legal or beneficial ownership of conversion subscription rights,
or the underlying securities to the account of another.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The OTS did not propose any change to the prohibition in the OTS conversion regulations on the transfer or sale of subscription
rights or similar ``free distribution'' schemes, but did request comment on whether subscription rights should
continue to be nontransferable, or if transferability is recommended, the reasons for, and the manner in which to
allow for, such transfer.

12 CFR 563b.3(i)(1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Almost all of the commenters who commented on this issue stated that subscription rights should continue to be nontransferable.
The commenters that opposed transferability asserted that transferability would place undue pressure on mutuals
to convert; would place emphasis on ownership by depositors, a concept that is theoretical; would make the conversion
process overly complex; would be dangerous to the long-term health of the industry; would be unworkable and not in
the public interest; would increase the chances of fraud and abuse; would be difficult and costly in allocation of
rights; would enable sophisticated and professional investors to take advantage of members; and would create a destabilizing
effect on mutuals. One commenter suggested an alternative that would allow members to cause associations to redeem
rights for a certain period of time, for payment of a special dividend, provided there is adequate capital. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three commenters endorsed transferability of subscription rights, although one of the three stated that account
holders should be allowed to transfer rights to another individual, but not a group of investors or another institution.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTS notes that the FDIC and others have suggested that it may be appropriate for depositors to be able to receive
a gift of cash or stock or to transfer and sell their subscription rights so that any ``windfall'' value can be distributed
directly to the depositors. The current OTS regulatory regimen specifically rejects any type of free distribution
schemes as unsafe and unsound practice.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
40
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The OTS continues to believe that this type of change to the current conversion regulations would raise a number of
complex legal and policy issues, many of which were taken into account previously by the FHLBB in determining to prohibit
transferability.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
41
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 These issues, as noted in the preamble to the interim final rule, include the possibility of adverse federal tax consequences
to depositors receiving such rights, undue pressure on mutual associations to convert that may evolve from significant
shifts of savings funds by depositors into such associations, difficulties in equitably allocating such subscription
rights among depositors, potential manipulation of the process by sophisticated third parties to the detriment
of the depositors, incentives for manipulation by insiders, the continued need for establishment and maintenance
of a liquidation account and significantly increased conversion costs due to compliance with securities law requirements
for registering subscription rights for public distribution. For these reasons, the OTS conversion regulations
continue in effect without any change relative to free distribution of stock or transfer of subscription rights.

2. Availability of Conversion Documents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OTS rules now permit the public to have ready access to all relevant non-confidential materials regarding proposed
conversion transactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of five commenters addressing the issue of whether OTS should permit access to non-confidential preliminary conversion
materials, three supported the revision allowing access, one opposed, claiming access to such materials would confuse
members whose focus should be on the accuracy and adequacy of the final information disclosed to the public, and one
stated that the prospectus and plan of conversion, as approved by the board of directors, provide adequate disclosure.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTS continues to believe that even though this information is preliminary in nature, it may be useful for account
holders and the public to access it earlier in the conversion process, and therefore, the provision in the interim
final rule will continue in effect without change. As noted above, business plans filed with, or in contemplation
of, a conversion will continue to be treated confidentially so long as the applicant follows the procedures set forth
in 12 CFR 563b.4(c).

3. Conforming Changes to Mutual Holding Company Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The mutual holding company regulations, 12 CFR part 575, generally incorporate the substantive and procedural standards
for conversion contained in the conversion regulation. To the extent the final rule addresses conversion standards,
those same standards apply to mutual holding company reorganizations and minority stock issuances. The OTS is also
revising 12 CFR part 575 to make clarifying and conforming changes to the mutual-to-stock conversion regulations.

III. Summary of Revisions to the Conversion Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the reasons set forth in the previous section, the following revisions have been made to the interim final rule.
All other provisions of the interim final rule, and the proposed rule on convenience and needs, are adopted without
change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The definition of ``Local Community'' in 12 CFR 563b.2(a)(19) is revised to include the generally used term ``metropolitan
statistical area,'' all zip code areas corresponding to an association's delineated CRA service area, and any area(s)
or category designated by the savings association and approved by the OTS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_12 CFR 563b.3(c)(2)(i), (4)(i), (5)(i), which required the LDP in the subscription phase of the conversion, are
deleted in the final rule and sections (2) (ii) and (iii), (4) (ii)&hyph;(v), and (5) (ii) and (iii) are redesignated
as sections (2) (i) and (ii), (4) (i)&hyph;(iv), and (5) (i) and (ii). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_12 CFR 563b.3(c)(6)(iv) is revised to delete the phrase ``or within 100 miles of the association's home or branch
office(s).'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_12 CFR 563b.3(c)(23) is revised to clarify that eligible account holders have first priority to purchase conversion
stock, tax-qualified employee stock benefit plans have second priority, supplemental eligible account holders
have third priority, and other voting members who have subscription rights have fourth priority. Also the final rule
clarifies that if the actual offering exceeds the proposed maximum offering price, up to ten percent of the total offering
of shares may be sold to the tax-qualified employee stock benefit plans; if the ESOP is not able to purchase conversion
stock, the ESOP or any other tax-qualified plan may purchase shares in the open market or utilize authorized by unissued
shares only with prior OTS approval; and disclosure must be made in the conversion application and related documents
as to the effects on the association and subscribers of shares of either open market purchases or use of authorized
but unissued shares. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_12 CFR 563b.3(d)(12) is redesignated as 12 CFR 563b.3(d)(13) and a new 12 CFR 563b.3(d)(12) is added to give converting
associations the authority to include a preference for eligible account holders, supplemental eligible account
holders and other voting members residing in the association's local community. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_12 CFR 563b.3(g)(3)(i)(B) is revised to clarify that repurchases within year two and year three after conversion
must be part of a repurchase program that does not allow for a repurchase of more than 5% of the association's outstanding
capital stock during a twelve month period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_12 CFR 563b.3(g)(3)(i)(D) revises the reference from Corporate and Securities Division to Business Transactions
Division. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_12 CFR 563b.3(g)(3)(ii) is revised to give the OTS discretion to allow limited stock repurchases during the first
three years in amounts exceeding those specified in (g)(3)(i), where exceptional circumstances are established.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_12 CFR 563b.3(g)(4) (vii) and (viii) are revised to require the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
total votes eligible to be cast at a shareholder meeting for the establishment and implementation of management stock
benefit plans and stock option plans within one year of conversion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_12 CFR 563b.3(g)(4) (vii) and (viii) also are revised to allow approval of stock option plans and management stock
benefit plans at any duly called meeting of shareholders, either annual or special, to be held no earlier than six months
after completion of the conversion.

may be required to publish new notice upon filing of the revised application and may be required to consider written
comments for an additional 20-day period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_12 CFR 563b.7(f)(2) is revised to prohibit appraisers from also serving as underwriters or selling agents under

make recommendations or in any way impact the appraisal; and to prohibit the appraiser from receiving any fees other
than the fees for services rendered in connection with the appraisal.

(23) Provide that eligible account holders with subscription rights have first priority to purchase conversion
stock, tax-qualified employee stock benefit plans have second priority, supplemental eligible account holders
have third priority, and other voting members who have subscription rights have fourth priority. If the final conversion
stock valuation range exceeds the maximum conversion stock offering range, up to ten percent of the total offering
of shares may be sold to the tax-qualified employee stock benefit plans. Furthermore, if the ESOP is not able to purchase
conversion stock, the ESOP or any other tax-qualified plan may purchase shares in the open market or utilize authorized
but unissued shares only with prior OTS approval; and disclosure must be made in the conversion stock offering materials
of the potential open market purchases or use of authorized but unissued shares to fund the ESOP and its effects on the
association and its shareholders.

Convenience and needs considerations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In reviewing an application under this subpart, the Office will examine the extent to which the conversion will affect
the convenience and needs of the communities to be served by the converted savings association. The Office will review
the applicant's record under part 563e of this subchapter. In addition, the Office will scrutinize the business plan
of the applicant. Each applicant must demonstrate that the proposed deployment of proceeds contained in its business
plan will help meet the credit and lending needs of the communities served by the applicant. Also, the Office will consider
other relevant factors relating to the association's performance in meeting the convenience and needs of the community.
Based on an assessment of the applicant's record under part 563e of this subchapter, the applicant's business plan
and other relevant factors, the Office may approve the application, deny the application, or approve the application
on the condition that the applicant improve certain aspects of its CRA performance record or address particular credit
or lending needs of the communities that it serves.

 A mutual savings association or mutual holding company may make use of any proxy conferring general authority to vote
on any and all matters at any meeting of members, provided that the member granting such proxy has been furnished a proxy
statement regarding the matters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the member does not grant a later-dated proxy to vote at the meeting at which the matter will be considered or attend
such meeting and vote in person, and further provided that ``running'' proxies or similar proxies may not be used to
vote for a mutual holding company reorganization, mutual-to-stock conversion undertaken either by a mutual savings
association or a mutual holding company or any other material transaction. Subject to the limitations set forth in
this paragraph, any proxy conferring on the board of directors or officers of a mutual savings association general
authority to cast a member's votes on any and all matters presented to the members shall be deemed to cover the member's
votes as a member of the mutual holding company and such authority shall be conferred on the board of directors or officers
of a mutual holding company.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 These amended special conditions are issued to Jetstream Aircraft Limited for the Jetstream Model 4100 series airplanes.
This airplane has a novel or unusual design feature associated with the main cabin aisle arrangement. Special Conditions
No. 25&hyph;ANM&hyph;45 were issued on July 9, 1991 (to British Aerospace Public Limited Company (BAe)), addressing
this unusual arrangement, and included a limitation on passenger capacity. The applicant has requested that Special
Conditions No. 25&hyph;ANM&hyph;45 be amended to increase the passenger capacity limit from 29 to 30 passengers.
Since Special Conditions No. 25&hyph;ANM&hyph;45 were issued, the applicant has changed the company name and revised
the model number of the airplane. These amended special conditions reflect those changes. Since the applicable airworthiness
regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for this particular design feature, these amended
special conditions contain the additional safety standards which the Administrator finds necessary to establish
a level of safety equivalent to that established by the airworthiness standards for transport category airplanes.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On May 24, 1989, BAe (currently Jetstream Aircraft Ltd.) applied for a type certificate for the BAe Model 4100 (currently
Jetstream Model 4101) airplane in the transport airplane category. The Model 4100 was to be a derivative of the Model
3100, which is a small airplane and is certificated under the provisions of part 23. Like the Model 3100, the Model 4100
was a low wing, twin engine turbo-prop design. The fuselage was stretched, however, to seat 29 passengers in a three-abreast
arrangement. Since the Model 4100 airplane had the same fuselage cross section as the Model 3100, it did not have a traditional
main cabin aisle arrangement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 25.815 specifies the minimum aisle width dimensions for transport category airplanes based on the passenger
seating capacity. For airplanes with 20 or more passenger seats, a minimum 15-inch width at heights 25 inches or less
above the main aisle floor and a minimum 20-inch width at heights greater than 25 inches above the floor must be maintained.
Aisle width is measured at any point along the aisle, normal to the centerline of the aisle. The main aisle envisioned
by the regulations would run in a straight line from one end of the passenger cabin to the other and would satisfy these
width criteria. Long-standing FAA policy has permitted slight deviation from a straight line where there is a transition
from one cabin section to another, or where there are interior features which dictate that the aisle move laterally.
For example, from tourist class to first class there may be a change from five-abreast seating to four-abreast seating
which moves the aisle centerline laterally. This has been accepted provided the required widths are maintained at
all heights normal to the path that an individual would take. This type of offset normally occurs at one or two points
in a main cabin aisle. In addition, there is no offset permitted in the aisle vertically; that is, the required 15-inch
dimension must lie completely below the projected 20-inch dimension at all points along the aisle.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Jetstream main cabin aisle arrangement utilizes an offset at each seat row. The left and right seat assemblies
are offset from one another longitudinally such that the seatbacks are not opposite each other across the aisle. This
arrangement permits a 20-inch measurement between seatbacks (at an angle to the airplane centerline) and the required
15-inch dimension is maintained within the projected 20-inch dimension vertically. Thus the ``required aisle''
is not a straight line from one end of the cabin to the other, but a series of alternating angular segments from seatback
to seatback. Nonetheless, there 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
is
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a straight path along the cabin length, and the aisle floor does not deviate from side to side at all. The projected aisle
width along this straight path reaches 20 inches at a height of 43 inches above the floor, which is the typical seatback
height for transport airplanes. Another feature of the design includes the use of overwing exits which are offset
longitudinally, corresponding to the seat positions on the left and right of the airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to provide design standards for the novel and unusual aisle configuration in BAe Model 4100 airplanes the
FAA issued Special Conditions No. 25&hyph;ANM&hyph;45 on July 9, 1991. The criteria used to develop Special Conditions
No. 25&hyph;ANM&hyph;45 utilized existing regulations, and made certain favorable design features in the Model
4100 mandatory. Special Conditions No. 25&hyph;ANM&hyph;45 are summarized as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. There are no more than 29 passenger seats with no more than ten seat rows on either side of the aisle;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. The interior arrangement includes one pair of Type II and one pair of Type III passenger emergency exits;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. In addition to the requirements of &sect;25.815, the projected aisle width is at least 20 inches measured at a height
of 43 inches above the aisle floor;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. The Type III exits and adjacent seat rows are offset longitudinally such that persons approaching an exit from one
end of the cabin may use the exit without interfering with those approaching the other exit from the other end of the
cabin;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. The location and part number of each passenger seat must be defined by a drawing approved by the FAA or foreign civil
airworthiness authority. The seat arrangement may not be reconfigured without FAA approval; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. An evacuation demonstration must be conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of the aisle arrangement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The content of Special Conditions No. 25&hyph;ANM&hyph;45 is based, in part, on the maximum passenger capacity proposed
by BAe. The specific limitation of 29 passenger seats was the maximum capacity requested by BAe, but the FAA considered
that the fact that this capacity was well below the maximum that could be allowed for the installed exit combination
was a significant factor in acceptance of the aisle arrangement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequent to the issuance of Special Conditions No. 25&hyph;ANM&hyph;45 and prior to issuance of the Type Certificate
for that project, British Aerospace Public Limited Company changed its name to Jetstream Aircraft Limited. Also,
the specific model of the 4100 series in question was identified as the Jetstream Model 4101. Type Certificate A41NM
was issued to Jetstream Aircraft Limited on April 9, 1993, for the Jetstream Model 4101 airplane. It is now anticipated
that additional models of the 4100 series may be added to this Type Certificate in the future. In addition to the Model
4101, Special Conditions No. 25&hyph;ANM&hyph;45 would be applicable to any other Jetstream Model 4100 series airplanes
that incorporate the same novel or unusual aisle configuration.

If the Administrator finds that the applicable airworthiness regulations (i.e., part 25 as amended) do not contain
adequate or appropriate safety standards for Jetstream Model 4100 series airplanes because of a novel or unusual
design feature, special conditions are prescribed under the provisions of &sect;21.16 to establish a level of safety
equivalent to that established in the regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Special conditions, as appropriate, are issued in accordance with &sect;11.49 after public notice, as required
by &sect;&sect;11.28 and 11.29(b), and become part of the type certification basis in accordance with &sect;21.17(a)(2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Special conditions are initially applicable to the model for which they are issued. Should the type certificate for
that model be amended later to include any other model that incorporates the same novel or unusual design feature,
or should any other model already included on the same type certificate be modified to incorporate the same novel or
unusual design feature, the special conditions would also apply to the other model under the provisions of &sect;21.101(a)(1).

Novel or Unusual Design Features
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 30 passenger seat version of Jetstream Model 4100 series airplanes incorporate the same novel or unusual aisle
configuration as described above for the 29 seat version.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As in the case of the 29 seat version, the required main cabin aisle widths would be established using measurements
taken between seatbacks, which form a path in angular segments. The aisle width measured normal to the fuselage centerline
above 25 inches from the floor, would extend from the seat back to the opposite cabin sidewall. Thus, while the required
15-inch dimension at cabin heights below 25 inches from the floor would be completely within the projected 20-inch
width vertically, the 20-inch portion would not be centered over the 15-inch portion. (See Figure 1.)

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In establishing Special Conditions No. 25&hyph;ANM&hyph;45, the FAA carefully evaluated the relevant design parameters
of the BAe Model 4100 and determined that the main aisle configuration is clearly not what was envisioned by the regulations.
The regulations do not specifically prohibit the arrangement proposed; however, the policy in effect is predicated
on a largely straight aisle which has only one or two lateral deviations; in other words, a traditional cabin arrangement.
Therefore, special conditions were developed to establish design criteria which result in a level of safety equivalent
to configurations on which the regulations were based.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Jetstream has requested that the FAA amend Special Conditions No. 25&hyph;ANM&hyph;45 to allow a maximum passenger
seating capacity of 30, to account for a new customer demand, and be responsive to the market. In their request Jetstream
contends that there is no technical basis for the limitation on passenger capacity, and that the Joint Aviation Authorities
(JAA) have, in fact, already granted such approval. Jetstream has proposed that on the basis of harmonization with
the JAA, the FAA should consider their request favorably.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Jetstream further contends that the evacuation demonstration conducted in accordance with the special conditions
for the 29 passenger Model 4101 illustrated that there is no impediment due to the aisle arrangement for 30 passengers.
Jetstream argues that the concern that prompted the requirement was therefore demonstrated not to exist.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In developing the special conditions, the FAA took account of the several favorable cabin safety features that the
29 passenger Model 4101 incorporates. One of the major features was the good exit-to-passenger ratio for the number
of passengers requested. That is, one pair of Type II exists and one pair of Type III exists for 29 passenger seats, where
the regulations allow up to 39. In this regard, 29 passenger seats was the largest arrangement proposed for a US customer.
Consequently, the FAA did not consider a greater passenger seating capacity, and the issue of harmonization with
JAA requirements did not come up.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the evacuation demonstration conducted in accordance with the special conditions, this demonstration
was a modified version of the demonstration specified in part 25, Appendix J. The principal modification was the use
of a single exit (in this case, the forward Type I exit) instead of one half of the total number of exits installed. The
demonstration was conducted this way in order to provide for maximum usage of the aisle, by the maximum number of passengers.
While this demonstration was completed in 54 seconds, the resultant overall rates of egress were not particularly
fast for this type of exit. In addition, the evacuees appeared to steady themselves on seatbacks to a higher degree
than is typically seen in such demonstrations. Thus, while there was no clear obstruction due to the aisle, the overall
egress rates did seem to be somewhat reduced. The FAA therefore considers that the aisle arrangement should result
in a limit on maximum passenger capacity that is reduced over the theoretical limit in the regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Jetstream has requested that the FAA increase the current limit, which they believe is arbitrary, and allow up to 30
passenger seats in accordance with same special conditions. As noted by the applicant the demonstration conducted
for approval of the 29 passenger version Model 4101 did include 30 occupants in the passenger cabin (to account for
the JAA approved arrangement) and was completed well within the allowable time. Therefore, from the standpoint of
amending the special conditions, an additional demonstration would not be required. While the limit of 29 passenger
seats is somewhat arbitrary, the FAA must consider whether other conditions should apply if the limit is raised.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of the existing conditions is that there be no more than ten seat rows on either side of the aisle. The 30 passenger
arrangement proposed by Jetstream is consistent with this requirement. In fact, the additional seat is located on
the left side of the aisle at the extreme rear of the airplane, and does not produce the same kind of aisle offset that
occurs throughout the cabin. This is because the seat is opposite a windscreen at which point the aisle leads into the
passageway for the aft exit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These special conditions are intended to provide requirements which result in a cabin aisle that is as effective and
safe as those envisioned by the regulations for the maximum number of passengers on the airplane. Where appropriate,
requirements were drawn from existing regulations. In other cases, new requirements were developed to preserve
the level of safety that is inherent in the design of more conventional aisle arrangements. The FAA considers that
an additional passenger seat would not invalidate the basis for the original finding of equivalency. It is noted however,
that any further increase in passenger capacity would violate one of the other conditions because it would result
in more than ten seat rows on at least one side of the aisle. Therefore, any increase beyond 30 passenger seats would
very likely require the development of additional conditions. As noted above, the FAA has determined that the staggered
aisle should limit the passenger seating capacity to something less than would otherwise be allowed by the regulations.
Under the terms of these special conditions, 30 is considered to be the reasonable maximum.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Accordingly, in addition to the requirements of &sect;25.815, these amended special conditions are issued for Jetstream
Model 4100 series airplanes with a staggered main aisle. Other conditions may be developed as needed based on further
FAA review and discussions with the manufacturer and the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, the amended special conditions would be applicable initially to the 30-passenger version of
the Jetstream Aircraft Limited Jetstream Model 4101 airplane. Should Jetstream apply at a later date for a change
to the type certificate to include another model of the 4100 series incorporating the same novel or unusual design
feature, these amended special conditions would apply to that model, as well, under the provisions of &sect;21.101(a)(1).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Jetstream, in their petition, requested that the amended special conditions be promulgated without delay as a final
rule and in time to permit delivery of 30 passenger airplanes during August 1994. The FAA determined that public comment
was in the public interest, but shortened the comment period to 20 days in order to expedite the issuance of these amended
special conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice of Proposed Special Conditions No. SC&hyph;91&hyph;4&hyph;NM for the Jetstream Aircraft Ltd. Model 4101
airplane was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on September 13, 1994 (59 FR 46939). Comments were received from two labor organizations and two airlines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both operators comment on the improved productivity that could be realized with the additional seat on the Jetstream
4101 and strongly support the proposed amendment. One operator notes that the Joint Aviation Authorities have already
approved the airplane for 30 passengers and only the FAA special conditions limit its capacity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third commenter is not in favor of the proposed amendment to the special conditions. This commenter argues that
the exit arrangement and flight attendant seat location on the airplane are confusing and awkward. The commenter
specifically criticizes the location of the flight attendant seat and the potential for the flight attendant to disrupt
evacuation through the right rear exit. The FAA does not agree that the exit arrangement on this airplane in conjunction
with the flight attendant seat location is in any way inadequate. The exit arrangement complies fully with all applicable
regulations and provides good uniformity for the number of passengers on board. The FAA also participated in an evaluation
of the flight attendant's ability to assist passengers through the right rear exit and found that this could be accomplished
quite effectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This commenter also does not feel that the emergency evacuation conducted as part of the original special conditions
was adequate, and should be repeated before an increase in passengers could be considered. The commenter notes that
there has been a change to the regulations regarding evacuation demonstrations since the issuance of the special
conditions and believes that the new provisions were not complied with in the original demonstration. This commenter
also questions whether the demonstration met the FAA's stated objective of maximizing the number of passengers who
must use the aisle, and feels that the aft right-hand door should have been used for the demonstration. Additionally,
the commenter interprets FAA comments to mean that the passengers were ``zig-zagging'' around the seats backs. The
commenter also suggests that Jetstream should relocate the flight attendant seat to the forward bulkhead. The commenter
believes that this would enhance both passenger and flight attendant safety. This last comment is not germane to these
amended special conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the demonstration conditions, these were chosen by the FAA for the purpose of complying with the special
conditions, and not to show compliance with the specific regulations regarding evacuation demonstrations. Therefore,
changes to these regulations since the special conditions were issued are not relevant. In any case, the new provisions
in the regulation were encompassed in the demonstration done for the special conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In regard to the second concern, that the demonstration did not maximize usage of the aisle, the FAA does not agree.
The evacuation demonstration was conducted with a full passenger and crew complement using only the forward entry
door. This scheme was chosen for several reasons. First, the end of cabin location meant that passengers at the extreme
end of the cabin would have to traverse the entire cabin in order to reach an exit, thus making maximum use of the aisle.
Second, the forward exit, a Type I exit, was specifically selected because it was expected to provide for an increased
evacuation rate capability over the aft exit, which is a Type II. Thus, the door rate would not mask any effect due to
the aisle. Had the aft exit been used, it is not clear that the rate capability of the door is sufficiently higher than
that of the aisle to identify effects due to the aisle only. In addition, the aft location of the flight attendant seat
meant that passengers had to negotiate the aisle without crew assistance, which is the more critical case. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the FAA's observations of the evacuation demonstration, as expressed above, were not intended as an implication
that passengers were required to ``zig-zag'' around the seat backs. The passengers proceeded in a straight line along
the aisle, but did seem to use the seat backs as hand-holds to a higher degree than is usually seen.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, the FAA will not require a new evacuation demonstration since the results of the previous demonstration
are still valid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fourth commenter opposes the amendment to the special conditions, and reiterated opposition to the original
special conditions. The commenter's principal objection is the projected width of the aisle at heights more than
25 inches above the floor. The commenter notes that the special conditions require a 20 inches projected width at 43
inches above the floor, but expresses frustration at not knowing the projected width below that height. The commenter
assumes that 43 inches represents the tops of the seat backs. This commenter also interprets the FAA's observations
of the evacuation demonstration as indicating that there is a safety problem with the airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the projected aisle width, this varies essentially linearly from approximately 16 inches (at a height
of 25 inches above the floor) to 20 inches (at a height of 43 inches above the floor). However, since the seat rows are
longitudinally offset, there is never any point where the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
transverse 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
measurement between seats is less than 20 inches. As noted in the original final special conditions, the actual seat
back height is almost 50 inches. Forty-three inches represents a typical seat back height for airplanes where the
seats are mounted at the same level as the main aisle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted previously, an indication of some additional problems should not be inferred from the FAA's observations
of the evacuation demonstration. They are simply the factual observations of the demonstrations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Conclusion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action affects only certain novel or unusual design features on one model of airplanes. It is not a rule of general
applicability, and it affects only the manufacturer who applied to the FAA for approval of these features on the airplane.

 This amendment establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs) for
operations at certain airports. These regulatory actions are needed because of the adoption of new or revised criteria,
or because of changes occurring in the National Airspace System, such as the commissioning of new navigational facilities,
addition of new obstacles, or changes in air traffic requirements. These changes are designed to provide safe and
efficient use of the navigable airspace and to promote safe flight operations under instrument flight rules at the
affected airports.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs). The complete regulatory description of each SIAP is contained
in official FAA form documents which are incorporated by reference in this amendment under 5 U.S.C. 552(a), 1 CFR part
51, and &sect;97.20 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR). The applicable FAA Forms are identified as FAA Form
8260&hyph;5. Materials incorporated by reference are available for examination or purchase as stated above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The large number of SIAPs, their complex nature, and the need for a special format make their verbatim publication
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 expensive and impractical. Further, airmen do not use the regulatory text of the SIAPs, but refer to their graphic
depiction on charts printed by publishers of aeronautical materials. Thus, the advantages of incorporation by reference
are realized and publication of the complete description of each SIAP contained in FAA Form documents is unnecessary.
The provisions of this amendment state the affected CFR (and FAR) sections, with the types and effective dates of the
SIAPs. This amendment also identifies the airport, its location, the procedure identification and the amendment
number.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This amendment to part 97 is effective upon publication of each separate SIAP as contained in the transmittal. The
SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the United States Standard for Terminal Instrument
Approach Procedures (TERPS). In developing these SIAPs, the TERPS criteria were applied to the conditions existing
or anticipated at the affected airports.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA has determined through testing that current non-localizer type, non-precision instrument approaches developed
using the TERPS criteria can be flown by aircraft equipped with Global Positioning System (GPS) equipment. In consideration
of the above, the applicable Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs) will be altered to include ``or GPS''
in the title without otherwise reviewing or modifying the procedure. Because of the close and immediate relationship
between these SIAPs and safety in air commerce, I find that notice and public procedure before adopting these SIAPs
are unnecessary, impracticable, and contrary to the public interest and, where applicable, that good cause exists
for making some SIAPs effective in less than 30 days.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. For the same reason, the FAA certifies that this amendment will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (``PBGC'') is amending its regulations to provide for debt collection
by administrative offset. The procedures in this rule implement administrative offset, as authorized by the Federal
Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended by the Debt Collection Act of 1982, and in accordance with standards prescribed
by the Comptroller General of the United States and the Attorney General of the United States. The PBGC believes that
adoption of this rule will enhance its debt collection ability.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (``PBGC'') administers the pension plan termination insurance program
under title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (``ERISA'') (29 U.S.C. 1301 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
.). In conjunction with the pension plan termination insurance program, persons (including organizations and entities)
incur various types of debts to the PBGC, and the PBGC incurs various types of liabilities (including contractual
obligations). The PBGC anticipates that administrative offset will enhance its debt collection ability because
persons owing debts to the PBGC sometimes receive payments from federal government agencies (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
, in connection with government contracts). (As was stated in the preamble to the proposed administrative offset
rule, the PBGC generally will not offset against plan benefits.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Administrative offset is defined as ``withholding money payable by the United States Government to, or held by the
Government for, a person to satisfy a debt the person owes the Government'' (31 U.S.C. 3701(a)(1)). The Debt Collection
Act of 1982, which amended the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966 (31 U.S.C. 3701, et seq.), authorizes the collection
of debts owed to the United States by administrative offset (31 U.S.C. 3716). Before collecting a claim by administrative
offset, the head of an agency must prescribe regulations on administrative offset based on the best interests of the
United States Government, the likelihood of collecting a claim by administrative offset, and, for collecting a claim
by administrative offset after the six-year period for bringing a civil action on a claim under 28 U.S.C. 2415 has expired,
the cost-effectiveness of leaving a claim unresolved for more than six years (31 U.S.C. 3716(b)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Comptroller General of the United States and the Attorney General have amended the Federal Claims Collections
Standards (``FCCS'') (4 CFR parts 101 through 105) to implement the Debt Collection Act of 1982. Part 102 of those regulations
prescribe standards for debt collection by administrative offset. The procedures prescribed in this rule are consistent
with applicable provisions of those regulations.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The PBGC's Financial Operations Department (``FOD'') will have primary responsibility for the new debt collection
procedures in this rule, including applying amounts recovered by administrative offset to multiple debts, requesting
offset by other agencies, and processing requests for offset from other agencies. However, ascertaining the indebtedness
and providing notice to the debtor and administrative review will continue to be handled by the organizational unit
with functional responsibility for the type of claim involved, including, where applicable, review by the Appeals
Board (see &sect;2606.1(b) (5) through (9)). (Applicable assignments of responsibilities are set forth in the mission
and functions statements issued by the Executive Director and included (along with organization charts) in the PBGC
Directives Manual as section 30&hyph;1 of Part GA (General Administration).)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 20, 1994 (59 FR 26467), the PBGC proposed to add part 2609, Debt Collection_Administrative Offset, to its regulations
(29 CFR part 2609). The PBGC received no comments on proposed part 2609.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions of this final rule are identical to those proposed. However, in the near future the PBGC expects to issue
an interim final rule on tax refund offset (as anticipated in the agency's semiannual regulatory agenda (59 FR 58424,
58429, November 14, 1994)). Because the PBGC plans to add its tax refund offset procedures to part 2609 (as subpart
C), it is designating all but the definitions section of the proposed administrative offset regulations as subpart
B (and substituting ``subpart'' for ``part''). (The terms in &sect;2609.2 are included in a general subpart A.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, in response to a letter from the Small Business Administration, the PBGC is reiterating its certification
that sections 603 and 604 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) do not apply to this action, with an expanded explanation of the reasons for such certification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
E.O. 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The PBGC has determined that this action is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the criteria set forth in
Executive Order 12866 because the rule will not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely
affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment,
public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; create a serious inconsistency or
otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements,
grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or raise novel legal or policy
issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in Executive Order
12866. The purpose of the rule is to enhance the PBGC's debt collection ability. The procedures will be triggered only
by a failure to pay a debt already owed.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The PBGC certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
Accordingly, as provided in section 605 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), sections 603 and 604 do not apply. As indicated above, this rule is limited to procedures required by the Federal
Claims Collections Standards for use of administrative offset to collect certain debts owed to the United States.
Thus, a small entity can avoid the application of this rule by paying such debts when due. Further, insofar as provisions
of this rule do apply, their primary effect will be to provide procedural protection to persons whose debts are otherwise
subject to collection by administrative offset.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The PBGC will determine the feasibility of collection by administrative offset, whether to accept a repayment agreement
in lieu of offset, and how to apply amounts collected by administrative offset on multiple debts as provided in the
Federal Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR 102.3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Feasibility.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The PBGC will determine whether collection by administrative offset is feasible on a case-by-case basis in the exercise
of sound discretion. In making such determinations, the PBGC will consider:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Whether administrative offset can be accomplished, both practically and legally;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Whether administrative offset is best suited to further and protect all governmental interests;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) In appropriate circumstances, the debtor's financial condition; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Whether offset would tend to interfere substantially with or defeat the purposes of the program authorizing the
payments against which offset is contemplated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Repayment agreements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The PBGC will exercise its discretion in determining whether to accept a repayment agreement in lieu of offset, balancing
the Government's interest in collecting the debt against fairness to the debtor. If the debt is delinquent (within
the meaning of 4 CFR 101.2(b)) and the debtor has not disputed its existence or amount, the PBGC will accept a repayment
agreement in lieu of offset only if the debtor is able to establish that offset would result in undue financial hardship
or would be against equity and good conscience.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Multiple debts.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 When the PBGC collects multiple debts by administrative offset, it will apply the recovered amounts to those debts
in accordance with the best interests of the United States, as determined by the facts and circumstances of the particular
case, paying special attention to applicable statutes of limitations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The PBGC will not consider entering a repayment agreement in lieu of offset unless a debtor submits a copy of the
debtor's most recent audited (or if not available, unaudited) financial statement (with balance sheets, income
statements, and statements of changes in financial position), to the extent such documents have been prepared, and
other information regarding the debtor's financial condition (

(1) The PBGC may effect administrative offset against a payment to be made to the debtor prior to completing the procedures
specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section if:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Failure to take the offset would substantially prejudice the government's ability to collect the debt; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The time before the payment is to be made does not reasonably permit the completion of those procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The PBGC has determined that a case in which it applies the special rule in &sect;2622.9(c) of this chapter meets

 In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of September 28, 1994 (59 FR 49373), EPA issued a proposed rule that gave notice that Dow Chemical Co., 1320 Waldo Ave.,
Suite 300, Midland, MI 48674, had submitted pesticide peititon (PP) 4E04371 to EPA requesting that the Administrator,
pursuant to section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) (21 U.S.C. 346a(e)), propose to amend
40 CFR part 180 by establishing an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of polystyrene (CAS Reg.
No. 9003-53-6) when used as an inert ingredient (suspending agent, thickener) in pesticide formulations applied
to growing crops, to raw agricultural commodities after harvest, or to animals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Inert ingredients are all ingredients that are not active ingredients as defined in 40 CFR 153.125, and include, but
are not limited to, the following types of ingredients (except when they have a pesticidal efficacy of their own):
solvents such as alcohols and hydrocarbons; surfactants such as polyoxyethylene polymers and fatty acids; carriers
such as clay and diatomaceous earth; thickeners such as carrageenan and modified cellulose; wetting, spreading,
and dispersing agents; propellants in aerosol dispensers; microencapsulating agents; and emulsifiers. The term
``inert'' is not intended to imply nontoxicity; the ingredient may or may not be chemically active. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data submitted relevant to the proposal and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed
rule. Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the tolerance exemption will protect
the public health. Therefore, the tolerance exemption is established as set forth below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
or recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

 of September 28, 1994 (59 FR 49397), which announced that Miles, Inc., Agricultural Division, P.O. Box 491, Kansas
City, MO 64120, had submtted a pesticide petition (PP 3F4169) and a food/feed additive petition (FAP 3H5655) to EPA
requesting that the Administrator, pursuant to sections 408(d) and 409(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a(d) and 348(b), establish tolerances for residues of the insecticide 1-[(6-chloro-3-pyridinyl)methyl]-
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
-nitro-2-imidazolidinimine in or on the raw agricultural commodities apples at 0.5 part per million (ppm), potatoes
at 0.3 ppm, and cottonseed at 6.0 ppm. FAP 3H5655 proposed establishing a food or feed additive regulation for cottonseed
meal at 9 ppm and for combined residues of imidacloprid and its metabolites containing the 6-chloropyridinyl moiety,
all expressed as imidacloprid, on apple pomace (wet or dried) at 3 ppm, on potato chip at 0.4 ppm, and on potato waste
at 0.9 ppm. A time limitation was requested on the cottonseed tolerance and the cottonseed meal food additive tolerance.
There were no comments or request for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the notices of filling.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The database for imidacloprid is relatively complete. The most significant data gap is the need to complete additional
cotton crop field trials and present a final report, and this is the reason for the 2-year time limitation on the tolerances.
On June 2, 1994, the Agency issued a guidance document on crop residue trials. Among other things, this document provided
guidance on the number and location of domestic crop field trials for establishment of pesticide residue tolerances.
Based on this guidance document, additional residue trials are needed to fully support the cotton tolerance. Given
the relatively low risk presented by imidacloprid, EPA does not believe that the missing data will significantly
change EPA's risk assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The scientific data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have been evaluated. The toxicological
data considered in support of the tolerance include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. A three-generation rat reproduction study with a noobserved-effect level (NOEL) of 100 ppm (8 mg/kg/bwt). Rat
and rabbit teratology studies were negative at doses up to 30 mg/kg/ bwt and 24 mg/kg/bwt, respectively.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A 2-year rat feeding/carcinogenicity study that was negative for carcinogenic effects under the conditions of
the study and a NOEL of 100 ppm (5.7 mg/kg/bwt in male and 7.6 mg/kg/bwt female) for noncarcinogenic effects that included
decreased body weight gain in females at 300 ppm and increased thyroid lesions in males at 300 ppm and females at 900
ppm.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. A 1-year dog feeding study with a NOEL of 1,250 ppm (41 mg/kg/bwt).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. A 2-year mouse carcinogenicity study that was negative for carcinogenic effects under conditions of the study
and that had a NOEL of 1,000 ppm (208 mg/kg/day).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is no cancer risk associated with exposure to this chemical. Imidacloprid has been classified under ``Group
E'' (no evidence of carcinogenicity for humans) under EPA's cancer Assement Guidlines by the Office of Pesticide
Programs (OPP) Reference Dose (RfD) Committee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reference dose (RfD), based on the 2-year rat feeding/carcinogenic study with a NOEL of 5.7 mg/kg/bwt and 100-fold
uncertainty factor, is calculated to be 0.057 mg/kg/bwt. The theoretical maximum residue contribution (TMRC) from
published uses is .001734 mg/kg/bwt/day. This represents 3% of the RfD. The proposed tolerances contribute .0008957
mg/kg/bwt/day. This represents a 1.56% increase in RfD. Dietary exposure from the existing uses and proposed uses
will not exceed the reference dose for any subpopulation (including infants and children) based on the information
available from EPA's Dietary Risk Evaluation System.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The nature of the residue in plants and livestock is adequately understood. The residues of concern are imidacloprid
and its metabolites that contain the 6-chloropyridinyl moiety, all calculated as imidacloprid. The analytical
methods are common moiety methods for imidacloprid and its metabolites containing the 6-chloropyridiyl moiety
using a permanganate oxidation, silyl derivatization, and capillary GC-MS selective ion monitoring. Adequate
geographically representative magnitude of the residue crop field trial data for imidacloprid on apples, potatoes,
and cotton indicate that residues of total imidacloprid will not exceed the proposed tolerances when the formulation
is used as directed. Cotton, potato, and apple processing studies were conducted using the raw agricultural commodities
bearing detectable imidacloprid residues. These studies followed commercial processing practices. Imidacloprid
was found to concentrate in apple pomace, cottonseed meal, potato chips, and potato waste. Appropriate imidacloprid
food additive tolerances have been requested. Based on the results of the imidacloprid bovine and poultry feeding
studies finite imidacloprid residues will occur in meat, milk, poultry, and eggs from feeding of imidacloprid-treated
feed items, or their processed feed items, when the formulations are used as directed. Appropriate secondary tolerances
have been requested. Although additional cotton field trial are needed, EPA does not believe the additional data
will change its risk assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are currently no actions pending against the continued registration of this chemical.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This pesticide is considered useful for the purposes for which the tolerances are sought and capable of achieving
the intended physical or technical effect. Based on the information and data considered, the Agency has determined
that the tolerances regulations established by amending 40 CFR part 180 will protect the public health and that use
of the pesticide in accordance with the terms of the requested food/feed additive tolerances will be safe. Therefore,
the tolerances are established as set forth below.

, file written objections to the regulation and may also request a hearing on those objections. Objections and hearing
requests must be filed with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20). A copy of the objections and/or
hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket for this rulemaking. The objections
submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for the objections
(40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR 180.33(i). If a hearing is requested,
the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing is requested, the requestor's contentions
on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector (40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will
be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted shows the following: There is genuine and
substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified by the requestor
would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor, taking into account uncontested
claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner sought by the requestor would
be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e., Regulatory Impact
Analysis, review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant''
as those actions likely to lead to a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely
and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health
or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant''); (2)
creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or
policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive
Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA issued a notice, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of June 29, 1994 (59 FR 33503), which announced that Valent U.S.A. Corp., 1333 N. California Blvd., Suite 600, Walnut
Creek, CA 95496, had submitted a pesticide petition (PP 3F4234) to EPA requesting that the Administrator, pursuant
to section 408(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a(d), establish a tolerance for
residues of the herbicide flumiclorac pentyl (pentyl[2-chloro-4-fluoro-5-(1,3,4,5,6,7-hexahydro-1,3-dioxo-2H-isoindol-2-yl)phenoxy]acetate),
including all metabolites of flumiclorac pentyl, in or on the raw agricultural commodity field corn, grain; field
corn, fodder; field corn, forage; and soybean, seed at 0.01 part per million (ppm). Valent had previously submitted
feed additive petition (FAP) 3H5682 to EPA (see the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of October 21, 1993 (58 FR 54356)) proposing under section 409 of the FFDCA (21 U.S.C. 348) an amendment to 40 CFR part
186 to establish a feed additive regulation for flumiclorac pentyl in or on soybean hulls at 0.02 ppm that inadvertently
appeared under petition number FAP 3H5665: The correct petition number is FAP 3H5682. The tolerance level for each
commodity is expressed in terms of the parent only, which serves as an indicator of the use of flumiclorac pentyl on
these commodities.

2. A 90-day feeding study in rats resulted in a lowest-observed-effect level (LOEL) of 659 mg/kg/day in males and 724
mg/kg/day in females, and a no-observed-effect level (NOEL) of 64.9 mg/kg/day in males and 70.6 mg/kg/day in females.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. A 90-day feeding study in dogs resulted in a NOEL of 100 mg/kg/day in males and 10 mg/kg/day in females, and a LOEL of
1,000 mg/kg/day in males and 100 mg/kg/day in females. The only significant finding in males was slight to mild vacuolation
in the kidneys in the 1,000-mg/kg/day group. In females, a prolongation of the activated partial thromboplastin
time was observed in the 100- and 1,000-mg/kg/day groups.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. A 21-day dermal toxicity study in rats resulted in the LOEL for systemic and dermal toxicity of greater than 1,000
mg/kg/day. No treatment-related effects were noted in mortality, body weight gain, food consumption, clinical
pathology, or absolute and relative organ weight gains. No relevant histopathological findings were observed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. A 1-year chronic oral toxicity study in dogs resulted in a LOEL of 1,000 mg/kg/day and a NOEL of 100 mg/kg/day for systemic
toxicity. There were no treatment-related clinical signs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. A 79-week oncogenicity study in mice resulted in a LOEL of 307.9 mg/kg/day and a NOEL of 31.5 mg/kg/day for systemic
toxicity in males and a NOEL of 850.2 mg/kg/day for females. There was no evidence of carcinogenicity in this study.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. A combined chronic toxicity/carcinogenicity study in rats was performed. Consistent treatment-related changes
at both 360.4 and 744.9 mg/kg/day were observed in males, while no treatment-related effects were noted in females.
Based on these findings, a LOEL of 360 mg/kg/day and a NOEL of 35 mg/kg/day were established for systemic toxicity in
male rats, and a NOEL of 919.4 mg/kg/day was established for female rats. There was no evidence of carcinogenicity
in this study.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Teratology_developmental toxicity studies performed on rabbits and rats. No developmental toxicity was present
at the highest dose tested in any of the four studies performed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. A dietary two-generation reproduction study in rats resulted in a systemic NOEL of 16 mg/kg/day in males and 18 mg/kg/day
in females, and a reproductive NOEL of 16 mg/kg/day in males and 18 mg/kg/day in females.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. A micronucleus study was performed to test structural chromosomal aberration on male and female ICR mice. No significant
differences in the frequency of micronucleated cells were noted in the bone marrow cells of the treated animals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. An 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in vitro
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 unscheduled DNA synthesis assay was performed on rats to examine other genotoxic effects. At concentrations up to
300 micrograms/mL, unscheduled DNA synthesis was not elicited in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. Metabolism studies in rats resulted in essentially all of the administered dose being eliminated within 2 days
of dosing. Based on the results of the study, the high amounts of unmetabolized chemical present in the feces was determined
to be due to lack of absorption rather than biliary excretion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Office of Pesticide Programs' Health Effects Division's Carcinogenicity Peer Review Committee (CPRC) has classified
flumiclorac pentyl in Group E carcinogen (no evidence of carcinogenicity) under the Agency's ``Guidelines for Carcinogen
Risk Assessment,'' published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of September 24, 1986 (51 FR 33992). In its evaluation, CPRC gave consideration to organ weight changes in the 2-year
feeding study in rats and the 2-year feeding study in mice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Reference Dose (RfD) is established at 0.35 mg/kg/day, based on a NOEL of 35.4 mg/kg/day from the 2-year feeding
study in rats and an uncertainty factor of 100. The Theoretical Maximum Residue Contribution (TMRC) from the current
action is estimated at 0.001005 mg/kg of body weight/day for the general population and utilizes less than 1% of the
RfD for the U.S. population. The TMRC for the most exposed subgroups are 0.000012 mg/kg body weight/day for nonnursing
infants (less than 1 year old) and 0.000009 mg/kg body weight/day for children (1 to 6 years old), or 0.0036 and 0.0026
percent of the RfD, respectively. Therefore, no appreciable risk is expected from chronic dietary intake since the
RfD is not exceeded for either the general population or any subgroup.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The nature of the residue is adequately understood for the purposes of the tolerance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An adequate analytical method, gas chromatography with a thermionic-specific detector, is available for enforcement
purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The enforcement methodology has been submitted to the Food and Drug Administration for publication in the Pesticide
Analytical Manual, Vol. II (PAM II). Because of the long lead time for publication of the method in PAM II, the analytical
methodology is being made available in the interim to anyone interested in pesticide enforcement when requested
from: Calvin Furlow, Public Response and Program Resources Branch, Field Operations Division (7506C), Office of
Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and
telephone number: Rm. 1132, CM #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Hwy., Arlington, VA 22202 (703)-305-5232.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is no reasonable expectation that secondary residues will occur in milk, eggs or meat of livestock or poultry
as a result of this action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The pesticide is considered useful for the purpose for which the tolerances are sought, and the tolerances are capable
of achieving the intended physical or technical effect. There are currently no actions pending against the registration
of this chemical.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the information and data considered, the Agency has determined that the tolerances established by amending
40 CFR parts 180 and 186 will protect the public health and that use of the pesticide in accordance with the terms of the
proposed food additive tolerance will be safe. Therefore, the tolerances are established as set forth below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, file written objections to the regulation and may also request a hearing on those objections. Objections and hearing
requests must be filed with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20). A copy of the objections and/or
hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket for this rulemaking. The objections
submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for the objections
(40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR 180.33(i). If a hearing is requested,
the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing is requested, the requestor's contentions
on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector (40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will
be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted shows the following: There is genuine and
substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified by the requestor
would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor, taking into account uncontested
claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner sought by the requestor would
be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e., Regulatory Impact
Analysis, review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant''
as those actions likely to lead to a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely
and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health
or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant''); (2)
creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or
policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive
Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the

This document amends Federal Information Resources Management Regulation (FIRMR) provisions with regard to: updating
General Services Administration (GSA) offices and symbols; changing the definition of ``performance validation'';
providing GSA advance notice of agency offices authorized to submit agency procurement requests; clarifying delegation
of procurement authority (DPA) requirements for using GSA's Information Resources Management Service (IRMS) contracts
programs and services; clarifying provisions regarding DPAs, including acquisitions when an agency uses the Small
Business Administration's (SBA's) 8(a) Program for Federal information processing (FIP) resources; changing
procedures for obtaining exceptions to the use of FTS2000 and clarifying that determinations regarding whether
the FTS2000 network will be used in an acquisition is subject to GSA approval; and changing the Purchase of Telecommunications
Services (POTS) Program from a mandatory-for-use program to a nonmandatory program.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Notices of proposed rulemaking (NPRs) were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (FR) on September 21 and December 7, 1993 proposing various amendments to several sections of the FIRMR. The September
21 FR notice contained proposed amendments regarding acquisitions to be issued through SBA's 8(a) Program and regarding
procedures when using GSA's nonmandatory schedule contracts. The December 7 FR notice contained other miscellaneous
changes as noted in the Summary above, including provisions regarding the use by one agency of another agency's contracts
for FIP resources. Changes in the December 7 FR notice regarding nonmandatory schedules, the Federal IRM Review Program,
and the use of other agency contracts (except for contracts and services provided by GSA/IRMS) will be covered in a
separate amendment. To expedite issuance, all other amendments are combined in this final rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) All comments were considered and, where possible, incorporated into the final rule. While most of the comments
were resolved in the final amendment, a few comments could not be fully accommodated. Also, in an effort to keep regulations
to a minimum, where a subject is already covered, additional provisions will not be included. Major comments that
will not be reflected in the amendment are addressed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Requests were made for explanations as to when justifications for specific make and model and for other than full
and open competition are required for 8(a) contracts. FIRMR &sect;201&hyph;39.601 already requires a justification
for specific make and model that applies to all acquisitions, including 8(a) acquisitions. The Federal Acquisition
Regulation (FAR) contains rules governing documentation for SBA's 8(a) Program contracts. Additional FIRMR provisions
are not required, but this does not preclude GSA from asking for supporting documentation in specific cases when SBA's
8(a) Program is used.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) There were requests to include provisions requiring that agencies be informed of the scope and manner of GSA reviews
and that would have the effect of regulating the timing of reviews. These changes are not desirable in view of the changing
nature of the reviews program and since agencies are now notified of pending reviews.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Suggestions that agencies, not GSA, make determinations regarding FTS2000 exceptions were not accepted because
of GSA's statutory responsibilities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Explanations of the changes made by this amendment are shown below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Various sections of the FIRMR are amended to update GSA offices and symbols.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) FIRMR part 201&hyph;4 is amended to change the definition of ``performance validation'' to reflect that benchmarking
is not the only method of validation. FIRMR Bulletin C&hyph;4 is also being revised to reflect this change.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(c) Section 201&hyph;20.305(a) is amended to require agencies to provide GSA the position title and organizational
identity of offices authorized to submit agency procurement requests for DPAs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Section 201&hyph;20.305&hyph;1 is amended to clarify that a delegation is not required for FIP supplies even
though they may be part of an acquisition that contains other FIP resources. It will serve to correct an error in FIRMR
Interim Rule 2 appearing in the October 24, 1994

.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Section 201&hyph;20.305&hyph;1 is also amended to clarify that, when an agency elects to use SBA's 8(a) Program
to acquire FIP resources, the FIRMR policies and delegation thresholds for obtaining DPAs apply. This final rule
is responsive to agencies' concerns about when the DPA thresholds apply; explains the difference between a requirement
``available from only one responsible source'' and a ``sole source'' acquisition issued under SBA's 8(a) Program;
and explains that the thresholds apply to all FIP resource acquisitions (including indefinite delivery, indefinite
quantity contracts). The FAR contains general policies that apply to all acquisitions. The FIRMR, which is the primary
regulation for FIP acquisitions, contains policies and procedures that are unique to FIP resources. In acquiring
FIP resources, acquisition personnel must follow the policies and procedures in the FAR except in those areas where
the FIRMR prescribes special policies and procedures. This applies to acquisitions using SBA's 8(a) Program for
FIP resources. To apply DPA thresholds to acquisitions conducted through SBA, an agency needs to determine if the
requirement is (i) a specific make and model, or (ii) a requirement for which only one source of supply or service exists.
If a requirement fits into either of these categories, a delegation is required if the value of combined FIP resources
(including optional periods and quantities) exceeds the regulatory delegation threshold established in the FIRMR
for the agency for a specific make and model or a requirement available from only one responsible source, unless the
agency has a specific agency delegation at a different level. In all other cases, the higher regulatory delegation
threshold established for the agency applies, unless the agency has a specific agency delegation at a different level.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Section 201&hyph;24.101&hyph;3 is amended to (i) provide a new address to which requests for exceptions to the
use of FTS2000 are submitted, and (ii) clarify procedures when an agency's intercity telecommunications may fall
outside the scope of FTS2000. Requirements for intercity telecommunications within the United States, Guam, Puerto
Rico, or the Virgin Islands must be submitted to GSA for inclusion in the FTS2000 program or for a final determination
as to whether a requirement is outside the scope of FTS2000. The changes will ensure that agencies follow appropriate
procedures when acquiring intercity telecommunications services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Section 201&hyph;24.104 is deleted to remove the POTS Program from GSA's mandatory programs. Agencies are encouraged
to consider use of POTS, since the contracts are competed and provide cost-effective services. This change allows
flexibility to agencies to acquire telecommunications resources that are most advantageous to their individual
needs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Subpart 201&hyph;39.8 is amended to remove provisions that require mandatory use of the POTS contracts. The POTS
contracts are available for use on a nonmandatory basis as an optional source of supply. The name of the program is changed
to ``Purchase of Telecommunications Services.''

(c) When an agency acquires FIP resources through the Small Business Administration's 8(a) Program, the regulatory
delegations in paragraph (a)(1) above apply unless an agency is granted specific agency delegations with different
thresholds. If a requirement to be satisfied through the 8(a) Program is for a specific make and model or is one that
is available from only one responsible source, the lower of the two specific agency delegation thresholds (or, if
none exists, the FIRMR regulatory delegation thresholds) applies. For all other acquisitions, the higher of the
two specific agency delegation thresholds (or, if none exists, the FIRMR regulatory delegation thresholds) apply.
For acquisitions conducted through SBA's 8(a) Program, a requirement available from only one responsible source
is one for which only one source of supply or service exists. The fact that the requirement is directed to one particular
source under SBA's 8(a) Program does not necessarily mean the requirement is available from only one responsible
source. When using an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract, the FIRMR thresholds apply to the maximum
value of all combined FIP resources (including optional periods and quantities), not the minimum guaranteed value.

cannot be provided by FTS2000. Additionally, if a requirement is above the regulatory or specific agency delegation,
and FTS2000 is not used, a specific acquisition delegation must be obtained. Requests for an exception and a DPA may
be submitted simultaneously to GSA.

By this Memorandum Opinion and Order the Commission denies a petition for reconsideration of the First Report and
Order in this proceeding filed by CELSAT, Inc. This action will result in Celsat's pioneer's preference request,
PP&hyph;28, being considered in RM&hyph;7927, the proceeding in which Celsat's companion petition for rule making
is under consideration, rather than in ET Docket No. 92&hyph;28, the above 1 GHz low-Earth orbit satellite service

Summary of Memorandum Opinion and Order
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. In the Notice of Proposed Rule Making (Notice) in this proceeding, 58 FR 57578 (October 26, 1993), the Commission
sought comment on whether and how the pioneer's preference rules could be amended to take into account competitive
bidding and its experience administering them, or whether they should be repealed. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
First R&amp;O
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 59 FR 8413 (February 22, 1994), the Commission determined that it would not apply amendments to its rules to the three
proceedings in which Tentative Decisions had been issued. Celsat requested reconsideration or clarification of
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
First R&amp;O
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 insofar as that decision affects the inclusion or exclusion of Celsat's pioneer's preference request, PP&hyph;28,
in Docket 92&hyph;28, which is one of the three proceedings in which a Tentative Decision had been issued and therefore,
under the decision in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
First R&amp;O
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, would be considered under the existing pioneer's preference rules. Celsat argues that its pioneer's preference
request is pending in Docket 92&hyph;28.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
First R&amp;O
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 did not address whether Celsat's pioneer's preference request is being considered in Docket 92&hyph;28 and had no
effect on the status of Celsat's request. However, because Celsat argues that it is uncertain as to the status of the
request, the Commission clarifies that the request has been, and remains, pending in RM&hyph;7927.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Celsat states that the Commission issued a Public Notice on March 11, 1992 ``in an apparent response to Celsat's
[pioneer's preference] filing [that] established April 10, 1992 as the final day for filing any additional pioneer's
preference requests'' in Docket 92&hyph;28. Celsat also argues that the Commission's Office of Engineering and
Technology issued an Order consolidating Celsat's pioneer's preference request with five other pioneer's preference
requests in Docket 92&hyph;28, and that the Commission made an initial ruling on Celsat's companion petition for
rule making in the Notice of Proposed Rule Making and Tentative Decision (NPRM) in that docket.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The Commission finds that Celsat's petition for rule making addressed a number of frequency bands, several of which
were already the subject of an ongoing proceeding. Those portions of Celsat's petition that addressed two bands being
considered for low-Earth orbit satellite operations, 1610&hyph;1626.5 and 2483.5&hyph;2500 MHz, were considered
in the proceeding initiated to address those bands, Docket 92&hyph;28. Because Celsat's petition as it related to
those bands proposed a terrestrial component that was inconsistent with the international allocation of those bands,
the portion of Celsat's petition that addressed those bands was dismissed. Had Celsat's petition addressed only
those bands, its request for pioneer's preference also would have been dismissed, inasmuch as a pioneer's preference
request is tied to adoption of rules consistent with the request. However, since the portion of Celsat's petition
addressing other bands remains pending in RM&hyph;7927, its companion pioneer's preference request also remains
pending in that proceeding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Celsat's arguments that its pioneer's preference request was associated with Docket 92&hyph;28, either in addition
to or instead of RM&hyph;7927, are demonstrably incorrect. Celsat's request was placed on public notice on March
9, 1992. The public notice clearly stated on it face that the pioneer's preference request was filed in conjunction
with Celsat's petition for rulemaking, RM&hyph;7927. Pioneer's preference requests pertaining to Docket 92&hyph;28
were separately placed on public notice and clearly marked with that docket number on the same day. There was no mention
of Docket 92&hyph;28 in the Public Notice addressing Celsat's request, and no mention of RM&hyph;7927 in the Public
Notice addressing Docket 92&hyph;28.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Additionally, an Order extending comment time periods cited by Celsat as consolidating the two proceedings clearly
did not do so. While the Order denied an extension of time request that was filed with respect to the two separate proceedings,
the request did not ask us to consolidate the two proceedings. Both the caption and text of the Order, as released March
27, 1992, made clear that RM&hyph;7927 and Docket 92&hyph;28 are separate and distinct. The Order twice refers to
the ``proceedings,'' and paragraph 4 exclusively discusses Docket 92&hyph;28 while paragraph 5 separately discusses
RM&hyph;7927. Not only would consolidation have been beyond the bounds of a routine ruling on an extension of time
request that made no reference to consolidation, but the Order itself left no doubt that it did not address consolidation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Finally, the NPRM and Report and Order in Docket 92&hyph;28 dismissed Celsat's petition for rulemaking only with
respect to the 1610&hyph;1626.5 and 2483.5&hyph;2500 MHz bands. The Commission explicitly stated therein that
the surviving portion of Celsat's petition remained pending. Furthermore, Celsat's pioneer's preference request
was addressed in the Tentative Decision in Docket 92&hyph;28, and Celsat did not file comments nor request clarification
of the status of its request despite its request not being addressed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. For the above reasons, we conclude that Celsat's pioneer's preference request remains pending before the Commission
in RM&hyph;7927. Whether any changes to the pioneer's preference rules that may be adopted in the instant proceeding
will apply to pending requests, such as Celsat's PP&hyph;28, is yet to be determined. Accordingly, it is ordered,
That the petition for reconsideration filed by Celsat, Inc., is denied.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary amends the regulations governing the campus-based programs (Federal Perkins Loan, Federal Work-Study
(FWS), and Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) programs). These amendments are needed
to implement changes made to the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA). These regulations also seek to improve
the efficiency of the campus-based programs, to reduce the administrative burden for institutions where possible,
and to enhance opportunities for postsecondary education.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 These amendments revise the existing campus-based program regulations. The campus-based programs are authorized
as follows: Federal Perkins Loan_20 U.S.C. 1087aa&hyph;1087hh and 20 U.S.C. 421&hyph;429; FWS_42 U.S.C. 2751&hyph;2756b;
FSEOG_20 U.S.C. 1070b&hyph;1070b&hyph;3. These regulations implement the provisions of the National and Community
Service Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;610), enacted November 16, 1990, the Crime Control Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;647),
enacted November 29, 1990, the Higher Education Amendments of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;325), enacted July 23, 1992

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 22, 1994, the Secretary published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 32264&hyph;32287). The NPRM included a discussion of major issues surrounding the proposed changes that will
not be repeated here. The following list summarizes those issues and identifies the pages of the preamble to the NPRM
on which a discussion of those issues can be found.

The Secretary proposed to amend the definition of ``undergraduate student'' to remove the restriction that did not
allow an undergraduate student to receive Federal Perkins Loan or FWS assistance if he or she has already earned a baccalaureate
or first professional degree. The proposal provided that a student is not ineligible for assistance under the Federal
Perkins Loan or FWS programs because he or she has previously received a baccalaureate or professional degree (page
32264). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposed to amend the allocation and reallocation procedures for the campus-based programs to provide
that if an institution returns more than 10 percent of its Federal Perkins Loan, FWS, or FSEOG allocation for an award
year, the institution will have its allocation for the next fiscal year for that program reduced by the dollar amount
returned (pages 32264&hyph;32265).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary proposed to amend the criteria for selection of students for campus-based assistance to ensure that
independent students and students attending an institution on a less-than-full-time basis would be equitably provided
financial assistance (page 32265). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposed to amend the overaward threshold provisions for the campus-based programs (page 32265).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To reduce burden for both the student and the institution, the Secretary proposed to allow an institution to disburse
funds under the Federal Perkins Loan and FSEOG programs to a student when he or she is no longer enrolled if the assistance
was awarded while the student was still an eligible student (page 32265).

Federal Perkins Loan Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary proposed to remove the definitions of ``Default rate'', ``Defaulted principal amount outstanding'',
and ``Matured loans'', and add the definitions of ``Disposable income'', ``Enter repayment'', ``Making of a loan'',
and ``Satisfactory arrangements to repay the loan'' (pages 32265&hyph;32266). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposed to amend the reallocation formula for the Federal Perkins Loan Program, and to establish an
appeals process by which the anticipated collections requirement may be waived for institutions with ``low default
rates'' (page 32266). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposed to add a new section to the regulations to establish the Federal Perkins Loan cohort default

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate and penalties for an institution with a high cohort default rate for the 1994&hyph;95 award year and subsequent
award years (page 32266). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposed to add a new section to the regulations to describe the measures that institutions with high
default rates must use to establish a default reduction plan (page 32266). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposed establishment of the Expanded Lending Option as necessary to implement statutory provisions
under the Amendments and the Technical Amendments (page 32266). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposed to amend the Program Participation Agreement to implement the increase in the capital contribution
requirements as required by the Amendments, and to include new reporting requirements containing information for
determining an institution's cohort default rate (pages 32266&hyph;32267). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposed to amend the student eligibility requirements to implement statutory provisions under the
Amendments (page 32267). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposed to amend the maximum loan limits to reflect statutory changes (page 32267). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposed to remove all references to the term ``endorser'' to reflect the statutory change that provides
that all Federal Perkins Loans are to be made without security or endorsement (page 32267). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposed to incorporate the new statutory requirement that an institution report loan disbursements
to a national credit bureau (page 32267). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with statutory changes, the Secretary proposed to provide for the transfer of up to 25 percent of an institution's
Federal Capital Contribution (FCC) allotment for an award year to either or both the FSEOG and FWS programs (page 32267).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposed to delete the promissory note from the existing regulations and to provide the note in a ``Dear
Colleague'' letter. In addition, the Secretary proposed to delete the defense of infancy provision (page 32267).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with statutory changes, the Secretary proposed to allow an institution to increase the minimum monthly
repayment amount to $40. In addition, the Secretary proposed to establish forbearance of principal and interest
where circumstances warrant it, and to authorize an institution to compromise on the repayment of a loan (page 32267).

The Secretary proposed to revise the regulations to reflect statutory changes in the deferment provisions (pages
32267&hyph;32268). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposed to amend the regulations to incorporate new statutory loan disclosure requirements that
must be met during a borrower's exit interview (page 32268).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To reduce burden for both the borrower and the institution, the Secretary proposed to allow a borrower to elect to repay
his loan by means of the electronic transfer of funds from the borrower's bank account (page 32268). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To reduce institutional burden, the Secretary proposed to eliminate skip-tracing as a required due diligence step
(page 32268). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with statutory changes, the Secretary proposed to revise loan collection and litigation procedures
to require institutions to report defaulted loans to any one of the credit bureaus with which the Secretary has an agreement.
In addition, the Secretary proposed to amend the regulations to reflect the elimination of the statute of limitations
on litigating to recover amounts owed on defaulted accounts (page 32268). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with statutory changes, the Secretary proposed to eliminate the 50-percent limitation on the number
of Title 1 schools in a State that meet the eligibility criteria and provided that teaching in any Title 1 school that
meets the eligibility criteria now qualifies a borrower for a loan cancellation. This change will increase the opportunities
for receiving loan cancellations and encourage more teachers to teach in low-income schools (pages 32268&hyph;32269).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposed to expand the loan cancellation employment provisions (page 32269). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposed to amend the definition of permanent and total disability to include the inability of the borrower
to attend an institution because of an impairment that is expected to continue indefinitely or result in death (page
32269).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with statutory amendments and consistent with the Secretary's desire to promote community service
activities, the Secretary proposed to amend the purpose of the FWS program to include an encouragement to students
receiving program assistance to participate in community service activities (page 32269). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposed to add a new definition of ``low-income individual'' for purposes of community services (page
32269). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposed to amend the program participation agreement to include assurances that (1) employment under
the program may be used to support programs for supportive services to students with disabilities, and (2) institutions
will inform all eligible students of the opportunity to perform community service and will consult with local nonprofit,
governmental, and community-based organizations to identify community service opportunities. In identifying
community service opportunities, the Secretary expects institutions to consult with their students (page 32269).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with statutory changes, the Secretary proposed to amend several provisions governing use of FWS funds.
First, institutions participating in the Work-Colleges program would be allowed to use FWS funds for meeting costs
of the Work-Colleges program. Second, the institutional administrative expense allowance for work-study for community
service learning would be eliminated. Third, the amount of an institution's allocation under the FWS programs that
may be transferred to the FSEOG program would be increased from 10 percent to 25 percent. Fourth, an institution would
have additional carry-back authority to pay students who work during the summer. Fifth, an institution would be required
to use 5 percent of the total FWS Federal funds granted to the institution to compensate students employed in community
service activities for the 1994&hyph;95 award year and subsequent award years (page 32269). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with statutory changes, the Secretary proposed to provide that a student employed by a proprietary
institution and performing community services is no longer also required to be furnishing student services (pages
32269&hyph;32270). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with statutory changes, the Secretary proposed to increase the Federal share of FWS compensation paid
to a student employed other than by a for-profit organization to 75 percent (page 32270). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of statutory changes the Secretary proposed to remove the ``Community Service-Learning Program'' from
the regulations (page 32270).

Job Location and Development (JLD) Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary proposed to combine the regular JLD program to expand off-campus job opportunities and the ``Community
Services'' JLD program to locate and develop community services jobs for students into one program. The Secretary
further proposed to expand the statement of purpose for the JLD program to include the encouragement of participation
in community service activities. The Secretary also proposed to allow an institution to use the lesser of $50,000
or 10 percent of its FWS allocation to establish or expand a JLD program (page 32270). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary, in accordance with amended section 446(a) of the HEA, proposed to eliminate the authority for institutions
to enter into agreements with nonprofit organizations and limit institutions to working with other institutions
for the purpose of developing jobs (page 32270).

The Secretary proposed to amend the allocation and reallocation provisions for unexpended FSEOG funds (page 32270&hyph;32271).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposed to eliminate an institution's authority to transfer FSEOG funds to the FWS program as necessary
to implement statutory provisions (page 32271). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposed to increase the maximum FSEOG award that an institution may award a student per academic year
from $4,000 to $4,400 for a student studying abroad (page 32271). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposed that the Federal share of FSEOG awards will not exceed 75 percent effective for award years
beginning on or after July 1, 1993 as necessary to implement statutory changes (page 32271).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following discussion describes the significant changes since publication of the NPRM and the manner in which
certain critical provisions will be initially implemented. They are discussed in the order in which they appear in
the text of the regulations. The changes that apply to more than one program are described first followed by descriptions
of changes that pertain to only a specific program.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the June 22, 1994 NPRM, the Secretary proposed to amend &sect;668.57(c) to require the signature of one parent instead
of both parents when verifying the number of family household members enrolled in postsecondary institutions for
a dependent applicant. If only one parent's income is considered in the title IV, HEA aid awarding process, that is
the parent who must sign. Otherwise, either parent may sign. This burden reduction provision will be addressed in
the Student Assistance General Provisions final regulations governing verification of all title IV programs which
will provide that either parent may sign, regardless of which parent's income is reported.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the June 22, 1994 NPRM the Secretary proposed to amend &sect;&sect;674.10, 675.10, and 676.10 to state that if an
institution's FSEOG allocation, FWS grant, or Federal Perkins Loan FCC is directly or indirectly based in part on
the financial need of less-than-full-time or independent students and if the need of all of these students exceeds
5 percent of the total need of all students at an institution, then at least 5 percent of that allotment for FSEOG, 5 percent
of that grant for FWS, or 5 percent of the dollar amount of the loans made under the Federal Perkins Loan program must
be made available to these students. The Department previously had stated in various documents that ``make available''
meant that an institution was required to actually ``expend'' the dollars for these students. In response to the public
comments and as part of his efforts to reduce regulatory burden, the Secretary is revising the final regulations to
provide that the institution must ``offer'' the funds to less-than-full-time and independent students. The institution
is not required to have actually disbursed the title IV funds to less-than-full-time and independent students.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A financial aid administrator may not award or disburse aid from a campus-based program if that aid, when combined
with all other resources, would exceed the student's need. If the student receives additional resources at any time
during the award year that were not considered in determining the student's eligibility for aid, and these resources
combined with the expected financial aid will exceed the student's need, the amount in excess of the student's need
is considered an overaward. Statutory provisions under the Amendments provided for a $300 overaward threshold for
FWS. In the June 22, 1994 NPRM, the Secretary proposed that, if a student has FWS, a $300 overaward threshold for the
three campus-based programs would be in effect; however, if a student only has an FSEOG or Federal Perkins Loan, the
current $200 overaward threshold would be the limit. In response to the public comments and as part of his efforts to
reduce regulatory burden, the Secretary is providing a uniform $300 overaward threshold for all the campus-based
programs regardless of whether the student has been awarded FWS funds.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the June 22, 1994 NPRM, the Secretary made proposals for the implementation of the statutory provisions governing
forbearance of a borrower's repayment of a Federal Perkins loan and the deferment of repayment due to economic hardship
reasons. The provisions contained in the NPRM paralleled the same provisions in the FFEL Program, as detailed in the
FFEL Program NPRM, published on March 24, 1994. In response to the comments received on the FFEL Program NPRM, the Secretary
made significant changes to the forbearance and economic hardship provisions in the final FFEL Program regulation,
published on June 29, 1994. Those same changes have been made to the forbearance and economic hardship provisions
in the Federal Perkins Loan program, as part of the Secretary's ongoing effort to reduce the institutional burden
of administering the title IV student aid programs. These changes include the revisions to the definition of ``full-time
employment'' for purposes of granting an economic hardship deferment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with amendments to the HEA made by the Improving America's Schools Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;382),
the Secretary is revising the final regulations to include a new criterion under which a borrower may qualify for deferment
of repayment due to economic hardship reasons.

In accordance with amendments to the HEA made by the National and Community Service Act of 1990 (Pub.L. 101&hyph;610),
the Secretary is revising the final regulations to include the provision that a borrower may not receive a benefit
under subtitle D of title I of the National and Community Service Act of 1990 and a cancellation benefit under the Federal

Statutory provisions for community service under the Amendments provide that community service is designed to improve
the quality of life for community residents, particularly low-income individuals. In the June 22, 1994 NPRM, the
Secretary proposed to add a new definition of ``low-income individual'' for purposes of community service. In response
to public comment and as part of the Secretary's efforts to reduce regulatory burden, the Secretary is not defining
``low-income individual'' in these regulations.

Comments:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Three commenters suggested that the Secretary permit an institution, under certain circumstances, to appeal an
allocation reduction because it returned more than 10 percent of its previous year's allocation. These commenters
suggested that the Secretary allow an appeal during occurrences of natural disasters or situations in which enrollments
are reduced because students are called to service in areas of hostility, such as the military mobilizations for ``Operation
Desert Storm.''

Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary believes that this provision of the proposed regulations adequately addresses situations in which
these provisions may be waived. As stated in the preamble to the NPRM, the Secretary may waive these provisions in such
circumstances as a natural disaster. Additionally, to assist institutions in their recovery from the effects of
disasters, or to provide relief to students who have been called to military service in areas of hostility, the Secretary
provides enforcement relief from regulatory requirements and provides guidance through ``Dear Colleague'' letters
issued at the time of the natural disaster or the declaration of an area of hostility.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter stated that a literal interpretation of a reduction in an institution's allocation for the next fiscal
year would require reductions in two award years. This commenter suggested that the term ``fiscal year'' be replaced
by ``award year'' to make the provision easier to understand while still being in line with congressional intent.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comments:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters noted that while sections 413C(d), 443(b)(3), and 464(b)(2) of the HEA require most institutions
to ``make available'' to less-than-full-time and independent students at least 5 percent of the FWS allotment, 5
percent of the FSEOG allotment, and 5 percent of the dollar amount of the loans made under the Federal Perkins Loan program,
the NPRM did not define the term ``make available.'' These commenters were concerned that while most students would
accept FSEOG as part of their award packages because it is grant money, institutions have no control over whether students
will accept Federal Perkins loans or work to earn FWS funds. They believe that it would be very difficult for some institutions
to meet this requirement if independent and part-time students have to accept, or even earn, 5 percent of the FWS allocation.
One commenter stated that most students attending less-than-full-time are doing so because they are already working
and therefore those students are not interested in FWS. The majority of the commenters suggested that the Secretary
should interpret the statute in its use of the term ``make available'' to mean ``offer'' FWS, FSEOG, and Federal Perkins
loans to students rather than ``disburse'' these funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter noted that the wording between the FWS section and the FSEOG section is slightly different and recommended
that it be consistent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary agrees that in some circumstances it may be difficult for an institution to actually disburse to less-than-full-time
and independent students at least 5 percent of its FWS allotment, 5 percent of its FSEOG allotment, or 5 percent of the
dollar amount of the loans made under the Federal Perkins Loan program. Therefore, to accommodate these circumstances
and prevent a burden on institutions to be responsible for what financial aid a student accepts, in interpreting amended
sections 413C(d), 443(b)(3), and 464(b)(2) of the HEA, the Secretary considers the words ``make available'' to mean
that the institutions must ``offer'' to less-than-full-time and independent students at least 5 percent of its FWS
allotment, 5 percent of its FSEOG allotment, or 5 percent of the dollar amount of the loans made under the Federal Perkins
Loan program if the need of all of these students exceeds 5 percent of the total need of all students at an institution.

 The wording of this provision in the campus-based sections is changed to reflect that institutions must ``offer''
these campus-based funds to less-than-full-time and independent students. Also, the wording was revised for consistency
among the campus-based programs.

Comments: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There were a number of comments on these sections, all in favor of the statutory provision that allows a student employed
in the FWS program to earn up to $300 for need-based employment in excess of his or her financial need before employment
in the FWS program must be discontinued. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters recommended that the Secretary provide a uniform overaward threshold of $300 for all recipients
of campus-based aid to simplify the overaward calculation process and reduce administrative costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that the proposed wording of these provisions is slightly ambiguous and subject to different
interpretations. The commenter believed that the application of a uniform overaward threshold to all campus-based
aid recipients will avoid any potential confusion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary has reevaluated his proposal in the June 22, 1994 NPRM. The statutory purpose of the FWS provision is
to prevent aid administrators from being administratively burdened by having to make adjustments to financial aid
packages when small amounts of overawards occur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes that the use of a uniform campus-based overaward threshold will further reduce the administrative
burden for institutions without cost implications to the campus-based programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is important to note that these provisions do not allow an institution to make campus-based awards in excess of the
amount of the student's need. Although a threshold is allowed subsequent to the packaging of campus-based aid, the
threshold does not allow an institution deliberately to award campus-based aid that, in combination with other resources,
exceeds the student's financial need.

While most commenters believed that the new definition of ``disposable income'' was necessary in order to be consistent
with the FFEL Program and to establish eligibility for an economic hardship deferment or forbearance of payments,
others believed the definition was unclear and needed further clarification. Commenters were particularly concerned
that alimony payments, child support payments, wage garnishment, and other similar items be considered deductions
``required by law to be withheld.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The term ``disposable income'' was defined in the NPRM as part of the proposed rules for the forbearance and the economic
hardship deferment provisions. Forbearance and economic hardship are provisions common to all title IV loan programs,
including the Federal Perkins Loan program, and the Secretary made the identical proposal for these two provisions
in the FFEL Program NPRM, published on March 24, 1994. The Secretary received a number of comments on the proposed definition
of ``disposable income'' in the FFEL Program NPRM and, as a result, decided that ``total monthly gross income'' was
a term more easily understood than ``disposable income.'' Consequently, the Secretary replaced ``disposable income''
with ``total monthly gross income'' in the final FFEL Program regulation. For a complete discussion of the reasons
for making this change, see comment number 18 on page 33584 of the

As part of the Department's effort to simplify the regulations and reduce burden at the institution, provisions that
are common to both the Federal Perkins Loan program and the FFEL Program will have the same regulatory provisions,
to the extent practicable. Therefore, in this final rule, the proposed rules for the Federal Perkins Loan program
have been modified to reflect the forbearance and economic hardship provisions contained in the final FFEL Program
regulation, published on June 29, 1994.

The issue of when funds are considered to be disbursed applies to all of the title IV programs, not just to the Federal
Perkins Loan program. The Secretary is aware that the current title IV disbursement policies are applied inconsistently
by institutions and is preparing to issue final regulations on this and other ``cash management'' issues by December
1, 1994. The Secretary is making conforming changes to the Federal Perkins Loan program regulations in the ``cash
management'' regulations to be issued by December 1, 1994.

Several commenters believed that the Secretary should define when a promissory note should be signed by the borrower
as part of the definition of ``making of a loan.'' These commenters believed that Federal Perkins Loan borrowers should
be able to sign the promissory note once, at the beginning of the academic year in which the award is made, and not each
time a disbursement is made to the borrower.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary is sensitive to the commenters' concerns and will evaluate situations in which an institution could
require an annual signature on the promissory note. The Secretary is especially interested in evaluating the possibility
of making this option available to those institutions that have demonstrated a high performance level and that have
met the stricter cohort default rate requirements adopted for the Federal Perkins Loan program. The Secretary would
like to note that an annual signature on the promissory note would necessitate the elimination of the ``open-ended''
Federal Perkins Loan promissory note. The ``open-ended'' promissory note, currently available only in the Federal
Perkins Loan program, significantly reduces burden at the institution, by allowing an institution to make loans
on the same promissory note for as long as the statutory provisions remain the same. Allowing only a ``closed-ended''
promissory note, as is done in the FFEL and FDSL programs, would result in a major increase in the number of promissory
notes an institution would be required to maintain.

A number of commenters felt strongly that the term ``satisfactory arrangements to repay the loan'' should be defined
in terms of the impact on the borrower and the institution. Commenters believed that the requirement of 6 months of
consecutive payments in this definition is too stringent, particularly when this definition is used to determine
when to exclude loans from the cohort default rate calculation. Because of the window of time in the cohort default
rate tracking period, one commenter believed it would be more equitable to consider the fact that the institution
was able to establish a new repayment plan with the borrower as meeting the criteria for satisfactory arrangements
to repay the loans. Other commenters suggested a minimum of three consecutive monthly payments as the basis for excluding
the loan from the cohort default rate. These commenters further stated that institutions do not have enough time to
locate and contact the delinquent borrower, obtain the written agreement, and have 6 months of payments made prior
to June 30. One commenter suggested that once the new written repayment agreement has been signed and all payments
due by June 30 have been properly made by the borrower, institutions should be allowed to exclude that account from
their cohort default rate.

In order to reduce the administrative burden at the institution, the Secretary is seeking ways to make the Federal
Perkins Loan program consistent with the other title IV loan programs. Including six consecutive monthly payments
in the definition of satisfactory arrangements to repay the loan is consistent with provisions in these programs.

Several commenters stated that while the definition of ``loan rehabilitation'' in &sect;674.5(e)(1) has limited
benefit to the school in reducing a school's cohort default rate, it will be a benefit to the borrower whose loan is no
longer considered to be in default. These commenters noted that a loan rehabilitated because the borrower has made
12 consecutive monthly payments is not removed from the school's cohort default rate. The commenters recommended
that the definition be revised to allow for lump sum payments or up to a three-month payment plan. One commenter also
invited the Secretary's consideration of allowing a quarterly repayment option and a reduction in the minimum payments
required to consider the loan rehabilitated.

While the Secretary is sensitive to the concerns of the commenters, the Secretary does not agree that the definition
of a rehabilitated loan is too restrictive. Rehabilitating a loan gets the borrower out of default. Consequently,
the borrower must establish a significant repayment history. Again, in order to reduce administrative burden at
the institution, the provision is parallel to similar provisions in the FFEL and FDSL programs.

Several commenters were concerned that the credit bureau reporting requirement for rehabilitated defaulted loans
in &sect;674.5(e)(2) was unclear. One commenter recommended including in the definition a requirement to report
to the national credit bureau the date of the last payment, the unpaid principal balance, amount past due and date and
amount of the last payment. Some commenters recommended that the phrase ``no longer in default'' should be clarified
to mean that the record is not deleted from the borrower's credit history, when in fact it is only reported as a status
change. One commenter also stated that the impact of ``rehabilitated and no longer in default'' affects the future
disbursement of title IV aid and that the Secretary should not force the credit bureau to use unique, special definitions.

Discussion:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary understands the concerns of these commenters and agrees that the requirements of this provision are
unclear. In drafting the provision the Secretary intended that institutions report to one of the national credit
bureaus the change in status of the defaulted loans. The Secretary did not intend that the default be eliminated from
the credit bureau records. A default on any loan is an important component of an individual's credit history and credit
bureaus are required to maintain such information on an individual's account for 7 years. The Secretary is concerned
that a borrower who has made such a serious attempt to take care of his or her defaulted loan have as up-to-date and accurate
record at the credit bureau as possible. Therefore, the status of the loan should be accurate on the credit bureau record.
In response to the suggestion that additional data be provided to the credit bureau, the Secretary does not want to
increase the burden at the institution by imposing additional reporting requirements on the institution. However,
it should be noted that these national credit bureaus have standards that have been established by Associated Credit
Bureaus (ACB), the industry's trade group. The Department has no regulatory authority over these bureaus' standards.
Some of these national credit bureaus might require more than the Department requires, such as follow-up reporting
of the borrower's declining balance as it is paid down or paid off. Further, some of their procedures are specifically
for credit bureau purposes and more closely in line with common U.S. business practice than with Federal regulations.
For example, business practice considers a customer's account to be current up to 30 days past the due date of an invoice;
whereas in the Federal Perkins Loan program, a borrower is considered to be in default when he or she fails to make an
installment payment when due.

One commenter argued that the Federal Perkins Loan program operates differently from the FFEL Program, and there

of the FFEL Program. The commenter believed that institutions would have to install costly and burdensome tracking
mechanisms in order to implement this provision.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary agrees with the commenter that there is no statutory requirement that mandates similar default reduction
plans for the Federal Perkins Loan Program and the FFEL Program. However, in the interest of minimizing increases
to burden at the institution, it is the Secretary's intent to mirror similar provisions that have existed in other
title IV programs for a number of years, such as the FFEL Program. The default reduction plan, as outlined in these provisions,
has been in effect in the FFEL Program for many years and, thus, has been thoroughly tested. Since most institutions
are already participating in the FFEL Program, the Secretary does not believe that this provision increases burden;
rather, he believes it streamlines and improves the delivery of student aid. The Secretary reminds commenters that
there is no requirement for a high default institution to implement this specific plan. Each institution has the option
of developing its own plan, subject to approval by the Secretary.

A few commenters suggested that the Secretary not include a provision in the default reduction plan that would require
first-time borrowers to endorse their check and to ``pick up'' any remaining proceeds at the institution. Instead,
because many institutions have Federal Perkins loan disbursement systems that do not involve the issuance of a check,
they recommended that the borrower's loan amount be credited directly to his or her student account and that any remaining
proceeds also be credited to his or her student account, with one commenter recommending that the borrower be notified
as to how he or she will receive his or her funds and that the loan funds will be disbursed 30 days after enrollment. One
commenter objected to the requirement that the disbursement to a first-time borrower be delayed until 30 days after
enrollment.

The Secretary is sympathetic to the concerns of these commenters but does not agree with the comments to remove the
delayed disbursement provision from the default reduction plan. The Secretary reminds the commenters that the purpose
of the default reduction plan is to help institutions that have large numbers of their Federal Perkins loan borrowers
in default to set up procedures and mechanisms to help keep their borrowers out of default. One aspect of keeping a borrower
out of default is to require a face-to-face contact in order to finalize the processing of loan proceeds. This will
help ensure that the borrower understands that he or she is receiving a loan and ensures to the institution that the
borrower is really enrolling. In addition, delayed disbursement of loan proceeds ensures that the borrower is actually
enrolled and continuing his or her studies before disbursing a loan, thus avoiding the situation in which a borrower
drops out with a large debt that the borrower cannot repay.

One commenter was particularly concerned about the intrusive nature of some of the requirements of the default reduction
plan. This commenter felt that the ability to benefit provisions in the general provisions regulations should be
sufficient to ensure that students ``have a reasonable expectation of succeeding in their programs of study.'' This
commenter wonders whether institutions with ``open door'' admissions policies would be required to revise these
policies, and what an institution is to do if admissions policies are set by a Board of Trustees. This commenter also
asserts that there is no evidence that monthly reviews of in-school status will improve an institution's default
rate.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, the Secretary does not agree with this commenter. The ability-to-benefit provisions in the Student Assistance
General Provisions affords some protection but not all the needed protection. When an institution has a high cohort
default rate, one of the first places to look for the cause is to look at who is being admitted to the institution and into
what program of study. Students should not be admitted if there is not a reasonable expectation of success. Moreover,
it seems only logical that another procedure to follow for eliminating a potential cause of a high cohort default rate
is to follow up on enrollment status to ensure that a student is still enrolled and, if not enrolled, to provide exit
counselling to the student as soon as possible. The Secretary reminds the commenter that these provisions have been
in effect in the FFEL Program for several years and have not had the intrusive effect on admissions policies or the burden
of the increased reviews of enrollment status that the commenter fears.

``agree'' rather than ``reaffirm'' to repay any loan discharged in bankruptcy.

``Reaffirmation,'' as it relates to this provision, would be the borrower's signature on a new repayment agreement.
However, the Secretary has removed the provision in proposed section 674.9(g) that would have required the reaffirmation
of Federal Perkins, Direct, or Defense loan amounts that had been discharged in bankruptcy as a prerequisite to further
eligibility for additional Federal Perkins Loans. This phrase has been omitted from the final rules because it is
no longer permissible by operation of law pursuant to the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994, P.L. 103&hyph;394. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 313 of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994 added a new subsection (c) to 11 U.S.C. Section 525, to provide that
the Department and other governmental units may no longer deny a loan, loan guarantee, or loan insurance to a person
solely because that person has filed for or received a discharge in bankruptcy, has had a student loan discharged in
bankruptcy, or has not paid a student loan that has been judicially determined to be dischargeable in bankruptcy.
The Secretary interprets this provision to mean that once a debtor has filed for bankruptcy relief, or had a Federal
Perkins Loan, or other student loan, discharged or determined to be dischargeable by a Bankruptcy Court, the bankruptcy
may be considered as evidence of an adverse credit history but cannot be the basis for denial of future participation
in the Federal Perkins Loan, or other student loan programs. Conforming changes will be made to 34 CFR 668.7(e). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 674.9(e) of the current regulations states that a student's failure to meet payment obligations on a previous
loan, including a loan discharged in bankruptcy, is evidence that the student is unwilling to repay the loan. Because
the Secretary is concerned that section 674.9(e) might be used to deny a student's eligibility for a Federal Perkins
Loan based solely on the student's having had a prior loan discharged in bankruptcy, the Secretary is removing the
phrase regarding a bankruptcy discharge from the regulations. However, schools may continue to consider the student's
post-bankruptcy credit history in determining willingness to repay the loan.

 The Secretary is sensitive to this commenter's concerns. The Secretary, as part of the Department's ongoing effort
to reduce the administrative burden in the loan programs, will no longer require reaffirmation of a title IV loan as
a student eligibility requirement for a borrower whose loan was canceled due to permanent and total disability. However,

 The Secretary does not agree with the commenters. The current regulations already provide, in &sect;674.19(e)(4)(v),
that an institution may keep its records in computer format, which would include the computer records held by an institution's
servicer. Source documents supporting records in computer format must also be maintained. The Secretary recognizes
the predominance of computer servicing, but, in order for computer records to substitute for hard copies of these
records, the Secretary would need to develop specifications, for example, regarding electronic signatures, which
he is not doing at this time. Because of the need to enforce Federal Perkins loans through the judicial system, the Secretary
requires the hard copy supporting documentation.

 One commenter objected to the proposal that institutions be required to use the promissory note developed by the Secretary
with no changes, saying that the proposal was in direct violation of the statute. Many commenters supported the provision
but felt that some discretion should be retained with the format of the promissory note, as long as they retain the text
provided by the Department. Another commenter recommended including language in this provision that would clarify
that ``stated options'' (such as the minimum repayment) are not considered modifications for the purposes of this
subsection. One of these commenters pointed out that it could use an NCR form by putting the signatures on the front
of the form with all the text on the back, thereby allowing the borrower to pull one copy off the back for his or her records.
Another of these commenters wondered whether the institution could still add the provision telling borrowers that
their academic transcript would be withheld in the event of a default.

 The promissory note is a key document in any legal action and serves as a permanent record for reaffirmation of any loans
and, therefore, must remain as developed by the Secretary. Optional elements, such as the minimum monthly repayments,
have been provided for institutions to use at their own discretion and will continue to be provided as options in the
text of the promissory note. As such, the Secretary does not need to provide regulatory language to support the continuation
of the optional language. The Secretary intends the text of the Department's Federal Perkins loan promissory note
to remain unchanged. The ``text'' includes the order of the provisions and the placement of the signatures. These
may not be changed. The current regulations have provided that the note approved by the Secretary may not have substantive
changes made to it. Withholding the official academic transcript is in violation of the Family Educational Rights
and Privacy Act (FERPA), regardless of whether the borrower has signed such a provision in his or her promissory note.
Such a provision may not be included in the promissory note. The institution may change only the format of the note,
e.g., the type, style, and paper size.

 Many commenters supported the forbearance provision. Several commenters felt that the proposed wording in section

of up to 12 months.'' One commenter requested clarification of ``disposable income'' and ``poverty line.'' Another
commenter suggested additional documentation to the Federal tax return for the purposes of documenting ``disposable
income.'' Another commenter felt this provision should make reference to the national service award.

 For a discussion of these issues as they relate to making provisions in the Federal Perkins Loan program comparable
to similar provisions in the FFEL Program, the Secretary asks the commenters to refer to the discussion of the definition
of ``disposable income'' under &sect;674.2. The ``poverty line'' is determined in accordance with section 673(2)
of the Community Service Block Grant Act, and information on the poverty line may be obtained by calling the Office
of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, Department of Health and Human Services, (202) 690&hyph;6141.
The Secretary does not have the statutory authority to extend forbearance to borrowers serving in National Community
Service jobs. However, the Secretary strongly encourages institutions to use their discretion, allowed under these
regulatory provisions, to grant forbearance to borrowers serving in National Community Service jobs.

 Many commenters disagreed with the Secretary's proposal that if an institution no longer qualifies as an institution
of higher education, the borrower's deferment ends on the date the institution ceases to qualify. The commenters
argued that the borrower's eligibility should not be affected by circumstances that are beyond the borrower's control.
The unanticipated cessation of a deferment would also pose an undue hardship on the borrower. One commenter suggested
that to expect a borrower or an institution and its third party servicer to monitor another institution's qualification
as an institution of higher education throughout the borrower's deferment period would be unduly burdensome for
the institution and the servicer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter agreed that borrowers who attend institutions that do not qualify as institutions of higher education
should not receive deferments; however, this requirement should be eased for borrowers who begin an academic year
at an eligible institution that subsequently loses its eligibility sometime during that academic year. The commenters
suggested that, at a minimum, the borrowers should be granted a continuation of their deferment to the end of the academic
year in which they are enrolled. A few commenters suggested that a borrower should continue to be eligible for a deferment
for the remainder of the deferment period.

 While the Secretary understands these concerns, the Secretary does not agree with the commenters. The statute is
clear that a student must be attending an institution of higher education (IHE). The Secretary feels that very few
borrowers would be in the situation in which an initially-eligible IHE would lose its eligibility. However, the Secretary
is not requiring the deferment-granting institution to closely monitor this situation. Rather, in order to not unduly
increase burden at the institution, the Secretary requires that if the deferment-granting institution becomes
aware that an institution is no longer an IHE, the borrower's deferment must be terminated. This borrower then qualifies
for a 6-month post-deferment grace period, which effectively reduces the impact on the borrowers.

 One commenter recommended that the regulations include a definition for the minimum period during which a borrower

Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary is quite interested in this issue and understands that there is a wide variety of interpretations of
the applicability of the 6-month post-deferment grace period. As the Secretary understands it, institutions are
granting the 6-month post-deferment grace period in one of four ways: (1) granting a 6-month post-deferment grace
period regardless of the period of time the borrower is enrolled, even if it is only for one day; (2) granting a 6-month
post-deferment grace period (and also a ``student'' deferment) only after the enrollment records are finalized,
usually 5 or 6 weeks into the term; (3) granting the 6-month post-deferment grace period only if the borrower is enrolled
longer than the borrower's repayment billing period; or (4) requiring the borrower to complete the enrollment period.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statute requires granting the post-deferment grace period for ``any period'' the borrower qualifies for a deferment,
and a borrower qualifies for a ``student'' deferment for ``any period'' of enrollment as at least a half-time student.
Therefore, any institution that is granting post-deferment grace periods under the first condition is in compliance
with the Federal Perkins Loan program regulations. All other institutions need to modify the procedures used for
determining eligibility for post-deferment grace periods and also student deferments. While the statute allows
an institution much discretion in administering the Federal Perkins Loan program, the granting of deferments and
post-deferment grace periods to qualified non-defaulted borrowers and the granting of cancellation benefits to
qualified borrowers are not at the institution's discretion. These provisions are an entitlement to the borrower
once the borrower has provided a written request and acceptable documentation to the institution. The Secretary
expects to revisit this issue, should the Secretary find that there is widespread abuse by borrowers of this benefit.

Several commenters felt the proposal to require defaulted borrowers to make ``satisfactory arrangements'' to repay
the loan as one of the conditions to be met in order to be granted a deferment would be unfair to the borrowers and impossible
to accomplish in many cases because a borrower is in ``default'' the first day a payment is missed. Several commenters
felt the provisions in the current regulations should be maintained.

The Secretary agrees that implementation of this provision as written in the proposed rule is unfair to borrowers
and agrees that the current regulatory provision should be maintained. The Secretary reminds the commenters that
&sect;674.37(a)(2) provides the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
option 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to an institution to declare a borrower in default if the borrower fails to supply a deferment request and documentation.
The fact that a borrower is in ``default'' the first day after a payment is missed is more significant for the cohort
default rate calculation. The borrower still has the opportunity to respond to the demand letters before being reported
to a national credit bureau, for example, even though this borrower would be counted as a default for purposes of the
cohort default rate calculation.

There is a typographical error in this section. The date should be ``July 1, 1993.'' The Secretary has included this
date to provide for those borrowers who are eligible for cancellation benefits but are not eligible for the new deferment
provisions (borrowers whose loans were made on or after July 23, 1992, but before July 1, 1993).

While several commenters supported the Secretary's proposal to amend section 674.43 to allow a borrower to elect
to repay his or her Federal Perkins loan by means of the electronic transfer of funds from the borrower's bank account,
they felt the Secretary should modify this proposal even further to allow for annual notification to the borrower
regardless of the repayment frequency. These commenters felt that this requirement was too burdensome.

The Secretary agrees. Using the electronic method of repaying a loan is quite similar to the coupons system, and no
statement of account is required under this system. However, the borrower has the remaining coupons to demonstrate
the amount still due on the loan. This does not exist under the electronic system, and the borrower needs to be kept apprised
of the status of his or her account. This statement of account needs to be no more frequent than annually. As part of the
Secretary's effort to be mindful of the burden imposed by regulations on the institution, the Secretary is reducing
burden in this provision by requiring only an annual statement of account.

While a few commenters strongly supported the provision in this section that preempts state collection laws as they
relate to allowing a collection agency to collect a Federal Perkins loan if the collection agency is not physically
located in the state, they also recommended that the Secretary apply similar language to billing procedures, &sect;674.43.

The Secretary is not aware of any state law that prohibits a collection agency from billing a borrower if that collection
agency does not have residence in that particular state. Moreover, the Secretary has not been informed of any problem
with a state that is prohibiting the billing of borrowers in this circumstance. Until such time as a problem develops,
the Secretary sees no reason to add this provision.

There were a number of comments on this section, and they all recommended that institutions should be allowed to write-off
non-defaulted small balances, in amounts of less than $25. The commenters felt that collecting on small balance loans
is not cost-effective and this change would ease the paperwork and administrative burdens.

While it has been a longstanding policy, and, more recently, a regulatory provision, at the Department to allow institutions
to write off defaulted accounts with balances of less than $25.00, it is not the policy to allow, nor do the current regulations
allow, the write-off of non-defaulted loans, regardless of the size of the balance. This issue cannot be addressed
in this final regulation, because the Secretary is required to provide the public an opportunity to make proposals
and to provide comments in this area. However, the Secretary is sensitive to the issue raised by these commenters and
will revisit this issue at a later date.

The Secretary regrets any confusion that this section might have caused the commenters. The NPRM used the term ``allied
health professional'' which became confused with the American Medical Association's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Twenty-Eight Allied Health Careers. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These twenty-eight careers are those areas in which the American Medical Association (AMA) accredits programs and
only comprise a small proportion of ``allied health professions.'' ``Allied health professional'' is a generic
term used to designate a large group of health-related personnel who assist, facilitate, or complement the work of
physicians and other specialists in the health care system. ``Allied health professionals'' range from therapists
and counselors to health care assistants. The Secretary intends ``allied health professional'' to be interpreted
in its generic sense. The Secretary's intent was to include those health care professionals who might be working full-time
except that the employment takes the form of part-time employment at more than one facility as well as those health
care professionals who might be providing health care services in an environment that would not qualify as a health
care facility (such as a school), or who might be working in a private facility. The Secretary believes that Congress
did not intend to exclude any qualified nurses or medical technicians, as long as they are working full-time and providing
health care services. The Secretary will not provide a list of ``allied health professions'' because the list of professions
is too lengthy and does not remain static. The Secretary provides further clarification of issues such as this in the

Four commenters responded to the Secretary's proposal to define ``low-income individual'' for the purpose of community
service under the FWS program. The commenters wanted either clarification or elimination of the definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter acknowledged that the Secretary had been asked to clarify the meaning of low-income clientele in reference
to individuals served through a community service program; however, the commenter believed that the proposed language
adds another layer of eligibility to FWS program administration. This commenter also believed that the proposed
definition of ``low-income individual'' unduly encumbers the FWS community service concept and strongly suggested
that a much more simplified approach be considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter suggested that efforts to increase participation in community service activities through the
FWS program might be hampered if institutions were required to verify the income levels of clientele served by various
community organizations.

The Secretary has taken these comments under consideration and has determined that at this time there is no need to
burden institutions with a formal definition of ``low-income individual'' for purposes of providing community
service under the FWS program. There is no requirement under the statute that a particular number or proportion of
the individuals must be low-income persons. However, the Secretary reminds institutions of the statutory emphasis
placed on the human, educational, environmental, and public safety needs of low-income individuals.

One commenter requested that more clarity be provided on whether the service has to be ``direct'' under the community
service component of the FWS program. Several commenters were concerned that the Secretary's interpretation of
the meaning of providing community service as being ``hands-on'' or ``direct contact'' will do a great disservice
to student workers by eliminating many behind-the-scene jobs. In general, commenters believed that a successful
community services agency requires all types of jobs to operate efficiently and that clerical jobs serve an important
function in any organization.

Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary did not propose in the NPRM a change to the definition of ``community services.'' The Secretary reminds
the commenters that the current definition of ``community services'' in &sect;675.2 does not require that the service
provided by the FWS student must be ``direct'' to be considered community service. The job duties must include providing
services that are designed to improve the quality of life for community residents or solve particular problems related
to their needs. In determining whether the service is community service, the institution must always consider whether
the service provided by the FWS student primarily benefits the community as opposed to the agency or institution.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary at this time is leaving flexibility to the institutions in determining what jobs provide service to
the community. This approach is adopted to minimize the burden on institutions in administering the community service
component of the FWS program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary encourages institutions to develop jobs that instill a sense of social responsibility in the students
and touch the lives of community residents in a meaningful and lasting way. The Secretary believes that the best way
to provide ``community services'' is for the students' jobs to put them in ``direct'' contact where possible with
the recipients of the services or involve some type of ``hands on'' service in the community. However, the Secretary
does not intend to indicate that certain activities are more important than others or that only jobs that have ``direct''
contact with community members are acceptable. For example, an FWS student working for a ``meals on wheels'' program
for the elderly may prepare those meals without any ``direct'' contact with the community recipients, yet the service
is very important in meeting the needs of the elderly.

Comments:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Three commenters discussed the proposal required by section 442(e) of the HEA that only an institution that uses at
least 10 percent of its total amount of FWS Federal funds granted to compensate students employed in community service
are eligible for reallocated FWS funds and that all the reallocated FWS funds must be used for community service. One
of these commenters suggested that the Secretary should clarify this proposal in the regulations. The other two commenters
expressed the concern that the provision that requires institutions to have a fair-share shortfall in order to receive
these reallocated supplemental FWS funds presents a disincentive to institutions, with no shortfall, to strive
for the 10 percent figure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenters suggested that the Secretary consider an alternative to the current process of awarding unexpended
funds. They would like to see the fair-share requirement changed to consider also those institutions that meet or
exceed the 10 percent rule, but do not have a shortfall. In addition, one of these commenters further noted that the
use of the reallocated funds should not be restricted to community service wages. Instead, since the institution
had already done 100 percent above the requirement, it should be allowed to use reallocated funds in any FWS program
or for administrative costs.

Under current FWS regulations in &sect;675.4, the Secretary allocates and reallocates funds to institutions participating
in the FWS program in accordance with section 442 of the HEA. Therefore, this provision will not be codified in the regulations.
Under section 442 of the HEA, the Secretary reallocates funds on a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the amount of an institution's fair-share shortfall as a percentage of the fair-share shortfalls of all participating
institutions with an unmet FWS request. The Secretary continues to believe this position to be the most equitable
formula for awarding unexpended funds. The statutory provision that mandates this new rule for receipt of unexpended
FWS funds, section 442(e)(1) of the HEA, provides that these funds will only go to institutions that expend at least
10 percent of their total amount of FWS funds (initial and supplemental) to employ students in community service jobs,
and that the reallocated FWS funds must also be used only for that purpose. Congress amended this section to encourage
students to participate in community service activities.

Several commenters believed that the jobs performed by an institution's FWS students that provide support services
solely to the institution's own students with disabilities should be counted toward meeting the community service
requirements under the FWS program. Many commenters believed that not to do this would cause an undue hardship for
the institution. One commenter questioned why under the FWS program it is permissible to develop programs that support
services to an institution's own students with disabilities yet under the community service component this is not
allowed. Two commenters asked for consistency between the program participation agreement and the community service
definition concerning the meaning of support services to students with disabilities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 441(c) of the HEA under the definition of community service states that an institution may include as part
of its community service component support services to students with disabilities. Section 443(b)(9) of the HEA
requires institutions under the program participation agreement to assure that employment under the FWS program
may be used to support programs for supportive services to students with disabilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes the intention of the community service requirement in the statute is for an institution's
FWS students to work with elementary and secondary school students as well as students attending other postsecondary
institutions, and provide services to the disabled, and not just for an institution to provide services solely to
its own students with disabilities. As allowed by section 443(b)(9) of the HEA, an institution may use FWS funds to
provide support services to its own institutional students with disabilities. However, to be providing community
service in accordance with section 441(c) of the HEA, the FWS students providing the service must be providing the
service to students with disabilities in the community. The fact that the FWS students also provide the services to
the institution's own students with disabilities would not necessarily prevent the job from being considered community
service.

shall use at least 5 percent of the total amount of FWS Federal funds granted to such institution to compensate students
employed in community service, except that the Secretary may waive this requirement if the Secretary determines
that enforcing it would cause hardship for students at an institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the NPRM, the Secretary requested comments regarding the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions under which the Secretary should grant waivers of this provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters believed that means and costs of transportation are major issues the Secretary needs to consider
in granting a waiver. The commenters believed that students from low-income backgrounds do not have cars, and some
institutions are located in areas that have no public transportation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter believed that there are many institutions located in rural areas and that community service jobs may
not be accessible. Some commenters believed it would be a hardship on institutions that could only locate community
service jobs with agencies that could not afford to pay a portion of the non-Federal share. Other commenters wanted
the Department to regulate the criteria that the Secretary would use to determine this waiver. One commenter expressed
concern for the safety of students providing community service in some locations. This same commenter noted that
performance of community service might conflict with student class schedules. One commenter believed that private
technical universities have very few degree programs offered that are geared toward community service and that placements
in this area are somewhat rare.

Section 443(b)(2)(A) of the amended HEA mandates that at least 5 percent of an institution's total amount of Federal
FWS funds granted must be used to compensate students employed in community service jobs, unless the Secretary waives
the requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on public comment, the Secretary does not foresee many instances in which a waiver would be granted. However,
to allow flexibility to consider factors that are valid reasons for a waiver, the Secretary is not specifying the specific
circumstances that would receive a waiver. The fact that it may be difficult for the institution to comply with this
provision is not a basis for granting a waiver. The Secretary will consider providing more specific regulatory guidance
on this issue as he gains more experience in processing these kinds of waiver requests.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two commenters requested that the additional Administrative Cost Allowance (ACA) available for the expired Community
Service Learning program be continued for the community service component under the FWS program. These commenters
believed that the regular campus-based ACA provided institutions was already fully utilized and the additional
expenses incurred for the new community service mandate will have to be absorbed by the institutions. One commenter
believed that the statute should be interpreted to allow use of up to 10 percent of the entire campus-based ACA for the
purpose of paying the costs for community service, but no more than the portion of the ACA attributable to the FWS program.
The commenter wanted the flexibility to be given to the institutions in using the ACA at no additional cost to the Federal
government.

Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Amendments changed sections 447 and 489(a) of the HEA to eliminate the special ACA for work-study for community
service learning. In accordance with the requirements of the HEA, the Secretary removed the special ACA from &sect;675.18(b)(5).
However, the Amendments did amend section 447 of the HEA to permit an institution to use up to 10 percent of the funds
available for the institution's regular campus-based ACA and attributable to the institution's FWS program expenditures
to cover expenses incurred for its program of community service. The Secretary, in accordance with the requirements
of the HEA, further amended &sect;675.18(b)(5) to provide an institution with this authority.

Comments: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter suggested that under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Work-Colleges subpart of the regulations the Department should provide for the allocation and reallocation of funds
as it does under &sect;675.4 of the FWS program regulations even though no funds are appropriated.

Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary will implement the allocation and reallocation process for the Work-Colleges program based on the
institutions' requests. The funds will be allocated and reallocated based on each institution's approved request
for Federal funds for the Work-Colleges program as a percent of the total of such approved requests for all applicant
institutions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These final regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order
the Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this regulatory action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential costs associated with the final regulations are those resulting from statutory requirements and those
determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering this program effectively and efficiently. Burdens
specifically associated with information collection requirements were identified and explained in the NPRM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both quantitative and qualitative_of these regulations, the Secretary
has determined that the benefits of the regulations justify the costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary has also determined that this regulatory action does not unduly interfere with State, local, and tribal
governments in the exercise of their governmental functions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 674.34(e) contains information collection requirements. As required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of

Waiver of Proposed Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the changes made to these regulations based on public comment on the notice of proposed rulemaking,
the Secretary has revised the regulations to include changes made by the Improving America's Schools Act of 1994 (Pub.
L. 103&hyph;382), and the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;394), enacted subsequent to publication
of the notice of proposed rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is the practice of the Secretary to offer interested parties the opportunity to comment on proposed regulations
in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553. However, since these changes merely incorporate
statutory changes into the regulations, public comment could have no effect. Therefore, the Secretary has determined
pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 5532(b)(B) that public comment on the regulations is unnecessary and contrary to the public interest.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the NPRM, the Secretary requested comments on whether the proposed regulations would require transmission of
information that is being gathered by or is available from any other agency or authority of the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the response to the proposed rules and on its own review, the Department has determined that the regulations
in this document do not require transmission of information that is being gathered by or is available from any other
agency or authority of the United States.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The Secretary considers enforcement of paragraph (e)(1) of this section to be contrary to the interest of the program
only if the institution returned more than 10 percent of its allocation due to circumstances beyond the institution's

period multiplied by 1.21. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Secretary may waive the provision of paragraph (f)(1) of this section for any institution that has a cohort
default rate that does not exceed 7.5 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. A new &sect;674.5 is added to read as follows:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 -->
&sect;674.5 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Default penalty. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If an institution's cohort default rate meets the following levels, a default penalty is imposed on the institution
as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If the institution's cohort default rate equals or exceeds 15 percent, the institution must establish a default
reduction plan in accordance with &sect;674.6. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the institution's cohort default rate equals or exceeds 20 percent, but is less than 25 percent, the institution's
FCC is reduced by 10 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If the institution's cohort default rate equals or exceeds 25 percent, but is less than 30 percent, the institution's
FCC is reduced by 30 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) If the institution's cohort default rate equals or exceeds 30 percent, the institution's FCC is reduced to zero.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Cohort default rate. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The term ``cohort default rate'' means, for any award year in which 30 or more current and former students at the
institution enter repayment on a loan received for attendance at the institution, the percentage of those current
and former students who enter repayment in that award year on the loans received for attendance at that institution
who default before the end of the following award year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In determining the number of students who default before the end of the following award year, the Secretary excludes
any loans that, due to improper servicing or collection, would result in an inaccurate or incomplete calculation
of the cohort default rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) For any award year in which less than 30 current and former students at the institution enter repayment on a loan
received for attendance at the institution, the ``cohort default rate'' means the percentage of those current and
former students who entered repayment on loans received for attendance at that institution in any of the three most
recent award years and who defaulted on those loans before the end of the award year immediately following the year
in which they entered repayment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Defaulted loans to be included in the cohort default rate. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

For purposes of calculating the cohort default rate under paragraph (b) of this section_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A borrower must be included only if the borrower's default has persisted for at least_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) 240 consecutive days for loans repayable in monthly installments; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(2) A loan is considered to be in default if a payment is made by the institution of higher education, its owner, agency,
contractor, employee, or any other entity or individual affiliated with the institution, in order to avoid default
by the borrower; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3)(i) Any loan that is in default, but on which the borrower has made satisfactory arrangements to repay the loan,
or any loan that has been rehabilitated before the end of the following award year is not considered to be in default
for purposes of the cohort default rate calculation; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) In the case of a student who has attended and borrowed at more than one institution, the student and his or her subsequent
repayment or default are attributed to the institution for attendance at which the student received the loan that
entered repayment in the award year; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Improper servicing or collection means the failure of the institution to comply with subpart C of this part.

Locations of the institution.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) A cohort default rate of an institution applies to all locations of the institution as it exists on the first day
of the award year for which the rate is calculated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A cohort default rate of an institution applies to all locations of the institution from the date the institution
is notified of that rate until the institution is notified by the Secretary that the rate no longer applies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) For an institution that changes status from a location of one institution to a free-standing institution, the
Secretary determines the cohort default rate based on the institution's status as of July 1 of the award year for which
a cohort default rate is being calculated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4)(i) For an institution that changes status from a free-standing institution to a location of another institution,
the Secretary determines the cohort default rate based on the combined number of students who enter repayment during
the applicable award year and the combined number of students who default during the applicable award years from both
the former free-standing institution and the other institution. This cohort default rate applies to the new consolidated
institution and all of its current locations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) For free-standing institutions that merge, the Secretary determines the cohort default rate based on the combined
number of students who enter repayment during the applicable award year and the combined number of students who default
during the applicable award years from both of the institutions that are merging. This cohort default rate applies
to the new, consolidated institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) For an institution that changes status from a location of one institution to a location of another institution,
the Secretary determines the cohort default rate based on the combined number of students who enter repayment during
the applicable award year and the number of students who default during the applicable award years from both of the
institutions in their entirety, not limited solely to the respective locations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) For an institution that has a change in ownership that results in a change in control, the Secretary determines
the cohort default rate based on the combined number of students who enter repayment during the applicable award year
and the combined number of students who default during the applicable award years from the institution under both
the old and new control.

Treatment of resources in excess of need. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An institution shall take the following steps if it learns that a student has received additional resources not included
in the calculation of Direct or Federal Perkins Loan eligibility that would result in the student's total resources
exceeding his or her financial need by more than $300:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The institution shall decide whether the student has increased financial need that was unanticipated when it
awarded financial aid to the student. If the student demonstrates increased financial need and the total resources
do not exceed this increased need by more than $300, no further action is necessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If no increased need is demonstrated, or the student's total resources still exceed his or her need by more than
$300, as recalculated pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the institution shall cancel any undisbursed
loan or grant (other than a Federal Pell Grant).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If the student's total resources still exceed his or her need by more than $300, after the institution takes the
steps required in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section, the institution shall consider the amount by which the
resources exceed the student's financial need by more than $300 as an overpayment.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary amends the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program regulations. The FFEL Program consists of
the Federal Stafford, Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS), Federal PLUS, and the Federal Consolidation
Loan Programs. These amendments are needed to implement certain changes made to the Higher Education Act of 1965,
as amended (HEA), by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA), enacted August 10, 1993, and by the Higher
Education Technical Amendments of 1993, enacted December 20, 1993. These regulations also amend the FFEL Program
regulations to permit a lender to issue a ``master check'' to an institution for purposes of disbursing Federal Stafford
loan proceeds to an institution, to prohibit a subsequent holder 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a loan to bill the Secretary for any applicable interest benefits or special allowance on a loan for which origination
fees have not been paid, and to limit the collection charges that may be assessed a borrower with a defaulted loan that
is paid off through loan consolidation. These regulations also clarify a change made to the HEA by the Improving America's
Schools Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;382).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FFEL Program regulations (34 CFR Part 682) govern the Federal Stafford Loan Program, the Federal Unsubsidized
Stafford Loan Program, the Federal SLS Program, the Federal PLUS Program, and the Federal Consolidation Loan Program
(formerly the Guaranteed Student Loan programs). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary is amending 34 CFR Part 682 to implement changes made to the HEA by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1993 (OBRA) (Pub. L. 103&hyph;66) and the Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1993 (the Technical Amendments)
(Pub. L. 103&hyph;208). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These amendments reflect changes made to the HEA by OBRA, such as the payment of lender referral fees to guaranty agencies,
the reduction of the reinsurance coverage and reinsurance rates for a guaranty agency's losses on default claims
and the reduction of insurance coverage a guaranty agency may pay on default claims. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These amendments also reflect changes to the HEA made by the Technical Amendments, such as a lender's obligation to
rebate excess interest on certain Federal Stafford loans to either the borrower or the Secretary and require lenders
to convert the interest rates on certain Federal Stafford loans to a variable interest rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These amendments also permit a lender to disburse Federal Stafford loan proceeds to a school via a master check, prohibit
a subsequent holder of a loan to bill the Secretary for any applicable interest benefits or special allowance on a loan
for which origination fees have not been paid, and limit the collection charges that may be assessed a borrower with
a defaulted loan that is paid off through loan consolidation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These amendments also exclude loans made under a guaranty agency's lender-of-last-resort program from the guaranty
agency's reinsurance percentage determined under &sect;682.404. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 13, 1994, the Secretary published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for the FFEL Program in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 52038). The NPRM included a discussion of the issues surrounding the proposed changes which will not be repeated
here. The following list summarizes those issues and identifies the pages of the preamble to the NPRM on which a discussion
may be found: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Returning excess interest to certain Stafford loan borrowers or the Secretary and converting the interest
rate on certain Federal Stafford loans to a variable interest rate (page 52038);

(page 52039); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The limitation of a guaranty agency to paying 98 percent of the unpaid principal balance of each loan on default
claims on loans disbursed on or after October 1, 1993 (page 52039); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The rates at which the Secretary will reinsure a guaranty agency's default claims (page 52039).

Share of Default Costs). As discussed below, the Secretary has determined that further consideration of the regulations
is necessary.

&bull;The final regulations have been revised to clarify that a borrower's loan proceeds disbursed via a master check
are treated, for operational purposes, the same way as loan proceeds are treated that are disbursed via electronic
funds transfer. These technical changes are reflected throughout the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The final regulations have been revised to provide that a loan made under a guaranty agency's lender-of-last-resort
program are not included in the guaranty agency's reinsurance rate determined under &sect;682.404.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the Secretary's invitation in the NPRM, 129 parties submitted comments on the proposed regulations.
An analysis of the comments and changes made to the regulations that differ from the NPRM follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Major issues are grouped according to subject, with the reference to the appropriate sections of the regulations.
Other substantive issues are discussed under the section of the regulations to which they pertain. Technical and
other minor changes, and suggested changes the Secretary is not legally authorized to make under the applicable statutory
authority are generally not addressed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Some commenters noted that the proposed regulations did not reflect other changes made to the HEA as a result of OBRA
and the Technical Amendments. The commenters expressed concern that the Department's decision not to reflect these
statutory changes in the regulations would result in a delay in their implementation under the master calendar provisions
of the HEA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary agrees that the statutory changes noted by the commenters should be incorporated into the FFEL regulations
and is preparing a regulations package of technical corrections and self-implementing changes that the Department
plans to publish shortly. As self-implementing provisions of the statute, these requirements are currently in effect.

 Many commenters asked the Secretary not to implement proposed section 682.418, which would implement the requirement
in section 428(n) of the HEA, which requires States to pay a share of the costs of defaults in the FFEL Program. Many of
the commenters raised concerns or questions about a number of the proposed regulatory provisions. In addition, some
commenters informed the Secretary that the implementation of this rule in fiscal year 1995 would not give the States
enough time to appropriate money to pay their fees and to enact laws under which they could pass a portion of their fees
on to schools. Further, the commenters argued that the States would not be able to develop any criteria for exceptional
mitigating circumstances that could be approved by the Secretary before the fee is due to the Secretary. In addition,
many commenters argued that the formula prescribed by section 428(n) of the HEA would impose undue penalties on States
and schools.

 Based on the comments received in response to the NPRM, the Secretary has determined that more time is needed to review
and address the concerns raised by the commenters regarding implementation of section 428(n) of the HEA. Therefore,
the Secretary has decided not to issue regulations implementing that provision at this time. The Secretary will further
evaluate the statutory requirements and pursue further rulemaking during 1995 to implement section 428(n) of the
HEA for fiscal year 1996. Moreover, the Secretary will exercise his authority under section 432(a)(5) and (6) of the
HEA to waive any fee a State would be responsible to pay under section 428(n) of the HEA for fiscal year 1995.

 The Secretary has decided that more time is needed to review the concerns raised by the commenters and, therefore,
is not publishing the final rule to implement section 428(n) of the HEA in these regulations. The Secretary expects
to fully implement this provision in fiscal year 1996 and will publish the final regulations at a later date.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Many commenters suggested that the Secretary calculate a borrower's refund of excess interest paid on a Federal Stafford
loan based on the ending principal balance of the loan for the quarter instead of the daily principal balance. The commenter
noted that using the average daily principal balance of the loan for the quarter would be more burdensome to a lender
than using the ending principal balance. Other commenters noted that the guidance in the regulations was not consistent
with guidance the Department has previously issued.

Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary is aware that using the average daily principal balance of a loan for a quarter requires a lender to track
more information than if the lender used the ending principal balance of the loan. The Secretary is also aware that
the regulatory provisions differ from the guidance the Department has issued with respect to rebates of excess interest.
However, these regulations reflect the provisions that are contained in section 427A(i) of the HEA. The Secretary
does not have the authority to change these statutory requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters suggested that the Secretary extend the 30-day period to credit the refund to 45 or 60 days. The commenters
believed that a lender with a large volume of loans for which a refund was required may not be able to make the appropriate
refunds within 30 days from the last day of the calendar year in which the quarter falls.

The Secretary realizes that a lender that has a large number of loans for which a rebate is required may have difficulty
making the appropriate refunds within the 30-day period. However, the 30-day time period is expressly mandated by
section 427(i)(5) of the HEA. The Secretary does not have the authority to change this statutory requirement.

A commenter suggested that a school, when receiving FFEL proceeds via check, should be given the option to receive
those proceeds via a master check or individual checks. The commenter pointed out that the disbursement of FFEL Program
loan proceeds via a master check will place the extra administrative burden and costs associated with processing
the master check and cutting individual checks to borrowers at a school in cases when a school would otherwise endorse
an individual loan check and deliver it to the borrower.

Many commenters suggested that the Secretary should require a school to obtain a borrower's written authorization
to release FFEL Program loan proceeds that are disbursed via a master check. The commenters believed that this is a
necessary control to ensure that the borrowers are aware they are receiving their loan proceeds.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters suggested that the Secretary notify a guaranty agency, or a new holder of a loan, that the originating
lender has failed to pay the origination fees. The commenters argued that a guaranty agency or a new holder will not
know if the origination fees have been paid on a loan.

Discussion:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary does not agree with the commenters. The Secretary believes that the most practical way for a lender or
guaranty agency to find out if the origination fees have been paid on a loan is through the lender selling the loan or
the lender that is submitting the claim. It would not be practicable for the Secretary to verify if the origination
fees have been paid on a loan every time a loan is sold or a default claim is filed. The Secretary is not informed by lenders
when a loan is sold.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters believed that a guaranty agency should not be penalized by loss of eligibility for reinsurance on
a loan because a lender did not pay the origination fees. The commenters believed that the lender should be held responsible
and be penalized for failing to pay the origination fees on loans that it has made.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary does not agree with the commenters. It has been the longstanding policy of the Secretary that an FFEL
Program loan is not eligible for reinsurance if the lender or agency has failed to comply with all Federal requirements
with respect to the loan. However, the Secretary agrees with the commenters that a lender that fails to pay the origination
fees should be penalized for failing to do so. The Secretary will take whatever action necessary against a lender to
ensure that the origination fees are promptly being paid.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters suggested that the Secretary amend this provision to permit a lender that purchases a loan to pay the
origination fees to the Secretary. The commenters argued that many originating lenders sell their loans upon disbursement
and have contractual agreements with the purchasing lenders that provide that the purchasing lender will pay the
origination fees.

Discussion:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary does not believe that such an amendment is necessary. The Secretary has promulgated this rule because,
in many cases, such origination fees are not being paid to the Secretary. The Secretary believes that it is necessary
to hold an originating lender responsible for such fees because this will decrease the incidence of origination fees
not being paid to the Secretary. A purchasing lender may reimburse the originating lender for the origination fees.

Many commenters suggested that the Secretary provide in the regulations that a guaranty agency may (generally) not
insure less than 98 percent of the unpaid principal balance of loans insured under its program. The commenters suggested
this change because they believed this reflected the language of the HEA.

The Secretary does not agree with the commenters. The Secretary believes that Congress intended to bar a guaranty
agency from paying lenders more than 98 percent of the unpaid principal and accrued interest on default claims filed
on loans made on or after October 1, 1993. The Secretary believes therefore it would be a misuse of a guaranty agency's
reserve fund to pay more than 98 percent of the unpaid principal and interest on a defaulted loan.

Many commenters suggested that the Secretary's limitation of collection costs that may be included in a Federal Consolidation
Loan to 18.5 percent was unreasonable. The commenters believed that 18.5 percent would not cover the collection costs
incurred on some loans. The commenters also argued that this provision debilitates the deterring effect collection
costs have with respect to a borrower repaying his or her loan.

The Secretary does not agree with the commenters that limiting collection costs to 18.5 percent of the borrower's
outstanding balance is unreasonable. The Secretary wishes to clarify that this provision is intended to encourage
a borrower with a defaulted loan to consolidate the loan in order to get the loan out of default and reestablish his or
her eligibility for student financial aid. The Secretary believes that limiting the collection costs that may be
included in a Federal Consolidation loan will provide an incentive for a borrower to get out of default.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the changes made to part 682 based on public comment on the notice of proposed rulemaking, the Secretary
has revised the regulations to include changes made by the Improving America's Schools Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;382),
enacted subsequent to publication of the notice of proposed rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is the practice of the Secretary to offer interested parties the opportunity to comment on proposed regulations
in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553. However, since these changes merely incorporate
statutory changes into the regulations, public comment could have no effect. Therefore, the Secretary has determined
pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) that public comment on the regulations is unnecessary and contrary to the public interest.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is adding 286 chemicals and chemical categories, which include 39 chemicals as part of two delineated categories,
to the list of toxic chemicals subject to reporting under section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know
Act of 1986 (EPCRA) and section 6607 of the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 (PPA). The additions of these chemicals
and chemical categories are based on their acute human health effects, carcinogenicity or other chronic human health
effects, and/or their adverse effects on the environment. EPA is taking this action pursuant to its authority to add
to the list those chemicals and chemical categories that meet the EPCRA section 313(d)(2) criteria for addition to
the list of toxic chemicals. EPCRA section 313 reporting for the newly listed chemicals and chemical categories will
be required beginning with the 1995 calendar year. As such, the first reports for the added chemicals and chemical
categories must be submitted to EPA and States by July 1, 1996.

This rule is issued under section 313(d) of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 (EPCRA),
42 U.S.C. 11001 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

B. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 313 of EPCRA requires certain facilities manufacturing, processing, or otherwise using listed toxic chemicals
to report their environmental releases of such chemicals annually. Beginning with the 1991 reporting year, such
facilities also must report pollution prevention and recycling data for such chemicals, pursuant to section 6607
of the Pollution Prevention Act, 42 U.S.C. 13106. Section 313 established an initial list of toxic chemicals that
was composed of more than 300 chemicals and 20 chemical categories. Section 313(d) authorizes EPA to add or delete
chemicals from the list, and sets forth criteria for these actions. Under section 313(e), any person may petition
EPA to add chemicals to or delete chemicals from the list. EPA issued a statement of petition policy and guidance in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of February 4, 1987 (52 FR 3479), to provide guidance regarding the recommended content and format for petitions.
On May 23, 1991 (56 FR 23703), EPA issued guidance regarding the recommended content of petitions to delete individual
members of the section 313 metal compound categories. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 12, 1994 (59 FR 1788), EPA issued a proposal in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to add 313 chemicals and chemical categories to the list of toxic chemicals under EPCRA section 313 based on their acute
human health effects, carcinogenicity or other chronic human health effects, and/or their environmental effects.
EPA's decision to add the chemicals and chemical categories in today's rule to the section 313 list is based on a further
assessment, in light of public comments of both the relative toxicity of the chemicals--the potency of the chemical's
inherent toxicity--and a careful consideration of the type of adverse effect the chemical causes or can reasonably
be anticipated to cause. Under section 313(d)(2)(A) (acute human toxicity), the effect must be ``significant.''
Under section 313(d)(2)(B) the effect must either be cancer or teratogenicity, or some other ``serious or irreversible''
chronic health effect. Under section 313(d)(2)(C) (environmental toxicity) the effect must be ``significant''
and ``of sufficient seriousness in the judgment of the Administrator'' to warrant reporting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statute does not specify how serious or significant an effect must be in order for a chemical to be listed under any
of the criteria. This determination is left to the EPA's discretion and scientific judgment. The Agency recognizes
that not every adverse effect is sufficiently significant or serious to satisfy the criteria. For chemicals with
effects that satisfy the criteria, Congress made it clear in section 313 that communities have a right to know about
releases of such chemicals. The Agency's goal in implementing section 313 is to ensure that the communities are provided
with that release information to allow them to further educate themselves and, if appropriate, take or recommend
action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A brief description of the selection process follows, however, a detailed description of EPA's methodology and rationale
for the proposed addition of these chemicals and chemical categories can be found in the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1. Development of the chemical addition list
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. As a starting point for screening candidates for addition to the toxic chemical list under EPCRA section 313, EPA
chose to examine the lists of chemicals regulated or identified, as of concern, under various environmental statutes
including: Section 112(b) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) as amended in 1990 (Hazardous Air Pollutants); (2) section 602(b)
of the CAA (Class II ozone depleting substances); (3) section 307(a) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) (Priority Pollutant
List); (4) Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Active Ingredients, including Special
Review, Canceled/Denied or Suspended, and Restricted Use Pesticides; (5) section 302 of EPCRA (Extremely Hazardous
Substances); (6) section 102 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA);
(7) section 3001 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and chemicals listed at 40 CFR 261.33(e) and
Appendix VIII; (8) section 1412 of the Safe Drinking Water Act as amended; (9) certain chemicals subject to the Toxics
Substance Control Act (Existing Chemicals); and (10) the State of California Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement
Act of 1986 (Proposition 65) (List of Chemicals Known to the State to Cause Reproductive Toxicity); and/or those chemicals
designated as possible, probable, or known carcinogens in the Monographs of the International Agency for Research
on Cancer (IARC) and the 6th Annual Report on Carcinogens of the National Toxicology Program (NTP), U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services (DHHS).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Screening of chemicals
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. To prioritize chemicals for possible addition to EPCRA section 313, EPA applied a human health and ecotoxicity screen
and a production volume screen, which are described below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Toxicity screen
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. A toxicity screen is a limited review of readily available toxicity data that is used for a preliminary categorization
of a chemical during the process of selecting candidates for possible listing under EPCRA section 313. The toxicity
screen is used to identify chemicals for further consideration and does not reflect a final determination for listing
a chemical under EPCRA section 313. Such a determination can only be made after a hazard assessment is conducted (See
Unit II.3. of this preamble). The chemicals identified above were screened for four general effect categories: Acute
human health effects, cancer, other chronic human health effects, and ecological effects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The screening criteria associated with each of the effect areas used in the toxicity screen are discussed in detail
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Revised Draft Hazard Assessment Guidelines for Listing Chemicals on the Toxic Release Inventory (Draft Hazard Assessment
Guidelines)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, (Ref. 11). Based on the results of this screen, the chemicals were preliminarily placed in one of three screening
categories defined in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Draft Hazard Assessment Guidelines
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: ``high priority;'' ``medium priority;'' or ``low priority.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chemicals that were categorized as ``low priority'' during the screening process were not considered further as
candidates for addition to the EPCRA section 313 list in this rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Production volume screen
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. EPCRA section 313(f) establishes reporting thresholds of either 25,000 or 10,000 pounds per facility per year related
to the amount of a chemical that is manufactured, processed, or otherwise used. EPA anticipates that the addition
of chemicals manufactured, imported, processed, or used in quantities less than the EPCRA section 313 activity thresholds
would not result in the submission of Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) reports. Thus, EPA elected to focus its attention
on chemicals likely to yield reports and also screened potential candidates for the likelihood of meeting the EPCRA
section 313 volume thresholds. Chemicals for which there were no data to indicate that the chemical is likely to meet
or exceed the EPCRA section 313 volume thresholds were not considered further as possible candidates for addition
to the section 313 list at this time.

. After completing the screening phase, EPA conducted a thorough hazard assessment for each of the addition candidates
that resulted from the above analyses and determined based on the weight-of-the evidence if there was sufficient
evidence to establish that the candidate chemical met the statutory criteria for addition to EPCRA section 313. To
make this determination, EPA senior scientists reviewed readily available toxicity information on each chemical
for each of the following effect areas: acute human health effects; cancer; other chronic human effects; and environmental
effects. In addition, EPA reviewed, where appropriate, information on the environmental fate of the chemical. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The hazard assessment was conducted in accordance with relevant EPA guidelines for each adverse human health or environmental
effect (e.g., the appropriate guidelines for hazard evaluation of chemical carcinogens and for the type of evidence
required to substantiate a determination of carcinogenicity are the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Assessment Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Ref. 4)). During this assessment the number, severity, and significance of the effects induced by the chemical,
the dose level causing the effect, and the quality and quantity of the available data, including the nature of the data
(e.g., human epidemiological, laboratory animal, field or workplace studies) and confidence level in the existing
data base, were all considered. Where a careful review of the scientific data for a particular chemical results in
a high level of confidence that the chemical causes an adverse effect at relatively low dose levels, EPA believes that
this evidence is sufficient for listing the chemical under section 313. EPA also believes that where a review of the
scientific data indicates that the chemical will cause various adverse effects at moderate dose levels, the total
weight-of-the-evidence indicates that there is sufficient evidence for listing the chemical under EPCRA section
313. EPA believes that both types of chemicals described above exhibit moderately high to high toxicity based on a
hazard assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also conducted an analysis of exposure for each chemical or chemical category proposed for listing under EPCRA
section 313(d)(2)(A) (i.e., based on adverse acute human health effects), and, where appropriate, under section
313(d)(2)(C) (i.e., based on adverse ecological effects). For chemicals listed under EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(A),
this analysis included estimated concentrations of the chemical at or beyond the facility site boundary through
the use of estimated releases and modelling techniques. EPA did not conduct an analysis of exposure for the chemicals
proposed for listing under section 313(d)(2)(B) because these chemicals exhibit moderately high to high toxicity
based on a hazard assessment (see Unit IV.B. for a discussion of the use of exposure). As discussed more thoroughly
in Unit IV.B. of this preamble, EPA does not believe that it is appropriate to factor exposure into the listing decisions
for the chemicals being listed pursuant to section 313(d)(2)(B) in this rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following a review and analysis of the information available about each chemical in this final rule (including information
provided through public comment) by senior Agency scientists, the Agency concludes that for each of the chemicals
listed one or more of the EPCRA section 313 listing criteria are met. Moreover, the adverse effects associated with
each of the chemicals being listed today are serious and significant. In some cases the effects are extreme, such as
cancer or death. In others, the effects are serious and lasting, including, for example, impairment of a fetus' or
an offspring's physical development, neurological effects inhibiting motor abilities or mental processes or impairing
the ability to reproduce, or the sustainability of a fragile ecosystem such as an estuary. For a number of chemicals
in the final rule, there is more than one adverse effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is important to understand that although an adverse effect is known or can be reasonably anticipated to be caused
by a chemical on the section 313 list, a release of a chemical into a community does not necessarily mean that the effect
will occur. Exposure and dose are also important factors in determining whether an adverse effect occurs and how serious
the manifestation will be. The listing of a chemical on the section 313 list does not mean that a particular community
will experience these adverse effects. Instead the purpose for listing a chemical is to ensure that the public gets
information about releases of such chemicals. Thus, EPA believes that for chemicals that typically do not affect
solely one or two species but rather affect changes across a whole ecosystem and for which there is well-documented
evidence supporting the adverse effects, that their addition to the EPCRA section 313 list is warranted even though
the severity of the adverse effects that they induce will be dependent upon site-specific characteristics. Once
EPA makes release data available through TRI, the community may then make its own determination on the importance
of these releases (and their potential adverse effects). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The expansion of the EPCRA section 313 toxic chemical list is the first phase of the expansion of the TRI program. EPA
plans to issue a proposed rule in early 1995 expanding the scope of industry sectors that would be subject to EPCRA section
313. EPA's initial analysis for this effort is focused on industrial sectors which have activities related to manufacturing
that result in significant releases of chemicals listed on EPCRA section 313. EPA is also considering further expanding
right-to-know by investigating the feasibility of adding data on exposure to and use of chemicals at TRI facilities.
The Agency believes that the collection of this type of data would provide a greater understanding of risk reduction
and pollution prevention opportunities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In conjunction with these expansion activities, the Agency is also considering situations where data of lesser value
can be removed from the TRI system. Elsewhere in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA is promulgating a rule establishing an alternate threshold for facilities with low annual reportable amounts
of listed toxic chemicals. This alternate threshold will provide considerable relief for facilities which generate
``small'' amounts of EPCRA section 313 chemicals in reportable amounts. This relief will offset the increased burden
that this expansion rule may impose. The alternate threshold for manufacture, or process, or otherwise use for each
of the chemicals meeting the facility category will be an amount greater than one million pounds per year. If a facility
meets the alternate threshold criteria, that facility will not be required to file a complete TRI report (Form R),
but will be required to submit an annual certification statement for each chemical meeting these conditions for the
reporting year for which these conditions were met and maintain records supporting calculations made to determine
these conditions. EPA estimates that this alternate threshold provides the option to convert approximately 20,100
Form R reports to certification statements.

III. Summary of Final Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this action, EPA is adding 286 chemicals and chemical categories, which includes 39 chemicals as part of two delineated
categories, to the EPCRA section 313 list. EPA finds that each of these chemicals and chemical categories meets one
or more of the EPCRA section 313(d)(2) criteria. Additionally, EPA believes that each of these chemicals can reasonably
be anticipated to be manufactured or imported in quantities of at least 10,000 pounds (the EPCRA section 313 otherwise
use reporting threshold) by at least one facility. Therefore, the Agency believes that the listing of these chemicals
can reasonably be anticipated to generate EPCRA section 313 reports and that adding these chemicals to the toxic chemical
list is appropriate. The proposed rule and record supporting the rulemaking contain information on EPA's review
of these chemicals, including the toxicity evaluation. This background information will not be repeated here in
the final rule. However, to the extent that comments were received on these issues, those comments are addressed in
this document. In addition to general comment and comment addressing a broad number of chemicals, EPA received specific
technical comments on 110 of the chemicals and chemical categories. Detailed responses to comments are contained
in

Table 1 lists the chemicals that EPA has determined meet the statutory criteria of EPCRA section 313(d)(2) and are
therefore being added to the toxic chemical list. Each of the chemicals and chemical categories listed below were
found to meet the statutory criteria described in EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(A)-(C). This means that the Agency has
made a finding that the chemical is known to cause an effect, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
or
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is reasonably anticipated to do so. It does not necessarily mean that the chemical is known to cause a given effect.
The specific criterion or criteria that the chemical meets are also listed in Table 1 below.

EPA is deferring final action on 40 chemicals and one chemical category until a later date. These chemicals and the
comments received on them raised particularly difficult technical or policy issues which will require additional
time to address. The Agency does not believe that it would be in the spirit of community right-to-know to delay final
action on the remaining 286 chemicals and chemical categories, pending completion of work on the more limited group.
In a future rulemaking, EPA will make a final determination as to whether these chemicals should be added to EPCRA section
313. The public comment that has been received specific to these deferred chemicals will be addressed as part of the
future rulemaking discussed above. These chemicals follow:

Based on an evaluation of the public comments received and a reanalysis of the available data cited in the proposed
rule, EPA has determined that three chemicals, clomazone, 5-chloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)phenol, and tetrasodium
ethylenediaminetetraacetate, that were proposed for listing do not have sufficient evidence of toxicity at this
time to meet the statutory criteria of EPCRA section313(d)(2) and thus are not listed in this final rule. Summaries
of responses to chemical-specific comments for these chemicals appear in unit IV.G. of this preamble.

IV. Summary of Public Comment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The public comment period for the proposed rule closed April 12, 1994. On March 9, 1994, EPA held a public meeting on
the proposed addition of chemicals and chemical categories. Two hundred and sixty-six comments were received, including
136 from industry, 60 from trade associations, 32 from environmental groups, 15 from private citizens, 3 from Federal
agencies, 7 from State agencies and 13 from other public interest groups, labor groups, universities, and associations.
In addition to general comment and comment addressing a broad number of chemicals, EPA received specific technical
comm
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ents on 110 of the chemicals and chemical categories. Detailed responses to all comments, except those comments specific
to chemicals for which final action is being deferred, are contained in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response to Comment Document
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Ref. 14). In addition to a number of comments supporting the concept of chemical expansion, EPA received comments
in the following major areas: EPA's screening process used to identify potential candidates and the Agency's use
of the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Draft Hazard Assessment Guidelines
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Ref. 11); the use of exposure in determining if a chemical meets the statutory criteria of EPCRA section 313; listing
of categories; the addition of chemicals that are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA); the addition
of chemicals that are regulated under FIFRA; duplicative reporting; general technical comments; and chemical-specific
comments.

Screening based on toxicity
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Monsanto, Zeneca Incorporated, and the National Oilseed Processors Association contend that the use of minimum
effective doses (MEDs) to screen chemicals as potential candidates for addition to the EPCRA section 313 list was
unrealistic and overly broad as a screening tool. One of these commenters also contended that EPA based its proposed
addition on toxicity screening only. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that the commenter may have misunderstood the use of the MED screening criteria. The MED screen is not
intended, and is not used by EPA, as a surrogate for the actual statutory listing criteria. The MED was used as a screening
tool during the preliminary review of several thousand candidate chemicals, because MED values were available and
they are based on experimental values. MEDs are not equivalent to lowest-observed-adverse-effect levels (LOAELs).
MEDs are generally derived from LOAELs from chronic toxicity studies using a log transformation and as such a MED is
a single value based upon the best available study. Satisfying the MED screening criteria, however, does not mean
that a chemical will necessarily be added to the list. In every case, the Agency determines that at least one of the section
313(d)(2) criteria is met before a chemical is listed. For example, isoprene, 1,3-dichloropropane, and dichlorodimethylmethane
passed the toxicity screen, but upon a more detailed review, were determined not to meet the criteria of EPCRA section
313(d)(2) and thus were not proposed for addition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that MEDs are useful as a screening tool and that the methodology has been adequately reviewed both internal
and external to the Agency. The MED system was first presented in a peer reviewed article by DeRosa, et. al (Ref. 2).
The MED methodology has been used by EPA in programs other than EPCRA section 313. For example, the MED methodology
is integral to the reportable quantity (RQ) scoring system as utilized by EPA in CERCLA section 102. The RQ scoring
system scheme is described in several

 documents (April 4, 1985, 50 FR 13456; September 29, 1986, 51 FR 34535; and March 16, 1987, 52 FR 8140). Further, the
Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA) required EPA and the Agency for Toxic Substances and
Disease Registry (ATSDR) to develop a list of 275 hazardous substances most commonly found at facilities on the National
Priorities List (NPL) and considered to present the most significant threat to human health at those sites or at other
facilities where releases may occur. During development of criteria to select the first list of 100, the RQ methodology
(as discussed in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, Ref. 11) was selected as one of the evaluation tools used to develop the initial list, and the annual updates. When
the initial list was published (April 17, 1987, 52 FR 12866) a summary of the methodology used to develop the list was
provided. Monsanto believes that the use of an MED of 500 mg/kg/day as the upper limit of the ``may be sufficient'' category
of the screening criteria required an unrealistically high dose to have been used for toxicity testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA agrees that the upper bound for the medium priority category may warrant reconsideration. EPA will address this
issue and other comments received on the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Draft Hazard Assessment Guidelines
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Ref. 11), when the Agency finalizes that document. However, none of the chemicals proposed for listing in the proposed
rule had MEDs that approached this upper bound. Of the chemicals proposed for addition pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B),
greater than 93 percent had MED values that were in the range for the high priority category; the remaining chemicals
(less than 7 percent) had MEDs in the lowest fifth of the medium priority category range, i.e., MEDs only slightly greater
than the high priority category range. EPA reiterates that the MED screen is not intended, and is not used by EPA, as
a surrogate for the actual statutory listing criteria. Additions to EPCRA section 313 are based on a hazard assessment,
and, where appropriate, an analysis of exposure, to determine whether the chemical meets one or more of the EPCRA section
313(d)(2) listing criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Natural Resources Defense Council supports the health and environmental effects screening criteria used by
EPA as a reasonable basis to screen chemicals as candidates for possible addition to EPCRA section 313. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency agrees with this commenter in its support of the use of the screening criteria and believes that the screening
criteria provide a reasonable basis to make a preliminary evaluation of chemicals for possible addition to the EPCRA
section 313 list. EPA also agrees with the commenter's statement that the specific screening values are consistent
with established risk assessment procedures applied in other EPA programs.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Screening based on production volume
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Eastman Chemical Company states that, in addition to the use of a production volume screen, the Agency should consider
the number of TRI Form Rs that would likely be submitted subsequent to listing. If the number is considered to be minimal
(perhaps 5, 10, 15 or more reports), then EPA should balance the public's right-to-know with the economic burden placed
on an industry. EPA adopted a production volume screen for the development of the proposed rule to screen out those
chemicals for which no reports are expected to be submitted. The Agency believes that it has the discretion to not include
such chemicals at this time. If chemicals that did not meet the production volume screen were listed, there would be
an economic burden for firms that would have to determine that they did not exceed the reporting threshold, without
providing any information to the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the Agency has determined to not list chemicals for which no reports would be submitted, EPA believes that it
is appropriate to add chemicals to EPCRA section 313 for which even a small number of reports are likely to be submitted
nationally. In such cases, the reporting facilities will still provide important information to the surrounding
communities. Even though a particular chemical may only be manufactured, processed, or otherwise used at a relatively
small number of facilities, the data provided in the TRI Form R reports by these facilities could represent significant
information in the communities in which the facilities are located. The Agency believes that it would be inconsistent
with the public's right-to-know not to list chemicals even if only a low number of reports is expected.

B. Use of Exposure Assessments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One of the most significant issues raised by commenters relates to the Agency's consideration of hazard, exposure,
and risk in interpreting the section 313(d)(2) criteria. Specifically, a number of commenters believe that EPA's
interpretation of the EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) criterion, chronic human health effects, and the section 313(d)(2)(C)
criterion, ecological effects, has been overly restrictive. The commenters contend that EPA should conduct risk
assessments and make a formal determination that a chemical poses a risk (i.e., a combination of exposure and hazard)
before adding it to the EPCRA section 313 list. The commenters argue that the following factors support their contention:
(1) The statutory criteria include an implicit exposure and thus risk component; (2) the legislative history illustrates
Congress' intent that exposure considerations were to be an integral part of determining whether a chemical should
be listed on the EPCRA section 313 list; and (3) EPA should consider exposure in conjunction with section 313(d)(2)(B),
chronic human health effects, and for all listings pursuant to section 313(d)(2)(C), ecological effects, because
there is precedent for the use of exposure in previous listing and delisting actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of the many comments received on this issue, EPA has reviewed its positions in this area, and agrees with many
of the commenters that there are limited circumstances under which it is appropriate for EPA to consider exposure
factors for listing decisions under section 313(d)(2). The Agency believes that exposure considerations are appropriate
in making determinations (1) under section 313(d)(2)(A), (2) under section 313(d)(2)(B) for chemicals that exhibit
low to moderately low toxicity based on a hazard assessment (i.e., those chemicals for which the value of listing on
the EPCRA section 313 list on hazard alone is marginal), and (3) under section 313(d)(2)(C) for chemicals that are
low or moderately ecotoxic but do not induce well-documented serious adverse effects as described below. The Agency
believes that exposure considerations are not appropriate in making determinations (1) under section 313(d)(2)(B)
for chemicals that exhibit moderately high to high human toxicity (These terms, which do not directly correlate to
the numerical screening values reflected in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Draft Hazard Assessment Guidelines
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, are defined in unit II.) based on a hazard assessment, and (2) under section 313(d)(2)(C) for chemicals that are highly
ecotoxic or induce well-established adverse environmental effects. For chemicals which induce well-established
serious adverse effects, e.g., chlorofluorocarbons, which cause stratospheric ozone depletion, EPA believes
that an exposure assessment is unnecessary. EPA believes that these chemicals typically do not affect solely one
or two species but rather cause changes across a whole ecosystem. EPA believes that these effects are sufficiently
serious because of the scope of their impact and the well-documented evidence supporting the adverse effects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA, however, disagrees with those commenters who suggest that EPA must include a risk assessment component to EPCRA
section 313 determinations. Specifically, EPA does not agree with the commenters about the extent to which exposure
must be considered in making determinations under sections 313(d)(2)(B) and (C). This is primarily because EPA does
not agree with the commenters' understanding of EPCRA section 313. Risk assessment may be pertinent and appropriate
for use under statutes that control the manufacture, use, and/or disposal of a chemical, such as the Clean Air Act or
the Toxic Substances Control Act. However, EPCRA section 313 is an information collection provision that is fundamentally
different from other environmental statutes that control or restrict chemical activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPCRA section 313 charges EPA with collecting and disseminating information on releases, among other waste management
data, so that communities can estimate local exposure and local risks; risks which can be significantly different
than those which would be assessed using generic exposure considerations. The intent of EPCRA section 313 is to move
the determination of what risks are acceptable from EPA to the communities in which the releases occur. This basic
local empowerment is a cornerstone of the right-to-know program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPCRA section 313 establishes an information collection and dissemination program, the burden it imposes is significantly
less than the burden imposed by a statute which controls the manufacture, use, and/or disposal of a chemical. EPCRA
section 313 requires that a facility use the best available information to prepare each chemical-specific TRI report.
However, the statute does not require that the facility conduct monitoring or emissions measurements to determine
these quantities. A facility must only estimate, to the best of its ability, the quantitative information it reports.
This is in contrast to other environmental statutes that may require a facility to monitor releases, change its manufacturing
process, install specific waste treatment technology, or dispose of wastes in a certain manner. As such, the Agency
believes that the standard that must be met to require information submission under EPCRA section 313 is less than
that to regulate a chemical under a statute such as the Clean Air Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that its position regarding the use of hazard, exposure, and risk in listing decisions is consistent
with the purpose and legislative history of EPCRA section 313, as illustrated in the following passage from the Conference
report: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administrator, in determining to list a chemical under any of the above criteria, may, but is not required to conduct
new studies or risk assessments or perform site-specific analyses to establish actual ambient concentrations or
to document adverse effects at any particular location. (H. Rep. 99-962, 99th Cong., 2nd Sess., p. 295 (Oct. 3, 1986)
). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This passage indicates Congress did not intend to require EPA to conduct new studies, such as exposure studies, or
perform risk assessments, and therefore did not consider these activities to be mandatory components of all section
313 decisions. EPA believes that this statement combined with the plain language of the statutory criteria clearly
indicate that Congress intended that the decision of whether and how to consider exposure under EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B)
and (C) should be left to the Agency's discretion. EPA has carefully considered when and how to use exposure to fully
implement the right-to-know provisions of EPCRA. The Agency believes that in this final rule, EPA has appropriately
used the discretion provided to it to assure the addition of chemicals that meet the right-to-know objectives of EPCRA
section 313 while not unduly burdening the regulated community. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPCRA section 313 specifically requires that exposure be considered for listing a chemical pursuant to section 313(d)(2)(A).
The statute mandates that EPA consider whether ``a chemical is known to cause or can reasonably be anticipated to cause
significant adverse acute human health effects at concentration levels that are reasonably likely to exist beyond
facility site boundaries.'' EPA has, and will continue to look at exposures reasonably likely to exist beyond facility
site boundaries when making a listing determination pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(A). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statute is silent on the issue of exposure considerations for the section 313(d)(2)(B) and (C) criteria. The language
of section 313 does not prohibit EPA from considering exposure factors when making a finding under either section
313(d)(2)(B) or section 313(d)(2)(C). However, the language of sections 313(d)(2)(B) and (C) does not require the
type of exposure assessment and/or risk assessment argued by the commenters. EPA believes that it has the discretion
under both section 313(d)(2)(B) and section 313(d)(2)(C) to consider, where appropriate, those exposure factors
that may call into question the validity of listing of any specific chemical on TRI. In exercising this discretion,
EPA considers it appropriate to employ exposure considerations to a limited extent in making determinations under
EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) because this criterion requires the Agency to find a ``significant adverse effect on
the environment of sufficient seriousness, in the judgment of the Administrator to warrant reporting'' under EPCRA
section 313. This language recognizes the possibility that under certain circumstances, a chemical that could theoretically
cause an adverse effect on the environment is unlikely to cause one of a magnitude sufficient to warrant listing. Moreover,
because of the limitation on the number of chemicals listed pursuant to only section 313(d)(2)(C) that may be listed,
EPA believes that it is appropriate to use both hazard and exposure factors as prioritizing considerations in these
listing decisions. Therefore, to meet its obligation under section 313(d)(2)(C), in cases where a chemical is low
or moderately ecotoxic, EPA may look at certain exposure factors (including pollution controls, the volume and pattern
of production, use, and release, environmental fate, as well as other chemical specific factors, and the use of estimated
releases and modeling techniques) to determine if listing is reasonable, i.e., could the chemical ever be present
at high enough concentrations to cause a significant adverse effect upon the environment to warrant listing under
section 313(d)(2)(C). Of the chemicals being added in today's action pursuant to section 313(d)(2)(C), all but one
are highly ecotoxic. These highly ecotoxic chemicals are being added to the EPCRA section 313 list pursuant to section
313(d)(2)(C) based on their hazard. The other chemical, which is moderately ecotoxic, is being added to the EPCRA
section 313 list pursuant to section 313(d)(2)(C) based on both its hazard and an exposure assessment for this chemical.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For listing determinations made pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B), in instances where the hazard assessment
indicates that the value of listing on EPCRA section 313 on hazard alone is marginal (i.e., a chemical is of low toxicity
and unrealistic exposures would be necessary for it to pose a risk to communities), EPA may use exposure considerations
in its listing decisions. Only chemicals for which the hazard assessments indicate moderately high to high toxicity
are being added in today's action to the EPCRA section 313 list pursuant to section 313(d)(2)(B). None of these chemicals
are chemicals for which the consideration of exposure factors would be appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Through this rulemaking, EPA is clarifying its position regarding the use of hazard, exposure, and risk in listing
decisions under EPCRA section 313. EPA will consider exposure factors when making determinations under section
313(d)(2)(A) (acute human toxicity). In addition, EPA has discretion to consider exposure factors where appropriate
for determinations under sections 313(d)(2)(B) (chronic human toxicity) and (C) (environmental toxicity), and
that there is a broader range of circumstances in which exposure will be considered under section 313(d)(2)(C) than
under (B). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has reviewed its past listing decisions in light of this clarification, and believes that its prior listing determinations
have been consistent in the consideration of exposure in 31 of the 32 listing/delisting determinations previous
to this action, including a number of deletions of low toxicity chemicals that Congress placed on the initial EPCRA
section 313 list. EPA is currently reviewing the one exception, inorganic fluorides, to determine if additional
action is warranted. EPA will continue to evaluate petitions according to this clarification and will delete chemicals
that do not meet the statutory criteria.

C. Addition of Categories 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Six industry trade organizations, 7 companies, and the Department of Energy contend that section 313 does not provide
EPA the statutory authority to list chemical categories. Some of the commenters contend that the intent of Congress
was for EPA to review individual chemicals. Therefore, the commenters believe that EPA should list all chemicals
individually. General Electric, American Iron and Steel Institute, and Eastman Chemical Company further contend
that, based on legal precedent (citing AFL-CIO vs. OSHA, 965 F.2d 9262 (11th Cir. 1992)), EPA does not have the authority
to list chemical categories or specific groups of chemicals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that the statutory authority to add ``a chemical'' to the list may be reasonably interpreted to include
the authority to list groups or categories of chemicals. Indeed, this interpretation is supported by the initial
list of chemicals and chemical categories adopted by Congress in section 313(c). In that initial list, Congress included
20 chemical categories, mainly metal compounds, but also categories of organic chemicals such as chlorophenols.
Nothing in section 313 or its legislative history indicates or even suggests that Congress intended to preclude EPA
from adding chemical categories to the list where the appropriate findings can be made. Where, as with the categories
being added in this final rule, EPA determines that the primary purpose of TRI--providing information to the community
about the release of chemicals--is most appropriately served by listing a category of chemicals, EPA has the discretion
to list a category rather than individual chemicals. Of course, in adding a category to the list, EPA must comply with
the statutory criteria. The Agency believes it satisfies the statutory criteria to add a category to the list by identifying
the toxic effect of concern for at least one member of the category and then showing why that effect may reasonably be
expected to be caused by all other members of the category. A specific justification for each of the categories included
in the final rule has been provided in the preamble of the January 12, 1994 proposed rule, in the docket supporting this
rulemaking, and in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response to Comment Document
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Ref. 14). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters raised policy concerns and suggested that there would be regulatory difficulties associated
with adding chemical categories. These are addressed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that the regulated community would face uncertainty in deciding which chemicals belong
in the category. In this final rule, EPA has described the categories in sufficient detail to alleviate uncertainty
regarding their membership. Of course, the Agency will work with the public and the regulated community to develop,
as appropriate, any interpretations and guidance the Agency determines are necessary to facilitate accurate reporting
for these categories. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter questions how to properly report a chemical which could be considered part of a category and which is
also specifically, individually listed. Threshold determinations should be made for the individually-listed
chemical rather than for the category. The current EPCRA section 313 list contains some individually-listed chemicals
that also meet the definition of an EPCRA section 313 listed category. For example, pentachlorophenol is listed individually
on EPCRA section 313 but also meets the definition of the chlorophenol category. In these situations, threshold determinations
should be made for the chemical as an individual entity rather than as a member of the category. A facility would not
count the quantities manufactured, processed, or otherwise used toward threshold determinations for both the individual
listing and the category listing, but rather only toward the individual chemical threshold. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter contends that categories will lead to inadvertent non-compliance with reporting requirements. EPA
does not believe that this is a significant concern. Because the categories being added to the EPCRA section 313 list
today each consist of chemicals that are similar chemically and in effect, EPA believes that these categories will
not be difficult for the public or industry to understand or for the Agency to administer. In addition, there are already
categories on the current list, and EPA has not experienced a significant problem of the sort suggested by the commenter.
The Congressional objective of providing information is outweighed by any possible problems that some facilities
might have with inadvertent noncompliance. One commenter states that the use of categories will artificially lower
the thresholds for reporting chemicals within the category. The Agency believes that calculating the thresholds
based on the category (i.e., a sum of the activities for each individual category member) is appropriate and not ``artificially
lower.'' As described above, categories are placed on the EPCRA section 313 list where each of the members can be expected
to cause similar effects because all members of the category have a similar functional group or exhibit a similar characteristic.
For each of the categories added in today's rule, EPA believes that because each member of the category has this similar
functional group or exhibits a similar characteristic, each member of the category can be reasonably anticipated
to cause similar adverse effects. The members of the category are not randomly selected, but are closely related and
warrant being reported as a category. These chemicals in aggregate can reasonably be anticipated to cause an aggregate
impact of the adverse effect associated with each member of the category. Thus, it is appropriate to apply the reporting
thresholds to the category regardless of whether the threshold amount is attributable to one member of the category
or to individual members in aggregate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter believes that listing broad categories where the individual members have diverse properties and cause
diverse effects does not constitute ``good science.'' The Agency agrees that a category must be rationally constructed
both in terms of similarity in the properties of the individual members and in terms of their effects. There is, of course,
no requirement that the properties across category members be absolutely identical. EPA agrees that the members
of a category be reasonably expected to elicit the same type of effect or related effects in order for a category to satisfy
the statutory listing criteria. Furthermore, EPA agrees that determinations to list a category, as with listing
an individual chemical are to be based on ``good science.'' EPA has applied these principles to the categories being
added in the final rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are several policy issues which were consistently raised in comments on specific chemicals and general comment
on the entire proposed rule. For purposes of this final rule, EPA addresses these issues in this unit of the preamble
and not in unit IV.F. of the preamble in the responses to chemical-specific comments. Detailed responses to comments
on specific individual chemicals are available in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The addition of chemicals that may be released in small quantities
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Many commenters object to the addition of many of the chemicals to the EPCRA section 313 list because they do not believe
that there will be significant releases of these chemicals. Therefore, they contend there will not be significant
exposure to these chemicals and the associated risks will be low. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that the chemicals added today meet the EPCRA section 313(d)(2) criteria and should be included on the
EPCRA section 313 list. The quantity of a chemical released is not part of the statutory criteria. The purpose of EPCRA
section 313 is to collect data on the quantity released so that local communities can make their own determinations
about exposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress intended EPCRA section 313 to address the lack of information on toxic chemicals in communities by providing
information on releases of toxic chemicals. The public can then use this release information with site-specific
information and the appropriate attributes of a chemical to evaluate exposure. EPA considers it inappropriate under
the right-to-know program to supplant the public's power to make risk determinations on a community level by the Agency's
use of specified levels of potential releases, exposure, or risk as screening criteria to exclude chemicals from
the EPCRA section 313 list. By listing chemicals that present a hazard and providing TRI data on these chemicals to
the public, EPA allows the public to make the determination as to whether there is a risk in their community. Furthermore,
any exposure assessment conducted by EPA would be conducted from a national perspective and may not truly represent
the risks to a specific community. (For a more detailed discussion on the Agency's use of exposure see Unit IV.B. of
this preamble).

. Eli Lily and Company, National Agricultural Chemical Association, Pharmeceutical Manufacturers Association,

commenters argue that the FDA approves a drug only after extensive testing and a determination that the benefits to
the patients outweigh the risks. The commenters further state that access to these drugs is controlled because they

EPA agrees that the drug testing and approval process conducted by the FDA is extensive and necessary to protect the
public health and well-being. However, as discussed above, the purpose of listing these chemicals under EPCRA section
313 is to provide information on the release, transfer, and waste management activities occurring in the community.
This is a different function that addresses different issues than those addressed by FDA. Furthermore, while the
main use of these chemicals is pharmaceutical in nature, that does not mean that they are not a hazard in other contexts.
EPA agrees that in controlled situations (e.g., a doctor's prescription) ingestion of a drug is likely to have certain
intended benefits. However, outside of this controlled situation, any adverse effects are not balanced by the benefits
received from the use of the drug. Further, EPCRA section 313 will collect information on the release and disposal
of these chemicals, which is not covered by the regulation of the use of a chemical as a drug.

Chemicals regulated under FIFRA
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Several commenters do not support the addition of chemicals regulated under FIFRA to the EPCRA section 313 list of
toxic chemicals because, they contend, the major route of exposure, agricultural field use, has been addressed through
FIFRA regulation which establishes safety factors and use directions allowing for safe use. They further contend
that the use of these chemicals has been determined not to present an unreasonable risk and therefore, listing pesticides
under EPCRA section 313 is unnecessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FIFRA regulations require that the Agency determine that pesticidal uses of a chemical do not cause ``unreasonable
adverse effects on the environment'' which is defined in FIFRA section 2(bb) as ``any unreasonable risk to man or the
environment taking into account the economic, social, and environmental costs and benefits of the use of pesticides''
(7 U.S.C. section 136(bb)). FIFRA is a regulatory statute, and the impacts of regulation can be immediate and direct
(e.g., banning of a chemical), and as such EPA examines not only the hazards presented by the chemical, but also the
specific exposure scenarios, and weighs the risks against the benefits of the chemical. The ``unreasonable adverse
effects'' determination under FIFRA is specific to the intentional use of the chemical as a pesticide and does not
address other uses or releases of the chemical that may result from manufacture, processing, or other use. Furthermore,
a determination under FIFRA that the use of a chemical will not result in an ``unreasonable adverse effect'' is not
a determination that the chemical is not hazardous or that the use of the chemical is without risk. Finally, EPCRA section
313 was not enacted to serve the same purpose as FIFRA. Listing on EPCRA section 313 provides communities with some
of the information required to determine what risks may result from the manufacture, processing and non-pesticidal
use of a chemical, information not generally provided through FIFRA.

With respect to the contents of the toxic release form, estimates of releases into each environmental medium must

EPA believes that the chemicals being added today meet the toxicity criteria of EPCRA section 313(d)(2) and, therefore,
should be added to the EPCRA section 313 list. EPA further believes that the EPCRA section 313 requirements do not duplicate
other regulatory program requirements. EPCRA was not enacted to serve the same purpose as other regulatory programs
but to collect and disseminate information to the public. Nor is EPCRA section 313 intended to regulate how a chemical
may be used, the amount of chemical a facility manufactures, processes, otherwise uses, and releases, what media
the chemical is released to, or how the chemical is disposed. Therefore, TRI, as an information collection and dissemination
program, is not designed to directly impose controls for the protection of human health or the environment in the same
manner as other regulatory programs. The benefit of TRI is that it empowers the public, through access to release,
transfer, and waste management data on toxic chemicals, to make determinations about risks in their communities
based on TRI data, site-specific information, and the properties of the chemicals.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Maternal toxicity
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. A number of commenters argued that for certain chemicals in animal tests, the only evidence for developmental toxicity
occurred at maternally toxic doses (that is, doses that were high enough to induce toxicity in the mother), and, therefore,
developmental toxicity cannot be used as a basis for listing these chemicals under EPCRA section 313. EPA disagrees
that fetal effects only in the presence of maternal toxicity demonstrate that a given substance does not present a
developmental hazard. Although the developmental effects may have been seen in the presence of reversible maternal
effects, the developmental effects may be more permanent and cannot be treated as only secondary to reversible maternal
toxicity. With regard to adverse effects in the presence of maternal toxicity, EPA believes that developmental effects
at maternal toxicity are ``. . .toxic manifestations and as such are generally considered a reasonable basis for Agency
regulation and/or risk assessment'' (Ref 6). This approach has particular relevance in situations where reversible
maternal toxicity may occur in the presence of irreversible adverse fetal effects. The Agency does not distinguish
between fetal effects observed in the presence of maternal toxicity or those observed without concomitant maternal
toxicity. Both maternal and fetal toxicity are of concern to the Agency, and are within the criteria of EPCRA section
313(d)(2). Thus, EPA will use the effect, maternal or fetal, which is most sensitive to set LOAELs and no-observed-adverse-effect
levels (NOAELs). If both occur at the same level, the LOAELs and NOAELs for both are the same. When the LOAEL is the same
for the adult and developing organisms, it may simply indicate that both are sensitive to that dose level, rather than
that the developmental effects result only from maternal toxicity. Moreover, whether developmental effects are
secondary to maternal toxicity or not, the maternal effects may be reversible while effects on offspring may be permanent.
There are several agents known to produce adverse developmental effects at minimally toxic doses in adult humans
(e.g., tobacco smoking, alcohol, isotretinoin).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Use of IRIS and other secondary sources
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Several commenters object to EPA's use of the Agency's Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) data base, the
Agency's Office of Pesticide Programs' 1988 TOX-One-Liners data base, Registry of Toxic Effects of Chemical Substances
(RTECS) data base, and the Aquatic Information Retrieval (AQUIRE) data base. The commenters contend that in relying
on these sources the Agency ignores other pertinent data that may be in its possession. They contend that EPA should
have examined the primary sources, rather than relying on data bases which are summaries of studies. Specifically,
some commenters claim that there are many studies in EPA's possession, but not included in the 1988 TOX-One-Liner
data base, that appear not to have been considered in the review process, because they have not yet been reviewed by
EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs. The commenters contend that reliance on IRIS or the 1988 TOX-One-Liner data base
does not constitute a detailed analysis and careful examination of the available data on a chemical. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA disagrees with the commenters. EPA's use of the Agency's IRIS data base for EPCRA section 313 purposes does constitute
a hazard evaluation. That data base generally provides information against which EPA can evaluate the section 313(d)(2)
criteria. The information contained in the IRIS data base represents the Agency's weight-of-evidence hazard assessment
for chemicals contained in the data base. The information was developed after the Agency's thorough scientific review
of the available data. Therefore, by relying on information in the IRIS data base in the review of chemicals for listing
on EPCRA section 313, EPA made statutory determinations based on hazard assessments conducted by the Agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the 1988 TOX-One-Liners were used as part of the Agency's evaluation of the toxicity of a candidate chemical,
a number of other sources were also used. These include decision documents from a number of Agency and EPA internal
peer review groups, deliberations of the FIFRA Scientific Advisory Panel, and reference to data evaluation records
for studies used in support of listing. Therefore, evaluations of the toxicity of individual chemicals has been made
on the entire data base and did not rely only on the 1988 TOX-One-Liners data base. Furthermore, inclusion of all of
the detailed studies in the docket was not possible, because of the proprietary nature of some of the information.
However, in cases where relevant information was used in support of the listing decision, but was not included in the
1988 TOX One-Liners data base (which is the most recent 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
sanitized
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 version of the data base), sanitized versions of the additional sources were included in the docket. In those cases
where only the 1988 TOX-One-Liners data base or other similar sources were cited, no additional data not described
in the 1988 TOX-One-Liners, RTECS, or the AQUIRE data bases was considered to be relevant to this listing. For a few
chemicals it has become apparent based on comments received that EPA's analysis did not include studies which are
in EPA's possession but which EPA has not reviewed. The Agency is deferring the final action on these chemicals until
such studies can be reviewed.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Testing at toxic doses
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. A number of commenters stated that pesticides which are registered under FIFRA should not be listed under EPCRA section
313 because the testing conducted to obtain a pesticide registration under the FIFRA review process requires testing
at dose levels ``virtually guaranteed to produce a toxicological effect.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is not EPA's position that chemicals registered as pesticides under FIFRA should be precluded from listing simply
because these chemicals were tested at doses which are designed to produce toxic effects. The commenters are correct
that the FIFRA standard study design attempts to set the doses at levels which bracket the minimal toxic dose, and,
therefore, the high dose(s) by design produces an effect. The purpose of this study design under FIFRA is to determine
the potential for toxicity of the chemical, whether the responses are dose-related and, depending on the effects
produced, the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
degree
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of toxicity. Because virtually any chemical substance can elicit a toxicological response at some dose level, the
mere presence of the toxic response is not used in isolation in listing decisions under EPCRA section 313. Rather,
it is the relative severity of the effect, the presence of a dose/response relationship, and whether the effect is
manifested at relatively low doses which are considered in determining the hazard of the chemical, and in making listing
determinations under EPCRA section 313.

Precursor chemicals
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. CRF AG Products Company, Monsanto, FMC Corporation, Eastman Chemical Company, and the Chemical Manufacturers
Association question EPA's authority to list precursor chemicals (i.e., a chemical that reacts in vivo or in the environment
to generate another chemical that produces the toxic effect supporting the listing) on the EPCRA section 313 list.
The commenters believe that a chemical should only be added to the list based on the toxicity of the chemical itself.
Further they contend that nowhere in the legislative history is there any indication that post-release transformation
products, degradation products, or products of chemical reactions are legitimate bases for adding chemicals to
the EPCRA section 313 list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPCRA section 313(d)(2) listing criteria each state that EPA may list a chemical that it determines ``causes or
may reasonably be anticipated to cause'' the relevant adverse human health or environmental effects. EPA believes
that this language allows EPA to consider the effects caused by the degradation products of a listed chemical. Where
it may reasonably be anticipated, based on available data, that the listed chemical would readily degrade into another
chemical that would cause the adverse effect, EPA is acting reasonably and within its grant of authority in listing
the precursor to the toxic degradation product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, one could also view the effects caused by the degradation product as effects indirectly caused by the
listed chemical. EPA believes it is within its authority to consider both the direct and indirect adverse human health
and environmental effects of a chemical in making a listing determination. Based on the statutory language and legislative
history, EPA interprets EPCRA section 313(d)(2) to include toxic effects indirectly caused by a listed chemical.
The statute and the legislative history do not specifically preclude EPA from considering indirect effects in deciding
whether a chemical meets the toxicity criteria under section 313. In the absence of specific congressional intent
on the issue, it is reasonable for EPA to consider indirect effects in light of the broad statutory purpose to inform
the public about releases of toxic chemicals to the environment. Were EPA to exclude indirect effects from consideration
it would ill-serve the purpose of the statute by precluding public access to information about chemicals that, albeit,
indirectly cause a wide range of adverse health and environmental effects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is precedent for the Agency to consider the ``indirect'' toxicity of a chemical being considered for listing.
Indirect toxicity was the basis for the granting of two petitions, one to add seven chlorofluorocarbons and halons
(August 30, 1990, 55 FR 31594) and a second to add hydrochlorofluorocarbons to the EPCRA section 313 list (December
1, 1993, 58 FR 64936). EPA also used indirect toxicity in support of its denial of petitions to delete certain volatile
organic chemicals from the section 313 list, specifically, the ethylene and propylene petition (January 27, 1989,
54 FR 4072) and the cyclohexane petition (March 15, 1989, 54 FR 10668).

Use of studies conducted by routes other than oral, inhalation, or dermal
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Several commenters maintain that intraperitoneal, intravenous, or subcutaneous injection (injection into the
abdomen, a vein, or under the skin, respectively) has minimal relevance for evaluating potential human exposure
from industrial situations and should not be used to support an EPCRA section 313 listing decision. One commenter
contends that, if considered at all, intraperitoneal injection is a form of exposure that should be considered in
establishing a section 313(d)(2)(A) finding of acute effects, not a section 313(d)(2)(B) finding of chronic effects.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA disagrees with the commenters. In making section 313 listing decisions, the Agency cannot ignore the possible
significance of any existing data, including data from intraperitoneal, intravenous, or subcutaneous injection
studies. Although it is preferable to have toxicity data from the common routes of human exposure, EPA believes that
for hazard assessment under EPCRA section 313, the Agency should use all available information to identify the hazard
associated with a chemical. This comment relates to five chemicals (bromacil lithium salt, fluorouracil, pentobarbital
sodium, tetracycline hydrochloride, and sodium nitrite) that are being added to the section 313 list today. For three
of these chemicals, bromacil lithium salt, fluorouracil, and sodium nitrite, any data from intraperitoneal or other
injection routes of exposure are supplemented by data from other, non-injection exposure routes. For example, in
addition to chronic dog and rat injection studies to support the chronic hematological concerns of sodium nitrite,
there are human oral data. For bromacil lithium salt, intraperitoneal injection studies in rats are supplemented
by gavage studies in mice to support the developmental concerns for this chemical. In addition to the developmental
effects observed in the offspring of women receiving fluorouracil intravenously, developmental abnormalities
in mice, rats and hamsters receiving fluorouracil orally were used to support the developmental toxicity finding.
For both pentobarbital sodium and tetracycline hydrochloride, the studies cited in the proposed rule in support
of the developmental effects of these chemicals are either studies in which the chemical was administered via injection
or studies in which the chemical was administered via another route. However, because both of these chemicals are
commonly administered orally, and are efficacious by this route (orally), there is reason to extrapolate the effects
observed in injection studies to effects by other routes. The proposed rule and the

the proposed rule for these five chemicals, EPA has sufficient evidence to determine that bromacil lithium salt,
fluorouracil, pentobarbital sodium, tetracycline hydrochloride, and sodium nitrite have sufficient evidence
to meet the statutory listing criteria under EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B).

Use of acute studies to support a chronic finding

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Several commenters object to the use of data from acute studies to support a finding of chronic toxicity. The commenters
contend that there is no correlation between transient acute impact and chronic toxicity that is appropriate to industrial
chemicals as a whole. The commenters contend that, if a chemical exhibits transient acute but not chronic effects,
it should not be listed based on chronic toxicity, unless additional data on chronic effects are also used in the determination
to list the chemical. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA agrees with the commenter that if a chemical exhibits acute toxic effects, it should be listed based on acute effects
unless additional data on adverse effects after long-term exposure are available. This comment relates to three
of the chemicals (bromine, 2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol, and sodium nitrite) that are being added to the section
313 list today. For these chemicals, any data from acute studies are supplemented by chronic toxicity information.
In chronic toxicity studies, bromine produced upper respiratory irritation and neurological symptoms. In chronic
toxicity studies, 2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol produced various effects including lesions of the stomach
mucosa, ulceration, raised areas and excrescences, inflammation, epithelial hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis,
and congested vessels of the mucosa of the gastrointestinal (G.I.) tract. Sodium nitrite induced, in a chronic study

Use of cholinesterase inhibition as a measure of neurotoxicity
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Several commenters expressed concern that the Agency has used a chemical's effect of inhibiting plasma, red blood
cell (RBC) or brain cholinesterase activity as a basis for listing chemicals on the EPCRA section 313 list. These commenters
feel that this effect is not an adequate indicator of neurotoxicity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency believes that inhibition of plasma, RBC, or brain cholinesterase activity is an appropriate indicator
to assess the toxicity of potential neurotoxicants (Ref. 7). In order for the normal activity of the nervous system
to be altered by a toxic chemical, the chemical must enter the body, reach the tissue target site(s), and be maintained
at a sufficient concentration for a period of time in order for an adverse effect to occur. Biochemical changes precede
the more overt, physiological changes associated with neurotoxicity, and are more easily detectable. Acetylcholinesterase
(AChE) is the enzyme that inactivates or terminates the effect of the neurotransmitter (acetylcholine) on its target.
When this enzyme is inhibited, acetylcholine is built up in the body, and may result in loss of appetite, anxiety, muscle
twitching, paralysis, or other neurotoxic effects. Thus, one can assess the signs and symptoms of systemic poisoning
by many neurotoxins from their biochemical mechanism of action, such as the inhibition of AChE. Because of the severity
of these effects, EPA takes a cautious approach by using a measure of cholinesterase activity as an indicator of neurotoxicity.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments concerning cholinesterase inhibition relate to six of the chemicals that are being added to the section

in the proposed rule for these six chemicals, EPA has sufficient evidence to determine that acephate, cycloate, diazinon,
ethyl dipropylthiocarbamate, pirimphos methyl, and profenofos meet the statutory listing criteria under EPCRA
section 313(d)(2)(B) based on available neurotoxicity data for these chemicals. 8.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Use of certain studies for hazard assessment
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Several commenters argue that EPA should not use studies in support of listing a chemical on the EPCRA section 313
list, if these studies have been determined to be insufficient for use in risk assessments under FIFRA or TSCA. For
example, the commenters point to studies EPA considered in this rulemaking in conducting hazard assessments even
though the studies when submitted for use under FIFRA or TSCA were determined by EPA to be of ``low confidence.'' EPA
believes its use of these studies for section 313 purposes is appropriate. The ``low confidence'' determination
under FIFRA or TSCA applies to the use of the studies for purposes of risk assessment associated with regulations that
impose controls. The data base for a chemical may be rated low confidence because of shortcomings such as lack of experimental
detail. Although these studies may be of limited value for purposes of risk assessment in support of regulatory controls,
when considered together, they present a sufficient weight-of-evidence as to the hazard associated with the chemical.
As additions to EPCRA section 313 made pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) are not based on the kind of risk assessment
needed for regulatory controls, EPA believes that such studies can be used to support listing.

Abamectin
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. One commenter, Merck, states that primates are less sensitive to the acute effects of abamectin and its analog, ivermectin,
than rodents. The commenter implies that because humans are primates, abamectin should be less toxic in humans than
in rodents. The commenter further contends that ivermectin and abamectin have been used safely in animals and humans.
Abamectin interferes with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transmission and, as such, produces neurotoxic clinical
signs such as tremors, ataxia, convulsions, or coma that are more severe in rodents and dogs than primates. EPA agrees
that the available studies indicate that the sensitivity as well as doses required to produce neurotoxic effects
vary from rodents to primates by a 20-fold factor. However, abamectin was proposed for addition to the EPCRA section
313 list based on developmental effects rather than neurotoxicity. There are no developmental studies with abamectin
in primates. Therefore, EPA believes that the rodent studies cited in the proposed rule provide sufficient evidence
that abamectin can reasonably be anticipated to cause developmental toxicity in humans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When administered in therapeutic doses, the Agency does not dispute the animal and human safety and efficacy of ivermectin
and abamectin, but the safety of a 0.2 to 0.3 mg/kg single therapeutic dose does not diminish the findings of the developmental,
reproductive, neurotoxic, chronic, and carcinogenic animal studies with abamectin which in some cases demonstrate
serious compound-related effects at higher than therapeutic doses in all species tested. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The same commenter states that although the aquatic toxicity data cited for the proposed listing of abamectin under
EPCRA section 313 are accurate and valid, it may be inappropriate to list abamectin under EPCRA section 313 based on
the environmental fate of this chemical, because of environmental fate factors which were not presented by EPA in
the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA agrees with the commenter that the aquatic toxicity values presented in the proposed rule are accurate and valid.
EPA disagrees that the environmental fate of abamectin will negate the chemical's ecological toxicity. EPA believes
that the environmental fate factors presented by the commenter may reduce, but do not eliminate, the potential for
adverse effects on aquatic organisms because the chemical is extremely acutely toxic to aquatic organisms. EPA reaffirms

. Monsanto states that at the highest dose tested in the chronic mouse study cited in the proposed rule, EPA concluded
there was an increase in lung tumors in females. Monsanto believes that other regulatory agencies have disagreed
with this conclusion. The commenter contends that these tumors occur spontaneously in mice with a fairly high and
variable frequency and a possible slight increase in a common rodent tumor at the highest dose tested does not represent
a risk to humans receiving, at most, trace level exposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has concluded that there was statistically significant increase (the increase was greater than that which
would be expected to occur spontaneously) in lung tumors in female CD-1 mice at 2 dose levels which were relevant to
potential carcinogenicity to humans. The commenter provides no specifics to support its contention that ``other
regulatory agencies have disagreed with this conclusion'' nor is the Agency aware of any.

 (Ref. 13) also incorrectly listed the dose levels (``[greater than] 42 mg/kg/day'') producing tumors in rats in the
2-year rat feeding study cited in the proposed rule. The commenter argues that significant increases in thyroid and
stomach tumors were observed only at 126 mg/kg/day, the highest dose tested; this dose level also produced severe,
excessive toxicity. Thus, the commenter concludes that the dose-response curves for the stomach and thyroid tumors
are exceptionally steep, with increased incidences observed only at a dose which exceeded the Maximum Tolerated
Dose (MTD). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Support Document for the Health and Ecological Toxicity Review of TRI Expansion Chemicals
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Ref. 13) correctly states the toxic dose levels in the 2&hyph;year rat feeding study as being greater than or equal
to 42 mg/kg/day. In this study, nasal tumors were significantly increased at 42 mg/kg/day and above and the stomach
and thyroid follicular cell tumors at 126 mg/kg/day. The Agency agrees that the 126 mg/kg/day dose level probably
exceeded the MTD; however, upon reconsideration of the carcinogenicity data, the Agency determined that the MTD
is between 42 mg/kg/day and 126 mg/kg/day. Although the MTD was exceeded by the highest dose (126 mg/kg/day), significant
effects were seen at 42 mg/kg/day, which does 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 exceed the MTD. Therefore, EPA believes that the 2&hyph;year chronic dog study cited in the proposed rule is a valid
measure of the oncogenic potential of alachlor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter cites a chronic rat feeding study, not cited by EPA in the proposed rule, in which 5 to 6 months of alachlor
administration followed by 19 months on control diet did not produce a significant increase in stomach or thyroid
tumors in rats. The commenter believes that this information is consistent with the results of a study, not cited by
EPA in the proposed rule, in which a close structural chloroacetanilide analog of alachlor has been shown to be a promoter
but not an initiator of stomach tumors. The commenter did not further identify this study. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although in the chronic rat feeding study referred to by Monsanto, the specific group which received alachlor in the
diet for 5 to 6 months in this study, and then control diet as a recovery period did not develop stomach or thyroid tumors,
the other groups on study which continued to receive alachlor in the diet developed both stomach and thyroid tumors
as well as nasal turbinate tumors. Therefore, the failure to develop stomach tumors after 5 to 6 months treatment reflects
the time frame required for tumor development rather than indicating a lack of carcinogenic response. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter also discusses the mechanism of carcinogenicity for alachlor. The commenter states that the mechanism
is nongenotoxic and hormonally mediated. The commenter argues that the mechanism exhibits a threshold and that nasal
turbinate tumors in particular are not relevant to humans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency acknowledges the mechanism of carcinogenicity may be hormonally mediated. However, the mechanism does
not alter the fact that the tumors are relevant to potential carcinogenesis in man. Mechanism of tumor development
relates to the appropriate model by which cancer risk is calculated. However, mechanism has no impact on the determination
of carcinogenicity hazard. In determining cancer classification, EPA does not assume that the specific types of
tumors seen in animals will develop in humans. However, EPA believes that the development of tumors, such as nasal
turbinates, in animals demonstrates the potential for tumor development in humans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The same commenter states that two epidemiology studies, not cited by EPA in the proposed rule, have been conducted
on alachlor manufacturing workers. The commenter contends that neither study indicates an increase in tumors in
humans due to exposure to alachlor. The commenter believes that these studies provide important additional evidence
indicating that the tumors produced in rats by alachlor are not produced in humans and should have been considered
by the Agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Epidemiological studies are used by the Agency in the overall evaluation of the carcinogenic potential of a chemical,
along with other evidence. However, the studies cited by the commenter are based on a small sample size. Studies of
this type cannot verify the levels and duration of exposure and represent results from a heterogeneous population.
In addition, one of the two studies apparently only focused on tumors resulting in death of the study subjects and may
reflect an under estimation of tumor incidence. Therefore, in the face of evidence of carcinogenicity in two adequately
performed bioassays in two species, the epidemiology data, although pertinent, do not negate the importance of the
animal data in the studies relied upon in the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA reaffirms that there is sufficient evidence for listing alachlor on the EPCRA section 313 list pursuant to EPCRA
section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available carcinogenicity data for this chemical. Therefore, EPA is finalizing
the addition of alachlor on the EPCRA section 313 list.

that hepatotoxicity was observed only at high dose levels (100 and 500 mg/kg/day) in subchronic studies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The Agency believes that the LOEL of 100 mg/kg/day is sufficiently low given the seriousness of the effect (hepatic
toxicity) to justify listing on the EPCRA section 313 list. Thus, EPA reaffirms that there is sufficient evidence
for listing ametryn on the EPCRA section 313 list pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available hepatotoxicity

. Nor-Am Chemical Company states that in the 2-year beagle dog feeding study cited in the proposed rule, contrary to
EPA's conclusions, the only effects seen in the high dose (1.0 mg/kg/day) group were a small but insignificant increase
in blood glucose and in one animal slight hypothermia during weeks 52 and 79. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA disagrees with the commenter. EPA has re-evaluated this study, and determined that in this study amitraz induced
significant changes in blood chemistry (increased blood glucose). Hypothermia occurred not only at the times noted
by the commenter, but also on days 1 and 2, and in one dog 3 hours after dosing, which returned to normal within 24 hours,
at the 1.0 mg/kg/day level, the LOEL. As noted in the proposed rule, these findings were supported by similar results
obtained in a 90-day feeding study in dogs cited in the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nor-Am disagrees with the Agency's conclusion that the NOAEL for fetotoxicity was 5 mg/kg/day in the 3-generation
rat reproduction study cited in the proposed rule. The commenter believes that while there was a slight decrease in
the mean litter size at birth in the 20 mg/kg/day dose group and decreased pup viability in the 5 and 20 mg/kg/day dose
groups post partum, there was no direct evidence of fetotoxicity. Nor-Am states that the effect on litter size was
only significant in the third generation animals at 5 mg/kg/day, and may have been due to an effect on lactation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's reanalysis of this data indicates that there was a decrease in litter size and pup survival at 5 mg/kg/day in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter contends that the rabbit teratology study reported by the Agency in the proposed rule was considered
by EPA to be invalid (i.e., significantly flawed) due to high abortion rates in all groups, inadequately small group
sizes, and lack of assessment of fetuses. The commenter argues that the low incidence of anomalies upon which the NOAEL
of 1 mg/kg/day was based were within historical control ranges and failed to show any clear dose-related effect. The
commenter claims that a subsequent study, not cited by EPA in the proposed rule, revealed no effects on fetal morphology
at doses up to 12 mg/kg/day while maternal toxicity was found at 3 mg/kg/day and above; no NOEL could be established.
The commenter claims that this subsequent study, not cited by EPA in the proposed rule, should have been considered
by EPA. EPA disagrees. The rabbit teratology study cited by EPA in the proposed rule was never declared by EPA to be invalid
(i.e., seriously flawed). Upon reanalysis of the rabbit teratology study, EPA determined that although this study
does not fully satisfy the guidelines for study conduct under FIFRA, it is sufficient for the purposes of hazard assessment,
with a NOEL and LOEL for maternal and developmental toxicity of 5 and 25 mg/kg/day, respectively. As described in the
proposed rule, at 25 mg/kg/day, the following effects were seen: Decreased litter size and increased pre and post-implantation
losses, decreased maternal body weight gain, and increased abortions. The high abortion rate is indicative of maternal
toxicity. Although the abortion rates were higher than the control, enough animals remained at sacrifice to evaluate
the toxicity potential of this chemical, and to support the finding that amitraz can reasonably be anticipated to
cause developmental toxicity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The subsequent study cited by the commenter was also considered by EPA. This study also does not fully satisfy the guidelines
for study conduct under FIFRA. Although the fetotoxic effects observed in the initial study (cited in the proposed
rule) were not reproduced in the subsequent study referred to by the commenter and not cited in the proposed rule, this
does not invalidate the results obtained in the initial study. Both studies were considered by EPA in determining
the developmental toxicity of amitraz. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA reaffirms that there is sufficient evidence for listing amitraz on the EPCRA section 313 list pursuant to EPCRA
section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the chronic toxicity and developmental toxicity data for this chemical. Therefore,
EPA is finalizing the addition of amitraz on the EPCRA section 313 list. 5.

. Ciba-Geigy Corporation objects to the listing of atrazine under EPCRA section 313 based on increased incidence
of mammary tumors in female Sprague-Dawley rats because the commenter contends that this tumor type is not indicative
of potential carcinogenicity in humans. The commenter states that the effect is species (rat) and strain (Sprague-Dawley)
specific. Further, the commenter states epidemiology data from Ciba-Geigy manufacturing and use indicate no evidence
of carcinogenicity in a human population exposed for up to 30 years. Ciba-Geigy did not provide EPA with a copy of this
study but did discuss the results in their comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While epidemiology data are considered in the weight of the evidence for carcinogenicity, the current classification
is based upon a positive finding in a well conducted animal study as described in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Risk Assessment Guidelines of 1986
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Ref. 5). Atrazine has been classified as a category C chemical by EPA's OPP Carcinogenicity Peer Review Committee
and the Scientific Advisory Panel (EPA, 1988). The use of mammary tumor data for hazard assessment purposes, even
when only one strain of test animal has been demonstrated to be positive, is consistent with current Agency policy.
The Agency considers the cancer classification to be sufficient basis for listing of atrazine.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA reaffirms that there is sufficient evidence for listing atrazine on the EPCRA section 313 list pursuant to EPCRA

. Nor-Am Chemical Company states that bendiocarb does not meet the criteria of EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) due to its
environmental fate. The commenter alleges that it has been shown not to accumulate in soil, water, or plants and has
a relatively short half-life (a few days). Nor-Am Chemical Company also contends that bendiocarb is rapidly broken
down by hydrolysis to a biologically inactive product. As a result, the commenter states that there is no clear evidence
of adverse effects on the environment associated with bendiocarb. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA disagrees that the environmental fate of bendiocarb will negate the chemical's ecological toxicity. EPA believes
that the environmental fate factors presented by the commenter may reduce but do not eliminate the potential for adverse
effects on aquatic organisms and birds because the chemical induces environmental toxicity at low dose levels. Thus,
EPA believes that the chemical can reasonably be anticipated to cause a significant adverse effect on the environment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA reaffirms that there is sufficient evidence for listing bendiocarb on the EPCRA section 313 list pursuant to EPCRA
section 313(d)(2)(B) based on neurological toxicity data for this chemical, and pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C)
based on the available environmental toxicity data. Therefore, EPA is finalizing the addition of bendiocarb on the

Bifenthrin
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. FMC Corporation does not support the addition of bifenthrin under EPCRA section 313 because ``EPA overstates the
neurological and [developmental effects] of bifenthrin. The neurological effects to which EPA referred were tremors
or twitching, neurological signs that did not persist for the entire duration of the studies.'' EPA agrees with the
commenter regarding the developmental toxicity potential or lack thereof, but disagrees with the commenter regarding
the neurological hazards. In addition to the tremors or twitching effects cited by the commenter, more severe symptoms,
including clonic convulsions and death, occur in the studies referred to by the commenters that are cited in the proposed
rule, at dose levels only slightly higher than those causing slight or occasional tremors and/or twitching. In a rat
developmental toxicity study by gavage, cited in the proposed rule, the maternal LOEL based on tremors was 2 mg/kg/day;
the NOEL was 1 mg/kg/day. The MTD of 2 mg/kg/day was established on the basis of findings in a rat pilot study (included
as part of the chronic rat study cited in the proposed rule) in which there were 3 deaths out of 10 animals at 2.5 mg/kg/day.
With regard to the comment concerning the transitory nature of the effects, although they may be transitory in nature,
this does not diminish the significance of the adverse effects. In particular, neurotoxic effects leading to convulsion
may result in more permanent, underlying damage which is not reversible upon cessation of immediate signs and symptoms.
Therefore, the Agency concludes that the neurological effects due to bifenthrin are of sufficient seriousness to
warrant listing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA reaffirms that there is sufficient evidence for listing bifenthrin on the EPCRA section 313 list pursuant to EPCRA
section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available neurological toxicity data, and pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C)
based on the available environmental toxicity data. Therefore, EPA is finalizing the addition of bifenthrin on the

Bromine

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Great Lakes Chemical Corporation and Albemarle Corporation believe that bromine does not meet the listing criteria
of EPCRA section 313. They contend that the Agency has failed to show that chronic exposure to bromine causes serious
or irreversible effects. They also contend that the time-weighted average (TWA) of 0.1 part per million (ppm) established
by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) will protect against the acute effects of exposure.
They believe, therefore, that the addition of bromine to the EPCRA section 313 list should not be finalized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NIOSH established the TWA for bromine for acute effects. However, the Agency is not listing bromine on the EPCRA section
313 list on the basis of its acute effects but on the basis of the adverse effects it induces after chronic exposure.
These effects include functional neurologic effects and abnormalities in respiratory and endocrine systems. In
humans, chronic exposure to bromine can cause severe irritation of the skin, mucous membranes and respiratory tract,
gastroenteritis, and death. This severe irritation which can lead to death through either, or both, respiratory
or gastroenteric irritation is the primary endpoint of concern although neurologic signs and symptoms which include
dizziness, headache, and ``feelings of oppression'' along with other functional disturbances of the central nervous
system (CNS) may also occur after exposure to bromine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA reaffirms that there is sufficient evidence for listing bromine on the EPCRA section 313 list pursuant to EPCRA

2-Bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol (Bronopol)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Boots Microcheck contends that 2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol presents only a moderate acute hazard, but does
not present a chronic hazard. Therefore, the commenter concludes that the compound should not be listed under EPCRA
section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the Agency agrees with the commenter that 2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol presents a moderate acute
hazard, EPA does not agree that the chemical is not a chronic toxicant. The effects noted in both acute and chronic studies,
cited in the proposed rule, indicate irritation due to exposure to the compound. However, differing expressions
of irritation are obtained depending upon the level of material to which the test animals were exposed and the duration
of exposure. In the acute studies cited in the proposed rule, the acute gastric effects were seen at relatively high
doses. In the chronic studies, cited in the proposed rule, the effects, described below, were noted following repeated
oral exposure to lower doses of 2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol. The NOEL for chronic oral exposure in rats was
10 mg/kg/day, with effects including lesions of the stomach mucosa, ulceration, raised areas and excrescences.
In a 13&hyph;week study in rats cited in the proposed rule, effects included inflammation, epithelial hyperplasia
and hyperkeratosis, and congested vessels of the mucosa of the G.I. tract. The chronic studies cited in the proposed
rule show that irritation was caused by a repeated number of low doses. In these chronic studies multiple doses were
required before irritation occurred. Further, the type of irritation caused by acute and chronic exposure are different.
Therefore, the irritation due to chronic exposure to 2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol is distinguishable from
that caused by acute exposure. EPA believes that the effects observed in the longer term studies are serious and potentially
irreversible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA reaffirms that there is sufficient evidence for listing 2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol on the EPCRA section

. Zeneca Incorporated and Uniroyal Chemical oppose the listing of carboxin. The commenters claim that the effect
of renal toxicity noted by EPA in the proposed rule was seen only in rat feeding studies and not in a chronic dog feeding
study. Thus, they claim it appears to be a species-specific effect that may not be relevant to man. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA disagrees with the conclusions of the commenters. Because direct human testing is generally unavailable, animals
are commonly accepted as surrogates for toxicity testing to predict potential hazard(s) to humans. Exceptions occur
only in a few rare cases where effects have been determined to be species-specific (e.g.,

-globulin). It should be noted that the actual number of species tested with carboxin is limited and, therefore, it
is premature to state that the renal toxicity of carboxin is species-specific. Significantly, the commenters did
not provide any additional evidence to support their contention that the renal toxicity is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species-specific. EPA uses information from the most sensitive species to evaluate potential human hazard(s),
as a conservative assumption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA reaffirms that there is sufficient evidence for adding carboxin on the EPCRA section 313 list pursuant to EPCRA

. Dow Chemical Company notes that, in the dog study cited in the proposed rule, the test material was administered in
gelatin capsules due to problems with palatability. They argue that this mode of administration is unusual and introduces
the confounding factor of what is in essence a bolus administration (given all at one time) of the chemical, and results
in an artificially lowered NOEL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency does not agree that this mode of administration is unusual. EPA frequently reviews dog studies in which
the test material is administered by capsule. In addition, dog studies rarely permit ad libitum feeding as used in
rat studies, even when dietary incorporation is the means of dose administration. Dogs generally receive a measured
amount of food that they rapidly consume. Therefore, bolus administration closely approximates actual behavior
in dogs. The concern that capsule administration produces an apparently altered response is not a confounding factor
in the study cited in the proposed rule, and therefore the reported NOEL does not need to be raised as suggested by the
commenter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The same commenter contends that the effects used as a basis for listing occurred only in dogs and only in a single study,
and, therefore, are not relevant to humans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because direct human testing is generally unavailable, animals are commonly accepted in the scientific and regulatory
communities as surrogates for toxicity testing to predict potential hazard to humans, except in a few rare cases where

potential human hazard. In addition, results demonstrated in a single well-conducted study are sufficient and can
serve as a basis for listing on the section 313 list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The same commenter states that the LOEL in the study was based upon a slight, reversible effect in the liver of a single
animal. The study, the commenter argues, should have been considered in toto rather than relying on a single effect.
The commenter implies that EPA should have set the LOEL at a higher dose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter is incorrect. The LOEL of 15 mg/kg/day is correct. This LOEL was based upon obliterative vasculitis
and perivasculitis in one animal. However, these effects are not commonly seen in dogs, yet in the study cited in the
proposed rule, they occurred in seven of eight dogs at 30 mg/kg/day, the dose next highest to the LOEL. EPA considers
the effects seen in this study to be serious effects.

that were proposed for addition (dichloromethylphenylsilane, dimethyldichlorosilane, methyltrichlorosilane,

and are not expected to be found in the atmosphere in appreciable concentrations. The commenters further state that
EPA estimated conditions in its exposure assessment that greatly exceed actual conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on these comments, EPA conducted revised exposure assessments for each of the chlorosilanes. These revisions
support EPA's initial finding that dimethyldichlorosilane, methyltrichlorosilane, and trimethylchlorosilane
can reasonably be anticipated to be present at facility boundaries in concentration levels that would cause a significant

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised exposure assessments for dichloromethylphenylsilane, trichloroethylsilane, and trichlorophenylsilane,
however, indicate that these chemicals are not individually present at facility boundaries in concentration levels
that would cause a significant adverse effect. However, two or more of these chemicals are usually produced together
and as a category are reasonably anticipated to be present at facility boundaries in concentration levels that would
cause a significant adverse effect. Therefore, EPA is deferring the individual listings of these three chemicals
for consideration as a category possibly to be added at a later date.

Crotonaldehyde
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Eastman Chemical and Monsanto believe that crotonaldehyde should not be added to the EPCRA section 313 list because
of inadequate data on human health. Furthermore, they contend that crotonaldehyde does not meet the criteria for
listing as a carcinogen as put forth in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Risk Assessment Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Ref. 4) because it was tested in a single sex, single species experiment. The commenters further believe that EPA's
statement that crotonaldehyde did not induce tumors at the high dose, because at that high dose crotonaldehyde is
cytotoxic, is a contention which is not supported by scientific evidence. They believe that overall the weight of
evidence for carcinogenicity, including reactivity and mutagenicity, is insufficient to support listing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA agrees that the human carcinogenicity data are inadequate but feels that the available animal data are adequate
to support a concern for carcinogenicity. The Agency accepts the single-sex, single species testing of crotonaldehyde
as being sufficient for listing because these data are supported by strong evidence of mutagenicity in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Salmonella typhimurium
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
; a statistically significant increase in the number of both benign and malignant tumors in low dose animals and induced
altered liver foci but not tumor formation in the high dose group. Crotonaldehyde is known to be severely cytotoxic
with the capacity to induce cell death and alter cellular macromolecules. It caused gross degeneration, chromosome
breakage and reciprocal translocations in

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and gross degeneration and polyploidy in all stages of spermatogenesis in mouse seminiferous tubules thus showing
that is has ample ability to interact with cellular DNA and cause severe disruption in chromosome structure and cellular
integrity. It is logical to assume that if crotonaldehyde is capable of such damage in the mammalian testis which is
protected by the blood/testis barrier, it can also cause severe toxicity and cell death in the liver which has no such
protection from toxic agents. Absent evidence to the contrary, which the commenter did not provide, EPA continues
to believe that failure to observe tumor formation is due to cell death before tumors could develop. Based on these
findings, the Agency believes that the weight of evidence for crotonaldehyde is sufficient for listing. EPA reaffirms
that there is sufficient evidence for listing crotonaldehyde on the EPCRA section 313 list pursuant to EPCRA section
313(d)(2)(B) based on available carcinogenicity and mutagenicity data for this chemical. Therefore, EPA is finalizing
the addition of crotonaldehyde on the EPCRA section 313 list.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Cycloate
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Zeneca Incorporated contends that in the 3&hyph;generation rat feeding study, cited in the proposed rule as being
of unknown duration, the distended myelin sheath demyelination and nerve fiber loss at the LOEL of 3.0 mg/kg/day occurred
only after extensive exposure and as such would not be relevant to a toxic release type of short exposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The effects described in this study are considered to be both serious and irreversible. Adverse effects that are induced
by a chemical after repeated long-term exposures and are a valid basis for listing under EPCRA section 313. The same
commenter states that the 3-generation rat reproduction study cited in the proposed rule was replaced by a more recent
(1990) 2-generation rat reproduction study, also cited in the proposed rule, in which the toxic effects on pup survival
(LOEL of 50 mg/kg/day) and pup body weight (LOEL of 20 mg/kg/day) occurred at doses which were maternally toxic as well.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA considered both studies in its evaluation of cycloate. As described in unit IV.E. of this preamble, developmental
effects seen in developing organisms are considered to be adverse whether or not they occur at doses that are also maternally
toxic. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA reaffirms that there is sufficient evidence for listing cycloate on the EPCRA section 313 list pursuant to EPCRA
section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available neurological and developmental toxicity data. Therefore, EPA is finalizing
the addition of cycloate on the EPCRA section 313 list.

Cyclohexanol

identified in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Draft Hazard Assessment Guidelines
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Ref. 11) as high priority or moderate priority. Furthermore, the concentrations that led to reproductive impacts
in rats were above the MED level of high priority. In addition, Monsanto states that the Industrial Health Foundation
submitted to EPA's TSCA office the results of a 2-generation reproduction study demonstrating a NOEL of 500 ppm in
air which should have been considered. The commenter claims that EPA has also not demonstrated that the effects mentioned,
or concentrations at which they occurred, were serious or irreversible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA agrees that the concentrations that led to tremors, central nervous system depression, lethargy, or hypothermia
in rabbits are above the level of MED that EPA identifies in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Draft Hazard Assessment Guidelines
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Ref. 11) as high priority for listing. However, while the 2,500 mg/kg/day dermal exposure is above the moderate priority
MED guideline, the 997 ppm (438 mg/kg/day) is within this category. In addition to the neurotoxicity effects, as cited
in the proposed rule, cyclohexanol also induces renal, hepatic, and myocardial effects at moderate dose levels (for
example, inhalation of 0.59 mg/L of cyclohexanol induced degenerative changes in the livers and kidneys of rabbits).
EPA considers these effects to be serious. In this case, based on a weight-of-evidence approach, EPA believes that
cyclohexanol presents a sufficient hazard to warrant listing under EPCRA section 313 even though the reported values
for neurotoxicity effects are in excess of the MEDs placing a chemical in the high priority grouping.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA disagrees that the concentrations that led to reproductive impacts in rats and gerbils (15 mg/kg) as described
in the proposed rule are above the MED range for high priority listing. EPA reiterates the overall reproductive toxicity
of this chemical, based on a weight-of-evidence, supports the addition of cyclohexanol to the EPCRA section 313 list.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The chemical tested in the 2-generation reproduction study submitted to the Agency by the Industrial Health Foundation,
cited by the commenter, was cyclohexanone not cyclohexanol as claimed by the commenter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA reaffirms that there is sufficient evidence for listing cyclohexanol pursuant to EPCRA section 313 pursuant
to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available chronic neurological, hepatic, renal, myocardial, and reproductive
toxicity data for this chemical. Therefore, EPA is finalizing the addition of cyclohexanol on the EPCRA section 313
list.

Cyhalothrin

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Zeneca Incorporated contends that the neurotoxicity signs observed in the 6-month and 1-year dog studies cited
in the proposed rule occurred at doses that were ``otherwise toxic as well'' and do not provide any evidence of a specific
neurotoxicity. Zeneca Incorporated implies that the presence of ``otherwise toxic'' signs reduces the significance
of the neurotoxicity observed in the cited study. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The phrase ``otherwise toxic as well'' was not defined by the commenter. The clinical signs of neurotoxicity observed
in the dogs at 3.5 mg/kg/day (ataxia, muscle tremors, and convulsions in the 1&hyph;year study cited in the proposed
rule) and at 10 mg/kg/day (unsteadiness and trembling in the 6&hyph;month study cited in the proposed rule) are considered
by EPA to be evidence of physiological neurotoxicity. Although there were no pathologic changes in the nervous tissue,
EPA considers these effects to be serious because they often precede pathologic neurotoxicity. With the exception
of liquid feces, there were no reported toxic findings other than those related to neurotoxicity. EPA reaffirms that
there is sufficient evidence for listing cyhalothrin on the EPCRA section 313 list pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B)
based on the available neurological toxicity data. Therefore, EPA is finalizing the addition of cyhalothrin on the
EPCRA section 313 list.

Desmedipham

. Nor-Am Chemical states that methemoglobin formation, which is cited by EPA as the basis for listing, is an entirely
reversible effect which occurs only after prolonged and consistent exposure. Therefore, the commenter concludes
that this finding, by itself, should not be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the 90&hyph;day dog study, cited in the proposed rule, EPA considers 150 ppm to be a NOAEL. Methemoglobin values
were only minimally higher than control levels and were not associated with an increase in Heinz bodies. In the 1-year
dog feeding study, after 13 weeks treatment at 300 ppm, methemoglobin was seen associated with histopathological
changes (hemosiderin and hemopoiesis). While methemoglobinemia may be a reversible effect, it is nevertheless
a serious effect, and in some cases irreversible damage may occur as a result of methemoglobinemia. Methemoglobinemia
interfers with the oxygenating capacity of blood resulting in an undersupply of oxygen to the tissues. Therefore,
methemoglobinemia is a toxic effect and not simply an indicator of exposure to desmedipham as concluded by the commenter.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, EPA reaffirms that there is sufficient evidence for listing desmedipham on the EPCRA section 313 list
pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available hematological toxicity data. Therefore, EPA is finalizing
the addition of desmedipham on the EPCRA section 313 list. 18.

2,2-Dibromo-3-nitrilopropionamide
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Dow Chemical Company and Rohm Haas state that the corrosivity and irritancy of the 2,2-dibromo-3-nitrilopropionamide
(DBNPA) solutions to the esophagus, pharynx, trachea, and lungs led to development of dyspnea in rats. The commenters
imply that the dyspnea in rats should be discounted because it was caused by the method of administration rather than
the toxicity of the chemical. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency agrees that the dyspnea observed in the 4&hyph;week and 13&hyph;week rat gavage studies cited in the proposed
rule may have been due to severe irritation of the trachea and lungs from accidental or incidental delivery of small
amounts of the DBNPA dosing solutions into the larynx, pharynx, trachea, and/or lungs during the procedure. However,
this suggestion of possible cause can be neither refuted nor confirmed based upon the available data. Dyspnea is the
basis for the LOEL in the study. One of the commenters agrees that DBNPA is corrosive, particularly to the eyes and,
at the least, is severely irritating to the respiratory tract. This is consistent with the effects observed in the
two subject studies. The Agency considers the finding of dyspnea in the 4- and 13&hyph;week studies to be of sufficient
seriousness to warrant listing on the EPCRA section 313 list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA reaffirms that there is sufficient evidence for listing 2,2-dibromo-3-nitrilopropionamide on the EPCRA section

EPA is finalizing the addition of 2,2-dibromo-3-nitriloproprionamide on the EPCRA section 313 list.

Diclofop-methyl

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Nor-Am Chemical and Hoechst-Celanese contend that EPA interpreted the doses administered by gavage as diet concentrations
(ppm) in the rat teratology study cited in the proposed rule. One commenter states the Agency should provide clarifications
concerning ``mortality'' of the pups and the calculation of the actual test substance intake at different stages
during the in-life phases during development in the 3-generation rat reproduction study. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter is correct in stating that the Agency erred in interpreting gavage doses as ppm in the rat teratology
study. However, EPA still believes that the doses at which adverse effects occur are sufficiently low and the adverse
effects reported are of sufficient seriousness to warrant listing. The developmental NOEL is 10 mg/kg/day and the
LOEL is 32 mg/kg/day based on an increased incidence of a number of variations and malformations, as described in the
proposed rule. While the maternal effects on body weight and food consumption at 32 mg/kg/day are transient and reversible,
some of the developmental effects at this dose are irreversible. In the 3&hyph;generation rat reproduction study
cited in the proposed rule, a decrease in pups born alive in the F

) was noted in offspring at 100 ppm (5 mg/kg/day). The commenter considers the LOEL for this study to be 6.7 mg/kg/day.
This dose resulted in decreased parental food consumption and body weight and there were no post partum pup mortalities.
Additionally, there were no effects on fertility at the LOEL at any time during the three generations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenters further stated that EPA should ``consider the validity'' of the 30&hyph;day rat study cited in the
proposed rule because heart, kidney, and adrenal weights were increased only at doses with no histopathological
correlates and were due to the pharmacodynamic lipid metabolism of the test material by the liver. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The increased relative heart, liver, and kidney weights at 80 ppm (4 mg/kg/day) in the 30&hyph;day rat feeding study
is further substantiated by a recent 90&hyph;day rat feeding study cited in the proposed rule with a LOEL of 80 ppm and
a NOEL of 20 ppm (1 mg/kg/day). In the recent 90&hyph;day study cited in the proposed rule, absolute and relative liver
and kidney weight was increased in males and relative liver and kidney weight was increased in females at 80 ppm. These
increased organ weights are evidence of a compound-related effect. The Agency interprets Hoechst-Celanese's own
statements regarding the 30&hyph;day rat feeding study that ``increased liver weights and centrilobular enlargement
of hepatic cells at dietary concentrations of 80 ppm and higher'' as evidence of toxicity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hoechst-Celanese also contends that the effects in the renal cortex observed in the 90&hyph;day dog study cited in
the proposed rule at 250 ppm (15 and 13.4 mg/kg/day in males and females, respectively) did not occur at the highest
concentration tested in the 1-year dog study (80 ppm, 4-5mg/kg/day) indicating that the finding in the 90&hyph;day
study was not test substance related. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that the effects occurring in the renal cortex in the 90&hyph;day dog study at 13 to 15 mg/kg/day may not
have appeared in the 1&hyph;year dog study, since the highest dose tested was 4-5 mg/kg/day. If higher doses were employed
in the 1&hyph;year study, then renal effects could possibly have occurred. However, the results of the 1&hyph;year
study do not negate the 90&hyph;day results, since the dose levels used in the 90&hyph;day study were so much higher.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hoechst-Celanese also states that the Agency used an invalid (flawed) reproductive toxicity study to support the
listing. The commenter indicates that the study was compromised by infection of the rat colony with RCV/SDA virus.
They further state that another reproductive toxicity study, which EPA did not cite in the proposed rule, should have
been evaluated in which the fetotoxic NOEL was 30 mg/kg/day instead of greater than 5 mg/kg/day as in the original study.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency does not find the original study to be invalid. The data were considered to be valid for regulatory purposes.
In addition, the Agency found the fetotoxic NOEL in the study referred to by the commenter, not cited by EPA in the proposed
rule, to be 5 mg/kg/day, not 30 mg/kg/day as stated by the commenter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA reaffirms that there is sufficient evidence for listing diclofop-methyl on the EPCRA section 313 list pursuant
to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available developmental, hepatic, and renal toxicity data. Therefore,
EPA is finalizing the addition of diclofop-methyl on the EPCRA section 313 list.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Diisocyanates
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. EPA originally proposed to list three diisocyanates (hexamethylene-1,6-diisocyanate, isophorone diisocyanate,
and 1,1-methylene bis(4-isocyanatocyclohexane) on the basis of acute toxicity pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(A).
As an alternative, EPA proposed to create a delimited diisocyanates category containing these 3 diisocyanates and
17 other diisocyanates based on chronic pulmonary irritation pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B). EPA is finalizing
addition of the delimited diisocyanate category based on chronic pulmonary toxicity and therefore has not addressed
comments concerning the acute toxicity of any of the diisocyanates. EPA believes that diisocyanates are best added
as a category because the members of this category are structurally similar (i.e., each contains the diisocyanate
functionality), they induce a similar toxic effect (chronic pulmonary irritation), and their toxicity is due to
the diisocyanate portion of the molecule common to all members. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chemical Manufacturers Association Hexamethylene-1,6-Diisocyanate Panel, Dow Chemical Company, Monsanto,
Olin Chemicals, Sealed Air Corporation, Huls America Incorporated, and the Diisocyanates Panel of the Chemical
Manufacturers Association oppose EPA's alternative proposal to create a diisocyanate category and believe that
individual diisocyanates should be evaluated and included on the EPCRA section 313 list only if the diisocyanate
independently satisfies the statutory listing criteria. The commenters state that in adding a broad category of
diisocyanates, EPA ignores its statutory mandate to evaluate the individual toxicity of each chemical and to evaluate
the exposure potential to the EPCRA community by each individual chemical. The commenters contend that the category
would mislead the public as to the amount and type of toxic chemicals to which communities may be exposed. The commenters
contend that data collected in aggregate is confusing and difficult to use or interpret. Commenters state that adding
a category of diisocyanates based upon the isocyanate functionality is based on the chronic effects associated with
exposures to a limited number of diisocyanates and that this method unjustifiably equates toxicity across an entire
class of chemicals that have different properties and effects. Commenters state that diisocyanates encompass a
diverse group of chemicals which vary significantly in physical and chemical properties and in potential toxicity.
Commenters state that the available evidence on the pulmonary effects or toxicity of individual diisocyanates (toluene
diisocyanate, methylenebis(phenylisocyanate), and isophorone diisocyanate) does not support the addition of
a diisocyanates category. The commenters also state that EPA has not cited any data to support the assertions that
diisocyanates cause these effects. Commenters state that individual diisocyanates have been shown to respond differently
in mutagenicity studies and that other toxicological differences would be expected among individual diisocyanates,
because of differences in their ability to penetrate membranes, the capacity of organisms to metabolize them, the
specific reactivity of the diisocyanate groups, etc. Commenters state that in the proposed rule EPA recognized these
differences by stating that some diisocyanates are classified as probable carcinogens and others are not. The Wisconsin
Department of Natural Resources supports EPA's alternative proposal to create a diisocyanate category and would
prefer this manner of listing to listing each diisocyanate separately. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in unit IV.C. of the preamble, EPA believes that it is acting reasonably within its discretion in listing
a category of chemicals by showing that at least one member of the category meets the listing criteria of EPCRA section
313 and that the other members can reasonably be expected to exhibit the same or similar toxic effect. EPA believes
that the available data on the chronic pulmonary toxicity for several members of the diisocyanates category are sufficient
for listing under EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B). EPA also believes that the diisocyanate moiety, common to all members
of the category, is responsible for the observed chronic pulmonary toxicity. Therefore, EPA believes that it is reasonable
to anticipate that all members of the diisocyanate category will exhibit chronic pulmonary toxicity and that creating
a category of diisocyanates is the most appropriate way to list this class of chemicals. As stated in Unit IV.B. of the
preamble, EPA does not believe that it is required to consider exposure for chemicals that are moderately high to highly
toxic based on a hazard assessment when determining if a chemical can be added for chronic effects pursuant to EPCRA
section 313(d)(2)(B); therefore, EPA is not required to evaluate the exposure potential for the members of the diisocyanates
category. EPA believes that, because each member of the diisocyanates category has the same functional groups and
can reasonably be anticipated to cause similar toxic effects, the diisocyanates category will not mislead the public
as to the amounts and type of chemicals released and will not be confusing to use or interpret. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA agrees that the diisocyanates are a diverse group of chemicals which vary in physical and chemical properties.
However, EPA also believes that the reactive portion of diisocyanate chemicals is the diisocyanate moiety itself
and that the rest of the molecule does not affect the reactivity of this portion of the molecule. EPA stands by its interpretation
of the literature, as cited in the proposed rule and background material, on the adverse pulmonary effects of diisocyanates
and believes that this information supports the addition of a diisocyanates category. The Agency agrees that structural
differences among individual diisocyanates may indeed affect their absorption and metabolism. However, since
absorption and metabolism are not necessary for chronic pulmonary irritation to occur, the effect of structural
differences upon either absorption or metabolism is not an issue in this case. The Agency agrees with the commenter
that there are differences in the carcinogenicity/mutagenicity of toluene diisocyanate, methylenebis(phenylisocyanate),
and isophorone diisocyanate and that these differences are most likely the result of the differences in absorption
and metabolism. However, since neither of these endpoints is the basis for listing diisocyanates as a category and
since chronic pulmonary irritation can occur without absorption and metabolism taking place, these issues do not
affect the Agency's overall concern for diisocyanates or its decision to list them as a category on the EPCRA section
313. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As EPA discussed in the proposed rule, there currently are four other diisocyanates listed on the EPCRA section 313
list, these are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Toluene-2,4-diisocyanate (000584-84-9) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Toluene-2,6-diisocyanate (000091&hyph;08-7)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is leaving the toluene diisocyanate compounds listed individually. In addition to the effects discussed above,
these compounds have been shown to be carcinogenic. EPA believes it is appropriate to continue to individually list
carcinogenic diisocyanates because they exhibit a different toxic endpoint than other members of the category.
Methylenebis(phenylisocyanate) has not been shown to be a carcinogen and as EPA discussed in the proposed rule it
is being moved into the diisocyanate category. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA reaffirms its determination that diisocyanates meet the criteria of EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B). Therefore,

In reassessing the Agency's proposal in light of comments received and other information, it has become clear to EPA
that the effect of concern (chronic pulmonary toxicity) is related to the diisocyanate moiety and therefore common
to all diisocyanate compounds not just those included in the delimited category finalized in this rule. EPA believes
that many other diisocyanates not covered by the category may meet the EPCRA section 313 criteria. Therefore, EPA
believes that it may be more appropriate to create a diisocyanates category based on a molecular formula description
rather than a more limited category comprised of certain named diisocyanates. However, EPA did not include a molecular
formula category option in its proposal and therefore has not given the public an opportunity to comment on such a category.
Accordingly, in this action EPA is finalizing the addition of a delimited category consisting of the 20 diisocyanates
on which the Agency has received comment and for which the Agency has made a final determination that the chemicals
meet the EPCRA section 313 criteria for listing. EPA believes that the chemicals covered by this category represent
the majority of diisocyanates in production and that listing the delimited category will provide meaningful data
to the public. At a later date, EPA will consider whether a more broad diisocyanates category is warranted and appropriate.

rigorous review of the available data before adding dimethylamine to the EPCRA section 313 list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is not proposing to list dimethylamine pursuant to section 313(d)(2)(A), therefore the Agency does not
have to show that the chemical causes ``. . .significant adverse acute human health effects at concentration levels
that are reasonably likely to exist beyond facility site boundaries. . . .'' EPA disagrees that the data cited are insufficient
to prove that dimethylamine is likely to cause significant human health effects. As articulated in the proposed rule,
dimethylamine is corrosive to mucous membranes, the eyes and respiratory tract. Chronic exposure results in dose-related
lesions in the respiratory and olfactory epithelium and is associated with centrilobular fatty degeneration and
necrosis of parenchymal cells after inhalation exposure for 18 to 20 weeks. Rats exposed to oral doses as low as 0.035
mg/kg for 8 months showed neurological effects including changes in conditioned reflexes while single doses of 240
to 260 mg/kg caused excitement and muscle weakness in mice, rats, guinea pigs, and rabbits. Dimethylamine is corrosive
to the respiratory tract, exhibits hepatotoxicity and is neurotoxic. EPA reaffirms that there is sufficient evidence
to list dimethylamine on the EPCRA section 313 list pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available
chronic respiratory, hepatic, and neurological toxicity data for this chemical. Therefore, EPA is finalizing the
addition of dimethylamine on the EPCRA section 313 list.

. One commenter, General Electric, states that the proposed addition of 2,6-dimethylphenol to EPCRA section 313
is based upon a ``low confidence'' study and a 10-week subchronic study which the ITC found insufficient to evaluate.
The commenter is concerned that EPA is using the same data set in two rule makings; TSCA section 4 and the decision to
list on the EPCRA section 313 list. The commenter quotes the ITC finding that the studies are of ``low confidence.''
The Agency used these data to derive an oral RfD of 0.0006 mg/kg/day. IRIS confidence in the studies is low because of
lack of experimental detail. EPA also concedes that the ITC had low confidence in these studies for its purposes which

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. However, EPA believes that these data are sufficient for the purposes of hazard assessment and concludes that these
studies when considered together present a sufficient weight of the evidence determination for listing 2,6-dimethylphenol
on EPCRA section 313 because 2,6-dimethylphenol causes hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity at relatively low dose
levels. EPA reaffirms that there is sufficient evidence to list 2,6-dimethylphenol on the EPCRA section 313 list
pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity data for this chemical.
Therefore, EPA is finalizing the addition of 2,6-dimethylphenol on the EPCRA section 313 list.

subject to FIFRA (e.g. as an inhibitor in the polymer industry). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that the chemical is more properly listed by its common chemical name, dinitrobutyl phenol, rather than

. Buckman Laboratories International, Incorporated contends that the compound was not teratogenic in either the
rat or rabbit studies cited in the proposed rule. Specifically, they contend that skeletal variations and increased
resorptions should be considered an artifact (i.e., occurring by chance rather than as a result of treatment), and
should not be considered as evidence of developmental toxicity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA disagrees with the commenter. In both the rabbit and rat teratology studies cited in the proposed rule, developmental
effects were observed at levels that were above the maternally toxic level (greater than 3 mg/kg for rabbits and greater
than 6 mg/kg for rats). Furthermore, the effects observed cannot be considered an artifact, because in rabbits receiving
30 mg/kg, there is a continuation of the effects observed at 10 mg/kg, with an accompanying increase in the severity
of the developmental findings. This shows that the effects are related to the dose received and do not occur by chance.
EPA reaffirms that there is sufficient evidence for listing disodium cyanodithioimidocarbonate on the EPCRA section
313 list pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available developmental toxicity data. Therefore,
EPA is finalizing the listing of disodium cyanodithiomidocarbamate on the EPCRA section 313 list.

. Zeneca Incorporated states that in the study cited by EPA in the proposed rule in which rats were orally administered
the test compound for 2 years, brain cholinesterase reductions were slight and only occurred at 120 mg/kg/day, not
15 mg/kg/day. The commenter claims that neuromuscular changes occurred only after extended exposure, and are not
relevant to listing on the EPCRA section 313 list. The commenter is referring to two studies cited in the proposed rule.
A 2-year rat feeding study established a NOEL of 5 mg/kg/day and a systemic LOEL of 25 mg/kg/day with neuromuscular
atrophy/degeneration and decreased body weight gains as the findings. At 125 mg/kg/day, the effects included chronic
myocarditis, cataracts, increased SGOT and decreased RBC cholinesterase (ChE) activity. The neuromuscular and
cardiac changes are serious and potentially irreversible effects. The second study is a 3&hyph;month feeding study
in Sprague-Dawley rats. Although this study was not identified in the proposed rule, the results of the study were
described. The systemic NOEL in this study was 3 mg/kg/day, and the LOEL was 15 mg/kg/day. The effects seen included
increase in cardiomyopathy and decreased weight gain and food consumption. As noted by the commenter, brain ChE depression
in this study in females was slight and occurred at 120 mg/kg/day and, taken by itself, is not sufficient for listing,
however, when considered with other effects in a weight-of-evidence approach, this endpoint is supportive of listing.
The commenter further states that the 2&hyph;year dietary rat study is old and has been superseded by another study
(Ref. 8), in which the NOEL was 25 mg/kg/day. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency agrees with the commenter's comment regarding the replacement of the older study with a newer study, but
disagrees with the commenter's NOEL. The Agency's NOEL for this study is 5 mg/kg/day and not 25 mg/kg/day. However,
the results of the older study demonstrate that heart effects of EPTC are seen in more than one study.

effect in other generations. Thus, there is no reason to conclude that this effect was not manifested in other generations.
In addition, this type of adverse effect has been seen in other studies, such as the 2&hyph;year rat study and the 3-month
rat study discussed above and cited in the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency believes that the cardiopathic finding at 10 mg/kg/day, degenerative cardiomyopathy, is the pivotal
finding of toxicological significance for EPTC. EPA believes that this is a serious effect. Therefore, this effect
cannot be considered incidental to treatment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter further states that the neurological effects seen in the study are not relevant to the EPCRA section
313 due to prolonged exposure and the cardiovascular observations occurred at the highest dose tested in the studies
cited. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The cardiovascular effects occur after relatively short exposures at doses of 9 mg/kg/day in male rats and 18 mg/kg/day
in female rats. These dose levels are sufficiently low and the adverse effects are serious and potentially irreversible.
The Agency considers the neurotoxicity due to prolonged exposure to be relevant for purposes of listing on the EPCRA
section 313 list. Releases of chemicals that induce adverse effects after prolonged exposure is among the type of
information that Congress intended TRI to include. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA reaffirms that there is sufficient evidence for listing EPTC on the EPCRA section 313 list pursuant to EPCRA section
313(d)(2)(B) based on the available neurological, cardiovascular, and reproductive toxicity data for this chemical.
Therefore, EPA is finalizing the addition of EPTC on the EPCRA section 313 list.

3&hyph;month dog study cited in the proposed rule ``was [a] non substance-related, incidental finding since 12/24&hyph;months
chronic treatment produced no comparable pathogenesis'' and that ``liver and kidney were not the target organs in
dogs; effects were confined to reduced body weight gains at the highest concentration (75 ppm).'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA disagrees with the commenters. The dietary levels of fenoxaprop-ethyl in the studies compared by the commenter
were 0, 16, 80, and 400 ppm and 0, 3, 15, and 75 ppm for the 3&hyph;month and 24&hyph;month studies, respectively; both
studies are cited in the proposed rule. The microscopic findings in the 3&hyph;month study indicated that there was
a dose response for chronic interstitial nephritis with inflammatory changes in the medulla and inner cortex. One
half of the dogs were affected at 400 ppm, which is much higher than the highest dietary level in the 24&hyph;month study
(75 ppm). Therefore, the inflammatory changes in the kidneys of treated dogs at 80 and 400 ppm in the 3&hyph;month study
appear to be related to the ingestion of fenoxaprop-ethyl and, therefore, the kidney appears to be a target organ.
The Agency did not cite liver effects in dogs as a basis for listing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA reaffirms that there is sufficient evidence for listing fenoxaprop-ethyl on the EPCRA section 313 list pursuant
to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available renal and developmental toxicity data for this chemical, and
pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the available environmental toxicity data. Therefore, EPA is finalizing

list because they believe that the adverse hepatic effects observed in mice and rats (3-month dietary study and 2-year
oncogenicity study, both cited in the proposed rule) are not sufficiently serious to support listing. They note that
no evidence of neoplastic lesions was reported in the chronic studies. They further state that delayed pinna unfolding
in the reproductive toxicity study in rats cited in the proposed rule is a reflection of slower growth only, and therefore
should not be used to support listing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency disagrees that the evidence does not support a finding that section 313(d)(2)(B) are satisfied. The effects
in the chronic studies include focal necrosis, changes which are considered by the Agency to be serious and potentially
irreversible in nature. The liver effects in the subchronic study demonstrate the progression of changes leading
to necrosis in the chronic study. The Agency considers these to be serious adverse effects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The developmental effects (slight delays in pinna unfolding) were said by the commenter not to reflect developmental
effects since development was complete and function apparently unaffected, and that these effects were considered
a reflection of slower growth (reduced body weights) as were the differences in relative organ weights. The Agency
considers reduced rat pup body weight and slower growth with resulting differences in organ weight to be effects that
are indicators of potential hazard. The Agency's

 (Ref. 6) state ``A change in offspring body weight is a sensitive indicator of developmental toxicity, in part because
it is a continuous variable. In some cases, offspring weight reduction may be the only indicator of developmental
toxicity. While there is always a question as to whether weight reduction is a permanent or transitory effect, little
is known about the long-term consequences of short-term fetal or neonatal weight changes. Therefore, when significant
weight reduction effects are noted, they are used as a basis to establish the NOAEL.'' EPA, therefore, considers evidence
of delayed development, including delayed pinna unfolding and reduced body weight gain, to be significant signs
of developmental toxicity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA reaffirms that there is sufficient evidence for listing fenoxycarb on the EPCRA section 313 list pursuant to EPCRA

Zeneca Incorporated did not provide any new evidence which supports the lack of relevance of these effects to man.
In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the Agency believes that liver toxicity, which is associated with peroxisome
proliferation is relevant to the assessment of potential human health effects. As there is evidence of hepatic toxicity
in three different rat studies at varying dosages and durations and one dog study, EPA reaffirms that there is sufficient
evidence for listing fomesafen on the EPCRA section 313 list pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available

and 80 mg/kg/day dose levels, while also present at the 20 mg/kg/day dose level (lowest dose tested), were not statistically
significant and therefore a NOEL was clearly established at this dose. The commenter also contends that non-neoplastic
lesions of the stomach in rats are not relevant to humans. The Agency agrees with the commenter that the increases in
nonneoplastic changes reported at 20 mg/kg/day were not statistically significant. However, the lack of a study
NOEL was based upon decreased body-weight gain in males at 20 mg/kg/day (the lowest dose tested), not the nonneoplastic
lesions. The non-neoplastic lesions reported at 40 and 80 mg/kg/day are still considered serious enough to support
a listing on the EPCRA section 313 list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The same commenter states that the simple findings of increased liver-to-body weight ratio found in the subchronic
oral toxicity study in rats cited in the proposed rule as well as the incidence of non-neoplastic stomach irritation
found in the chronic toxicity/carcinogenicity study cited in the proposed rule in rats is not of sufficient seriousness
to warrant EPCRA section 313 listing. The commenter claims that neither study cited demonstrates a sufficiently
known or reasonably anticipated adverse health effect in humans to warrant section 313 listing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA disagrees. The commenter provides no basis for the contention that the nonneoplastic lesions of the stomach in
rats are not relevant to humans. The incidence of these lesions was dose dependent, and was apparent at both sacrifices.
Moreover, incidence increased with duration of treatment. The Agency considers this effect to be serious in nature
and not readily reversible, and therefore the chemical warrants listing. The liver-to-body weight ratio from the
subchronic study is not in itself sufficient to warrant listing on the EPCRA section 313 list but is provided as corroborating

contends that there is no evidence that lithium carbonate is ``known to cause or can reasonably be anticipated to cause
significant adverse acute human health effects at concentration levels that are reasonably likely to exist beyond

that there is no basis for the listing of lithium carbonate on the EPCRA section 313 list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is not proposing to list lithium carbonate on the basis of acute effects but on the basis of developmental

levels and can cause life-threatening cardiac abnormalities in the developing human fetus. The commenter argues
that lithium is toxic at therapeutic levels but not at naturally ``occurring levels.'' The Agency agrees that lithium
may be toxic at therapeutic levels but also recognizes that use of lithium in a therapeutic setting is carefully controlled.
Levels observed in a therapeutic setting may have little or no relationship to levels seen in an uncontrolled release
setting. Furthermore, both the efficacy of lithium and its associated toxicity in humans is dependent upon individual
sensitivity and can vary widely from individual to individual making uncontrolled release even more problematic.
EPA reaffirms that there is sufficient evidence to list lithium carbonate under EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA
section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available developmental toxicity data for this chemical. Therefore, EPA is finalizing
the addition of lithium carbonate on the EPCRA section 313 list. 33.

. Buckman Laboratories International, Incorporated and Zeneca Incorporated state that the developmental toxicity

that have been accepted by the Agency, and that only the new studies should be considered for listing of metam sodium.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The two earlier studies referred to by the commenters and cited in the proposed rule were submitted to the Agency under
FIFRA. EPA's evaluation of those studies for purposes of FIFRA indicated that they did not fully satisfy the guidelines
for developmental toxicity studies (Ref. 6); however, EPA did not reject these studies. EPA considers them sufficient
as part of a weight-of-evidence evaluation, in determining the developmental toxicity of this chemical. The two
new studies cited by the commenter have been reviewed by the Agency. The Agency found these studies to fully satisfy
the guidelines (Ref. 6). However, these new studies do not supersede the previous studies nor did the Agency ignore
them. Rather, all four studies were used together as part of the Agency's weight-of-evidence to evaluate the chemical.
EPA does not ignore indications of potential toxicity simply because of study design flaws. A full discussion of these
studies is contained in the

Zeneca Incorporated further stated that the rat teratology study was a gavage study and not a dietary study. The commenter
claims that this is an unrealistic route of human exposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter is correct in stating that the rat teratology study was a gavage study and not a dietary study. This does
not diminish its appropriateness for consideration in the hazard assessment for listing. In fact, EPA requests that
developmental toxicity studies be conducted by gavage, because this route allows for a more accurate assessment
of the dose the animal actually receives.

. IBM, American Automobile Manufacturers Association, and N-Methylpyrrolidone Producers Group object to the listing
of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) on the EPCRA section 313 list. NMP Producers Group contends that the 2-generation
reproductive study and the rabbit gavage developmental study cited in the proposed rule are flawed. NMP Producers
Group further contends that the author of the 2-generation rat reproductive study and an independent reviewer have
reached similar conclusions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In reviewing the material submitted by the commenter, EPA failed to find a statement from the author that the study
was flawed. The review of the 2-generation rat reproductive study by an independent reviewer did not find fault with
the entire study but stated that it should not be used for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 purposes. EPA agrees with this judgement but is not using this study for risk assessment purposes but rather as an indication
of human health hazard. The Agency believes that the adverse effects seen in these studies are of sufficient seriousness
to warrant listing under EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B). NMP Producers Group also states that when the 2-generation
reproductive study is evaluated taking into account the genetic fertility problem in the strain of male rats, the
study establishes a NOAEL of 160 mg/kg rather than the NOAEL of 50 mg/kg cited in the proposed rule. The commenters also
believe the study should not be considered because the variability in male fertility was not dose-dependent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA does not agree that the NOAEL should be adjusted for the fertility problem of the strain of male rats used in the study.
During the first mating on which EPA based its concern level (F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2a
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) the high-dose male group exhibited a 24 percent reduction in the mating index. In addition, there was a statistically
significant, dose-related reduction in the male fertility index; thus, the index was 93.1, 72.4, 72.4, and 46.7 in
the control, low-, mid-, and high-dose groups, respectively. The control value in this study is 93.1 percent, well
within acceptable limits for any reproductive effects study and as seen the reduction in mating index is dose-related
being 72.4 percent in the low- and mid-dose groups and 46.7 percent in the high-dose group. With a control value of 93.1
percent and using the concurrent controls as an index of mating performance for the males in this study, the Agency
feels that there is no reason to adjust the NOAEL of 50 mg/kg to account for reduced fertility in the test animals. During
the second mating (F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2b
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the male high-dose group exhibited a 31 percent reduction in the mating index, and again, there was a statistically
significant, dose-related reduction in the male fertility index (83.3, 69.0, 60.0, and 34.5 in the control, low-,
mid-, and high-dose groups, respectively). The female high-dose group exhibited a 28 percent reduction in the fertility
index, and again, there was a statistically significant, dose-related reduction in the fecundity index (92.6, 74.1,
64.3, and 50.0 in the control, low-, mid-, and high-dose groups, respectively). Again, the Agency does not feel that
a control value of 83.3 percent fertility index in the control animals is abnormal and is more concerned with the dose-related
decrease in fertility as an indication that NMP is a reproductive toxicant. EPA is also concerned with the decrease
in fecundity index in the females and does not feel that the control value of 92.6 percent warrants any adjustment of
NOAEL for reduced fertility or mating ability among males in the study. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency also disagrees with NMP Producers Group's contention that decreases in male fertility observed are not
dose dependent. The data presented above clearly show a correlation between dose and decreased fertility. NMP Producers
Group claims that the effects of NMP administration manifested only in the second generation of animals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA disagrees and believes that effects were manifested in the first generation. There was a reduction in fertility
in the F1 generation, histological evidence of reproductive effects including hypospermia and significant systemic
toxicity in the F1 generation. In addition, EPA does not believe that it is unusual to see increased severity in the
second generation since animals have either been treated for 2 generations or are the offspring of treated animals
and cumulative effects or effects on the reproductive system of the first generation animals may manifest in the second
generation. NMP Producers Group further believes that NMP is not a developmental hazard because EPA's conclusion
is based on observations from what the commenter claims is a flawed reproductive study. The commenter adds that a considerable
body of evidence supports the conclusion that NMP is not uniquely toxic to a developing fetus. EPA's conclusions about
the developmental toxicity of NMP are based upon a rabbit gavage study and the developmental portion of the 2-generation
reproductive study referred to above and cited in the proposed rule. The rabbit gavage study showed a significant
increase in resorptions and malformations (misshapen skull bone and cardiovascular malformations). The LOAEL
for developmental toxicity in this study was 540 mg/kg and the NOAEL was 175 mg/kg. The developmental portion of the
2-generation reproductive effects study showed evidence of developmental toxicity in both generations after exposure
to 500 mg/kg as demonstrated by reduced litter size, reduced postnatal survival, and reduced pup body weight. The
Agency believes that despite the flaws in the study, the data described above clearly show evidence of developmental
toxicity. In addition, EPA believes that the body of evidence supports the finding that NMP is uniquely toxic to the
developing fetus and the information available to the Agency both from the rat developmental study and rabbit gavage
study is sufficient to list NMP on the EPCRA section 313 list.

Molinate
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Zeneca Incorporated contends that the observations attributed to the 35 mg/kg/day dose level in the rat developmental
toxicity study ``in fact occurred at 140 mg/kg/day, the highest dose tested and were thus a consequence of maternal
toxicity.'' The commenter states that the NOEL for that study was 35 mg/kg/day. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency does not agree that the NOEL for this study was 35 mg/kg/day. The NOEL for developmental toxicity was 2.2
mg/kg/day based on an increase in runting at the next highest doses, 35 and 140 mg/kg/day. The other adverse effects
listed in the comments for this study occurred only at the highest dose tested (140 mg/kg/day). The NOEL for maternal
toxicity was 35 mg/kg/day and that the effects on the pups (runting) occurred at a dose level lower than the dose level
found to be maternally toxic. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The same commenter stated that the issue of whether molinate is a reproductive toxin on the basis of its adverse effect
on fertility in rodents has been very extensively investigated with studies in rabbits, dogs, monkeys, and man, and
these studies have shown ``conclusively that the effects seen in rodents is [sic] not relevant to man.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While EPA agrees that there has been extensive testing of molinate with respect to fertility, the data on the rabbit
and dog do not support the commenter's contention that the effects seen in rodents are specific only to rodents. For
example, in each of the fertility studies in rabbits, both an increase in pre-implantation loss and abnormal sperm
were observed. These two consistent [reproducible] observations are suggestive of fertility effects, are two of
the same observations found in rats and, although not as dramatic as observed in rats, cannot be negated. In the chronic
dog study, lesions in male reproduction organs and effects on sperm were observed, which demonstrate that, at least
in the males, the gonads are target organs for molinate. The lack of any effect on the limited parameters assessed in
the male monkey studies lends little credence to the argument since only male monkeys were exposed to molinate, and
no reproduction studies have been performed to assess reproductive performance. Since molinate is reaching the
gonads in all species, not only in rodents as the commenter claims, molinate can reasonably be anticipated to cause
fertility/reproductive effects in humans. Further, animals are accepted as surrogates for toxicity testing to
predict potential hazard to humans, except in a few rare cases where effects have been determined to be species-specific
[e.g.,

-globulin]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The same commenter further contends that a NOEL of 2 mg/kg/day was established in the rat 2&hyph;year study, and that
this study should not be used to evaluate the neurotoxicity of molinate because the study was not designed to evaluate
that effect. Rather, the commenter contends that the ``definitive position on neurotoxicity has been determined
by specific [neurotoxicity] studies.'' Zeneca Incorporated did not provide a reference for these ``specific studies.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA agrees that the NOEL for effects other than neurotoxic effects is 2 mg/kg/day in the chronic rat study. No NOEL for
neurotoxic effects was established in that study. The LOEL for neurotoxicity in this study is 0.35 mg/kg/day. Although
this study was not specifically designed to evaluate the neurotoxic effects of molinate, adverse neurological effects
were reported. Further, they were substantiated by the findings from a 1&hyph;year study in dogs. The same commenter
stated that the effects observed in the dog study were found at the highest dose administered for 1&hyph;year and were
``largely a consequence of extended exposure'' and as such should not form a part of the EPCRA listing. The commenter
implies that because this is a chronic adverse effect, the effect is not relevant to the EPCRA section 313 criteria.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As specified in section 313(d)(2)(B), a chemical may be listed if it causes chronic toxicity. Thus, the comment is
not relevant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA reaffirms that there is sufficient evidence for listing molinate on the EPCRA section 313 list pursuant to EPCRA
section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available developmental, reproductive, and neurological toxicity data for this

Nitrate compounds (proposed as nitrate ion)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. American Automobile Manufacturers Association, Merck, and the Department of Energy disagree with EPA's proposal
to list nitrate ion because an ion is not a chemical. Merck further states that nitrate ion ``exists only in aqueous
media.'' The Chevron Companies, the Department of Energy, Chemical Manufacturers Association, and Air Products
and Chemicals, Incorporated contend that in proposing to add nitrate ion to EPCRA section 313 the Agency actually
proposed to add a category of chemicals that dissociate to generate nitrate ion. EPA agrees with the commenters that
an ion does not meet the definition of a chemical for purposes of listing on the EPCRA section 313 list and that by proposing
nitrate ion the Agency had, in effect, proposed the addition of a category of nitrate compounds that dissociate in
water that are reportable only when in aqueous solution. Thus based on the comments provided by the commenters, the
Agency is finalizing the addition of the following category: water dissociable nitrate compounds (reportable only
when in aqueous solution). Qualifiers of this sort have been used to define the form of a chemical for which reports
should be submitted, e.g., zinc (fume or dust). The qualifier following this listing indicates that only water dissociable
nitrate compounds that are manufactured, processed, or otherwise used as an aqueous solution at a facility are subject
to reporting. As with all other aspects of EPCRA section 313 reporting, only the weight of the listed chemical is subject
to threshold determinations. That determination does not include, for example the weight of the water or any other
constituent in the solution other than the nitrate compound. Beyond the threshold determination, the amounts reportable
on Form R should only include the mass of the nitrate portion of the compound in solution. This approach is consistent
with guidance given for determining threshold and release amounts for metal compounds. EPA recognizes that most
monitoring data available measure only the dissociated nitrate ion released and not the amount of total nitrate compounds
from which the nitrate ion dissociated. Reporting of the amount of the total water dissociable nitrate compound in
wastes would be complicated when more than one substance contributes to the nitrate ion content of the waste and when
the nitrate compound is converted to a different substance due to waste treatment or other processes. It is therefore
reasonable to require reporting of only the nitrate ion released in order to avoid confusion over the meaning of total
compound released. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPCRA section 313 requires threshold determinations for chemical categories to be based on the total of all chemicals
in the category manufactured, processed, or otherwise used. For example, a facility that manufactures three members
of a chemical category would count the total amount of all three chemicals manufactured towards the manufacturing
threshold for that category. One report is filed for the category and all releases are reported on this form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the proposed rule, EPA discussed both the human health and environmental adverse effects attributable to nitrates.
EPA continues to be concerned about the potential environmental impacts of nitrates. In today's action, EPA is adding
nitrate compounds based on the adverse human health effects that the nitrate moiety causes. Nitrate causes methemoglobinemia.
Methemoglobinemia, like carbon monoxide, interferes with the oxygenating capacity of the blood resulting in an
under supply of oxygen to the tissues. In adults, cyanosis to lips and mucous membranes occurs at a level of 1.5 g/dL
(10 percent saturation in an adult with normal hemoglobin levels). Levels between 30 percent and 50 percent saturation
in adults produce depression of the cardiovascular and central nervous systems; levels between 50 percent and 70
percent cause stupor, convulsions and respiratory depression and levels above 70 percent are usually fatal. Because
of increased requirement for oxygen in growing tissue and because of decreased blood volume in infants, they are much
more sensitive to nitrate ion toxicity than adults. Infants have a lower activity of methemoglobin reductase and
thus are more susceptible. Consequently adverse effects are seen at much lower levels in infants than in adults. Irreversible
damage to organs such as the heart or brain, and the development of coronary artery disease or pulmonary disease are
more likely to develop in infants because the anoxia caused by methemoglobinemia can occur more rapidly and have more
devastating effects in growing tissue than in the ``static'' tissue of the adult body. EPA believes that these are
serious adverse effects that satisfy the criteria of EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B).

EPA agrees with the commenters that there are many complex issues associated with the extensive collection of data
on these chemicals under the Clean Air Act. Therefore, EPA is deferring the listing of these chemicals for possible
addition at a later time to address some of the issues involving the availability of data collected under the CAA. The
Agency does not believe, however, that the listing of ozone should also be deferred. Emissions of ozone, also a criteria
pollutant, are not captured under the CAA. The CAA mandates the collection of data on the releases of VOCs (VOCs react
in the troposphere to generate ozone and other air pollutants), which are regulated to maintain the ambient air quality
standard for ozone. EPA believes there are many other significant uses of ozone (e.g., wastewater treatment, bottled
water purification, and chemical intermediate) that would be captured by EPCRA section 313 reporting. Accordingly,
EPA does not believe that the finalization of ozone should be deferred. EPA reaffirms that ozone meets the EPCRA section
313(d)(2) criteria pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) and 313(d)(2)(C) based on the available toxicity data

. Zeneca Incorporated comments that the neurological effects noted in the 1&hyph;year feeding study in dogs cited
in the proposed rule occurred at the highest dose level (100 mg/kg/day), which was, by design, a toxic dose. Thus, the
commenter claims that there is no reasonable hazard. The Agency disagrees. Although the highest dose tested is designed
to elicit toxicity in the dogs, the presence of Wallerian type degeneration of the white matter of the spinal cord at
the 100 mg/kg/day dose level in dogs of both sexes is of considerable seriousness and cannot be dismissed only because
it occurred at the highest dose tested. Although the dose eliciting degeneration of the spinal cord was the highest
dose tested, 100 mg/kg/day, these adverse effects are of sufficient seriousness to warrant listing based upon the
potential for similar effects in humans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this study, the NOEL for the Wallerian type neurological lesions is 50 mg/kg/day. However, the NOEL in males is less
than 5 mg/kg/day (LOEL based on findings of abnormal behavior, ataxia, severe convulsions, and congestion in both
kidneys in one dog). In females, the NOEL was 5 mg/kg/day and the LOEL was 25 mg/kg/day with occurrence of blood in feces,
increased absolute and relative liver weight, increase in severity of lipofuscin deposition in kidneys, and hemosiderin
deposition in liver and spleen.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA does not agree that the incidence of liver weight increase is not a significant effect, or that there were no changes
in liver weight relative to body weight. The liver weights, relative to bodyweight, were increased in all treated
groups in the 2&hyph;year rat study. EPA believes that the hepatic changes noted in these studies represent a significant
adverse effect.

The same commenter contends that in the 2-year rat study cited in the proposed rule, ``the NOEL is also incorrectly
stated as 5 mg/kg/day, where EPA states a LOEL of 100 mg/kg/day.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency disagrees with the commenter. The NOEL and LOEL should be 5 and 100 mg/kg/day, respectively. At 100 mg/kg/day
there was an increase in alkaline phosphatase, liver weight and cellular swelling of the liver (indicative of typical
smooth endoplasmic reticulum proliferation), and one male in the low dose group was affected, focal inflammation
with degenerative change in the zona fasciculate and swelling and vacuolation ofcells in the zona reticularis of
the adrenals and reduced body weight in females. EPA considers these to be serious adverse effects.

believes that, rather than name the category based on one of the feedstocks used to make these compounds, a more appropriate
name for the category is one that describes the actual members of the category. Therefore, because the members of this
category are alkanes containing three or more chlorines, EPA is renaming this category polychlorinated alkanes.
The new category name will not expand the scope of the category. EPA believes that the toxicity data for chlorinated

Some of the commenters contend that only the data on short-chain chlorinated paraffins are sufficient to justify
a listing on the EPCRA section 313 list and that EPA should limit the category to just the short-chain species.

Long-chain chlorinated paraffins
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. IARC has not classified the long-chain chlorinated paraffins because there is insufficient evidence that they
cause cancer in treated animals. The NTP found no evidence of cancer in male rats treated with 1,875 or 3,750 mg/kg/day
for 24 months with long-chain chlorinated paraffins. Female rats treated with 900 mg/kg/day showed marginal increases
in adrenal gland tumors; female rats treated with 5,000 mg/kg/day had marginal increases in liver tumors. The only
significant increase in tumor formation occurred in male mice which had a significant increase in malignant lymphomas.
After further evaluation of the available data and considering the available statistics, the high background rate
of lymphoma in the strain of mice used in the NTP bioassay and the statements made by the NTP Working Group and the Quality
Assessment Narrative, which was submitted by the commenters, EPA agrees that there is insufficient evidence to conclude
that the malignant lymphomas observed in male mice were treatment related and that long-chain chlorinated paraffins
should not be classified as potential carcinogens. Therefore, the Agency concludes that there is insufficient evidence
to list long-chain chlorinated paraffins on the EPCRA section 313 list.

 (Ref. 14). Summaries of the responses to the most significant comments concerning flaws in the studies used to support
the listing of the short-chain species are provided below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The Agency agrees that the kidney tumors observed in rats are most likely not relevant to tumor formation in man
because the male rat kidney possess a unique protein,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-globulin which has been shown to be responsible for the development of rat liver kidney tumors, not only after administration
of short-chain chlorinated paraffins but after administration of many other chemicals also. However, to state that
chlorinated paraffins bind to a protein which is similar to

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-globulin and that this binding is not seen in guinea pigs as evidence that kidney tumor formation is not relevant to
human tumor formation in this instance is not a convincing argument. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Agency agrees that forced gavage feeding may not be a relevant route of administration when one is using the
data for human risk assessment. In this instance, the data are being used as an indication of potential human hazard
and EPA accepts the data as being indicative of such potential. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) EPA believes that corn oil is an accepted vehicle of administration for many 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 studies because it is relatively inert and has not been shown to interact with test agents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The B6C3F1 mouse is the accepted test species of the NTP and EPA has no reason to question the NTPs choice of test species
nor to discount results of cancer bioassays using this species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) EPA does not believe that non-genotoxicity is a sufficient reason to dismiss the relevance to man of tumor formation
by the short-chain chlorinated paraffins. Non-genotoxicity may be a factor in selecting a model to use for dose response
estimation, once tumor formation has been established, but it is not a reason to disregard the significance of tumors
which are formed by agents which are non-genotoxic in short-term tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The Agency is not convinced that failure to observe liver growth, peroxisome proliferation in hepatocytes and
stimulation of replicative DNA in guinea pigs is proof that these effects are specific to rats and mice and have no bearing
on tumor formation in humans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) The Agency agrees that there was a perturbation of thyroxine levels in treated animals but does not agree that the
observed tumors are therefore irrelevant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Agency finds that there is sufficient evidence for listing short-chain chlorinated paraffins on
the EPCRA section 313 list pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available carcinogenicity data for
these chemicals.

Ecotoxicity data
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Courtaulds Aerospace, Occidental Chemical Corporation, and the American Automobile Manufactures Association
contend that ecotoxicity data are only available for the short-chain (10 to 13 carbons, 59 percent chlorine) chlorinated
paraffins. The commenters object to EPA assuming the same ecotoxicity for all members of the chlorinated paraffin
category because of the potential difference in effects related to chain length and chlorine content. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although it was stated as such in the proposed rule, EPA did not intend to equate the ecotoxicity of the short-chain
chlorinated paraffins with the ecotoxicity of other members of the category. The ecotoxicity data on the short-chain
chemicals was provided as further support for the listing of the short-chain chemicals. However, as EPA is not finalizing
the addition of the long-chained species, this issue is no longer relevant.

there are no data that indicate that having two of the chlorines at carbons 1 and 2 is significant from a toxicity standpoint.
The commenters do not substantiate their claim (mass spectral data submitted by one commenter is inconclusive and
cannot be used in support, for or against, the commenter's position); EPA is not aware of experimental evidence that

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

structural extremes within the chlorinated

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A valid comparison of physical property data can only be made between two discreet substances of known purity or, in
some cases, between two mixtures of chemicals with well defined compositions. EPA believes that an 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

a
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-olefin and a paraffin, both with the same chain length and both with the same degree of chlorination, are essentially
identical structurally (especially if the degree of chlorination is high); the same isomers can be predicted for
the chlorination of an 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

a
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-olefins and the corresponding chlorinated paraffins are therefore expected to be very similar. The differences
in the chemical and physical properties that the commenters refer to are largely or completely due to the fact that
the chlorinated paraffins are mixtures of different chain lengths while the chlorinated

EPCRA section 313 requires threshold determinations for chemical categories to be based on the total of all chemicals

Polycyclic aromatic compounds
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In the proposed rule, EPA proposed the addition of a delineated polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAC) category that
consisted of 28 polycyclic aromatic compounds. Alternatively, EPA proposed the addition of a PAC category based
on the following broad definition: ``includes all chemical species from the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, aza-polycyclic,
thio-polycyclic, or nitroarene families where polycyclic means three or more fused rings. More specifically, it
means any combination of three or more fused six or five membered hydrocarbon rings with at least two or more rings being
aromatic. The structure may contain fused non-aromatic 5-membered rings, a ring nitrogen, a ring sulfur, one or more
attached nitro groups, or one or more attached alkyl groups'' (January 12, 1994, 59 FR 1832). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Monsanto, The Chevron Companies, Amoco Corporation, Armco Steel Company, Mobil Oil Corporation, UNOCAL, Pennzoil,
Phillips Petroleum Company, American Petroleum Institute, and the Department of Energy object to listing polycyclic
aromatic compounds as a category and recommend that EPA list them separately as individual chemicals. American Coke
and Coal Chemicals Institute and Mobil Oil Corporation state that if the chemicals are not individually listed then
the proposed delineated category should be used. Koch Industries Incorporated, Texaco Incorporated, and the Wisconsin
Department of Natural Resources object to the alternative proposal for a PAC category with the broad definition and
recommend that EPA implement the delineated category approach. The Natural Resources Defense Council recommends
that EPA use the broad category definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that polycyclic aromatic compounds should be listed as a delineated category rather than listed individually
or defined under the broad category definition. Most if not all of the polycyclic aromatic compounds included in the
category are not intentionally manufactured, they are byproducts and impurities from various industrial processes.
As such, they occur as complex mixtures that are typically released or transferred together. EPA believes that for
this class of compounds a category listing is the most appropriate way to track releases and transfers under EPCRA
section 313 because members of this category are structurally similar and induce a similar toxic effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The American Petroleum Institute, Mobil Oil Corporation, American Coke and Coal Chemicals Institute, Koch Industries
Incorporated, Monsanto, The Chevron Companies, and Amoco Corporation state that analytical methodologies do exist
to identify specific chemicals such as those proposed for the delimited PAC category; however, these analytical
methodologies require a chemical-by-chemical analysis. They add that since a chemical-by-chemical analysis is
required, there would be no reduction in the reporting burden for either a category based on the broad definition or
for the proposed delimited category. EPA proposed the broad category definition approach as a possible way to reduce
the reporting burden for a PAC category. However, the majority of the industries that would have to report do not agree
that this will result in a reduction of their reporting burden, they believe that it will cause confusion over what
chemicals are covered by this category, and do not believe that analytical methodologies exist to identify all of
the thousands of chemicals that would be covered by a PAC category based on the alternative broad definition. EPA is
therefore not finalizing the alternative proposal to create a PAC category based on the broad definition but is finalizing
the proposed delimited PAC category as explained above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that although it may be necessary to perform a chemical- by-chemical analysis for members of this delimited
category, the most appropriate way to track releases and transfers under EPCRA section 313 is by creating this category
as explained above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Chevron Companies, Amoco Corporation, Mobil Oil, UNOCAL, Pennzoil, and the American Petroleum Institute state
that polycyclic aromatic compounds share some physical and chemical properties but that this does not necessarily
imply similar toxicities. These commenters state that the toxicity potentials vary widely among the polycyclic
aromatic compounds but that the public tends to associate all members of a category with the most toxic chemical in
the category. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA recognizes that similarities in physical and chemical properties do not necessarily indicate that the ability
to induce carcinogenic effect among the members of the polycyclic aromatic compounds category are identical. However,
these compounds are chemically similar, induce the same toxicological effect (carcinogenicity), and typically
are produced, released, and transferred as complex mixtures rather than individual chemicals. EPA therefore believes
that it is appropriate to consider these compounds as a category. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mobil Oil Corporation contends that 11 of the PACs proposed for listing have been reviewed by IARC and found to have
insufficient data in animals and no data in humans making the overall evaluation IARC-3 or inadequate evidence of
carcinogenicity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 11 chemicals the commenter cites as being classified by IARC as a group 3 chemical, i.e., the chemical is not classifiable
as to its carcinogenicity, are: carbazole (CAS No. 86&hyph;74&hyph;8); cyclopenta(cd)pyrene (CAS No. 27208&hyph;37&hyph;3);
dibenz(a,c)anthracene (CAS No. 215&hyph;58&hyph;7); dibenz(a,j)anthracene (CAS No. 224&hyph;41&hyph;9);
dibenzo(a,e)fluoranthene (CAS No. 5385&hyph;75&hyph;1); 2-methylchrysene (CAS No. 3351&hyph;32&hyph;4);
3-methylchrysene (CAS No. 3351&hyph;31&hyph;3); 4-methylchrysene (CAS No. 3351&hyph;30&hyph;2); 6-methylchrysene
(CAS No. 1705&hyph;85&hyph;7); 2-methylfluoranthene (CAS No. 33543&hyph;31&hyph;6); and 1-nitropyrene (CAS
No. 5522&hyph;43&hyph;0). The commenter is correct in that 10 of these 11 compounds have been classified as IARC group
3 chemicals. The 11th compound, 1-nitropyrene (CAS No. 5522&hyph;43&hyph;0), was classified by IARC as a Group 2B
chemical, i.e., a possible human carcinogen. The IARC classification and a review of the data indicate that the data
is sufficient to support the listing of this chemical on the EPCRA section 313 list pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B).
A second compound, dibenzo(a,e)fluoranthene (CAS No. 5385&hyph;75&hyph;1) was classified by EPA as a B2 category
chemical, the chemical is a probable human carcinogen, which justifies its addition to EPCRA section 313 pursuant
to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B). Upon further review of the other 9 IARC group C chemicals, the Agency believes that
a more detailed review of their relationship to the 19 PACs for which cancer data is available and is sufficient is necessary
before they can be placed on the list on the basis of structure alone. Therefore, EPA will not add these 9 chemicals to
the EPCRA section 313 list at this time and the delineated category will consist of the other 19 chemicals proposed
for this category. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPCRA section 313 requires threshold determinations for chemical categories to be based on the total of all chemicals
in the category manufactured, processed, or otherwise used. For example, a facility that manufactures three members
of a chemical category would count the total amount of all three chemicals manufactured towards the manufacturing
threshold for that category. One report is filed for the category and all releases are reported on this form.

Potassium dimethyldithiocarbamate

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Buckman Laboratories International, Incorporated states that the proposed listing of the chemical was based on
the results of the rat and rabbit teratology studies, cited in the proposed rule, although neither study demonstrates
evidence of developmental toxicity. They contend that the findings in the developmental studies should be considered
an artifact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The findings in rabbits cannot be considered artifacts because there is a dose-related increase in the severity of
developmental effects at 38 and 77 mg/kg. At 38 mg/kg, developmental toxicity was characterized by increased post
implantation loss, malformations, and sternebral malalignments. At 77 mg/kg, there were reports of severe fetal
and embryo lethality. EPA did not cite a rat study in the proposed rule as the commenter claims. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA reaffirms that there is sufficient evidence for listing potassium dimethyldithiocarbamate on the EPCRA section
313 list pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available neurological toxicity data for this chemical.
Therefore, EPA is finalizing the addition of potassium dimethyldithiocarbamate on the EPCRA section 313 list.

only in the 2-year dog study cited in the proposed rule. The commenter further claims that although minor liver effects
were seen in rats in the 28&hyph;day study cited in the proposed rule, there were no liver effects in rats after 90 days
at dose levels up to 5,000 ppm. This 90&hyph;day study that the commenter cited was not cited by EPA in the proposed rule.
Thus, the commenter does not believe that the data support the addition of this chemical to the EPCRA section 313 list.
EPA disagrees with the commenter. In the 2&hyph;year dog feeding study, prometryn induced degenerative changes
in liver and kidney and bone marrow atrophy at 37.5 mg/kg/day (LOEL, the NOEL is 3.75 mg/kg/day). Although the dose
eliciting degenerative changes in liver and kidney and bone marrow atrophy was the highest dose tested, these adverse
effects are of sufficient seriousness to warrant listing based upon the potential for similar effects in humans.
Further, the findings of the 2&hyph;year dog study and the 28&hyph;day rat study, cannot be discounted based solely
on of the results of the 90&hyph;day study referred to by the commenter. Rather EPA has considered all of the data in
concluding that prometryn meets the criteria for addition to the EPCRA section 313 list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter questions the use of the rabbit developmental toxicity study because only a slight effect (if real)
was noted at the highest dose tested, and was not statistically significant. Although the use of the rabbit developmental
toxicity study may not be justified, and the potential for developmental effects therefore not supported, EPA reaffirms
that there is sufficient evidence for listing prometryn on the EPCRA section 313 list pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B)
based on available hepatic, renal, and bone marrow toxicity data. Therefore, EPA is finalizing the addition of prometryn
on the EPCRA section 313 list.

Propachlor
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Monsanto contends that the developmental toxicity study in rabbits cited in the proposed rule was a study that was
rejected by the Agency. Monsanto further stated that in this study ``a slight decrease in viable fetuses, slight increase
in post-implantation loss, and slight decrease in mean fetal weight was noted at the highest dose tested (116.7 mg/kg/day)
which caused severe treatment-related maternal toxicity including death. An equivocal increase in post-implantation
loss on a percent basis was noted in the mid-dose (58.3 mg/kg/day) level. Marginal developmental effects that were
seen were not statistically significant and were within the historical control limits. Propachlor does not produce
any observable maternal or fetal toxicity at 5.8 or 58.3 mg/kg/day. In addition, propachlor does not cause developmental
toxicity in rats.'' Monsanto concluded that, based on the ``weight of evidence from the rat and rabbit studies, there
does not appear to be any developmental risk to humans.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The Agency does not concur with the commenter's statement that ``propachlor does not produce any observable maternal
or fetal toxicity at 5.8 or 58.3 mg/kg/day dose levels,'' nor with the statement that ``the marginal developmental
effects that were seen were .... within the historical control limits.'' The Agency's rationale for the disagreements
are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a developmental toxicity study in rabbits, oral administration of propachlor at 116.7 mg/kg/day caused maternal
toxicity as evidenced by death, clinical signs [salivation and reduced defecation], decreased body weight gain
and food consumption, and gross pathological lesions of the stomach. Developmental toxicity at 58.3 and 116.7 mg/kg/day
included dose-related increases in the total number of resorptions/litter and post-implantation losses compared
to concurrent and/or historical controls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on these findings, it is apparent that the developmental effects seen at 58.3 and 116.7 mg/kg/day levels are
attributable to propachlor; the NOEL was 5.8 mg/kg/day. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA reaffirms that there is sufficient evidence for listing propachlor on the EPCRA section 313 list pursuant to EPCRA
section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available developmental toxicity data for this chemical. Therefore, EPA is finalizing
the addition of propachlor on the EPCRA section 313 list.

Propargyl alcohol
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. International Specialty Products is opposed to the listing of propargyl alcohol apparently because an uncertainty
factor of 3,000 was used by EPA in setting the RfD. The commenter feels that an uncertainty factor of 100 would have been
more appropriate and cites instances where such an uncertainty factor has been used by IRIS in setting reference doses.
The commenter does not question the renal or hepatotoxicity cited in IRIS as a basis of its concern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter is correct in stating that EPA has used uncertainty factors of 100 for other chemicals. However, that
was not deemed appropriate in this instance for reasons which are set out by EPA in the IRIS data base. EPA continues
to support the listing of propargyl alcohol under EPCRA section 313 on the basis of chronic toxicity which may pose
a significant health hazard as manifested by renal and hepatic effects. The uncertainty factor plays no part in this
decision. EPA reaffirms that there is sufficient evidence for listing propargyl alcohol on the EPCRA section 313
list pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity data for this
chemical. Therefore, EPA is finalizing the addition of propargyl alcohol on the EPCRA section 313 list.

Propiconazole
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Ciba-Geigy Corporation states that the increased incidence of liver tumors in the oncogenicity study on propiconazole
was noted only in male mice in the high dose (2,500 ppm), which exceeded the MTD, based on decreased survival and body
weight gain. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that the study high dose (2,500 ppm, equivalent to 325 mg/kg/day) was excessively toxic; however, the
Agency also determined that the mid dose (500 ppm, equivalent to 65 mg/kg/day) was not considered sufficiently high
to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of propiconazole. The Agency believes that a supplementary study should
be conducted in male mice at doses selected to sufficiently evaluate carcinogenic potential without excessive toxicity.
At this time however, based on the currently available evidence, propiconazole remains classified as a Group C, possible
human carcinogen, with the RfD approach recommended for quantification of human risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter further states that relatively minor gastrointestinal effects were noted in dogs at the high dose only
(250 ppm). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that the data in both the 3-month and 1&hyph;year dog studies demonstrate gastrointestinal effects
at the high-dose (250 ppm, equivalent to 6.25 mg/kg/day). These effects are considered severe, and, therefore, are
of sufficient seriousness to warrant listing propiconazole on the EPCRA section 313 list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA reaffirms that there is sufficient evidence for listing propiconazole on the EPCRA section 313 list pursuant
to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available hepatic and gastrointestinal toxicity data for this chemical.
Therefore, EPA is finalizing the addition of propiconazole on the EPCRA section 313 list.

Simazine

. Ciba-Geigy Corporation objects to the listing of simazine under EPCRA section 313 based on reports of liver, kidney,
testicular and neural pathology in sheep and increases in liver enzymes in a dog 2-year study. The commenter maintains
that the sheep study was conducted to investigate the possible effects that would result if large amounts of simazine
were ingested by this species. The commenter also states that in a 1&hyph;year study there were some indications of
effects on the hematopoietic system but not the hepatic system at the high dose of 1,500 ppm. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a 1&hyph;year study, NOEL and LOELs of 0.68 and 3.41 mg/kg/day, respectively, were established based on decreased
body weight gain, and decreased RBC, HGB, HCT in females. Although the sheep study was conducted for a purpose other
than to investigate the overall toxicity of simazine, this does not negate the relevance of its results. EPA reaffirms
that there is sufficient evidence for listing simazine on the EPCRA section 313 list pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B)
based on the available hepatic, renal, neurological, and reproductive toxicity data for this chemical. Therefore,
EPA is finalizing the addition of simazine on the EPCRA section 313 list.

Sodium nitrite
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. American Automobile Manufacturers Association contends that EPA has proposed listing on the basis of chronic toxicity
but the support document cites studies based on high dose, acute exposures. High dose gestational studies in rats
and mice were also cited as the basis for developmental (fetal) toxicity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA agrees that the human studies cited in the proposed rule are acute studies. However, these studies in conjunction
with the chronic study in mice, which showed reduced motor activity and major EEG changes in treated animals, support
the basis for concern for chronic neurological effects. EPA thus considers sufficient indication of a potential
chronic neurologic hazard to list this chemical on the EPCRA section 313. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There were two developmental studies in mice and one reproductive study in rats cited in the proposed rule which showed
effects on the fetal development whether sodium nitrite was administered during gestation or lactation. The doses
used in the studies with mice, 30 and 80 mg/kg/day, respectively, are not abnormally high for this type of study; the
dose range reported for the rat reproductive study, 26 to 256 mg/kg/day is also not abnormally high. The results from
all three studies indicate that sodium nitrite induces developmental effects in animals and are sufficient to make
a determination that the chemical is a potential health hazard in man. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA reaffirms that there is sufficient evidence for listing sodium nitrite on the EPCRA section 313 list pursuant
to section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the chronic hematological and developmental toxicity data for this chemical. Therefore,
EPA is finalizing the addition of sodium nitrite on the EPCRA section 313 list.

Triallate
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Monsanto contends that the hepatic health effects listed in the proposed rule for triallate are trivial effects
that do not provide sufficient evidence that triallate causes hepatic toxicity. In addition, Monsanto claims that
pregnant rats exhibited abnormal behavioral signs at 90 but not at 30 mg/kg/day. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the Agency agrees that there is not sufficient evidence for hepatotoxic potential of triallate, the Agency
does not concur with the commenter that ``pregnant rats exhibited abnormal behavioral signs at 90 but not at 30 mg/kg/day.''
Head bobbing and circling, clear signs of neurotoxicity, were observed in pregnant females at 30 mg/kg/day. Males
and non-pregnant females did not exhibit these clinical signs. These data suggest that pregnant rats are more susceptible
to the neurologic potential of triallate than the general population. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter noted the existence of a subchronic neurotoxicity study in rats and indicated that this study provides
a better estimation of the neurotoxic potential of triallate than the 2-generation reproduction study. The Agency
agrees that the subchronic neurotoxicity study in rats (Ref. 10) provides a clearer picture of the neurotoxic potential
of triallate. The Agency has reviewed this study and concludes that the results indicate the neurotoxic potential
of triallate and further corroborates the findings cited by EPA in the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, the Agency reaffirms that there is sufficient evidence for listing triallate on the EPCRA section 313 list pursuant
to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available chronic neurotoxicity data for this chemical. Therefore, EPA
is finalizing the addition of triallate on the EPCRA section 313 list.

5-Chloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)phenol

. Ciba-Geigy Corporation and The Dial Corporation contend that insufficient evidence is available to support the
conclusion that 5-chloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)phenol poses a risk of hematological toxicity to humans based
on handling and uses of the product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on these comments and EPA's reanalysis of the data, the Agency has concluded that the information presented
in the proposed rule is not sufficient to justify adding 5-chloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)phenol to the EPCRA section

The Agency agrees with the commenter. Based on these comments and EPA's reanalysis of the data, the Agency has concluded
that the information presented in the proposed rule is not sufficient to justify adding clomazone to the EPCRA section

other chemicals. EPA concedes that the effects cannot be attributed solely to tetrasodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate.
Therefore, the Agency is not finalizing the addition of tetrasodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate on the EPCRA section

Year-to-year comparisons of the TRI data
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. BP America, Texaco, and American Automobile Manufacturers Association contend that the proposed expansion of
the EPCRA section 313 list will eliminate any consistency with earlier TRI data and make tracking environmental progress
impossible. American Automobile Manufacturers Association further states that EPA needs to ensure that the ``total
TRI releases and transfers'' measurement system allows accurate interpretation of the data, allowing the public
to realistically assess progress in pollution prevention. Also, the commenters add that considerable confusion
results in trying to explain the different data sets to the public. Mobil Oil Corporation states that EPA should divide
the list into three sub-groups so that a facility's history can be tracked on a more common basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA recognizes that changes in the EPCRA section 313 list and in the reporting requirements have an effect on the characterization
of the TRI data. In fact, some change has occurred for every reporting year. In an attempt to provide useful year-to-year
comparisons, EPA has presented the TRI data annually on a normalized list of chemicals, i.e., the list of chemicals
used for year-to-year comparisons is the same for every year in the comparison. EPA further recognizes the effect
that expansion of the EPCRA section 313 list will have on the TRI data and will continue to work to find ways to make the
data useable for cross-year comparisons. EPA will use the 1995 reporting year as the base year for comparisons that
include the chemicals added today. Facilities should still be able to track pollution prevention progress for those
chemicals previously listed (using 1988 as the base year) and have a new base year for the additional chemicals which
can be used to track future pollution prevention progress.

Public perceptions
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Roussell Uclaf Corporation, National Paint and Coatings Association, Association of International Automobile
Manufacturers, and American Frozen Food Institute oppose the listing of these chemicals under EPCRA section 313
because of the public's misperception of the associated dangers. American Automobile Manufacturers Association
(AAMA) states that since the public considers all chemicals on the EPCRA section 313 list to be toxic, any chemical
on the list is subject to adverse scrutiny, regardless of the actual risks associated with the chemical. While recognizing
past efforts by EPA towards public education, AAMA believes that misunderstanding and misinterpretation of the
data still exists which makes it more critical that EPA not expand the list with low risk chemicals. Texaco and AAMA
believe that before the Agency expands the EPCRA section 313 list, resources should be committed to provide public
education on actual risks portrayed by the data and educate the public on viable means of chemical risk reduction and
chemical management. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The chemicals that are listed under EPCRA section 313 exhibit a wide range of effects at various dose levels. While
EPA attempts to communicate the TRI data in the most accurate manner, the Agency recognizes that there exists the perception
that the TRI data may sometimes be mischaracterized, but that does not justify not adding a chemical for which the statutory
criteria are clearly met. EPA agrees that the better approach to such a problem is improving public information on
the chemical, which, combined with the release, transfer, and waste management data will enable the public to participate
in informed environmental decision-making. EPA continues to attempt to provide the public with means for interpreting
the TRI data.

Persistent bioaccumulative chemicals
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In the proposed rule, EPA requested comment on whether chemicals that are manufactured in trace amounts in waste
streams, are highly toxic at very low dose levels and have physical, chemical, or biological properties that make
the chemicals persist for extended periods in the environment, and bioaccumulate through the food chain should be
listed on the EPCRA section 313 list (January 12, 1994, 59 FR 1791). EPA noted that persistent bioaccumulative toxic
chemicals, such as dioxins, are of particular concern in ecosystems such as the Great Lakes Basin due to the long retention
time of the individual lakes and the cycling of the chemical from one component of the ecosystem to another. EPA also
requested comment on the following: If EPA were to add this type of chemical to EPCRA section 313, what modifications
to EPCRA section 313, such as lowering the reporting thresholds and modifying the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in mixture exemption (40 CFR 372.38), would be required to ensure that release and transfer information would be collected?
In addition to two comments opposed to the addition of this type of chemical, EPA received 35 comments supporting the
addition of toxic persistent bioaccumulative chemicals. The majority of these commenters also supported lowering
the reporting thresholds for this type of chemical. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Monsanto and Dow Chemical Company object to the addition of persistent bioaccumulative chemicals that are produced
in quantities less than the EPCRA section 313 reporting thresholds. The commenters state that many of the persistent,
bioaccumulative toxic compounds which are of concern are no longer manufactured in the United States, and are merely
present in the environment due to historical activities and not current activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA disagrees with this contention. EPA's request for comment focused on chemicals that are generated in small quantities.
This is not limited to chemicals produced as a product, but includes chemicals that are generated in waste streams.
Many persistent, bioaccumulative toxic chemicals are produced in waste streams. Further, EPCRA section 313 requires
the reporting of chemicals manufactured in waste streams if the quantity produced exceeds the appropriate reporting
threshold. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Monsanto further claims that ``the amounts of these particularly dangerous substances coming from industrial facilities
are so small that they can have no measurable impact on health or the environment.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA disagrees that releases of these chemicals are so low that they will not have an adverse effect upon human health
or the environment. The persistent bioaccumulative aspects of these toxic chemicals are such that even very small
quantities released can reasonably be anticipated to cause adverse effects upon human health and the environment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Monsanto also states that the concept of different reporting thresholds suggests that this threshold would be proportional
to the relative hazard. Thresholds for practically non-toxic chemicals may be very high using this concept. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA requested comment on lowering the thresholds for these chemicals not so that the reporting thresholds for chemicals
listed on the EPCRA section 313 list would be proportional to the relative hazard of the chemicals. Rather, EPA requested
comment on lowering the threshold for persistent bioaccumulative chemicals because even minimal releases of these
chemicals may result in elevated concentrations in the environment or in an organism that can reasonably be anticipated
to result in significant adverse effects. This reflects the increased likelihood that there will be exposure to a
chemical that persists due to its longer residence time in the environment. Repeated minimal releases of a persistent
chemical may result in elevated concentrations in the environment. For a chemical that bioaccumulates, even low
levels of the chemical in the environment may result in increased concentrations in an organism. Thus, lower thresholds
for these substances would be considered due to the persistent and bioaccumulative nature of the substances, rather
than the direct hazard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its next action to add chemicals to the EPCRA section 313 list, the Agency intends to consider the addition of chemicals
that are persistent and bioaccumulate. EPA also intends to consider lowering the reporting thresholds for these
additional chemicals and those chemicals that are persistent and bioaccumulate that are now on the EPCRA section
313 list. Accordingly, comments received in response to EPA's request for comment on the potential addition of persistent
bioaccumulators will be addressed in the future rulemaking if these chemicals are proposed for addition.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources states that the EPCRA section 313 chemical list should be expanded
to include the six chemicals listed in section 112(b) of the CAA not currently included on the EPCRA section 313 list
or as part of the January 12, 1994 proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has reviewed all of the chemicals listed under section 112(b) of the CAA not currently on the EPCRA section 313 list

Hormone mimics

de minimis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 exemption for mixtures eliminated for these chemicals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA agrees that the deleterious effects of hormone mimicking chemicals may warrant their future review for listing
on the EPCRA section 313 list. Although the effects of these chemicals are difficult to predict, and it is often impossible
to establish a clear cause/effect relationship, still it is clear from the available evidence that these chemicals
warrant consideration. Wide scale changes in wildlife and human populations have been noted by some researchers.
Population decreases and reproductive effects have been linked to these chemicals in a number of wildlife species,
including but not limited to bears, Florida panthers, songbirds, and bald eagles, to list just a few. Possibly of greater
concern are the effects of these chemicals in humans. In addition to the carcinogenic potential of many of these chemicals,
effects on fertility, immune system damages, and many childhood problems have been attributed to hormone-mimics.
A number of the chemicals with widespread distribution in the environment reported to have reproductive and endocrine-disrupting
effects (Ref. 1) are either already on the EPCRA section 313 list, or are being added as a result of this action. EPA may
consider reviewing the remaining chemicals on this list as part of a future action.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters state that EPA's Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) failed to meet the requirements of Executive Order
12866, which mandates regulatory planning and review. The commenters state that: (1) The RIA for the proposed rule
did not analyze any alternatives other than adding the 313 chemicals and chemical categories to the EPCRA section
313 list, (2) that it excluded the economic effects due to complying with state, local and other federal requirements
that are triggered when a chemical is listed under EPCRA section 313, and (3) that it did not analyze the benefits of
the rule. Many commenters also contend that small business impacts were understated in the RIA, and that the time required
for compliance is higher than estimated in the RIA. These comments and the Agency's responses are discussed below.

chemical categories to the EPCRA section 313 list. In response to these comments, EPA has revised the RIA to include
a variety of alternatives, such as adding the CAA criteria air pollutants, not adding chemicals regulated under FIFRA,
not adding the water dissociable nitrate compounds category, and adding the proposed chemicals in conjunction with
an alternate reporting threshold for facilities with low-levels of TRI chemicals in wastes. The commenters requested
that EPA present the costs for adding each individual chemical. EPA cannot provide the costs on an individual chemical
basis because the estimates for most of the chemicals were derived from confidential business information. Displaying

raise include state taxes and fees, state pollution prevention planning requirements, special requirements for
certain National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) storm water permits, and requirements for federal
facilities under Executive Order 12856. EPA has revised the RIA to discuss state and federal requirements that are
linked to reporting under EPCRA section 313. However, EPA has not quantified the costs of such requirements. In some
cases, this is because there is insufficient data to make a reasonable estimate. In other cases, EPA does not believe
that the requirements represent a social cost. The requirements that may be linked to listing under EPCRA section
313 are discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
State fees
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Thirteen states place a tax or fee on facilities filing TRI Form R reports. These states are Colorado, Florida, Iowa,
Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, and Texas. Many
commenters estimate that the costs resulting from state fees and taxes linked to EPCRA section 313 reporting are up
to 50 percent of the direct cost of filing the forms, and state that any tax is likely to induce a reduction in economic
welfare. EPA has revised the RIA to discuss state fees and taxes that are linked to reporting under EPCRA section 313.
However, the taxes and fees are not direct social costs, and EPA does not believe that there is sufficient information
to estimate the net social costs or benefits of these requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenters treat state taxes and fees on the EPCRA section 313 reports as costs, but these are transfer payments
and not economic costs to society. Specifically, the standard definition of a cost in economics is the consumption
of a resource (e.g., labor, equipment, natural resources, etc.). A tax or fee is a transfer payment from one party to
another. While the fee is a cost to the firm (and/or its customers), it is income to the state. No resources are consumed,
except for transaction costs, so the amount of the fee is not a cost to society. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA disagrees with the commenters' contention that any tax or fee is likely to induce a reduction in economic welfare.
EPA believes that taxes or fees on toxic chemicals may resolve a market failure and increase social welfare. The use
of toxic chemicals often creates a negative externality. For instance, releases of a chemical may cause health and
environmental effects in the surrounding community. In such cases, it is likely that private costs are below true
social costs, because private markets do not provide an adequate incentive for firms to internalize these externalities.
In such cases, taxes may be the optimal method to correct the market failure. EPA believes that if the commenters feel
that the fees are not set at the level that optimizes social welfare, their remedy lies with the appropriate state agency,
and not EPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA does not feel that it is feasible to estimate the size of the transfer payment resulting from state fees and taxes
linked to EPCRA section 313, or the net social costs or benefits of these payments. The commenters made their estimates
by applying the maximum state fees to all facilities nation-wide. EPA does not feel that such a calculation is appropriate.
Most states have no fees or taxes linked to EPCRA section 313 reporting, and the level of the fees or taxes (and how they
are assessed) is different in each of the rest of the states, varying from $25 to $50,000. Many of the state requirements
are not flat fees, but are graduated depending on the level of releases that a facility reports. An accurate representation
of the size of the transfer payments would require estimating the geographic distribution of new reports, and the
level of releases and transfers for each report. EPA feels that it is not possible to predict with a reasonable degree
of accuracy the location and level of releases for facilities that will report on the chemicals being added to the EPCRA
section 313 list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nor is it feasible to accurately estimate the net social costs or benefits of the state fees and taxes. To do so would
require knowing not only the size of the transfer payments, but the damages caused by the use and release of the chemicals,
and the change in behavior that would result from the fees and taxes. EPA does not have adequate information on the facilities
that would be affected by the rule to make such estimates. As a result, the RIA has been revised to qualitatively discuss
state fees and taxes linked to EPCRA section 313 reporting, but does not estimate the size of the resulting transfer
payments, or the net social costs or benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
State pollution prevention programs
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Seven states (Arizona, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Jersey, and Texas) mandate pollution
prevention plans from facilities reporting under EPCRA section 313. Facilities in these states that are reporting
to TRI for the first time because of the additions to the chemical list will have to prepare pollution prevention plans.
Although the development of pollution prevention plans imposes a cost on facilities, the RIA did not analyze the costs
of these requirements. Many commenters contend that there are significant costs for preparing such plans, and that
the RIA should have included these costs. Quantifying the impacts of state pollution prevention requirements would
require predicting which facilities reporting for the additional chemicals would be located in these seven states.
As stated above, it is not possible to accurately predict the geographic location of new reporters. Thus, no costs
are estimated for state pollution prevention plans in the RIA. Nor does the RIA quantify the benefits derived from
these pollution prevention planning requirements. None of the commenters submitted any evidence comparing the
social benefits of such requirements to the costs. Therefore, EPA has no information from which to conclude that the
linked requirements for state pollution prevention plans would reduce the net social benefits of adding chemicals
to EPCRA section 313. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has not quantitatively estimated either the costs of state pollution prevention planning requirements or the
benefits of such programs in the RIA. However, the RIA has been revised to qualitatively discuss requirements that
are linked to EPCRA section 313 reporting, including pollution prevention plan preparation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
NPDES storm water permits
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. EPA issued National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) ``baseline'' general permits for storm water
discharges associated with industrial activity on September 9, 1992 (57 FR 41236). EPA subsequently proposed a multi-sector
storm water industrial permit covering 29 industrial sectors (November 19, 1993, 58 FR 61147). The ``baseline''
general and multi-sector general permits have special pollution prevention requirements for certain EPCRA section
313 facilities, and the ``baseline'' permits also contain special monitoring requirements. Many commenters assert
that the RIA underestimates the costs of the rule by a factor of up to 5.6 by not including the costs of NPDES storm water
permit requirements that are triggered by adding chemicals to the EPCRA section 313 list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that the commenters' estimates are based on a cost scenario that is not applicable to the typical facility
affected by the proposal to add chemicals under EPCRA section 313. There are four reasons that the commenters' estimates
are not generally appropriate. Any of these reasons alone demonstrate that the commenters have overestimated the
number of facilities that are affected and the the size of the impact. Because there may also be a significant overlap
among the four, the commenters' estimates are likely to apply to few, if any, facilities. The commenters' estimates
would not apply to all facilities affected by the rule, as the commenters contend. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, only a fraction of the facilities that would report under EPCRA section 313 for the additional chemicals would
be affected by the NPDES storm water permits. A facility that submits TRI Form R is only subject to storm water permitting
requirements if industrial materials or activities are exposed to storm water, and if the facility is reporting to
TRI for one of the section 313 water priority chemicals. Only about two dozen of the chemicals being added to the EPCRA
section 313 list qualify as section 313 water priority chemicals, and thus would be covered by the NPDES requirements.
About half of these are pesticides, which would not be manufactured or processed at many facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, EPA expects the majority of facilities to have existing containment systems that meet most of the requirements
of the NPDES permits. Third, many of the costs for the storm water requirements are likely to apply at the facility level.
In such cases, facilities that installed systems for the current EPCRA section 313 chemicals will not face incremental
costs for the additional chemicals. Fourth, the special requirements of the NPDES storm water permits are based on
the coverage of EPCRA section 313 at the time the permits were issued. The NPDES requirements do not apply to chemicals
that are added to the EPCRA section 313 list until the time of permit renewal (which occurs every 5 years), and may not
apply in subsequent permits, depending on the Agency's decisions at the time those permits are issued. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the commenters based their estimates solely on the upper bound of EPA's estimates for the NPDES permits,
and have ignored the mix of low-cost and high-cost facilities that is likely to exist. EPA believes that the commenters'
estimate is a hypothetical ``worst-case'' scenario that does not apply to the typical facility and may not apply to
any facilities. EPA believes that the costs of the storm water requirements for the proposed chemicals will be relatively
minor. Again, EPA has revised the RIA to qualitatively discuss the linkage between EPCRA section 313 reporting and
the NPDES storm water, but it has not made any quantitative estimates of these costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Executive order 12856
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Executive Order 12856, signed by the President in August 1993, extends the coverage of EPCRA to federal facilities.
In addition, section 3-303(a) of the Executive Order states that ``Each federal agency shall establish a plan and
goals for eliminating or reducing the unnecessary acquisition by that agency of products containing extremely hazardous
substances or toxic chemicals'' (emphasis added). The Executive Order defines ``toxic chemical'' as a substance
on the list described in section 313 of EPCRA. Many commenters contend that the cost to the federal government and the
private sector of complying with Executive Order 12856 for the chemicals being added to EPCRA section 313 will be $1.5
billion per year. EPA does not believe that the effects of Executive Order 12856 should have a bearing on the decision-making
regarding the addition of toxic chemicals to EPCRA section 313. EPA believes that following the commenters line of
reasoning would discourage the federal government from ever making any changes in procurement, for whatever reason,
because doing so might have an impact on a supplier. Furthermore, EPA believes that there is insufficient data to make
any estimate of the effects of the Executive Order, and that the resources required to make such an estimate would exceed
the value of the information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA notes that section 3-303(a) of the Executive Order does not require the elimination of toxic chemicals in federal
procurement. If the performance characteristics of a toxic chemical or product containing a toxic chemical are critical
in the required tasks, federal agencies may continue to purchase it. Each federal agency must make its own determination
whether a particular toxic chemical is necessary in a particular use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Executive Order requires that federal agencies eliminate or reduce the unnecessary procurement of extremely
hazardous substances or toxic chemicals. None of the commenters identify which toxic chemicals are being unnecessarily
purchased by the federal government, and which federal agencies are making these unnecessary purchases. Without
such information, EPA cannot verify the commenters' claim that the addition of chemicals to EPCRA section 313 will
create significant impacts as a result of the Executive Order. If these chemicals are not being purchased by the federal
government, or are not being purchased unnecessarily, there will not be an impact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenters' estimate of $1.5 billion in costs is based solely on a series of assumptions, which are not supported
by data. EPA does not believe that the commenter's analysis was based on a careful analysis of any factual information.
EPA has no data with which to replace these assumptions. Given EPA's belief that effect of the Executive Order should
not have a bearing on the rulemaking (as well as the limitations of the Executive Order, the small amount of procurement
that would be affected, and the ability of producers to sell to private sector clients or manufacture substitutes),
EPA does not believe that there is a need to develop any data on these factors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Executive Order states that ``the environmental, energy and economic benefits of energy and water use reductions
are very significant,'' and that ``the federal government has the opportunity to realize significant economic as
well as environmental benefits of pollution prevention.'' The Executive Order provided a mandate for the federal
government to reduce its unnecessary use of toxic chemicals. EPA believes that the proposal to add chemicals to the
section 313 list complements this mandate. Furthermore, EPA hopes that federal agencies will comply with the spirit
of the Order, and reduce their unnecessary use of toxic and hazardous chemicals, whether or not these chemicals are
listed on the EPCRA section 313 list. EPA believes that, by definition, the social benefits cannot exceed the social
costs for an unnecessary toxic chemical, and social welfare can be improved by switching to a substitute product.
Therefore, EPA believes that any actions federal agencies take to meet their obligations under Executive Order 12856
will have a positive net benefit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Benefits
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Many commenters assert that the RIA did not show any benefits to adding chemicals to the EPCRA section 313 list of chemicals.
The commenters appear to have made these statements because EPA did not make a quantitative estimate of the benefits
associated with the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are two types of benefits associated with EPCRA section 313. The first type of benefit is due to improvements
in understanding, awareness, and decision-making related to the provision and distribution of information. The
second type of benefits derive from changes in behavior that result from the information reported to TRI. These benefits
include reduced environmental and health risks, and reduced treatment and disposal costs: These changes in behavior
come at some cost to society. Because the current state of knowledge about the economics of information is not highly
developed, EPA has not attempted to quantify the pure information benefits of adding chemicals to the EPCRA section
313 list. Because of the inherent uncertainty in the chain of events, EPA has also not attempted to quantify the benefits
or the costs of the changes in behavior that result from the information. EPA does not believe that there are adequate
methodologies to make reasonable quantitative estimates of either type of benefits. However, EPA believes that
its qualitative discussion of the effects of the current TRI program show that such benefits do exist. The information
on the additional chemicals is expected to improve scientific understanding of the environment and health risks,
foster greater community awareness of industrial activities, and allow Federal, state, and local authorities to
make better informed decisions on acceptable levels of toxic chemicals in communities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Instead, EPA has drawn its conclusions about the net benefits of adding chemicals to EPCRA section 313 by inference.
In enacting EPCRA and the PPA, Congress implicitly determined that the net benefits of reporting was positive for
the original list of 320 chemicals and categories. EPA's interpretation of the statutory toxicity criteria is more
stringent than Congress' original determination because EPA has deleted 12 chemicals from the original list of 320
chemicals and categories developed by Congress. EPA believes that all of the chemicals being finalized meet the statutory
toxicity criteria of section 313, and are at least as toxic as some of the chemicals for which Congress believed there
were net benefits due to reporting. Thus, by inference, the net benefits of reporting for the chemicals added in this
rulemaking should be positive as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that the experience of the past 5 years shows that reporting under EPCRA section 313 has produced real
gains in understanding about exposure to toxic chemicals. EPA sees no reason why the information on the additional
chemicals will provide less understanding than the currently reported chemicals have provided. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Small business
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. sections 601 - 612), agencies must prepare an analysis of small business
impacts for proposed rules. Many commenters contend that small business impacts were understated in the RIA, and
they question EPA's conclusion that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.
EPA believes that the commenters have significantly overestimated the costs of the rule, and that the commenters'
estimates of small business impacts are not valid. EPA has provided additional analysis in the RIA for the final rule
that demonstrates that the rule will not have significant cost impacts on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that, whether or not the proposed rule would have had significant cost impacts on small entities, the
Agency has subsequently met its obligations under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Where a proposed rule would have
significant impacts on small entities, the Act requires EPA to identify and consider (but not necessarily adopt)
alternatives that minimize the impact on these entities, while accomplishing the stated objectives of the applicable
statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Elsewhere in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA is finalizing a rule establishing an alternate threshold for low-levels of TRI chemicals in waste that would
otherwise meet the reporting requirements under EPCRA section 313. Such facilities can submit an annual certification
statement in lieu of a TRI Form R. EPA estimates that facilities will require an average of 34 hours to comply with the
requirements for a certification statement, compared to 53 hours for a TRI Form R. The alternate reporting threshold
will apply to the chemicals being added under EPCRA section 313 by this rule as well as chemicals currently listed under
EPCRA section 313. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's guidelines for implementing the Regulatory Flexibility Act state that ``The alternatives considered for
the purpose of fulfilling the Act's requirements need not be restricted in applicability to small entities. Regulatory
alternatives that prove to be more cost-effective for small entities often will be more cost-effective for larger
entities as well. For example, alternatives that place lesser burden on facilities with lower emission levels, lower
production levels, etc., should be analyzed in conjunction with fulfilling the Act's requirements even though such
alternatives may not ease the burden on all (or even most) small entities and may benefit large entities as well as small
ones.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because EPA has considered, and adopted, an alternative that places lesser burden on facilities with lower emission
levels, EPA believes that it has met the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The alternate threshold
will provide significant relief for small businesses that will report for the proposed chemicals, which is the intent
of the Act.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reporting burden
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Many commenters report that the time required for compliance with EPCRA section 313 is higher than that estimated
in the RIA. Commenters estimates of the time required to prepare a TRI Form R and perform the necessary recordkeeping
vary from 91 to 2,000 hours, compared with EPA's estimate of 53 hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The unit time estimates used by EPA are average values. EPA recognizes that large multi-divisional, multi-departmental
facilities may require more than the average time to comply. As with any average, some facilities will be above the
average and others will be below it. However, there are many other facilities subject to the rule that are not large,
multi-divisional or multi-departmental. These facilities will typically have a simpler compliance process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The variability among facilities is evident in comments on the rule submitted by a large chemical manufacturing company,
that provided estimates showing that it spends an average of 28 hours for each TRI Form R that is submitted to compile
information, perform calculations, prepare the TRI Form R and maintain records. This includes the time spent on compliance
determination for chemicals that are below threshold levels. This is less than EPA's estimate of 53 hours for the same
activities. While some of the commenters may require more time than average to comply with the rule, other companies
require less time than average. EPA believes that its time estimates are a reasonable average for the manufacturing
sector as a whole.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines as ``significant'' those regulatory actions likely
to lead to a rule (1) Having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting
a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local
or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious
inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering
the budgetary impacts of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues
arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has prepared a Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) in conjunction with this rulemaking. A copy of this document (titled
``Regulatory Impact Analysis of the Final Rule to Add Various Chemicals and Chemical Categories to the EPCRA Section
313 List of Toxic Chemicals'') is available in the TSCA NCIC (See Unit V. of this preamble), for review and copying.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has estimated that the total costs to industry of adding the new chemicals to the EPCRA section 313 list is approximately
$99 million in the first year and $49 million each year thereafter. Costs to EPA are approximately $1 million per year.

The costs for the final rule are different from the costs for the proposed rule, as shown in Table 2. There are two reasons
for this change. First, the number of chemicals and chemical categories added has decreased from 313 to 286, which
reduced the number of reports that would be submitted. Second, the number of reports estimated for one chemical, water
dissociable nitrate compounds (reportable only when in aqueous solution), was increased from 2,146 to 3,066 to account
for facilities that create water dissociable nitrate compounds in aqueous solution through on-site biological
treatment of wastewater.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA is finalizing a rule establishing an alternate threshold for facilities with low amounts of a listed toxic chemical
in waste (see Unit II. of this preamble). Qualifying facilities would be eligible to submit an annual certification
statement instead of a TRI Form R. Because the time required for the alternate threshold is less than the time required
for a TRI Form R, the cost of compliance with this rule will be lowered as a result. The effect of the alternate threshold
on the chemicals being added by this rule is demonstrated in Table 2. Further information on the effect of the alternate
threshold is presented elsewhere in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The costs described in Table 2 represent only those actions that are required by this rule. There are other requirements
that are linked to reporting under EPCRA section 313, but which are not required by this rule. There are 13 states that
place a fee or tax on facilities that file a TRI Form R or report to EPA under EPCRA section 313, and 7 states that mandate
pollution prevention plans from such facilities. EPA has also created special requirements for certain facilities
with NPDES storm water permits that report under EPCRA section 313. Adding chemicals and chemical categories to the
EPCRA section 313 list may cause some facilities to incur additional costs through these linked requirements. These
costs have not been monetized, but they should not be significant. The linked fees and taxes are transfers, and not
social costs, and many of the reporting facilities will not be located in the 13 states with fees and taxes. Also, the
NPDES and pollution prevention planning requirements are most likely to create costs for facilities that are new
reporters. There will be approximately 1,225 new reporters as a result of this rule, although not all of these will
be subject to the NPDES requirements, or be located in states with pollution prevention planning requirements. The
linkage to the NPDES requirements is limited to about two dozen of the new chemicals, not all 286 chemicals and chemical
categories being added. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The market failure that this rule is intended to correct is the externality created by the lack of information available
to citizens about the releases and transfers of toxic chemicals in their communities. Taking no action would allow
this externality (and the resultant social costs) to continue. It is expected that this rulemaking will generate
benefits by providing citizens with access to information that otherwise would not be available to them. The benefits
of the rule itself are limited to improvements in understanding, awareness and decision-making related to the provision
and distribution of information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that the rulemaking can reasonably be anticipated to indirectly yield health and environmental benefits
by leading to reductions in the releases and transfers of toxic chemicals. These changes in behavior come at some cost
to industry. The net benefits of the follow-on activities are the difference between the benefits of decreased chemical
releases and transfers, and the costs of the actions needed to achieve them. As noted above, EPA has not quantified
the benefits of this rule or the follow-on activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action was submitted to OMB for review, as required by Executive Order 12866, and any comments or changes made
in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations have been documented in the public record.

B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires each Federal agency to perform a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
for all rules that are likely to have a ``significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' EPA investigated
the potential impact of the proposed rule on small businesses, and has prepared a Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
(FRFA). This assessment has been included as part of the RIA and is summarized below. In assessing small business impacts,
EPA calculated the costs incurred by two hypothetical facilities that are supplier notification facilities reporting
to the TRI for the first time. Facilities were assumed to file only Form Rs, instead of any annual certification statements.
Thus, the results are based on conservative assumptions. The first facility files a report for a single new chemical,
while the other files reports for four new chemicals. For each hypothetical facility, annual regulatory costs were
calculated and compared to average annual sales. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The cost impact ratios were calculated based on the average annual sales of those facilities currently reporting
under EPCRA section 313 for which annual sales and employee figures could be obtained from Dun Bradstreet. The Dun
Bradstreet data base was used instead of Census data on the assumption that facilities that report under EPCRA section
313 are not uniformly distributed throughout the entire population of facilities in each size category. EPA believes
that it is reasonable to assume that facilities reporting under EPCRA section 313 have, on average, larger annual
sales than the typical facility in an industry. Therefore, the annual sales of current reporters should be a more appropriate
measure than the sales of all facilities in an industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A small business was defined as having fewer than 50 employees. Although a more detailed break-down of size categories
would have allowed for a closer examination of the potential impact on even smaller facilities, the total number of
observations in the matched data base was too small to allow for additional categories. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA often uses a cost impact percentage of one percent as a threshold measure below which facilities are not considered
to be significantly impacted as a result of a regulation. Under the scenario in which facilities are assumed to submit
one TRI Form R, the cost impact percentages are well below one percent for all employee size classes in all SICs. The
highest cost impact percentage is 0.4 percent for small facilities in Standard Industrial Classification (SIC)
codes 25 (Furniture) and 31 (Leather) in the first year of reporting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the scenario in which facilities are assumed to submit four TRI Form Rs, cost impact percentages in the first
year of reporting are above one percent only for small facilities in SIC codes 25 (1.2 percent) and 31 (1.1 percent).
Cost impact percentages are below 0.8 percent for all industries in subsequent years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The higher impact rates for the hypothetical facilities occur in industry sectors where there have historically
been a relatively small number of establishments reporting. Approximately 8 percent of all facilities in SIC code
25 (Furniture) and 10 percent of all facilities in SIC code 31 (Leather) currently report to EPCRA section 313 (compared
to 57 percent of all facilities in the chemical industry). It is reasonable that large and medium businesses are more
highly represented in these percentages than small businesses, because they would be more likely to exceed the EPCRA
section 313 thresholds. In addition, facilities in SIC 25 and 31 have typically submitted fewer than four reports
each, and would be less likely to submit four reports for the new chemicals than facilities in other industries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, cost impacts for facilities potentially affected by the rule were not found to be of sufficient magnitude to
cause significant impacts. Although EPA has found that the rule does not result in significant impacts on small facilities,
EPA has separately developed alternatives to meet the goals of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (i.e., to accomplish
the objectives of EPCRA section 313 while minimizing the economic impact on small entities). EPA proposed a rule establishing
an alternative reporting threshold for low-level releases and transfers (July 28, 1994, 59 FR 38524). The proposal
requested comment on five different levels for the alternate reporting threshold. This rule is being finalized elsewhere
in today's issue of the

The collection of information and other requirements under section 313 of EPCRA and section 6607 of the PPA are covered
under OMB approval number 2070&hyph;0093, which was issued on May 14, 1992. While this approval normally would have
expired on November 30, 1992, it remains in effect pursuant to the 1993 Department of Veteran Affairs and Housing and
Urban Development and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, Pub. L. 102-389, signed October 6, 1992, which states
that:

Act of 1990 (Public Law 101&hyph;508) and section 313 of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986

This final rule adds chemicals to the list of toxic chemicals subject to reporting under section 313 of EPCRA and section
6607 of the PPA and does not change the elements of the TRI reporting form, its instructions, or related requirements.
Accordingly, the TRI Form R and instructions and related requirements remain in effect, as provided by Pub. L. 102-389.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The industry reporting burden for collecting this information is estimated to average 53 hours per respondent annually,
including time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data
needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. The actual burden to a specific facility may
deviate from this estimate depending on the complexity of the facility's operations and the profile of the release.

Summary:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is establishing an alternate threshold for those facilities with low annual reportable amounts of a listed toxic
chemical. These are facilities that would otherwise meet reporting requirements under section 313 of the Emergency
Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 (EPCRA). A facility that meets the current section 313 reporting
thresholds, but estimates that the total annual reportable amount of the chemical does not exceed 500 pounds per year,
can take advantage of an alternate manufacture, process, or otherwise use threshold of 1 million pounds per year,
for that chemical, provided that certain conditions are adhered to. EPA is establishing this alternate threshold
in response to petitions received from the Small Business Administration and the American Feed Industry Association,
and in consideration of the future management of the Toxic Release Inventory (TRI).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Statutory Authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is issued under section 313(f)(2) and section 328 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know
Act of 1986 (EPCRA), 42 U.S.C. 11023(f)(2) and 11048. EPCRA is also referred to as Title III of the Superfund Amendments
and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 313 of EPCRA, 42 U.S.C. 11023, requires certain facilities which manufacture, process, or otherwise use
listed toxic chemicals in excess of the applicable threshold quantities to report their environmental releases
of such chemicals annually. The threshold quantities are established in section 313(f)(1). EPA has authority to
revise these threshold amounts pursuant to section 313(f)(2); however, such revised threshold amounts must obtain
reporting on a substantial majority of total releases of the chemical at all facilities subject to section 313. A revised
threshold may be based on classes of chemicals or categories of facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Beginning with the 1991 reporting year, such facilities also began reporting source reduction and recycling data
for listed chemicals, pursuant to section 6607 of the Pollution Prevention Act, 42 U.S.C. 13106. This information
is submitted on EPA Form 9350&hyph;1 (Form R) and compiled in an annual Toxic Release Inventory (TRI). Each covered
facility must file a separate Form R for each listed chemical manufactured, processed, or otherwise used in excess
of the reporting thresholds established in section 313(f)(1). Section 328, 42 U.S.C. 11048, provides EPA with general
rulemaking authority to develop regulations necessary to carry out the purposes of the Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 8, 1991, the Small Business Administration (SBA) petitioned EPA to exempt from TRI reporting requirements,
facilities reporting relatively low volumes of chemicals released and transferred off-site. The petition proposed
that EPA establish a tiering system within the list of reportable chemicals under EPCRA section 313. The petition
suggested a division of the list to be based on a combination of chemical toxicity and amounts reported to TRI. Those
chemicals deemed to have high toxicity concerns and/or are reported in relatively low volumes nationally, would
have a lower ``exemption'' threshold (such as 10 pounds for the sum of releases and transfers) or would be reported
on a much more simplified form. Those chemicals with lower toxicity concerns and are reported in relatively high volumes
would be subject to a much higher ``exemption'' level, such as 5,000 pounds for the sum of releases and transfers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA published this petition as a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of October 27, 1992, (57 FR 48706), and received a substantial number of comments. Copies of these comments are available
in the TSCA docket, OPPTS docket number 400072. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA received a similar request in a petition from the American Feed Industry Association (AFIA) on February 14, 1992.
AFIA requested an exemption of Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code 2048 from TRI reporting. The general
basis of this request is that facilities in SIC code 2048, ``Prepared Feeds and Feed Ingredients for Animals and Fowls,
Except Dogs and Cats,'' have such small releases of the listed chemicals (primarily feed additives) that the industry
as a whole does not contribute information that furthers the purposes of EPCRA, therefore, the imposition of TRI reporting
on the feed industry is unfair. The AFIA petition suggested, as an alternative to their request of an SIC code deletion,
that EPA adopt the approach proposed in the SBA petition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA published the AFIA petition as a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of April 13, 1993 (58 FR 19308), and again received a substantial number of comments. These comments are available
in the TSCA docket, OPPTS docket number 400077. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA decided to focus on a revision of current reporting requirements that would be applied to all industries subject
to section 313, as opposed to a revision restricted to target industrial sectors or SIC codes. EPA therefore considers
this rule as a response to both the AFIA and SBA petitions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of the pre-proposal process, which included consideration of the comments received, EPA held a public meeting
on February 16, 1994, to present its analytical findings and open discussions regarding reduced reporting for facilities
with low volumes of releases and transfers. Comment was taken on a variety of positions. Results from EPA's preliminary
analysis are presented in an issues paper,

C. Summary of the Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA issued a proposed rule on July 28, 1994 (59 FR 38524), to establish a higher manufacture, process, or otherwise
use threshold for those facilities having low volumes of specific chemicals for the sum of amounts released and transferred
off-site for the purpose of treatment and/or disposal. Facilities qualifying for the low release and transfer criterion
and that manufacture, process, or otherwise use less than the higher ``alternate'' threshold would be eligible to
submit a certification statement instead of a full Form R report. The certification statement would be made available
to provide the regulated community, compliance programs, and other interested parties basic information concerning
which facilities were manufacturing, processing, or otherwise using a TRI chemical at current section 313 reporting
quantities, but whose sum of amounts released or transferred, for the purpose of treatment and/or disposal, were
below 100 pounds. A facility meeting the above conditions and choosing to submit a certification statement would
be required to maintain records substantiating the calculations that establish the facility's eligibility to apply
the alternate threshold. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA issued the proposal in part as a response to both the SBA and AFIA petitions, but the burden relief provided by the
proposal was also a result of EPA's consideration of the future management of the overall TRI program. As stated in
the proposal, EPA is in the process of significantly expanding the TRI program to add many additional chemicals to
the list. EPA is also in the process of evaluating industry sectors not currently covered by TRI for addition. Both
of these actions are expected to substantially increase the level of current reporting. The increase in reporting
has obvious information management implications for EPA as well as for States. Today's action will make a significant
portion of the current Form R data management capacity available for data on additional chemicals and from new sources.
EPA believes this will also help increase the long-term efficiency and utility of the data system while preserving
a basic link for the public between facility location and reportable TRI chemicals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's proposal offered several alternatives to those advanced by the SBA and AFIA petitions. All aspects of the proposal
were available for public comment. EPA requested specific comment on the following issues: (1) What should form the
basis to determine which facilities or reports should be eligible for burden reduction (for example, should a category
of facilities be based on the sum of amounts released and transferred or based on the sum of total waste generated for
a given chemical); (2) what volume level should determine the eligible ``category''; (3) what should be the alternate
manufacture, process, or otherwise use thresholds; (4) what should constitute the certification statement and
how often it should be submitted; and (5) what would be the impacts of such a reporting modification. These issues and
the comments received are addressed in unit III. of this preamble. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Summary of the Final Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is establishing an alternate threshold for those facilities with a low amount of a listed toxic chemical in their
``annual reportable amount'' (in the proposal, this amount was referred to as ``total waste''). Contingent upon
OMB approval, the alternate threshold rule will be effective for activities beginning January 1, 1995. EPA will publish
a technical amendment in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 when the reporting additions have been approved by OMB. This reporting modification will enable facilities otherwise
meeting reporting requirements under section 313 of EPCRA to take advantage of a higher threshold than those set out
in 40 CFR 372.25 for any listed toxic chemical, if the annual reportable amounts of that toxic chemical did not exceed
500 pounds for the combined total quantities released at the facility, disposed within the facility, treated at the
facility (as represented by amounts destroyed or converted by treatment processes), recovered at the facility as
a result of recycle operations, combusted for the purpose of energy recovery at the facility, and amounts transferred
from the facility to off-site locations for the purpose of recycle, energy recovery, treatment, and/or disposal.
These volumes correspond to the sum of amounts reportable for data elements on EPA Form R (EPA Form 9350-1;Rev. 12/4/93)
as Part II column B or sections 8.1 (quantity released), 8.2 (quantity used for energy recovery on-site), 8.3 (quantity
used for energy recovery off-site), 8.4 (quantity recycled on-site), 8.5 (quantity recycled off-site), 8.6 (quantity
treated on-site), and 8.7 (quantity treated off-site). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The alternate threshold applies to a defined category of facilities on a per chemical basis. The alternate manufacture,
process, or otherwise use threshold for a specific chemical at a facility meeting the category definition would be
an amount greater than 1 million pounds per year. Specifically, if a facility manufactures, processes, or otherwise
uses 1 million pounds or less of a chemical annually, and if 500 pounds or less of that chemical is present in their annual
reportable amount, then the alternate reporting option is available to that facility for that chemical. Other chemicals
at the facility that do not meet the criteria for the alternate threshold would continue to be reported on Form R as currently
required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To take advantage of the alternate threshold, a facility is required to: (1) Submit an annual certification statement
indicating that the facility met the requirements for use of the alternate threshold for the specific chemical and
(2) maintain and make available upon request accurate records substantiating the calculations supporting the facility's
claim of eligibility for the alternate threshold for each chemical. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Explanation of this Threshold Modification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule establishes an alternate threshold for purposes of submitting reports under section 313 of EPCRA.
The key factors that govern the application of this alternate threshold are, the sum of amounts of the listed toxic
chemical in their annual reportable amount, and the quantity of that chemical being manufactured, processed, or
otherwise used within the facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current reporting thresholds set forth in EPCRA section 313(f)(1) apply to the manufacture, process, or otherwise
use of listed section 313 chemicals. In short, these are activity-based thresholds. EPCRA section 313(f)(2) also
provides EPA with the flexibility to revise the established activity-based threshold amounts in section 313(f)(1)
and apply such revised thresholds to individual chemicals, classes of chemicals, or categories of facilities. However,
any modification of a threshold must continue to obtain reporting on a substantial majority of total releases of the
chemical at all facilities subject to the requirements of section 313. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule first establishes a category of facilities based on the annual sum of a listed toxic chemical in their
annual reportable amount. By establishing this category of facilities, a threshold modification can then be applied
selectively to that category. A facility becomes part of this category if at least one toxic chemical, otherwise reportable,
does not exceed the 500 pound criterion for that chemical in their annaual reportable amount. Annaul reportable amount
is defined as the combined total quantities released at the facility, disposed within the facility, treated at the
facility (as represented by amounts destroyed or converted by treatment processes), recovered at the facility as
a result of recycle operations, combusted for the purpose of energy recovery at the facility, and amounts transferred
from the facility to off-site locations for the purpose of recycle, energy recovery, treatment, and/or disposal.
These volumes correspond to the sum of amounts reportable for data elements on EPA Form R (EPA Form 9350-1; Rev. 12/4/93)
as Part II column B or sections 8.1 (quantity released), 8.2 (quantity used for energy recovery on-site), 8.3 (quantity
used for energy recovery off-site), 8.4 (quantity recycled on-site), 8.5 (quantity recycled off-site), 8.6 (quantity
treated on-site), and 8.7 (quantity treated off-site). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A facility in this category is then eligible to take advantage of an alternate manufacture, process, or otherwise
use threshold of 1 million pounds for that specific chemical. Hence, if the facility meets the criterion of having
no more than 500 pounds in its annual reportable amount of a listed toxic chemical, and for that chemical, the facility
does not exceed the manufacture, process, or otherwise use threshold of 1 million pounds, then that facility may submit
a certification statement for that chemical in lieu of a full Form R. A facility eligible to apply the alternate threshold
and choosing to submit a certification statement must keep records substantiating the facility's eligibility determination.
If EPA subsequently determines that the facility was ineligible to apply the alternate threshold, then the Agency
can bring an enforcement action with respect to non-reporting of Form R.

III. Issues Considered and Comment Summary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA received about 500 comments in response to EPA's Alternate Threshold proposal (59 FR 38524). Approximately 400
of these comments were submitted by industry or entities representing industry concerns. The remaining comments
were submitted by environmental and labor organizations, public interests groups, state program representatives,
and private citizens. The following section is a discussion of the major issues and points raised in comments received
and EPA's consideration of those comments that pertain to this final rule. The major issues are discussed in the following
order: Structure of the facility category; poundage level for the category; alternate threshold level; certification
statement; recordkeeping requirements; covered facility status; degree of burden reduction; and effective date.

A. Facility Category 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The reporting modification established by this rule is intended to provide regulatory relief for facilities that
report low amounts of listed toxic chemicals in their annaul reportable amount. For reasons stated in the proposal
(59 FR 38524), this reporting modification is intended to help focus both industry's and EPA's resources on the data
of greatest significance. EPA proposed to target this regulatory relief at facilities where the sum of releases and
a subset of the transfers were below 100 pounds. However, EPA offered alternatives including use of total waste as
the basis of the eligible ``category.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Category based on releases and certain transfers as proposed
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Many industry commenters voiced approval for the structure of the category as initially proposed by EPA, but generally
these commenters urged the Agency to raise the volume level of the category. Several comments submitted by industry
requested that EPA consider all releases to Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTW) as zero releases or disregard them
from the calculations a facility must make in determining their eligibility for the alternate threshold. A number
of commenters from industry said that EPA should only focus on amounts released and referred to the language in the
statute which
<!-- PJG 0320 forcenewline -->
 states, . . . ``such revised threshold shall obtain reporting on a substantial majority of total releases of the chemical
at all facilities . . . ,'' as support.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 These commenters argued that transfers to POTWs and landfills have little environmental effect and do not represent
actual environmental loadings. Many commenters from the animal feed and dairy industries referred to their most
frequently released chemicals, such as sulfuric acid, arguing that amounts of these chemicals are almost completely
neutralized or adequately treated by recipient POTWs and should not be considered a factor in a facility's eligibility.
A similar comment suggested that, if EPA is interested in amounts going to or being handled by POTWs or landfills, the
TRI should be expanded to include these types of facilities.

Section 313(f)(2)_The Administrator may establish a threshold amount for a toxic chemical different from the amount
established by section 313(f)(1). Such revised threshold shall obtain reporting on a substantial majority of total
releases of the chemical at all facilities subject to the requirements of this section. The amounts established under
this paragraph may, at the Administrator's discretion, be based on classes of chemicals or categories of facilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA disagrees with commenters who would limit the category to direct releases at the facility only. EPA's rationale
for proposing the sum of releases and certain transfers was to cover direct as well as potential environmental loadings
associated with the wastes generated by that facility. EPA can see no merit in the argument that transfers to POTWs
should be discounted as part of the category determination. The ultimate entry into the environment of any particular
chemical sent to a POTW in wastes is highly dependent upon the type of treatment/disposal process at that POTW. For
example, ammonia may be destroyed by tertiary treatment processes, but not all POTWs employ this process. Additionally,
many chemicals, such as most metals, are not converted to less toxic forms during treatment processes, such as those
employed by POTWs, and may either pass directly through these treatment operations and/or be directed to other media.
Therefore, EPA believes that these amounts, along with amounts handled by other management practices that can potentially
result in environmental releases, should be accounted for and be part of a facility's eligibility determination.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters representing environmental and public interest groups stated their concern over the amounts of
materials that would not be accounted for by EPA's proposed category approach. These commenters urged EPA to eliminate
the ``recycling loophole'' which can be characterized by the removal from public access information on the volumes
associated with waste management activities such as materials recycling. These commenters contend that not including
this type of information as a criterion in the facility category determination undermines source reduction and is
in conflict with national policy established in the Pollution Prevention Act (PPA) of 1990. Some of these commenters
stated that the recycling loophole encourages burning of toxic wastes that are often transferred to cement kilns,
instead of encouraging source reduction practices. Additional comments received raised concerns over hazardous
emissions that result from solvent recycling operations, some of which are not listed within the manufacturing SIC
codes of 20 through 39, and therefore, are not currently required to report to TRI. Commenters indicated that TRI provides
specific data on transfers of hazardous wastes for the purpose of recycling. These data are important because they
indicate where releases from the further processing of such toxic chemicals may be occurring. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A comment from a representative of a state's toxics reporting program stated that significant amounts of currently
reported information within their state would no longer be reported if EPA's category were implemented as proposed.
Their analysis of the impact on their state's reporting indicated that EPA's proposal would primarily benefit larger
businesses. This commenter noted that some facilities operating in their state identified as meeting the 100 pound
category as proposed have reported off-site transfers for recycling of amounts as high as 3 and 15 million pounds for
a given chemical. This commenter suggested that this ``recycling loophole'' could be eliminated by including off-site
transfers for recycling and those amounts burned for energy recovery in the category determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed below, EPA believes that there is merit in structuring the category in such a way to include volumes associated
with management activities beyond releases and limited transfers as proposed. Ultimately, the structure of the
category should relate to how well it serves to provide an optimal balance between burden reduction for submitters
and data preservation for users of the full range of TRI data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Category based on annual reportable amount
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. EPA's proposal included an alternative that would establish a category based on the total amount in wastes, which
was referred to as total waste generation. This category includes all amounts released on-site, transferred off-site
for treatment or disposal, recycled or burned for energy recovery on- or off-site, and treated on-site. One commenter
from industry argued against using the total waste option, because the purpose of the reporting modification should
be concerned with information relevant under EPCRA. This commenter went on to say that the information collected
under the PPA of 1990 is subsidiary to EPCRA section 313 data elements. This commenter and several others from industry
stated that basing the category on total waste limits the amount of burden reduction sought by this reporting modification,
and that adopting the total waste approach would actually serve as a disincentive for applying more pollution prevention
practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, commenters from industry said that creating a category determination that does not include amounts sent
off-site for recycling or to incineration for energy recovery would encourage more facilities to engage in these
activities, as opposed to treating or directly disposing of wastes. An industry representative said that not including
amounts sent off-site as part of the facility category determination is particularly relevant when such wastes are
recovered and are then returned to the originator. This commenter along with several others from industry said that
excluding these amounts would encourage facilities to participate in responsible/reasonable care types of programs,
which further pollution prevention goals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter said that the environmental releases from wastes generated by a ``covered facility'' are likely to
be included in the calculation of environmental releases either (i) by the generator of the waste, or (ii) by an off-site
``covered facility'' to which the waste is sent for recycling or energy recovery. The commenter continued by saying
that since environmental releases are the ultimate focus of the TRI program, the likelihood that they will be included
in the release calculations of some ``covered facility'' should allay fears that toxic chemicals transferred off-site
for recycling or energy recovery would somehow escape the system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA disagrees with commenters stating that information collected under the PPA is subsidiary to data mandated by
EPCRA section 313. EPA believes that the PPA data are an enhancement of the basic data gathered by EPCRA section 313.
The purpose of this enhancement was to provide the public with a more complete picture of the amount of toxic chemicals
in facility waste streams, which can highlight the potential for source reduction. EPA believes that including a
broader category of amounts reportable to TRI in a facility's determination will not discourage facilities from
implementing pollution prevention activities, and that the inclusion of this broader category of amounts will encourage
facilities to practice source reduction measures where possible, which is the primary goal of pollution prevention.

Comments from the environmental community, labor organizations, states, and private citizens voiced strong opposition
to EPA's proposed category because it did not include amounts being recycled or burned for energy recovery. These
commenters were concerned about the removal from public access of information regarding the further processing
of hazardous materials and the emissions that may result. A number of commenters urged EPA to continue to collect the
information on materials sent off-site for the purpose of recycling and/or energy recovery which were not included
in EPA's proposed approach. A few public interest groups submitted comments that described hazardous materials
recycling as a hazardous activity, and urged EPA to continue to collect information on materials being sent to these
facilities. Noting cases where these facilities have created serious environmental problems, a few other comments
came from individuals and local interest groups living near facilities where hazardous waste recycling and burning
occurs. These commenters stress the need for their communities to have access to information regarding materials
being sent to these facilities. Some urged EPA to list these types of facilities for direct TRI reporting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters stated that EPA has the authority, through the PPA and EPCRA, to collect and make available information
regarding chemicals being recycled and burned for energy recovery and urged that EPA continue to do so. EPA believes
that a category based on either releases and transfers or annual reportable amounts will satisfy the section 313(f)(2)
requirement for reporting on ``total releases'' because ``annual reportable amounts,'' as defined in this rule,
encompasses releases. However, EPA agrees with the commenters concerned with the amounts of materials that are not
part of the category based on releases and transfers. As noted in the proposal, amounts associated with waste management
activities for those facilities fitting a category description based only on releases and transfers can be substantial.
EPA carefully weighed these comments regarding the structure of the category and has determined that a category based
on annual reportable amounts is more consistent with the goals of EPCRA than the release and transfer option. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's proposal presented an analysis of the volumes of materials managed as waste that would be affected (i.e., not
reported in detail) under a reporting modification based on a facility category of releases and transfers or annual
reportable amounts.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There was a substantial difference in the annual reportable amount data associated with the forms, as defined by the
two basic category approaches. As presented in EPA's proposal, the total waste volume (annual reportable amount)
associated with the forms identified by a category based on releases and transfers (at a level of less than 100 pounds),
was estimated to be 2.2 billion pounds based on 1991 data. This represented approximately 6.3 percent of this data
nationally. The same category, in terms of 1992 data, as seen in Table 1 above, affected approximately 6.1 billion
pounds of annual reportable amount information, or 16.7 percent of this data nationally. In comparison, a category
based on annual reportable amounts not exceeding 500 pounds would apply to very nearly the same number of Form Rs. However,
based on 1991 data, these forms had only 2.7 million pounds of annual reportable amounts associated with them. The
forms fitting the same category for 1992 reporting, as seen in Table 1 above, have an estimated 2.5 million pounds of
annual reportable amount data associated with them (Ref. 4). EPA believes that the significant increase in volumes
of annual reportable amounts reported in 1992 as compared to 1991 can be attributed to a greater amount of recycling
and on-site treatment activities reported by those facilities that have releases and transfers of less than 100 pounds.
Additionally, some of the volume differences may also be attributed to more accurate reporting given that 1992 was
the second year that the data associated with the PPA was required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that the disparity in amounts of data associated with the forms defined by a category based on releases
and transfers and a category based on annual reportable amounts is great enough to discount an approach based on only
releases and transfers for treatment and/or disposal. Hence, EPA agrees with those commenters who have stressed
the need to retain information on amounts of materials being treated, recycled, or burned for energy recovery both
on-site and off-site. EPA has therefore structured the category in this final rule to be based on the sum of amounts
reported during the calendar year as represented by the following: The combined total of quantities released at the
facility, disposed within the facility, treated at the facility (as represented by amounts destroyed or converted
by treatment processes), recovered at the facility as a result of recycling operations, combusted for the purpose
of energy recovery at the facility, and amounts transferred from the facility to off-site locations for the purpose
of recycle, energy recovery, treatment, and/or disposal. These volumes correspond to the sum of amounts reportable
for data elements on EPA Form R (EPA Form 9350-1; Rev. 12/4/93) as Part II column B or sections 8.1 (quantity released),
8.2 (quantity used for energy recovery on-site), 8.3 (quantity used for energy recovery off-site), 8.4 (quantity
recycled on-site), 8.5 (quantity recycled off-site), 8.6 (quantity treated on-site), and 8.7 (quantity treated
off-site). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certain commenters stated their objection to inclusion of these amounts, using the rationale that doing so would
discourage pollution prevention. EPA believes that inclusion of these amounts is in keeping with the goal and national
policy of pollution prevention. EPA believes that this information should be available to the public and other interested
parties, who are concerned with the operations that generate, receive, and further process large amounts of these
materials. The public has demonstrated a strong concern about these operations, and TRI provides a reliable accounting
of reportable constituents and their estimated amounts from those facilities required to report to TRI. EPA further
believes that requiring facilities to account for pollution prevention efforts, including source reduction activities,
can serve to inform industry and the users of the data about the level of progress being made at a particular facility
and within a given industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that a category based on annual reportable amounts will more appropriately focus the burden reduction
benefit of this rule on facilities that have limited the entry of toxic chemicals into waste streams, rather than on
facilities that could derive the benefit by shifting toxic chemicals from one management practice to another. EPA
also believes that a category based on annual reportable amounts will retain a higher degree of specificity of the
toxic chemical data while still allowing for the burden reducing ``conversion'' of a substantial number of full Form
R reports to certification statements.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Category based on a chemical list division
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Many commenters from industry supported the approach put forth in the SBA petition to treat listed chemicals differently.
This approach was referred to in EPA's proposal as the ``split list'' approach. These commenters stress that only
by distinguishing among chemical toxicities can EPA effectively determine what information can be exempted on the
basis of a chemical's relative and potential impact. They argue that only by making distinctions among chemicals
on the basis of their human health and/or environmental impacts can EPA properly determine what information is vital
to a community's right-to-know, as opposed to chemical accounting for the sake of reporting. A few of these commenters
supported EPA's example of splitting the listed chemicals primarily based on their Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA) carcinogen classification, as presented in EPA's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Issues Paper
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Ref. 3). Several of these industry commenters who support the ``split list'' approach suggested that EPA establish
a simplified petitioning system that would allow parties to submit requests to move chemicals from one list to another.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stated that current risk assessments are overly reliant on cancer rates and ignore too many other health
problems, including adverse reproductive outcomes such as birth defects, developmental abnormalities, low birth
weights, and behavioral abnormalities. This commenter also cites adverse effects on the human immune system, neurological
diseases, as well as asthma and other respiratory diseases. In addition, other commenters noted that adverse impacts
on the ecosystem, including wildlife reproductive effects (e.g., from endocrine disruptors), need to be considered
when discussing toxicity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many of the commenters from the environmental community stressed their concern over losing any data or limiting the
public's access to information on toxic chemicals that persist in the environment or have carcinogenic, developmental,
or other serious health impacts. Several commenters described EPA's alternate threshold as inappropriate and insisted
on full reporting on ``small releases'' of persistent toxic chemicals such as mercury or highly toxic chemicals such
as phosgene. Other commenters supported the addition of highly toxic chemicals and are in favor of setting a much lower
reporting threshold in order to receive reports on these chemicals. A few commenters urged EPA to add these types of
chemicals to TRI and require reporting for any amounts released. One commenter objected to EPA's proposed reporting
change, stressing that it is based on the fallacious assumption that ``small'' releases do not pose risks to public
health and the environment and therefore the public does not need explicit information regarding such releases.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the purpose of this category structure, EPA chose to make no distinction among listed chemicals. EPA is not attempting
to apply risk-based concepts in this rulemaking. EPA does recognize that there are wide variations in the hazards
associated with the chemicals on the list. EPA is concerned that the current threshold structure may be masking important
data on releases and waste management activities of certain chemicals that may exhibit bioaccumulative properties
or direct toxicity even at low levels. EPA may consider a future modification of current thresholds to more fully capture
information on chemicals that persist in the environment and bioaccumulate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is, therefore, EPA's intention to establish a reporting modification in this rulemaking that creates a degree
of reporting relief without substantially limiting the information currently collected and made available through
TRI. It is also EPA's intention that this reporting modification apply to all industries subject to reporting and
to all listed toxic chemicals without regard to their relative hazard.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Chemical-specific issues
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Several commenters from the feed industry repeated their position that the chemicals for which the majority of their
reports are submitted are Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved nutrient additives for animal feed, and are
generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the scientific community. One commenter supporting these points added that
the industry's handling practices for these chemicals further reduce losses that might otherwise occur, which should
lessen concern over adverse affects resulting from the use or processing of these chemicals. One commenter requested
that EPA establish a separate reporting threshold for ``by-products,'' such as ammonia generated from rendering
operations, and suggested a 100,000 pound level for these chemicals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few specialty industries, such as the cold storage industry, which uses ammonia for refrigeration units, claim
that their industry accounts for only a fraction of the volume of ammonia produced nationally. These commenters make
the point that their use of this chemical is safe, does not threaten the environment, and the reporting of the emissions
associated with these uses serves no benefit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter believes EPA should modify the processing threshold to exclude chemicals intentionally added when
making products for distribution if the total facility releases and transfers are less than 4 percent of the use volume
of the chemical in the calendar year. This commenter states that this step will promote use reduction and release reduction
by facilities where processing of toxic chemicals is essential for the manufacture of their product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated in the above section, many of the comments submitted by the environmental community urged EPA to collect
and make available through TRI information on any amounts of chemicals that could affect serious impacts on human
health and the environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For many of the same reasons given in the above discussion concerning a possible list division, EPA intends that the
regulatory relief provided by this rule be applied to all facilities and all listed toxic chemicals, rather than only
those that are not highly toxic. EPA believes that the intent of EPCRA section 313 is to place the decisionmaking on
whether a facility's releases are acceptable to a community in the hands of the community. Therefore, EPA does not
believe that it should make distinctions among the listed chemicals on the basis of inherent toxicity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Avoiding further complication in the use of TRI data is also a significant consideration in how this burden reduction
amendment is structured. EPA strongly believes that an individual interested in accessing TRI data should be able
to locate and understand the information contained in the data base with as few encumbrances as possible. Singling
out specific chemicals and chemicals managed by specific processes from how other chemicals are reported, could
unnecessarily complicate the use of the data. While many of the issues raised by the commenters concerning specific
chemicals may have merit, EPA does not believe it would be productive to further complicate this rule amendment by
making particular exceptions for specific chemicals or handling practices.

B. Level of the Category 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the basis on which a category of facilities would be structured, EPA asked for comment on the poundage
level proposed and offered alternatives. Although a few commenters supported EPA's proposed level of less than 100
pounds for the sum of releases and transfers, most of the commenters from industry preferred a higher level, while
some commenters generally opposed to the reporting modification said they could accept a level such as zero or 10 pounds
as long as total waste were not excluded and other conditions were met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A federal Agency, along with one chemical manufacturer, submitted comments in support of EPA's proposed level, while
comments submitted by the feed industry generally supported a release and transfer level of 500 pounds. This level
was supported by these commenters based on the types of chemicals handled by their industry. One chemical specifically
mentioned was sulfuric acid, which some commenters said, ``would not be of great concern for releases at 500 pounds
or less.'' Some of the other commenters supported the 500 pound level based on the level of accuracy of data collected
by TRI. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few industry commenters said that EPA's proposed level was too low to benefit their specific industry and urged EPA
to elevate the level. A trade association, among others, criticized EPA's proposal as lacking adequate justification.
Several of these commenters said that EPA's selection of approach and level were unfounded, while others disagreed
that there was a ``natural break'' in the data, as EPA described at the 100 pound level. Some commenters identified
other levels in the data that they thought indicated a more appropriate level for selection. Several industry commenters
questioned EPA's sincerity in providing any level of significant burden reduction. One commenter stated that EPA's
proposed level is based on the impact of total waste information affected, which does not necessarily relate to actual
volumes of total waste generated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter said that EPA should set the category level at 500 pounds because it currently accepts range reporting
of 0&hyph;499 pounds and adopting a ``low-level'' release category of less than 500 pounds is effectively no different
than allowing a facility to use a range code. Other commenters supporting the 500 pound level describe the data loss
as not unreasonable. Several commenters said that EPA's proposed level does not allow a margin of error in estimating
releases, and therefore, many facilities will be forced to submit actual release amounts on Form R and will not be able
to take advantage of the alternate threshold. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional comments were submitted that stated the application of a less than 100 pound category on chemicals with
relatively low toxicities was not consistent with EPA's Common Sense Initiative, and that a 5,000 pound release of
a chemical such as an acidic cleaner over the course of 1 year is insignificant. These commenters stress that chemicals
such as this do not bioaccumulate, are not carcinogenic, and do not damage the environment at the levels used by their
industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters supporting the split list approach are in favor of an elevated poundage level for chemicals of low toxicity
and a much lower poundage level for those chemicals determined to have higher toxicity or hazard concerns. Many of
these commenters urge EPA to apply the SBA's 5,000 pound level to the low toxicity chemicals and a 10 pound level for
chemicals considered to be of greater concern. Some commenters supporting the split list approach argued that the
adoption of a 5,000 pound level for low toxicity chemicals could improve data quality and further lessen the burden
on industry and EPA. Some commenters suggested variations on the levels suggested by the SBA petition, such as 1,000
pounds for low toxicity chemicals and 0 to 500 pounds for chemicals with high toxicities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter supporting a 5,000 pound split list approach assumed that if all of the amounts released and transferred
(for the purpose of treatment and/or disposal) which EPA estimated would not be reported on under its proposal were
located at a single facility using one chemical of ``typical'' toxicity, the concentrations of those releases would
be below OSHA permissible exposure limits if the distance to the facility's fenceline was 470 meters or more. The commenter
continued with this supposition to make the point that for a 5,000 pound release and transfer category level, within
no single location (zip code) would there be a loss of an amount great enough to trip a Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) reportable quantity (RQ) for a single facility, at least for
two states researched by the commenter. This argument is premised on the amount released and transferred, for a given
chemical under the 5,000 pound category level, being evenly distributed over a facility's annual operations while
not exceeding the maximum amount released within a single 24&hyph;hour period of a chemical of ``typical'' toxicity.
The commenter used ammonia as an example. This argument would not apply for chemicals with CERCLA RQ values below 100
pounds, which would exclude approximately 150 currently listed TRI chemicals (Ref. 2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, a CERCLA listed chemical released in excess of its RQ value as part of a facility's routine operations,
as presented in the example, would require an application for continuous release notification, or the facility would
be required to report each instance that the amount released exceeded the chemical's RQ value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many other comments submitted by industry supported a level of 5,000 pounds, making no toxicity distinctions among
listed chemicals. This was broadly supported by referring to the percentage of release and transfer (for the purpose
of treatment and/or disposal only) data that would still be collected. These commenters referred to EPA's analysis
relating to volumes of chemicals released on-site and sent off-site for the purpose of treatment and/or disposal
that would be affected based on a range of category levels. Many commenters contend that by establishing the category
level at less than 5,000 pounds, only an additional 0.7 percent of the data for releases and transfers would be affected,
as compared with a facility category set at less than 100 pounds for releases and transfers. Many of these commenters
said that their facility had never received a request for information or had any knowledge of the public's interest
in releases of low amounts, adding that resources necessary to provide this information could be used more beneficially.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A comment submitted by a chemicals manufacturer supporting the 5,000 pound threshold said that such a threshold would
not significantly reduce the quantity of aggregate releases and transfers that their facilities currently report.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A trade association submitted comment in support of a total waste approach, but proposed a level matching that of a
conditionally exempt small quantity generator as defined in the RCRA program, which would be less than 2,645 pounds.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Conversely, some commenters argued that EPA should be focusing on expansion of community right-to-know and should
lower reporting thresholds to collect data on small releases of highly toxic chemicals that are currently unavailable
to the public in a comprehensive format. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An environmental organization criticized the alternate threshold proposal for not including amounts transferred
to recycling and energy recovery facilities. This organization voiced support for a total waste approach, but with
a threshold of 10 pounds. Citing data presented in EPA's proposal, this commenter states that a facility category
based on total waste at a 10 pound level corresponds to approximately 10,000 forms, which represents substantial
regulatory relief for businesses without reducing the public's access to important information which they have
a right-to-know. A major trade union voiced approval of this approach, provided that a facility also indicate into
which media a chemical was released. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in the preceding section, EPA has decided to base the facility category on the annual reportable amount
rather than the amount released plus limited transfers. After considering the multiple factors related to the selection
of a category level, EPA has selected an annual reportable amount of not greater than 500 pounds. In choosing a poundage
level, EPA sought a level that provides a reasonable balance between preserving the detail of data available to the
public and providing facilities with a realistic option for burden reduction. EPA believes that a level of 500 pounds
or less represents a reasonable cut-off for this annual reportable amount approach. EPA estimates that 20,100 Form
Rs would have been affected for the 1992 reporting year by the alternate threshold for a category based on an annual
reportable amount of no more than 500 pounds. This number of forms is essentially identical to the number that would
have been eligible for the proposed approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on 1992 data, the amounts reported on Form Rs identified as coming from facilities that would meet the facility
category of annual reportable amounts not exceeding 500 pounds, account for less than 1 percent of annual reportable
amounts reported nationally. While the amounts reported by facilities fitting EPA's proposed category and level
account for nearly 17 percent of annual reportable amounts reported nationally. These data also indicate several
additional impacts that EPA believes are important in determining which level is appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that a comparison of impacts at the county level is relevant to EPA's decision. Based on 1992 data, an estimated
250 counties would have greater than 50 percent of all of their annual reportable amount data affected by a category
based on releases and transfers at a 100 pound level, as EPA proposed. Under a category based on annual reportable amounts
not exceeding 500 pounds, about 90 counties are estimated to have greater than 50 percent of their annual reportable
amount data affected
<!-- PJG 0320 forcenewline -->
 (Ref. 1 ). Perhaps more importantly, the number of counties that would have a volume of over 1 million pounds of their
annual reportable amount data affected, based on the proposed release and transfer category, is estimated to be greater
than 278, while the category based on annual reportable amounts not exceeding 500 pounds has no counties where annual
reportable amounts greater than 1 million pounds would be affected (Ref. 1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Selection of the 500 pound level is consistent with current range reporting. Current reporting guidance allows facilities
to submit estimated amounts pertaining to releases on-site or transfers off-site in terms of three range codes. These
range codes correspond to poundage amounts of 1&hyph;10, 11&hyph;499, and 500&hyph;999 pounds. Range codes can
be used in as many reporting fields as the estimated amount applies for amounts released or transferred. While range
codes are not currently available for reporting PPA data, establishing a category of facilities based on annual reportable
amounts effectively extends range reporting to these activities. Submission of a certification statement is different
from receipt of a Form R that indicates amounts in ranges. The certification will not provide the detail as to which
media the chemical was released or otherwise directed as does Form R. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA does not believe that the fact that a commenter has received no inquiries from the public demonstrates that the
information is not of value. Because the data are kept in a publically available database, there is no need for individuals
to contact a company in order to access and use the information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, EPA believes a category based on annual reportable amounts not exceeding 500 pounds will limit the loss of
detailed information currently available, while providing industry with a reasonably attainable level. As EPA's
analysis indicates in Table 1 in unit III.A.2. of this preamble, that the approach selected is estimated to apply to
approximately 25 percent of the currently reported submissions.

C. Alternate Threshold Level 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA proposed that facilities which meet current section 313 reporting requirements for a listed toxic chemical,
but estimate for that chemical the sum of amounts released and transferred (for the purpose of treatment and/or disposal
only) is below 100 pounds per year, could take advantage of an alternate manufacture, process, or otherwise use threshold
of 1 million pounds per year, for that chemical. The proposed 1 million pound alternate threshold received considerable
comment. Comments were primarily directed at the proposal's impact on those facilities with low releases and limited
transfers but which have high volume chemical uses. The following unit addresses comments on the alternate threshold
in terms of: (1) Application of the alternate threshold; (2) impact on high volume chemical users; and (3) alternatives
to the proposed approach.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Application of the alternate threshold
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Several commenters requested that EPA clarify whether the Agency intends the application of the alternate threshold
to apply in the same manner as current threshold applications for submitting Form R. In particular, commenters wanted
clarification that the 1 million pound alternate threshold applies in a mutually exclusive manner to either manufacture,
or process, or otherwise use of the toxic chemical within the facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA confirms that the application of the alternate threshold applies in the same manner as current thresholds apply
in making compliance determinations for submitting Form R. This is reflected in &sect;327.27(c) of the regulatory
text. That is, the alternate threshold represents the amount that the facility manufactures, or processes, or otherwise
uses of the listed toxic chemical. If the facility meets the eligibility criteria for the category and does not exceed
1 million pounds of manufacture, or process, or otherwise use, then the facility may be eligible for reduced reporting.
In a multi-establishment facility situation, the owner or operator must determine the total amount of the same listed
toxic chemical that is, for example, otherwise used within all establishments of the facility and then compare it
to the alternate threshold. Owners or operators of facilities should also be aware that the calculation of the low
volume category amount, annual reportable amounts not exceeding 500 pounds in total wastes, must be based upon a whole
facility determination, and must include all activities occurring within all establishments within the facility,
unless otherwise exempt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters saw no apparent rationale for the million pound threshold, since, as one commenter stated, EPA
has not collected threshold data for EPCRA section 313 reported chemicals. One commenter states that EPA should eliminate
the million pound per year ``manufacture, process, or otherwise use'' threshold, since one of the key objectives
for the EPA proposal is to reduce reporting of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 releases; this commenter sees no reason to establish an additional qualification threshold related to chemical
usage, which goes beyond the Congressional intent for EPCRA to keep the public informed of releases to the environment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter stated that the 1 million pound threshold is unnecessary because this rulemaking focuses on amounts
released not used. The volume of a listed chemical which a facility manufactures, processes, or uses should have no
bearing on whether that facility qualifies for the proposed de minimis category based on releases, since no appreciable
benefit is gained by either the public or the regulated community if releases are below the facility category level.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As described in unit II of this preamble, EPA is issuing this rule under the authority of section 313(f)(2) to reduce
the reporting burden for those facilities that have relatively low amounts of listed chemicals in annual reportable
amounts. To accomplish this, EPA is establishing a category of facilities based on certain criteria that would be
eligible to use an alternate threshold. It is by the application of a higher manufacture, process, or otherwise use
alternate threshold that determines the eligibility of facilities within the category to elect to submit a certification
statement in lieu of a Form R for those chemicals to which the category criteria apply.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Impact on high volume chemical users
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Many commenters criticized the proposed alternate threshold level for penalizing high volume chemical users with
low releases and transfers, providing these facilities with no incentive for pollution prevention while displaying
a bias against facilities reporting within certain SIC codes. Some believe the regulation should serve as an opportunity
for EPA to reward or encourage companies with low releases, instead of subjecting facilities to a threshold which
many view as still too low. One firm conducted an analysis indicating that facilities operating in the metal and metal
fabrication industries (SIC codes 33 and 34) account for approximately 21 percent of all Form Rs submitted under TRI.
Under the proposed rule, these facilities would have been unable to take advantage of the alternate threshold at a
disproportionate rate due to their large volumes of materials recycled and further processed that would have exceeded
the proposed 1 million pound threshold. Several commenters from the feed industry said that facilities in this industry
can regularly process 1 million pounds or more of feed ingredients that contain TRI chemicals but are able to keep their
releases typically below 100 pounds. These commenters ask why these operations should be penalized for their high
efficiency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters expressed the belief that EPA's proposed alternate threshold had been arbitrarily selected and
was not clearly defined. Several commenters emphasize that EPA should set the alternate threshold level high enough
to allow all facilities with qualifying low releases to utilize the burden reduction intended by this rulemaking.
Some of these commenters recommended alternatives such as a 10 and 50 million pound thresholds instead of EPA's 1 million
pound proposed level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter said that EPA appears to be unaware of the fundamental reality that production throughput does not relate
to amounts released. This commenter repeated the position that EPA should reward large facilities that control their
releases by allowing them to qualify for the same benefit. Through this rule, EPA intends to provide a reporting modification
that delivers some degree of regulatory relief while continuing to capture relevant data. The 1 million pound alternate
threshold represents an attempt to balance these two concerns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters from the environmental community and others commented that the structure of the regulation put forth
in EPA's proposal would allow facilities to handle volumes of up to 1 million pounds per chemical without the public
having access to this information. These commenters were concerned about those amounts that would not be included
in the facility category, such as amounts recycled as EPA proposed, and that the amount of a chemical managed by these
activities would only be limited by the level of the alternate manufacture, process, or otherwise use thresholds.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that concerns raised by commenters, about the proposed approach affecting potentially very large amounts
of information on chemicals in waste streams (i.e., they would not be reported), has been mitigated by establishing
a facility category based on annual reportable amounts. By establishing the category based on annual reportable
amounts, only amounts managed in waste streams up to the level established for the category are eligible for reduced
reporting. In contrast, EPA's proposed approach would have allowed a facility to conduct such waste management activities
as on-site treatment well beyond the category level of 100 pounds and submit a certification statement so long as the
facility did not exceed the alternate threshold of 1 million pounds. EPA has established the alternate threshold
for manufacture, process, or otherwise use of 1 million pounds in order to provide those facilities with annual reportable
amounts not exceeding 500 pounds per chemical with a lower burden reporting option, while preserving more detailed
data for facilities that manufacture, process, or otherwise use larger volumes of chemicals. A 1 million pound alternate
threshold for amounts manufactured or processed, with annual reportable amounts not exceeding 500 pounds, represents
an efficiency of 99.95 percent and EPA believes this level is likely to include the vast majority of facilities meeting
the category. EPA also believes that establishing the alternate threshold at 1 million pounds is an effective means
to retain more detailed information where exceedingly large volumes of toxic chemicals are managed.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Alternatives to the proposed approach
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Many commenters offered alternatives to the proposed activity threshold. One commenter suggested that EPA consider
a straight revision of the otherwise use threshold from the current 10,000 pound level to 25,000 pounds in order to
simplify the rule. EPA considered revising the otherwise use threshold in its initial analysis of this rulemaking.
By revising the otherwise use threshold, only those forms pertaining to chemicals used would be affected and the reduced
reporting would not apply to chemicals manufactured or processed. Additionally, where a revision of the otherwise
use threshold may be easier to implement than the alternate threshold established by this rule, it does not provide
the ability to consider and make allowances for the types of information that will be affected. For example, the current
reporting thresholds allow a facility to have uses of a chemical in amounts up to 10,000 pounds and not be required to
report to TRI. Uses of a chemical can result in direct releases or transfers of nearly all of the amounts used. By raising
the otherwise use threshold to 25,000 pounds, a facility could potentially release up to 25,000 pounds of a given constituent
and the public would not have access to that information through TRI. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters believe EPA should modify the ``otherwise use'' threshold to exclude chemicals contained in closed
systems that are not released under normal use activities. Reporting under section 313 is often required when a listed
chemical contained in a closed system is charged or recharged in amounts that exceed the ``otherwise use'' threshold
of 10,000 pounds. The commenters state that the inclusion of this type of ``otherwise use'' in threshold determinations
does not meet the intent of EPCRA, since releases may not occur in the same year that the facility's activity meets the
reporting threshold. The commenters further state that pollution prevention is generally not applicable to these
kinds of closed systems, with the exception of use of a substitute chemical--which may or may not be less toxic, and
may be controlled by other laws and regulations. These commenters argue that the exclusion of closed systems from
the threshold determination parallels other EPA guidance on exemptions for use of an article, and is in keeping with
the intent of EPCRA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes the type of activity described by this commenter should continue to be a covered use under TRI. These types
of uses can involve handling of significant quantities of a listed chemical. EPA has provided an interpretation that
only requires considering amounts toward the otherwise use threshold in those years when such large volumes are handled,
such as when refrigeration systems are recharged.

D. Certification Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA proposed that each qualifying facility that chooses to apply the alternate threshold must file an annual certification
statement for that listed toxic chemical instead of a Form R. The proposal outlined two primary purposes of a certification
statement. A certification statement serves as a means of informing the public about the presence and general magnitude
of combined releases and transfers of a listed toxic chemical by a facility at a lower burden than submitting a Form
R. It also serves to satisfy the statutory intent of section 313(f)(2) which requires that reporting be obtained on
a substantial majority of releases of a chemical. The proposed elements of the certification statement included
signature of a senior management official, facility identification, location and certain other linkage data, the
chemical identity, and an indication of any trade secrecy claim. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General reactions to the certification statement concept
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Many commenters, primarily those representing the regulated community, oppose the concept of a certification
statement. Several commenters stated that EPA should comply with the spirit and purpose of the Paperwork Reduction
Act and not require an annual certification. Two commenters stated that numerous other environmental requirements,
including the basic TRI thresholds, allow for self-determination with requirements, and question why this rule
should be different. Others commenters raised similar concerns. For instance, if the facility meets the ``exemption''
standard, then recordkeeping should be sufficient for the purposes of an inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA would like to reiterate that the proposal of an alternate threshold was not developed to establish a wholesale
exemption from section 313 reporting requirements. Because the statute does not provide expressed authority to
establish a specific release-based threshold, EPA has used the alternate threshold authority in section 313(f)(2)
to grant some regulatory relief to small sources. Section 313(f)(2) requires that a revised threshold based on a facility
category concept retain reporting on a ``substantial majority'' of releases. Therefore it would not be sufficient
to simply rely on recordkeeping as a means of satisfying the law. A certification statement serves the purposes of
right-to-know by providing the public with the basic information that a facility manufactures, processes, or otherwise
uses a listed chemical in excess of current thresholds in section 313(f)(1), that the annual reportable amount is
between 0 and 500 pounds, and that the facility did not exceed the alternate threshold for reporting. This information
will be made available in the TRI data base. Company records supporting such determinations are available to EPA inspectors.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters representing environmental and public interest groups supported the concept of a certification
statement. This support is generally associated, however, with a particular low volume amount that establishes
the category. For example, one commenter states that a certification statement is appropriate, but the proposed
level is too high. Another commenter states that annual certification should be provided, but only if the level is
set at 10 pounds or below. Another commenter states that ``at most, EPA should allow annual certification where a facility's
releases, all transfers, and waste streams are zero, or 10 pounds, if simple check boxes show where the chemical went
(land, water, air, recycling, etc.).'' Another commenter states that annual certification is reasonable only if
there is no loophole for recycling and energy recovery, that source reduction goals are not undermined, and that small
release quantities are truly small. A commenter from a state government indicated that a certification statement
would ensure that the present universe of facilities covered by their State pollution prevention rules would remain
intact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA, in this final action, has adopted a certification statement approach and the basis of the low volume category
has been shifted to an annual reportable amount approach. EPA does not believe, however, that implementation of a
certification statement should be made contingent upon the setting of a particular poundage value for the category
level. EPA believes that a certification statement is necessary in order to maintain public right-to-know and to
meet the statutory ``substantial majority'' of releases requirement. The certification statement relates to a
range volume for a given chemical contained in the annual reportable amount that can have multiple connections to
quantitative line items as reported or Form R. However, EPA does not agree that additional check boxes are needed in
the certification statement. EPA believes that the category and level established in this final rule are such that
replacement of full Form Rs, for those eligible reports, with certification statements provides the public with
an adequate level of information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Frequency of certification
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In the proposed rule, frequency of certification would track the annual requirement for submission of Form R. EPA
requested comment on the appropriateness of certification statements received less frequently than on an annual
basis. Commenters representing environmental and public interest groups supported annual certification. Many
commenters representing the regulated community stated that industries should be able to submit the certification
only once, arguing that a facility that takes advantage of the alternate threshold will likely remain eligible year
after year, and if they become ineligible, they will submit a Form R. These commenters stated that during facility
inspections, EPA could require facilities to perform detailed calculations to verify eligibility and that such
detailed calculations to support the certification should not be required each year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters recommended a 3 or 5&hyph;year certification schedule. Several commenters, many from the metal
plating industry, favor a 3&hyph;year certification with appropriate recordkeeping. Commenters from industry
generally believe that annual certification at any level is not necessary and does little to reduce the burden of reporting.
However, one commenter representing an industry which generally opposed the certification statement, indicated
that if EPA were to require such a statement that it should be annual. The reason given is that there is a greater likelihood
of missed filings under a bi-annual or tri-annual schedule and the consequent exposure to enforcement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this final rule, EPA has retained an annual schedule for submission of the certification statements. EPA believes
that a one-time or multi-year approach would not provide the data continuity necessary for providing the TRI data
annually to the public. In addition, EPA does not believe that it should present the information to the public in the
TRI data base from such certification activity unless it is based upon a positive submission by the facility. For example,
lack of receipt of a certification statement during one of the ``out years'' can mean one of two things. The facility
could still be within the eligibility limits of the alternate threshold, or it could be beyond such limits and has not
submitted a Form R. EPA is sensitive to the cost considerations of an annual certification schedule. However, this
cost is in general a lower cost than for Form R submission each year. Also, if operations do not change significantly
from year-to-year, as commenters indicate, then the subsequent year determination of eligibility should not be
a time-consuming data development process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Development of the information needed for a facility's certification statements will generally involve only a one-time
(one-chemical) collection burden. In addition, most of the information on the certification statement is very similar,
if not identical to the facility identification section of the current Form R. Furthermore, the Agency plans to develop
streamlined methods for submitting the certification statements beginning with the 1995 reporting year. The Agency's
Automated Form R magnetic media submission software will be modified to include the ability to create the certification
statement. This software is already designed to allow importation of data previously filed. Once created or imported,
the data will remain accessible for all subsequent filing unless there has been a change in the basic facility identification
information. Even then, changing the data will be straight-forward. The only additional variable will be the name
of the listed toxic chemical to which the certification statement applies.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Representing certification statements in the data base
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. EPA plans to enter the data from these certification statements into its regular TRI data bases. The data will be marked
to indicate that it represents certification statements rather than Form Rs. In this way, a geographic or chemical
search will be able to show the presence of a facility and the chemical for which it is applying the alternate threshold.
Quantitative analyses using certification statement data could be done in one of several ways. The user could make
a ``worst case'' assumption and choose to count a total of 500 pounds of the chemical released from that facility. An
alternative would be to use a midpoint of 250 pounds total release, similar to the treatment of current range reports.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA received comment from a federal agency that requested that the regulatory language of the proposal be changed
prior to the final rule that would allow facilities to submit a single certification for multiple chemicals meeting
the alternate threshold criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At this time, EPA is requiring that a facility submit a unique certification statement for each chemical meeting the
alternate threshold conditions. Facilities may assert a trade secrecy claim for a chemical identity on the certification
statement as on the Form R. Reports submitted on a per chemical basis protect against the disclosure of trade secrets.
Certification statements with trade secrecy claims, like Form Rs with similar claims, will be separately handled
upon receipt to protect against disclosure. Comingling trade secret chemical identities with non-trade secret
chemical identities on the same submission increases the risk of disclosure. Also, processing techniques currently
in place make handling of one form with more than one chemical difficult and be more likely to create submission errors
on the part of Form R reporters, as well as handling errors by EPA.

E. Covered Facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters requested clarification from the Agency regarding the status of a facility that may take advantage
of the alternate threshold. These commenters were concerned that the preamble discussion in the proposal seemed
to indicate that those facilities taking advantage of an alternate threshold were not covered facilities for purposes
of TRI reporting, yet language in the proposed section 372.27(a) states that ``. . . a covered facility may apply an
alternate reporting threshold . . . .'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Applicability to ``piggy-back'' requirements
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Several commenters questioned whether a facility that utilizes the alternate threshold is a section 313 ``covered
facility'' as outlined in 40 CFR 372.22. The primary concern expressed by these commenters relates to so called ``piggy-back''
requirements of other state or federal laws or regulations. For example, a state law or regulation may cite a section
313 ``covered facility'' as a facility that must pay a fee, submit additional information, or conduct facility pollution
prevention planning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 CFR 372.22 of the regulations, ``covered facilities for toxic chemical release reporting,'' defines the facilities
for which a Form R must be submitted. A facility that can take advantage of the alternate threshold may or may not be a
``covered facility'' for purposes of any specific toxic chemical. It will depend upon the factual situation and the
choices made by the owner/operator. The following examples illustrate common situations/choice combinations:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A facility that fits within the category description, and manufactures, processes or otherwise uses 1 million
pounds or less of a listed toxic chemical annually, and whose owner/operator elects to take advantage of the alternate
threshold 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
is not a covered facility
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and no Form R is required. (ii) The facility described in example (i) that fits within the category description, and
manufactures, processes, or otherwise uses 1 million pounds or less of a toxic chemical annually, but whose owner/operator
elects not to use the alternate threshold 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
is a covered facility subject to the thresholds under section 313(f)(1)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for which a Form R must be submitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A facility that fits within the category description, but that manufactures, processes, or otherwise uses
more than 1 million pounds of a toxic chemical annually must still submit Form R and, therefore, remains a covered facility.
In this final rule, &sect;372.22 has been amended to reflect this interpretation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency wants to make it clear, however, that its determination on this issue may not necessarily mitigate the impact
of piggy-back requirements. The ultimate impact of being a ``covered facility'' can vary depending upon how the linkage
is constructed in the specific state or other federal requirement. For example, where a state requirement is based
upon the number of Form R reports submitted to the state (e.g., report-based filing fee), the submission of certification
statements instead of Form R reports could provide an incremental burden reduction. Conversely, if the state requirement
is based upon the submission of at least one Form R report, a facility may be subject to the same degree of piggy-back
burden irrespective of the existence of the alternate threshold. In this scenario, it is only those facilities who
could substitute certification statements for all of their Form R reports that may benefit. Under any circumstance,
a state could modify its requirements to adjust for certification statements, and EPA has no control over such state
actions. Owners/operators should contact the appropriate state authorities for guidance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's determination on this issue in no way limits or affects its ability to bring enforcement actions against a facility.
If a facility wishes to take advantage of the alternate threshold, then it must determine that its annual reportable
amount did not exceed 500 pounds of the chemical for that year, it must file a certification statement, and it must keep
appropriate records. Therefore, if the facility fails to submit either a certification statement or a Form R, the
facility is a non-reporter and faces penalties up to $25,000 per day per violation (see EPCRA section 325(c), 42 U.S.C.
11045). In addition, even if the facility files a certification statement, the Agency can bring an enforcement action
based upon the inadequacy of required records or a determination that the facility's calculation of annual reportable
amount was incorrect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Applicability to partial facility reports
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Commenters asked whether the alternate threshold certification process applied in the same manner as Form R reporting
in the case of such partial facility reports. Currently the regulations at &sect;372.30(c) allow separate reports
to be filed for the same chemical by establishments within a multi-establishment facility. This was allowed as a convenience
for such multi-establishment facilities because these separate establishments may operate independently of one
another and would find it easier to file reports on their own operations than to have to consolidate reporting data
across several such operating units. However, this is only allowed if there has been a total facility threshold determination
for the manufacture, process, or otherwise use of a listed chemical. Form R contains a check box for a question relating
to whether the report is a ``partial facility'' report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the purposes of the certification statement, the facility must also make its determination based upon the entire
facility's operations including all of its establishments. If the facility as a whole is able to take advantage of
the alternate threshold, a single certification is required. EPA can see no benefit in allowing a facility with multiple
establishments to submit more than one certification statement for each of the chemicals for which it is eligible.
The eligibility to submit a certification statement is made on a whole facility determination. Thus, all of the information
necessary to make the determination has been assembled to the facility level. No other detail is required by the certification
statement and, therefore, no apparent benefit is provided to the facility in having it submit multiple statements
containing duplicative information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also believes that multiple submissions of certification statements for the same chemical from the same facility
provides a greater opportunity for the data to be misinterpreted. If, for example, a user of the data were interested
in a facility's chemical management practices and found more than one certification for the same chemical, as it would
appear in the data base, then the user might incorrectly assume that the facility managed the maximum annaul reportable
amount of 500 pounds for that chemical times the number of certification statements appearing in the data base for
the same chemical from another establishment. For these reasons, EPA is not extending ``partial facility'' or multiple
submissions of the certification statement by multi-establishment facilities.

Loss of eligibility for the threshold and relationship to prior year reporting
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. A commenter questioned whether the facility was required to submit prior year data under section 8 of Form R if in a
subsequent reporting year the facility became ineligible to take advantage of the alternate threshold. EPA's determination
on this issue is that the facility would not be required to include prior year data. This is because the facility was
not specifically obligated to develop such data and submit it on Form R. This would be similar to a situation in which
a facility fell below the statutory threshold for an activity and was not required to file Form R for a preceding year.
The facility may enter ``NA'' in these blocks of column A of section 8 of Form R. However, EPA encourages facilities
to provide such data voluntarily. A facility may have developed specific determinations regarding amounts that
contributed to the total waste determination in order to take advantage of the alternate threshold for that prior
year. Given this, the facility could fill in the appropriate blocks of column A without significant additional burden.

F. Degree of Burden Reduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A majority of commenters indicated that the proposal would provide, at best, only minimal regulatory relief from
current reporting burden. Others indicated that, while they support the concept of this proposal, it will not relieve
the reporting burden placed on either large or small businesses. In addition, some commenters considered EPA's estimates
of net savings to the regulated community to be overstated. Most of the comments received concerning burden relief
focussed on four aspects that, in the commenters' view, are unrelieved by EPA's proposal: (1) Data elements required
to complete the annual certification; (2) level of effort required to document eligibility for submitting a certification
statement; (3) failure of EPA to account for facilities manufacturing, processing, or otherwise using chemicals
in excess of the alternate threshold; and (4) relief from additional regulations at the state and local level, which
are predicated upon eligibility for reporting in TRI.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Data elements required to complete the annual certification
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Commenters' most frequent contention was that only minimal burden reduction would be available through the alternate
threshold. The reason given by commenters was that filing the annual certification statement would require that
all calculations required when filing Form R would still be necessary in order to document eligibility for the alternate
threshold. The only reduction in burden, argue commenters, would be associated with the actual preparation and mailing
of Form R. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA emphasizes that information regarding source reduction activities (including, for example, prior and subsequent
year estimates required under section 8 of Form R) and certain other data (including, for example, location of transfer
recipients; waste treatment method and efficiency) would not be required under the rule. Some commenters believe
that many facilities eligible for the alternate threshold will perform such calculations in any event, to ensure
that a complete Form R submission can be prepared in case their eligibility cannot be maintained from year-to-year.
EPA stresses that these calculations for previous and subsequent years are not required, and concludes that meaningful
burden reduction is available through the alternate threshold to facilities choosing to file the certification
statement.

Level of effort required to document eligibility for the alternate threshold
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Some commenters expressed concern regarding the level of effort needed to document a claim of eligibility under
the proposed rule, fearing that increased stringency will be applied to recordkeeping requirements. Consequently,
the additional burden and cost associated with this increased stringency, commenters argue, could prevent many
facilities from taking advantage of the exemption. While EPA recognizes that facility operators may perceive a level
of burden in documenting eligibility for the alternate threshold in excess of current requirements, EPA does not
intend to seek greater precision in estimates from facilities eligible for the alternate threshold. Since facility
operators have presumably filed Form Rs in the past, estimation procedures and recent records of calculations and
submissions most likely exist for most facilities; thus, new or additional procedures should not need to be established.
Consequently, EPA disagrees with these commenters, and sees no reason why recordkeeping requirements associated
with the alternate threshold should deter eligible facilities from filing the annual certification statement.

Failure of EPA to account for facilities manufacturing, processing, or otherwise using chemicals in excess of the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. One commenter explained that EPA's aggregate estimate of savings attributable to the alternate threshold were
overstated due to the Agency's assumption that all facilities identified as meeting the category criteria were in
fact eligible to file the certification statement under the alternate threshold. The commenter noted that many facilities
with low level releases would be ineligible to file the annual certification statement because they would exceed
the proposed 1 million pound alternate manufacture, process, or otherwise use threshold. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA acknowledges this, and agrees that, to the extent that there are facilities that satisfy the category criteria
but do not meet threshold requirements, aggregate savings are overstated. While data are not available to estimate
the frequency of occurrence of such facilities, EPA is confident that the overall impacts of the assumption are minor.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Conversely, EPA's estimates may understate savings due to the effect of range reporting on the analysis. That is,
the number of facilities estimated to meet the category criteria likely excludes many facilities satisfying the
criteria because many take advantage of the option of range reporting when filing Form R. Since facilities may report
releases within a range of 11&hyph;499 pounds to each media type, EPA cannot know for certain the number of facilities
for which the annual reportable amount would be limited to 500 pounds. Where range reporting was used, EPA assumed
actual releases to be the midpoint of 250 pounds; thus, facilities with actual releases below this amount would be
excluded if reporting for more than two media types.

Impact of other regulatory requirements
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Many commenters pointed out that burden is also a function of ``piggyback'' state or federal requirements that reference
TRI reporting as a trigger for additional reporting, submission of fees, or development of facility plans for pollution
prevention. Commenters urge EPA to clearly state that those who take advantage of the alternate threshold are not
considered to be ``covered facilities'' and should not be subject to additional ``piggyback'' regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in unit III.E.1. of this preamble, the covered facility determination relative to these other requirements
is a chemical-specific determination. If all potential Form R reports can be converted to certification statements,
EPA estimates that approximately 3,800 facilities would no longer be ``covered facilities'' for purposes of Form
R reporting. In addition, approximately 6,000 other facilities would be eligible to convert one or more of their Form
R reports to a certification statement (Ref. 4). However, facilities that can take advantage of the alternate threshold
are required to report under EPCRA section 313 for purposes of submission of the alternate threshold certification
statement for a specific chemical. The ultimate mitigation of the burden associated with the piggyback requirements
will relate to the specific way in which those requirements reference TRI submitters or forms.

G. Effective Date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters suggested that EPA consider alternatives to the effective date of the proposal. Suggestions included
a retroactive date corresponding to the effective date of EPCRA, in essence applying the alternate threshold to all
past reports under section 313. Others felt that no delays in promulgating this rule should prevent its application
in reporting year 1995. Another commenter indicated that EPA should deliberate as long as is necessary to complete
the analysis that supports this rule, while a few commenters requested that the effective date of the rule be applied
to reporting year 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Contingent upon OMB approval, the alternate threshold rule is effective for reporting on activities beginning January
1, 1995, with the first receipt of certifications due on or before July 1, 1996. EPA will publish a technical amendment
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 when the reporting additions have been approved by OMB. As with any major changes in reporting requirements, EPA believes
that both the regulated community, EPA, and the states require time to understand and prepare for implementing this
change. The regulated community will need an opportunity to become fully aware of the alternate threshold and understand
how it can apply to their data development and their own data management systems for TRI compliance purposes. EPA and
the states need time to make necessary modifications in data systems to incorporate the certification statements.
Also, changes to the Agency's automated reporting software have to be made and tested in order to add the certification
statement feature.

A. Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines as ``significant'' those regulatory actions likely
to lead to a rule (1) Having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting
a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local
or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious
inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering
the budgetary impacts of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues
arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is ``significant'' because of the
novel policy issues arising out of the statutory mandate to maintain reporting on a substantial majority of releases
if the reporting threshold under section 313(f)(1) is modified. This action was submitted to OMB for review, as required
by Executive Order 12866, and any comments or changes made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations have
been documented in the public record. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has prepared a Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) in conjunction with this rulemaking. A copy of this document (titled
``Regulatory Impact Analysis of the Final Rule for the Alternate Threshold for EPCRA Section 313 Reporting'') is
available in the TSCA Nonconfidential Information Center (NCIC) (also known as the TSCA Public Docket Office), for
review and copying (see unit IV. of this preamble). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has estimated that the alternate threshold will generate $19 million a year in savings. The savings from the final
rule differ from the savings from the proposed rule because the basis of the facility category has been changed from
releases and transfers to annual reportable amounts, and the level has been changed from 100 pounds to 500 pounds.
These differences are shown in Table 2 below. EPA is issuing a final rule to add chemicals and chemical categories to
the EPCRA section 313 list. The alternate threshold is estimated to save an additional $3 million per year for reporting
on these additional chemicals. Further information on the chemical additions will be presented the

The savings described in Table 2 above are only related to those actions that are required under EPCRA section 313.
There are other requirements that are linked to reporting under EPCRA section 313, but that are not required by it.
EPA is aware of 13 states that place a fee or tax on facilities that file a Form R or report to EPA under EPCRA section 313,
and 7 states that mandate pollution prevention plans from such facilities. EPA has also created special requirements
for certain facilities with NPDES storm water permits that report under EPCRA section 313. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The alternate threshold may also create savings related to the linked requirements. Since a facility that can take
advantage of the alternate threshold is not a ``covered facility'' for purposes of a specific Form R submission, the
linkage to state requirements may no longer hold. This will not necessarily increase net social benefits, because
the linked fees and taxes are transfers (and there will be a corresponding decrease in state revenues), and the benefits
of covering these facilities under the pollution prevention planning requirements may be lost. Moreover, these
states may choose to reimpose the linked requirements, even if the facilities have not filed a Form R.

(a) With respect to the manufacture, process, or otherwise use of a toxic chemical, the owner or operator of a facility
may apply an alternate threshold of 1 million pounds per year to that chemical if the owner or operator calculates that
the facility would have an annual reportable amount of that toxic chemical not exceeding 500 pounds for the combined
total quantities released at the facility, disposed within the facility, treated at the facility (as represented
by amounts destroyed or converted by treatment processes), recovered at the facility as a result of recycle operations,
combusted for the purpose of energy recovery at the facility, and amounts transferred from the facility to off-site
locations for the purpose of recycle, energy recovery, treatment, and/or disposal. These volumes correspond to
the sum of amounts reportable for data elements on EPA Form R (EPA Form 9350-1; Rev. 12/4/93) as Part II column B or sections
8.1 (quantity released), 8.2 (quantity used for energy recovery on-site), 8.3 (quantity used for energy recovery
off-site), 8.4 (quantity recycled on-site), 8.5 (quantity recycled off-site), 8.6 (quantity treated on-site),
and 8.7 (quantity treated off-site). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) If an owner or operator of a facility determines that the owner or operator may apply the alternate reporting threshold

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992, the Secretary is required to establish
housing goals to direct the purchase of mortgages by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) and
the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) on: housing for low- and moderate-income families; housing
located in central cities, rural areas and other underserved areas; and housing meeting the needs of and affordable
to low-income families in low-income areas and very low-income families. By Notices published on October 13, 1993,
the Secretary established housing goals for 1993 and 1994. This final rule temporarily extends into 1995 the 1994
housing goals that were established by the Secretary for Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. The Secretary will soon propose
regulations that will include adjusted housing goals for 1995. When these new 1995 goals are established by final
regulation, the 1994 goals extended through this action will be superseded for the remainder of the year, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
the new goals will be established ``short year,'' so that the Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are not expected to perform
under the new goals for the entire year. The goals shall be applied using the same requirements set forth in the Notices
of Interim Housing Goals and as clarified subsequently by the Department.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Justification for Final Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In general, the Department publishes a rule for public comment before issuing a rule for effect, in accordance with
its own regulations on rulemaking, 24 CFR part 10. However, the Administrative Procedure Act (see 5 U.S.C. 553) and
part 10 provide for exceptions from that general rule where the agency finds good cause to omit advance notice and public
participation. The good cause requirement is satisfied when prior public procedure is ``impracticable, unnecessary,
or contrary to the public interest.'' (24 CFR 10.1) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department finds that good cause exists to publish this rule for effect without first soliciting public comment,
in that prior public procedure is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to public interest. The rule merely ensures
that housing goals are established under which the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and the Federal National
Mortgage Association (together, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are referenced throughout this text as ``Government-Sponsored
Enterprises'' or ``GSEs'') will be accountable for carrying out their statutory and charter responsibilities.
A critical need exists to ensure continued applicability of housing goals pending the establishment of new housing
goals through notice-and-comment rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary currently is in the process of issuing a proposed regulation that will establish housing goals from
the date established when such regulation becomes final, some time in 1995. That final regulation will replace this
rule. Accordingly, the housing goals extended through this rule will only apply to that portion of 1995 that precedes
the effective date of that rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
This Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This rule extends the housing goals for the GSEs' purchase of mortgages on housing for low- and moderate-income families,
housing located in central cities, and housing meeting the needs of and affordable to low-income families in low-income
areas and very low-income families. The housing goals being extended were established by the Secretary and promulgated
as Notices of Interim Housing Goals (58 FR 53048 and 53072; October 13, 1993). The requirements of the Notices, including
any clarifications issued by the Secretary, will also apply to the housing goals continued for 1995 by this action.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the housing goals for low- and moderate-income families and for housing located in central cities, this rule extends
the Notices' goals into 1995. Accordingly, the housing goal for each GSE's purchases of mortgages financing housing
for low- and moderate-income families is 30 percent of the total number of dwelling units financed by each GSE's mortgage
purchases. For central cities, the housing goal for each GSE's purchases of mortgages financing housing located
in central cities is 30 percent of the total number of dwelling units financed by each GSE's mortgage purchases. These
goals shall apply on a proportional basis for that portion of 1995 before permanent goals are established and effective
following rulemaking.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The goals for special affordable housing (i.e., housing meeting the needs of and affordable to low-income families
in low-income areas and very low-income families) applicable to each GSE were established under the Federal Housing
Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992, 12 U.S.C. 4501&hyph;4641 (the 1992 Act), and the Interim
Notices as two-year goals covering 1993 and 1994. This rule extends the 1993&hyph;1994 special affordable housing
goals for each GSE into 1995 and provides that the goals for 1995 shall be as described below. The special affordable
housing goals established under this rule also shall apply on a proportional basis to that portion of 1995 before permanent
goals are established and effective following rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The level of the two-year (1993&hyph;1994) special affordable housing goal for each GSE was established at a dollar
amount above and beyond a 1992 baseline. The GSEs were asked to provide the Secretary with a good-faith estimate of
the dollar amount of each enterprise's 1992 mortgage purchases that would have qualified under the special affordable
housing goal if the goal had applied to 1992 purchases. Fannie Mae estimated that in 1992 it purchased $7.1965 billion
of mortgages that would have qualified toward the special affordable housing goal had it applied. Freddie Mac estimated
that in 1992 it purchased $5.214 billion of mortgages that would have qualified toward the special affordable housing
goal had it applied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1993&hyph;1994 special affordable housing goal for Fannie Mae was then established as twice the 1992 baseline
($14.393 billion) plus $2 billion_the minimum amount of the goal for the transition period established for Fannie
Mae under the 1992 Act_for a two-year goal of $16.393 billion. The 1993&hyph;1994 special affordable housing goal
for Freddie Mac was then established as twice the 1992 baseline ($10.428 billion) plus $1.5 billion_the minimum amount
of the goal for the transition period established for Freddie Mac under the 1992 Act_for a two-year goal of $11.928
billion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary recognizes that in 1995 the dollar amount of conventional mortgages originated will be substantially
lower than the amount originated in 1992. HUD estimates that there will be a reduction in conventional originations
of at least one-third between the 1992 market ($819 billion) and the 1995 mortgage market (an estimated $510 billion).
In addition, seasonality is an important factor in the mortgage markets_fewer mortgages are originated in the first
quarter of the year than in any other quarter. These goals are likely to be in place for only a portion of 1995, including
that quarter for which mortgage originations are the lowest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of these two factors_the large reduction in the size of the mortgage market and the seasonality of originations_the
Secretary has appropriately revised the baseline applicable to the special affordable housing goals that will be
in place for 1995. The Secretary has reduced the baselines for each enterprise by 50 percent. The 1995 goal for Fannie
Mae is $4.598 billion (the revised baseline plus $1 billion, half of the two-year goal under the 1992 Act). The 1995
goal for Freddie Mac is $3.357 billion (the revised baseline plus $750 million, half of the goal for Freddie Mac under
the 1992 Act).

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Since 1968, the Secretary has had general regulatory authority and specific regulatory authorities respecting
Fannie Mae. Since 1989, pursuant to the Financial Institution Reform Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (Pub.L.
101&hyph;73, approved August 9, 1989) (``FIRREA''), the Secretary has had the same regulatory authorities respecting
Freddie Mac. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1992 Act substantially changed the Secretary's regulatory authorities respecting the GSEs. The 1992 Act increased
and detailed the Secretary's authority to establish, monitor performance under, and enforce annual goals for mortgage
purchases by the GSEs of mortgages financing: (1) housing for low- and moderate-income families; (2) housing located
in central cities, rural areas, and other underserved areas; and (3) housing meeting the needs of and affordable to
low-income families in low-income areas and very low-income families. (See generally sections 1331&hyph;49 of
the 1992 Act.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1992 Act provided for a transition period of 1993 and 1994, for which the Act established annual targets for the
purchases by both GSEs of mortgages financing housing for low- and moderate-income families and housing located
in central cities. These transition targets were set at the same percentages provided under HUD regulations applicable
to Fannie Mae that were issued in 1978. Accordingly, the 1992 Act set the transition targets at 30 percent of the mortgage
purchases of the GSEs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1992 Act provided that, for the transition period, in cases where a GSE was not meeting its 30 percent target as of
January 1, 1993, the Secretary was to establish annual goals so that the GSE would improve its performance relative
to the target annually and, to the maximum extent feasible, would meet the target at the conclusion of the transition
period. The 1992 Act also established dollar goals for the GSEs' purchases of mortgages financing special affordable
housing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 22, 1993, in accordance with requirements in the 1992 Act, the Secretary provided the GSEs with an opportunity
to review and comment on the proposed interim goals. Subsequently, HUD staff met with representatives of both GSEs
for discussion of the comments received, after which the GSEs provided additional comments to the Department. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to sections 1332(d)(3), 1333(d)(4), and 1334(d)(3) of the 1992 Act, on October 13, 1993 (58 FR 53048 and 53061)
(``October 13 Notice''), the Secretary published two notices in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 establishing the interim goals for each GSE_applicable to the transition years of 1993 and 1994_and requirements
for implementation of the goals. Since neither GSE was meeting its targets as of the beginning of the transition period,
the goals were established so that the GSEs would, to the maximum extent feasible, meet the targets by the end of the
transition period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The October 13 Notice established Fannie Mae's low- and moderate-income housing goal at 30 percent of the units financed
by mortgages purchased by Fannie Mae in 1993 and 1994. The notice also established Fannie Mae's central cities goal
at 28 percent of units financed by mortgages purchased by Fannie Mae in 1993, and 30 percent in 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The October 13 Notice established Freddie Mac's low- and moderate-income housing goal at 28 percent for 1993 and 30
percent for 1994. The notice also established Freddie Mac's goal for purchases of mortgages financing housing located
in central cities at 26 percent for 1993 and 30 percent for 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The October 13 Notice established the Special Affordable Housing Goals as two-year goals for the GSEs' purchases
of conventional mortgages on rental and owner-occupied housing meeting the then-existing unaddressed needs of,
and affordable to, low-income families in low-income areas and very low-income families. This goal for Fannie Mae
was established as not less than 2 billion dollars ($2,000,000,000) above Fannie Mae's existing performance and
commitments. This goal for Freddie Mac was established as not less than 11/2 billion dollars ($1,500,000,000) above
Freddie Mac's existing performance and commitments.

Basis for Secretary's Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary is empowered to extend the housing goals under section 1321 of the 1992 Act, which confers on the Secretary
general regulatory authority and the authority to ``make such rules and regulations as shall be necessary and proper''
to ensure that the purposes of the 1992 Act and the purposes of the Fannie Mae Charter Act and the Freddie Mac Act are accomplished.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1331 of the 1992 Act provides that the Secretary shall establish housing goals by regulation. Section 1331
also provides that from year to year the Secretary may adjust any housing goal by regulation. Section 1349 of the 1992
Act provides that any final regulations necessary to implement the provisions of the 1992 Act relating to the housing
goals shall be issued after notice and opportunity for public comment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule does not involve either an establishment of goals or an adjustment of existing goals; it involves an extension
of established goals for which the GSEs were invited to comment. (In the case of the special affordable housing goal,
only the baseline is revised appropriately to reflect market conditions and seasonality.) The Secretary will soon
propose final regulations implementing the Secretary's responsibilities under the 1992 Act, including establishing
new housing goals. Those regulations will be proposed for public comment. However, those regulations will not be
effective by the beginning of 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, issuance of this final rule is essential to assure that the GSEs continue carrying out their Charter purposes
pending rulemaking. The Fannie Mae Charter Act (12 U.S.C. 1716

) establish identical purposes for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, including ``provid[ing] ongoing assistance to the
secondary market for residential mortgages (including activities relating to mortgages on housing for low- and
moderate-income families involving a reasonable economic return that may be less than the return earned on other
activities) by increasing the liquidity of mortgage investments and improving the distribution of investment capital
available for residential mortgage financing;'' and ``promot[ing] access to mortgage credit throughout the Nation

appropriate revisions to the 1992 baseline for the goals as set forth herein. In establishing the levels of these housing
goals for 1995, the Secretary has considered the level of estimated mortgage originations in 1995 and that these goals

to the special affordable housing goals, from the 1992 baselines, so that the goals result in the following dollar
amounts: The 1995 goal for Fannie Mae shall be $4.598 billion and the 1995 goal for Freddie Mac shall be $3.357 billion.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department expands its rules on Super Bowl tours to cover air tours to other types of special events. The new rule
requires that operators of tours to special events that are promoted as including admission to the event must have
those event tickets in hand or under contract before they advertise or sell the tours, and that they must refund the
entire tour price to any customer who does not receive a promised event ticket. This rule also extends the charter rule's
prohibition on last-minute price increases to non-charter special event tours. This initiative arises as a result
of problems on certain tours to the 1994 Rose Bowl on which participants did not receive game tickets that were promoted
as being included in the package, or were required to make additional payments in order to receive tickets.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In conjunction with the Rose Bowl football game that was played in Pasadena, California on January 1, 1994, a large
number of fans of the University of Wisconsin (one of the two teams participating in the game) purchased package tours
to California. Many of those tours were promoted as including a ticket to the Rose Bowl game. However, a significant
number of these individuals either did not receive the game tickets that they had been promised and did not gain admission
to the game, or were required to make an additional payment after they arrived in Pasadena in order to obtain their tickets.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On January 27, 1994, the Department issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in this proceeding (published
February 1, 1994; 59 FR 4614). In this notice, we stated that we were tentatively proposing to issue a new rule which
would contain the procedures of the Department's rules on Super Bowl tours and extend these rules to include air tours
to other types of special events where admission to the event is advertised as being included in the package. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department's rules on Super Bowl tours are contained in Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 380 and
section 399.87. These rules came about following problems with game tickets for Super Bowl tours in the late 1970's
(see 45 FR 1856, January 9, 1980). The rules were limited to the Super Bowl because that was the only event where such
problems had surfaced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part 380 contains the rules for Super Bowl tours on Public Charter flights: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 380.2 defines a Super Bowl charter as a charter flight that is represented by its charter operator as
including tickets to the National Football League's Super Bowl game as part of its ground package. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 380.18a states that a Super Bowl charter may not be advertised unless the operator has submitted verification
to the Department
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 that the operator (1) is in physical possession of enough Super Bowl game tickets to provide them for a substantial
number of seats on the charter, or (2) has a contract with the NFL or with an NFL team for such a number of game tickets,
or (3) has a contract with another person who has a contract with the NFL or an NFL team for such a number of game tickets.

References to ``the Board'' in Part 380 refer to the Civil Aeronautics Board, the Department's predecessor in aviation
economic and consumer matters. The Department of Transportation now administers this rule as authorized by the Civil
Aeronautics Board Sunset Act of 1984 (P.L. 98&hyph;443; 98 Stat. 1703).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Section 380.18a also states that a Super Bowl charter may not be sold unless the operator has submitted verification
to the Department that the operator has possession of, or contracts for, enough game tickets to provide one to every
person who is to receive one under the terms of the operator/participant contract for the charter.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Section 380.31(c) states that if an operator receives a booking for which he or she does not have possession
of or a contract for a game ticket, the operator must return that participant's money within 3 days, unless the participant
has authorized the operator in writing to retain the payment while the operator seeks additional tickets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Sections 380.32(s), 380.33(a)(5) and 380.33(e) state that if Super Bowl game tickets are not supplied when
promised, the affected participant must be sent a refund of the price of the entire charter package within 14 days after
the return flight. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the Super Bowl rules in Part 380, the Department has a policy statement at 14 CFR section 399.87 which
states that it shall be an unfair or deceptive practice within the meaning of section 411 of the Federal Aviation Act
[now 49 U.S.C. &sect;41712] to advertise or sell an air tour that is promoted as including a ticket to the Super Bowl
game unless the operator has tickets or contracts for tickets in the manner described in 14 CFR 380.18a (see above).
The principal purpose of this policy statement is to reach tours operated on scheduled air service, which are not covered
by the Part 380 charter rules. The Part 399 policy statement mirrors section 380.18a, but does not include the other
Part 380 provisions described above. Most importantly, it does not include the requirement that the entire tour price
be refunded if a game ticket is not provided. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Like current section 399.87, the new rule tentatively proposed in the ANPRM would apply to tours on all forms of air
transportation, not just charters. Like the existing Super Bowl charter rules in Part 380, it would require the tour
operator to refund the entire tour price to any participant who does not receive a promised event ticket, even if the
tour were not on a charter. The proposed rule would also pick up the procedures of section 380.31(c) of the charter rule,
which requires an operator to refund any money received for a booking within 3 days if the operator has no contract for
an event ticket for that person, unless the person has authorized the operator in writing to retain the payment while
the operator seeks a ticket.

Comments on the ANPRM 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department received comments from 11 organizations and 7 individuals. The great majority of the comments favored
adoption of a rule in this area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the subject of the type of special event that should be covered by the rule, several of the comments discussed only
sports events as the context for the rule. Other commenters stated that the context of the rule should be broader than
that. The American Society of Travel Agents (ASTA) said that it should apply to all events where a separately-purchased
ticket is necessary for admission to the event. The RG Travel Companies, which were involved in sending 1,700 Wisconsin
fans to the 1994 Rose Bowl, stated that the rule should cover any special event ``where a good possibility exists that
the demand for tickets will exceed the supply&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*'' In a similar vein, the Pasadena Tournament
of Roses commented that the rule should apply to any event with limited admission. The National Tour Association (NTA,
representing motorcoach tour operators) and Congressman Robert Andrews of New Jersey expressed the opinion that
the rule should not be limited to sports events. Ms. Arlene Caldwell said that the rule should cover any tour that claims
to include a ticket to the event, and Mr. Donald Hamilton stated that it should apply to any event for which tour packages
are sold. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All of the commenters that expressed an opinion on whether the rule should apply to both charter and scheduled transportation
felt that it should apply to both forms of air service. Those commenters were the RG Travel Companies, NACA, the NHL,
ASTA, the NCAA, FBA, the Pasadena Tournament of Roses, and the Wisconsin Attorney General.

The ANPRM asked whether the rule should contain only the advertising and sale restrictions of sections 380.18a and
399.87 of the current Super Bowl rule, or whether it should also contain the ``money back guarantee'' of sections 380.32
and 380.33 and/or the ``booking rejection'' and ``contingent booking'' procedures of section 380.31(c). Except
for NTA, all commenters that expressed a position on this question felt that some form of regulation along these lines
was appropriate. NTA stated that the majority of its members that responded to a poll on this matter felt that regulation
of special-event tours should not be a responsibility of the government, but the association said that in the event
a rule is adopted it favors the ``booking rejection'' and ``contingent booking'' procedures of section 380.31(c).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ASTA and the Wisconsin Attorney General also expressed support for the ``booking rejection'' and ``contingent booking''
procedures. They favored the ``money back guarantee'' as well, as did the RG Travel Companies, the National Air Carrier
Association (NACA, an organization of charter airlines), the NHL, NCAA, FBA, and Pasadena Tournament of Roses. The
Tournament of Roses stated that this guarantee should apply ``at any time prior to departure'' if it is clear tickets
will not be forthcoming. FBA commented ``the greater the remedy available, the less likely that tour packagers will
create the problem by promoting packages that may not be legitimate.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NACA said that there should be an exception to the ``money back guarantee'' for situations of force majeure and acts
of God, such as the earthquake in San Francisco that forced postponement of the World Series. Similarly, the NHL stated
that if the event is canceled or substantially altered after the tour begins, consumers should be entitled only to
a refund of the face value of the event ticket, but that if such cancellation or alteration takes place before departure,
the operator should be required to inform the consumers, who would have the right to cancel (presumably with a full
refund). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congressman Andrews was also in favor of the ``money back guarantee,'' as well as a requirement for tour operators
to disclose whether event tickets are guaranteed or tentative. However, he stated that any rule that would totally
prohibit marketing of a special-event tour until the tour operator has event tickets in hand would not be practical.
Tickets for many such events are not available until less than two weeks before the event, he pointed out, but other
arrangements (e.g., air and hotel) must be made before that. NTA, the NCAA and the Wisconsin Attorney General stated
that the current restrictions against marketing Super Bowl tours until the operator has game tickets in hand or under
contract should be included in the new rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In discussing the ``money-back guarantee,'' the ANPRM asked if the rule should contain procedures to protect the
operator from having to refund the entire tour price if a participant doesn't receive promised admission to something
like a welcoming cocktail party. Of those who commented on the issue, NTA, the NHL, ASTA, the Pasadena Tournament of
Roses said that operators should not be required to refund the entire tour price over failure to provide something
like a promised welcoming cocktail party. NACA and the Wisconsin Attorney General stated that the rule should require
the value of undelivered ancillary events to be refunded, but should not require a refund of the entire tour price.
FBA and the Wisconsin Attorney General both pointed out that certain events on a special event tour (e.g., the Tournament
of Roses parade on a Rose Bowl tour) are integral to the experience for which the tour was organized while other events
on the same tour (e.g., a side trip to Disneyland) are not. These two commenters suggest that integral events be protected
by the ``money back guarantee'' of the total tour price, but not other events.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ANPRM sought comment on whether the rule should ban last-minute or post-departure price increases for admission
to the event, one of the problems that allegedly occurred on the 1994 Rose Bowl tours. All commenters who offered an
opinion on this subject felt that last-minute price increases should be regulated in some manner. The RG Travel Companies,
NACA, the NCAA, ASTA, the Wisconsin Attorney General and Mr. Donald Hamilton stated that last-minute price increases
should be banned. FBA and the Pasadena Tournament of Roses said that price increases at any time following purchase
should be prohibited unless the consumer receives written notice that the operator reserves this right. The Pasadena
Tournament of Roses also suggested that participants who cancel within a few days of notification of a price increase
be entitled to a full refund. The Wisconsin Attorney General commented that on tours to special events, ``last-minute
or post-departure price increases are common and are tantamount to extortion'' because other options may be sold
out. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NHL stated that, in general, price increases should be banned unless the face value of the ticket has been increased
subsequent to departure of the tour. However, for events with short lead times such as the Stanley Cup playoffs, the
NHL said that the rule should permit tours on which participants are required to agree to purchase event tickets at
the yet-unknown face price plus a service fee, as long as the consumer is given prominent notice of this fact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some tours are promoted in conjunction with a special event, but do not include, and do not represent that they include,
admission to the event. For example, there have been tours to the Super Bowl host city during the Super Bowl weekend
that prominently feature ``Super Bowl'' in the headline of advertisements and flyers, but which do not include game
tickets. The ANPRM asked whether the new rule should ban this practice, or require affirmative, prominent disclosure
that admission to the event is not included. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All of the commenters that expressed an opinion on this issue felt that it should be regulated in some manner. The RG
Travel Companies stated that they favored either banning the practice or requiring disclosure. The NCAA urged affirmative,
prominent disclosure, ``if such tours are to be allowed at all.'' All others who commented on this point recommended
prominent disclosure. The NHL and Pasadena Tournament of Roses submitted specific suggestions for minimum required
typeface size for advertisements for such tours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ANPRM solicited comment on the economic burdens of such a rule, and asked whether it would be impractical for events
where the participants are known only a week in advance, e.g. the NCAA Final Four. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All of the parties that commented on this issue agreed that the rule can and should apply to events in which the participants
are not known until shortly before the event. The RG Travel Companies commented that commitments centering around
a particular team could be made contingent on that team qualifying for the event. The NHL stated that the rule may be
burdensome for organizers of short-lead-time tours, but that this is justified by the benefit to consumers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ASTA, like NACA, said that the degree of advance notice is not relevant, and that an operator who markets an event-oriented
tour before the participants are known should simply disclose that event tickets are not included in the advertised
price. FBA commented that participating teams in college bowl games are generally known at least a month in advance,
and also that any experience the Department has had with Super Bowl tours would be instructive, as the competing teams
in that game are sometimes determined only a week before the game. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters pointed out that even though the participating teams in the NCAA Final Four (the example given
in the ANPRM) are determined only the weekend before, the tickets are sold out months beforehand. Thus, the fact that
the participants are not known until the final week has minimal impact on the availability of tickets and the feasibility
of tours. The Pasadena Tournament of Roses asserted that any economic burden resulting from this rule would fall on
ticket brokers and tour operators who buy event tickets from individuals in order to resell them. The Wisconsin Attorney
General stated that consumer protection may be even more important in cases where event participants are determined
at the last minute, because consumers have less time to investigate their options. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Air Transport Association (ATA, an association of large scheduled airlines) filed a comment stating that it expressed
no opinion about whether, or to what extent, the current Super Bowl rules should be made applicable to tours to other
special events. However, ATA said that DOT should not make air carriers responsible for assuring that tour operators
comply with the new rule. NACA echoed this view, stating that carriers should not be made the guarantors of tour operators.

The Department issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in this proceeding on October 6, 1994 (published October 13,
1994; 59 FR 51881). The proposed rule was very similar to that described in the ANPRM, which in turn closely tracks the
existing rules for Super Bowl tours.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The rule proposed in the NPRM would apply to any tour that is organized for the purpose of attending a sporting, social,
religious, educational, cultural, political or other event of a special nature and limited duration, which exists
for reasons apart from the tour itself, and which is represented by the operator of the tour as including admission
to that event. We stated that we did not wish to engage in line-drawing of the type that would be required were we to publish
a list of specific events that would be covered by the rule. In addition, we said in the NPRM that we saw no justification
for limiting the applicability of the rule to sporting events. Few commenters specifically suggested such a limitation,
although a number of them offered sports contests as examples of the type of event that should be covered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We stated that we agreed with the comments that suggested that the rule should apply to any event where a separate ticket
is required for admission to the event or where there is limited admission. The proposed rule would apply to any tour
to an event of the type described at the beginning of the previous paragraph in which the tour operator has represented
that the tour includes admission to the event. If the event is free, or attendance is unlimited, the operator should
have no trouble furnishing tickets and this rule will impose no burden. On the other hand, if tours are promoted to an
unusually popular event of a non-sporting nature, those tour participants would be just as disappointed at not receiving
the promised admission to the event that constituted the entire purpose of their trip as would a fan traveling to a bowl
game. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We tentatively concluded in the NPRM that the rule should apply to both charter and scheduled air transportation,
as well as to any other form of air service meeting the statutory definition of ``air transportation'' that may develop
in the future. Thus, we proposed to apply it to ``scheduled, charter, and other air transportation.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would apply to all interstate (i.e., domestic)
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 air transportation, and to foreign (i.e., international) air transportation originating at a point within the United
States. Applying the rule only to outbound international flights is consistent with the approach taken in the existing
Public Charter rule (see 14 CFR 380.23) and with the ``country of origin'' concept of regulation of international
air transportation. As a policy matter, the Department has less of an interest in applying this rule to tours originating
in foreign countries whose participants are largely or exclusively foreign citizens.

The statutory term ``overseas air transportation,'' which referred to domestic transportation to or from U.S. territories
or possessions, was abolished in a recent recodification of transportation laws. Such transportation is now included
in the definition of ``interstate air transportation,'' and consequently would be covered by this proposed rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The rule that we proposed would apply to any operator of a tour that meets the rule's definition of a Special Event Tour,
regardless of whether that operator is a direct air carrier (i.e., an airline), an indirect air carrier (e.g., a Public
Charter operator), or a ticket agent (as defined in 49 U.S.C. &sect;40102, e.g., a scheduled-service tour operator,
including a travel agent acting as a tour operator). The proposed rule would apply to both U.S. and foreign entities
that act as operators of Special Event Tours, just as current &sect;399.87 does. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the comments of ATA and NACA, neither the ANPRM nor the NPRM proposed that this rule should include provisions
that obligate direct air carriers to assure that tour operators comply with the rule. Except where an airline might
choose to directly operate a Special Event Tour (i.e., to become the tour operator), a direct air carrier of a Special
Event Tour would incur no greater or lesser obligations under this rule than it has in its capacity as a common carrier
either certificated under 49 U.S.C. &sect;41101 or holding a foreign air carrier permit issued under 49 U.S.C. &sect;41301
(formerly sections 401 and 402 of the Federal Aviation Act). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As we had suggested in the ANPRM, the NPRM proposed to carry over the provisions from the existing Super Bowl rule that
prohibit advertising or sale of such tours before game tickets are in hand or under contract. These provisions would
be expanded to apply to all special events. This approach was supported by the comments on the ANPRM, and involves no
novel processes since the existing procedures have been in place in the Super Bowl rule for 15 years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the provision that prohibits advertising or sale of a Super Bowl tour until game tickets are in hand or
under contract, the Super Bowl charter rule requires Super Bowl charter operators to include in the prospectus that
is required to be filed with the Department for all Public Charters a certification that they have the game tickets
in hand or else a copy of the contract for the game tickets. We did not propose to carry over this additional filing requirement
to the new rule. The underlying requirement to have the tickets or ticket contracts before advertising or sales commence
would remain and would be enforceable without the filing provision. Moreover, in those instances deemed necessary,
we have ample authority under 49 U.S.C. &sect;41708 (formerly section 407(a) of the Federal Aviation Act) to require
such information to be provided. The Super Bowl rules that apply to scheduled-service tours have never required a
filing of this type. Since the NPRM proposed consolidating regulation of this type of tour in a single rule, we stated
that we saw no justification for having a filing requirement for charter tours but not scheduled-service tours, nor
did we see a need to impose a new paperwork burden on scheduled-service tour operators. This tentative decision was
consistent with the Paperwork Reduction Act and with the Department's proposal in Docket 48341 (57 FR 42864) to eliminate
unnecessary paperwork burdens on charters.

Congressman Andrews expressed concern that any rule that would prohibit marketing of a tour until tickets are in hand
would not be practical, since tickets for many events are not available until a couple of weeks in advance but other
arrangements (e.g., air and hotel) must be made before that. However, neither the existing nor proposed rules requires
that tickets be in hand before marketing is allowed; the operator can simply have a written contract for the tickets.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule also incorporated the so-called ``booking rejection'' and ``contingent booking'' procedures
currently found in section 380.31(c) of the Super Bowl charter rule, and expanded them to apply to all events and to
all forms of air transportation. These provisions require operators to return unsolicited bookings for which they
don't have event tickets unless a tour participant authorizes the operator in writing to retain the participant's
payment while the operator attempts to obtain more event tickets. We are modifying this slightly to allow for situations
in which participants agree to take the tour without an event ticket; the operator would be required to obtain the participant's
written acknowledgment of this understanding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of the key provisions of the Super Bowl charter rule is the requirement for the operator to refund the total tour
price to any participant who does not receive a promised game ticket, even if the participant uses all of the other tour
features. The ANPRM tentatively proposed to incorporate this provision in the new rule, but also asked for comment
on whether the rule should contain only the ``booking rejection'' and ``contingent booking'' procedures without
the ``money back guarantee.'' However, the comments solidly supported the ``money back guarantee,'' and we incorporated
it in the proposed rule. We stated that we agreed with the Football Bowl Association that strong consumer remedies
will also have the effect of deterring the promotion of non-legitimate tour packages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its comments on the ANPRM, NACA stated that there should be an exception to the ``money back guarantee'' for situations
of force majeure and acts of God, such as the earthquake in San Francisco that caused postponement of the World Series
several years ago. The NHL suggested that if the event is canceled or substantially altered, participants should
be entitled only to a refund of the face value of the event, not the total tour price. We replied in the NPRM that it was
never our intent to make the tour operator the guarantor of the event itself. The ``money back guarantee'' in the existing
Super Bowl charter rule kicks in ``if game tickets are not supplied.'' The rule we proposed in October would require
refunds ``*&blank;*&blank;* if promised admission to the [event] is not furnished by the tour operator *&blank;*&blank;*''
These provisions are directed toward potential problems with ticket distribution, not with the event itself. If
people who have tickets are able to attend the event and Special Event Tour participants are shut out because they don't
have tickets, the ``money back guarantee'' would apply. On the other hand, if nobody with a ticket can use it during
the period of the tour because the event itself was canceled or postponed, the ``money back guarantee'' would not apply.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We stated in the NPRM that we wished to make it clear that we are talking only about problems with the event itself, not
about any or all problems that the tour operator might view as beyond its control. Failure of a ticket broker to deliver
tickets to the tour operator, we said, would not invalidate the ``money back guarantee.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the NPRM we stated that we agreed with the NHL that if the event is canceled consumers should receive a refund for the
portion of their tour price that applied to the event that they paid for but did not receive. However, we said, mandating
such a partial refund in a situation where the event itself did not take place and where there were no problems with ticket
distribution was beyond the scope of this proceeding, and would best be dealt with in the context of contract law or
other applicable existing law.

The ANPRM solicited comment on whether the rule should include procedures to protect the tour operator from having
to refund the total tour price to participants who don't receive promised admission to an ``event'' like a welcoming
cocktail party. Most commenters who addressed this issue were opposed to requiring a refund of the entire tour price
in these circumstances. Some suggested that participants so affected simply be entitled to a refund of the value of
that ancillary event. Two commenters urged that a tour operator's failure to deliver admission to ancillary events
that are integral to the experience for which the tour was organized (e.g., the Tournament of Roses parade on a Rose
Bowl tour) should entitle the participant to a refund of the total tour price. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In raising this issue in the ANPRM, the Department had intended to focus on the situation of a tour that would not normally
be thought of as a Special Event Tour but which held out admission to an ``event'' as one of its features, e.g., a welcoming
cocktail party on a 5-day package to the Bahamas. If the definition of ``special event'' had been broad, we were concerned
that the rule might have the effect of requiring refunds of the entire price on such tours after failure to deliver a
relatively minor and low-value component. The comments on the ANPRM shed light on another issue: multiple ``events''
on a true Special Event Tour. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We stated in the NPRM that we agreed with the commenters that failure to deliver a relatively minor feature should not
result in a refund of the total tour price. We also felt that this rule should be limited to tours that are organized around
an event, not to events that occur in the normal course of the typical vacation tour. Accordingly, in the NPRM we limited
the scope of the proposed rule in two ways. First, there was a definition of ``Special Event Tour'' in proposed &sect;381.5
which was broad yet specific; it limited the applicability of the rule to tours to sporting, social, religious, educational,
cultural, political or other event of a special nature and limited duration, which exist for reasons apart from the
tour itself. Second, the ``money back guarantee'' in proposed &sect;381.11 would apply only to the primary event
for which a Special Event Tour is organized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the ANPRM, the Department solicited comment on whether the rule should ban last-minute or post-departure price
increases, something which occurred on certain tours to the 1994 Rose Bowl. The great majority of the comments on this
subject favored banning such increases. Some commenters said no price increase should be permitted unless the tour
operator has reserved this right in writing and allows participants to cancel and receive a full refund in the event
of a price increase. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We stated in the NPRM that we had decided to incorporate into the proposed rule the price increase provisions of the
Department's Public Charter rule (14 CFR 380.33). While it is not our intent in this proceeding to address all potential
sources of consumer harm on Special Event Tours, the issue of price increases is directly related to the issue of ticket
availability. Almost any event ticket is procurable if the price is right; if we do not regulate price increases in
the Special Event Tour rule, tour operators would always be able to acquire event tickets at greatly inflated prices
and then simply increase the price to the participant to cover it. Since a ticket has been offered in this situation,
the ``money back guarantee'' would not come into play. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed provisions on price increases, modeled on similar provisions in the charter rule, state that if a given
participant is assessed price increases for the tour that in the aggregate are more than 10 percent above his or her
original tour price, the participant shall have the right to cancel and receive a full refund (i.e., no cancellation
penalties would apply). No price increases in any amount would be permitted less than 5 days before departure (as opposed
to 10 days in the charter rule, recognizing the fact that Special Event Tours often have shorter lead times than the
typical charter). This would eliminate both last-minute and post-departure price hikes. Finally, proposed &sect;381.11
specifies that the promised event ticket must be furnished at the price that was agreed to before departure or else
the operator is subject to the ``money back guarantee'' just as if he had not provided the ticket at all. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its comments on the ANPRM the NHL stated that for events with short lead times such as the Stanley Cup playoffs, the
rule should permit tours on which participants are required to agree to purchase event tickets at the yet-unknown
face price plus a service fee, as long as the consumer is given prominent notice of this fact. We replied in the NPRM that
as an initial matter, a tour would not be covered under this rule at all if the event ticket were simply held out as an option
rather than as a mandatory feature. However, where the participant must agree to buy the event ticket, such tours are
clearly Special Event Tours since the tour operator is representing that admission to the event is included in the
tour (even if the price of that admission is not yet known and consequently any price that is advertised for that tour
is not the full tour price).

However, nothing in the proposed rule would explicitly prohibit a transaction of this type. The operator would still
have to have the requisite number of event tickets under contract before advertising or sales could begin; in other
words, the variable must be price, not availability. Beyond that, the proposed rule requires that tour participants
must receive promised event tickets ``at the tour price agreed to before departure'' or else the participant is entitled
to a refund of the total tour price. If a participant agrees to a price consisting of a known value

 and the operator delivers the tour (including the event ticket) at that price, the operator has satisfied the requirements
of the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ANPRM sought comment on whether the rule would be impractical for events where the participants are known only
a week in advance, such as the NCAA Final Four. All of the parties that commented on this issue thought that this should
not be a problem, and that the rule should apply. As noted above, several commenters pointed out that the Final Four
sells out months in advance even though the participating teams are not determined until the week before. Also, as
FBA noted, the contestants in the Super Bowl have been determined only the week before on several occasions, and that
does not appear to have either harmed the marketability of Super Bowl tours or resulted in additional consumer problems.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Football Bowl Association (representing all 19 post-season college football bowl games) and the National Collegiate
Athletic Association filed comments repeating the support that these organizations had expressed for the rule in
their comments on the ANPRM. However, both organizations also expressed disagreement with the Department's tentative
decision not to apply the ``money back guarantee'' to secondary events on a Special Event Tour, such as a ticket to the
Tournament of Roses Parade on a Rose Bowl tour. The FBA stated that such events are part of the Bowl Game ambience and
might be just as important to some as tickets to the game itself. The NCAA said that in the case of multi-game tournaments,
questions may arise concerning whether the primary event is the entire tournament or only the final championship
game. The NCAA suggested that the words ``and tournaments'' be added to the list of examples of events contained in
&sect;381.5.

We will not adopt these suggestions. As we said in the NPRM, identifying the primary event on a Special Event Tour will
seldom be a matter of debate, but identifying secondary events that are ``integral to the experience'' of the tour
would be a far more subjective exercise. Tour participants who do not receive promised admission to a secondary event
may have a contractual right to a refund of the value of that event, and they can pursue that claim with the tour operator.
By declining to incorporate the commenters' suggestion in the rule we are not suggesting that a consumer would not
as a matter of contract law in certain circumstances be entitled to a full refund in situations other than failure to
receive a promised ticket to the primary event. We are merely not establishing as a matter of regulation a guarantee
of a full refund beyond those instances in which a ticket to the primary event is not provided. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As for multi-game tournaments, the rule as proposed should be able to deal with this situation. If the tour operator
held out admission to ``the NCAA Final Four,'' the operator would be obligated to provide tickets to all three Final
Four games (the two semi-final games plus the final). On the other hand, if what was held out was admission to the championship
game on Monday night, there would be no reason for tour participants to assume that they were also going to receive tickets
to the semi-final games on the previous Saturday. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the NPRM we proposed to incorporate in the new rule the provisions in the existing Public Charter rule on price increases
(14 CFR 380.33). These provisions allow participants to cancel and receive a full refund if the tour price is increased
more than 10 percent, and prohibit price increases in any amount during the last ten days before departure. We proposed
to apply the ban on price increases to the last five days before departure in the Special Event Tours rule, recognizing
that these tours often have shorter lead times than the typical charter. In comments on the NPRM the price increase
provisions were supported by the Football Bowl Association and the NCAA; there were no other comments on this point.
We are finalizing this provision as proposed except that for the ban on price increases we have decided to remain with
the ten-day period specified in the provision on which this requirement is modeled (&sect;380.33 of the charter rule)
rather than reducing it to five days in the Special Event Tours rule as proposed in the NPRM. Although Special Event
Tours may be organized on shorter notice than the typical charter, most Special Event Tours are marketed significantly
more than ten days before departure. Being presented with a price increase only five days before departure is unjustifiably
disruptive, and this is just as true of Special Event Tours as other tours. Operators of Public Charters to special
events have been subject to the ten-day requirement for years, and incorporating this provision in the Special Event
Tours rule should not constitute an unreasonable burden. In addition, the requirement to have tickets in hand or under
contract may result in fewer unanticipated cost increases for tour operators for this component of the tour. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ANPRM noted that some tours are promoted in conjunction with a special event, but do not include, and do not represent
that they include, admission to the event. The ANPRM solicited comment on whether the new rule should ban this practice,
or whether it should specify a form of required disclosure. Most of the comments on the ANPRM favored requiring disclosure
of the fact that an event ticket is not included. In the NPRM, however, we proposed not to regulate these tours. The FBA
and the NCAA have objected to this tentative decision; both organizations urge a disclosure requirement. We have
decided not to include a provision of this type. Consumers solicited for such tours are able to determine from the advertising
material that an event ticket is not held out as included; this is distinguishable from the situation of a tour participant
who paid for an event ticket and then didn't receive it. Should any particular tour deceptively imply that event tickets
are included when in reality they are not, the Department has authority to take enforcement action and will not hesitate
to do so. For example, 49 U.S.C. &sect;41712 (formerly section 411 of the Federal Aviation Act) prohibits unfair and
deceptive practices or unfair methods of competition, and 14 CFR 399.80(f) declares that it is unfair or deceptive
for a ticket agent to misrepresent fares, charges or services in connection with air transportation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania filed comments in support of the proposed rule. However,
he said that tour operators should be required to disclose the protections available under this rule to all tour participants,
in writing. He noted that such disclosure is currently required in section 380.32(s) of the Department's regulations,
but that the NPRM proposed to eliminate this provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 380.32(s) is one of the provisions of the Public Charter portion of the Super Bowl rule. The NPRM proposed to
rescind the Super Bowl rule, since it would be replaced by the new Part 381. A disclosure requirement for Part 381 of
the type suggested by the Pennsylvania Attorney General was not proposed in the ANPRM or the NPRM, or in any previous
comments in this proceeding. While section 380.32(s) has required specific disclosure of the protections of the
Super Bowl rule on charter flights, there has never been a corresponding requirement for tours on scheduled service,
and we see no reason to impose one now. The past notice for Super Bowl tours using charter air transportation had been
incorporated in the operator-participant contract, an extensive document that was already required on all publicly-sold
charters. There has been no required contract for Super Bowl tours (or other tours) on scheduled service, and we are
not aware of any problems related to lack of notice on past tours of this type. With our action here, which will apply
the protections of the new Part 381 broadly to all types of Special Event Tours on both scheduled and charter service,
we see no need for a requirement that specific notice be given consumers of the rule's protections.

The American Society of Travel Agents filed a comment urging the Department to adopt the rule as proposed. The Air Transport
Association reiterated the comment that it made in response to the ANPRM that it expressed no opinion about whether,
or to what extent, the current Super Bowl rules should be made applicable to tours to other special events. However,
ATA said that DOT should not make air carriers responsible for assuring that tour operators comply with the new rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Concerning ATA's comment, the ANPRM and the NPRM did not propose, and the final rule does not include, any provisions
that obligate direct air carriers to assure that tour operators comply with the rule. Except where an airline might
choose to directly operate a Special Event Tour (i.e., to become the tour operator), a direct air carrier of a Special
Event Tour will incur no greater or lesser obligations under this rule than it has in its capacity as a common carrier
either certificated under 49 U.S.C. 41101 or holding a foreign air carrier permit issued under 49 U.S.C. 41301 (formerly
sections 401 and 402 of the Federal Aviation Act). Of course, all direct air carriers will remain subject to 14 CFR 380.40
where charter air transportation is used, including charters that constitute Special Event Tours. Section 380.40
provides that a direct air carrier shall not perform a Public Charter unless it has made a reasonable effort to verify
that all provisions of the Public Charter rule (14 CFR Part 380) have been complied with and that the charter operator's
authority has not been suspended by the Department. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We received identical letters from the National Association of Ticket Brokers and 38 individual ticket brokers.
These commenters stated that the conditions of the proposed rule could not be met by either tour operators or ticket
brokers. They said that in most cases the venue would not have the event tickets in hand sufficiently in advance of the
event to make the proper distribution. They also commented that many venues will not deal with the ticket broker or
tour operator directly, thus requiring the latter entities to procure tickets on the secondary market. They indicated
that the proposed rule would have a chilling effect on the brokerage industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Event USA, a ticket agency and tour provider, commented that the proposed rule is broad and over-reaching. The January
1994 Rose Bowl problem was an isolated instance and did not represent a trend, this commenter claimed. According to
Event USA, for many events the tickets are not distributed until shortly before the event and there is no meaningful
prospect for contracts. ``[K]nowing what orders the operator has, he can then determine what to buy as they are physically
available, rather than buying those on a speculation basis.'' The commenter suggested that the rule be limited to
the ``money back guarantee'' and a requirement for tour operators to have a contract for event tickets with ``established
and reliable sources of tickets.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments of the ticket brokers have not persuaded us to decrease the level of protection proposed in the NPRM. The
rule does not require tour operators to have tickets in hand, as long as they have contracts (in the manner described
in the rule) for tickets. In addition, the rule does not require a tour operator to have a contract for all the tickets
it will ever need before it can begin advertising; advertising can commence as soon as the operator has contracts for
tickets for ``a substantial number of seats on the tour.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, before a tour operator sells someone a tour that includes a ticket to the event, the operator must have a contract
for the event ticket (or the ticket itself) for that individual. That is the entire point of the rule. It is designed
to make clear that tour operators must end the practice of selling something that they do not have rights to at the time
they sell it. This is consistent with Department deceptive practice rules (see 14 CFR 399.80 (c), (f) and (j)), as well
as rules that prohibit the sale of air transportation until the provider has the required authority (see 14 CFR 201.5
and 14 CFR 380.25(a)). To that extent, the process described by Event USA is backwards; we wish to make clear the fact
that we will not accept a situation where, on air tours that are promoted as including a ticket to a special event, the
tour operator sells seats on the tour first and then attempts to find enough event tickets for those customers. Indeed,
while the prohibition here is made specific to special events, such a deceptive practice has long been prohibited
in a broad sense under current regulations (see 14 CFR 399.80 (c), (f) and (j)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We note that the proposed requirement for tour operators to have event tickets in hand or under contract was supported
by the NCAA in its comments on the ANPRM. The Football Bowl Association (representing all 19 post-season college bowl
games) and the Pasadena Tournament of Roses, while not commenting specifically on the proposed requirement for firm
contracts or tickets in hand, did not take exception to this provision and urged adoption of the rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We can appreciate the concerns of many ticket brokers that they may not be able to conduct business with tour operators
in the same manner as they have in the past. However, it is also possible that the new Part 381 may influence a realignment
of the distribution channels traditionally tapped by tour operators, for example by creating a motivation for event
organizers to deal directly with ticket brokers or tour operators in order to facilitate the availability of tickets
for event participants who use air tours. Nevertheless, experience has shown that the existing system is fraught
with risk for consumers and that, when problems occur, significant inconvenience if not substantial financial harm
is likely. The rights of consumers to be adequately informed about an offer and to receive what they are promised outweighs
the concerns expressed by those who feel the new rule may alter the way they must do business. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We note that there is nothing in the new rule that would prevent a tour operator from obtaining a contract for event tickets
from a ticket broker who has obtained a written commitment from a series of individuals (e.g., alumni who are entitled
to tickets but who aren't going to the game) who in turn each have a written commitment for game tickets from the ultimate
distributor of the game tickets or an organization that receives such tickets directly from the distributor (e.g.,
a bowl committee, conference, or university). We would also like to emphasize that the rule applies only where a ticket
to the event has been held out as a component of the tour that is being purchased. Tour operators remain free to use the
same methods to obtain event tickets that they have in the past as long as they disclose that an event ticket is not a component
of the tour, and that the operator will attempt to obtain the event ticket for the participant on an ``as available''
basis. (Once the operator represents to a participant that he has found the participant an event ticket, however,
the operator must either have the ticket in hand or have a contract for it in the manner required by Part 381. In addition,
the ``money back guarantee'' in Part 381 will apply from the point that the operator has represented that he has located
and reserved a ticket for that individual.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, we are issuing the rule as proposed in the NPRM, except for a minor change in the language in &sect;381.7(c)
made for purposes of clarity and changing the ban on price increases in &sect;381.13 to apply to the last ten days before
departure instead of the last five days, consistent with the same provision in the Public Charter rule (14 CFR Part
380).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The seven day period will allow tour operators time to obtain ticket contracts that comply with the rule. A lengthier
period between the publication and effective dates is not called for. The final rule is virtually unchanged from the
proposed rule described in the NPRM; between the NPRM published in October and the ANPRM published last January, there
has been ample notice of the Department's intentions in this proceeding. Air tours to college football bowl games
have been popular in the past, and one such bowl was the reason that this rulemaking was initiated. The bowl season is
only weeks away, and it is important for the consumer protections of this rule to be put in place as soon as possible lest
consumers be financially harmed. The Department is already investigating several current special-event air tour
promotions and is concerned that the risk of harm is real and significant.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule is considered to be non-significant under DOT regulatory policies and procedures, 44 FR 11034. The proposal
would have minimal economic impact, and accordingly no regulatory evaluation has been prepared. It is not subject
to review by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs pursuant to Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NPRM has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and
it has been determined that it does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism
Assessment.

no event ticket has been reserved for him or her. This agreement shall specify whether the person has agreed to participate

If the two parties agree that the operator will attempt to acquire an event ticket, the agreement shall specify any
penalties that will apply if the individual later cancels because an event ticket did not become available. If the
operator notifies this person that an event ticket has become available, that person shall enjoy all the other protections
of this part from that time.

pursuant to &sect;381.13(a)), the operator must provide each tour participant affected in this way a refund of the
total tour price. This refund is to be provided within 14 calendar days after the scheduled return date of the tour.
