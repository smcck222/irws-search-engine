SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is amending the Federal meat inspection regulations by amending the
definition of ``meat'' to include as ``meat,'' product resulting from advanced meat/bone separation machinery
and recovery systems that do not crush, grind, or pulverize bones to remove attached skeletal tissue from the bones
of livestock carcasses and parts of carcasses. This final rule also establishes the criteria, including that for
calcium content, for meat from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and meat recovery systems to assure consistency
with the characteristics and composition of meat, and establishes compliance procedures and recordkeeping requirements
for the calcium content criteria. This action is being taken to update the definition of ``meat'' to acknowledge and
include as ``meat,'' product derived from the advances made in the modification of traditional mechanical means
of separating meat from the bones of livestock and the development of advanced recovery systems that do not involve
grinding, crushing, or pulverizing bones to remove the adhering skeletal tissue.

The Federal meat inspection regulations define meat in 9 CFR 301.2(rr) as follows: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The part of the muscle of any cattle, sheep, swine, or goats, which is skeletal or which is found in the tongue, in the
diaphragm, in the heart, or in the esophagus, with or without the accompanying and overlying fat, and the portions
of bone, skin, sinew, nerve, and blood vessels which normally accompany the muscle tissue and which are not separated
from it in the process of dressing. It does not include the muscle found in the lips, snout, or ears. This term, as applied
to products of equines, shall have a meaning comparable to that provided in this paragraph with respect to cattle,
sheep, swine, and goats.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal meat inspection regulations also establish a definition and standard of identity for a meat food product
called ``mechanically separated (species)'' (MS(S)) in 9 CFR 319.5. ``Species'' refers to the species of livestock,
e.g., beef or pork. At various times, this product has also been called mechanically deboned meat and mechanically
processed (species) product. This meat food product is defined as ``any finely comminuted product resulting from
the mechanical separation and removal of most of the bone from attached skeletal muscle of livestock carcasses and
parts of carcasses'' and meeting the other provisions specified in 9 CFR 319.5. This provision and other provisions
in the Federal meat inspection regulations provide, among other things, for: (1) A definition and standard that classifies
MS(S) as a meat food product, (2) limitations on the amount of MS(S) that can be used in permitted products (viz., 20
percent of the livestock and poultry product portion of the product), (3) prohibitions on the use of MS(S) in certain
products (e.g., baby food), (4) limitations on certain components of MS(S), e.g., bone particle size, bone content
(measured as calcium content), protein quality, and a maximum fat content and minimum protein content, (5) requirements
for handling and for the production of MS(S) under an approved quality control program, and (6) a requirement that
MS(S) be separately identified in the ingredients statement of a meat food product in which it is used (9 CFR 317.2(c)
and (f), 318.18, 319.5, and 319.6). FSIS' 1982 final rulemaking on MS(S) (47 FR 28214) indicates that the Agency determined
that material differences in the consistency and the composition of MS(S) place it outside the scope of product traditionally
defined as meat (9 CFR 301.2(rr)), and that its differences are such that it should be defined as a distinctive standardized
product. As such, it should be identified by a name that adequately differentiates it from meat, viz., MS(S). When
MS(S) is used in meat food products, it must be separately listed in the ingredients statement by its standardized
name, e.g., ``mechanically separated beef (or pork).'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS considered issues in regard to the lack of a regulatory definition and standard for certain poultry products
produced by mechanical deboning_products which are deemed to be similar to MS(S). Poultry products produced by mechanical
separation are similar to MS(S) in that they are finely comminuted and paste-like in consistency and form, and result
from the mechanical separation and removal of most of the bone from attached skeletal muscle and other tissue of poultry
carcasses and parts of carcasses. Over the years, the meat and poultry industries have referred to poultry product
produced by mechanical separation as ``mechanically deboned poultry'' and ``comminuted poultry,'' and have declared
the product as poultry or poultry meat (e.g., ``chicken'' and ``turkey meat'') on the labels of products in which they
are used as ingredients. The Agency first conducted a rulemaking regarding poultry products produced by mechanical
separation in 1969. In subsequent years, the amount of such product being manufactured and the number and range of
poultry products and meat food products in which it is used as an ingredient, has increased significantly. Moreover,
the Agency has gained a great deal of knowledge from its rulemakings regarding the livestock product resulting from
the mechanical separation and removal process, viz., MS(S). More recently, in a lawsuit,

definition and standard exist. The red meat sausage manufacturers have alleged that the disparate labeling situation
poses an unfair advantage for the manufacturers of mechanically separated poultry products.

Actions in Response to Labeling Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS considered the appropriate course for addressing these issues and initiated two actions in response to them.
FSIS published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on March 3, 1994 (59 FR 10230), which solicited comments and requested data on various tentative positions on poultry
products produced by mechanical separation. The second action was a proposed rule (59 FR 10246), also published on
March 3, 1994, on which this final rule is predicated, that focused on the meat product derived from the advances in
meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems that is comparable to ``meat'' as traditionally defined in
9 CFR 301.2(rr). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Taking into account the information and experience acquired since 1969 and current regulatory policies, FSIS reviewed
and reevaluated the existing poultry regulations, particularly in light of the labeling issues. As a result of its
review and reevaluation, the Agency now believes that the method of deriving boneless poultry products by the mechanical
separation and removal of most of the bone from the meat and other tissues of poultry carcasses and parts of carcasses
results in a product whose physical form and texture differ materially from those of other boneless poultry products
produced by traditional deboning techniques. Mechanically separated poultry is derived using a machine that operates
on the differing resistance of bone and tissue to passage through small openings, whether it employs sieves, screens,
or other devices. Such machines mechanically separate and remove most of the bone from poultry carcasses and parts
of carcasses resulting in a finely comminuted, paste-like product. The starting materials, which may have undergone
an initial bone breaking process, are pushed under high pressure through equipment with apertures that allow a small
amount of powdered bone to pass through with the soft tissue. This is different than boneless poultry derived by traditional
means, i.e., hand-deboning, and such differences have potential consequences for consumer expectations. FSIS
has statutory responsibilities under the Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA) and the FMIA to assure that consumers
receive poultry and meat food products that are not adulterated and that bear labeling that is not false or misleading.
Mechanically separated poultry is produced by essentially the same technology and has characteristics (i.e., physical
form and texture) similar to those of the livestock product, MS(S). Yet, the regulatory requirements for labeling
these two products currently are inconsistent with one another. Therefore, the Agency is proposing that further
regulatory action is necessary pursuant to its statutory responsibilities to protect the public and prevent the
preparation and distribution in commerce of poultry products and meat food products which are misbranded or not properly
marked, labeled, or packaged. As such, the Agency is proposing in a separate document in this issue of the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to amend the poultry products inspection regulations (9 CFR Part 381) to revise and supplement the requirements for
the manufacture, characteristics, and labeling of poultry products produced by mechanical separation and the labeling
of products in which they are used as ingredients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of data and information provided in response to the proposed rule on Meat Produced by Advanced Meat/Bone
Separation Machinery and Meat Recovery Systems and otherwise acquired by FSIS, FSIS has determined that advances
in meat/bone separation machinery and meat recovery systems, which do not grind, crush, or pulverize bone in order
to remove skeletal muscle tissue adhering to bones of livestock (i.e., bones of cattle, sheep, swine, and goats) result
in a product which, unlike MS(S), is comparable to ``meat'' as traditionally defined. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the 1970's, there has been increasing commercial production of processed meat products that are formulated
with comminuted (i.e., ground) meat, e.g., hot dogs, in order to meet the demands of the market for such products. Most
of the technology that has found commercial use will evolve in the form of improvements to meet the demands of consumers
and industry. The demands of the industry have centered around the desire to harvest more usable protein, i.e., muscle
tissue, and to find alternatives to recovering more usable protein, from livestock carcasses to meet consumer demands
for the processed meat products formulated with skeletal muscle tissue obtained by mechanical removal. Mechanization
also diminishes the economic implications of removing meat by hand caused by repetitive motion disorders for workers
that hand-debone carcasses and parts of carcasses using knives, and by knife accidents. Industry data

 indicate that over 300,000 cases of cumulative trauma disorder (e.g., Carpal Tunnel Syndrome) have occurred in the
meat industry due to the strain of repetitive movements to remove meat from bones. The demands of the consumer and industry
have resulted in improvements in meat/bone separation machinery and meat recovery systems to improve yields and,
simultaneously, to make the process better ergonomically.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Over the past decade, FSIS has monitored the tremendous strides in modernizing the meat/bone separation machinery.
FSIS has determined that there are meat/bone separators and meat recovery systems that are fundamentally different
than the machines used to manufacture MS(S). These differences occur in terms of the efficiency and effectiveness
of the process of separating skeletal muscle tissue from bone. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
The Removal of Muscle Tissue From Livestock Bones 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Machines that are classified as meat/bone separators have been developed that emulate the physical action of hand-held
high-speed knives for the removal of skeletal muscle tissue from bone, e.g., the Wizard knife. The advances in meat/bone
separation have led to recovery systems that separate meat from bone without crushing, grinding, or pulverizing
bones such that the meat is removed by shaving, pressing, or scraping the muscle tissue from the bone surface similar
to the action of the hand-held high-speed knives. Thus, this meat is obtained in much the same manner as that which is
obtained using traditional hand-deboning techniques, where the bones emerge essentially intact and in natural
physical conformation separately from the meat. For example, the most commonly used bones would include rib bones
and loin bones and would be recognized as such when they emerge from the meat/bone separation machinery. FSIS believes
that the description of the bones from which muscle tissue has been removed as ``essentially intact'' is consistent
with the description of the bones resulting from the removal of muscle tissue by hand-deboning using knives, including
high-speed mechanical knives, such as the Wizard knife. FSIS recognizes that even when meat is removed with the use
of hand-operated knives, e.g., those used in the processing establishment, at the supermarket meat counter, or by
the consumer, there is the possibility of shaving, pressing, or scraping close to the bone surface so as to unavoidably
remove a minute amount of the bone's surface. FSIS has determined that this is a normal occurrence because of the difficulty
in exercising precision in hand-deboning operations, and, as such, it is still in conformance with good manufacturing
practices that render products safe and wholesome. Because the bones emerge from the advanced meat/bone separators
in their natural shape and structure, i.e., with the connective tissue linkages that normally occur in bones, FSIS
maintains that they are in natural physical conformation. Furthermore, under FSIS' longstanding boneless meat
inspection procedure for meat derived by hand-deboning techniques, it is expected that the finished comminuted
(i.e., ground) meat product made from the meat removed from livestock bones contains no bone perceptible to sight
or touch. This result would be expected for meat derived from the advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery
systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In contrast, the mechanism of traditional mechanical deboning machines from which MS(S) results, involves mechanically
separating and removing most of the bone from attached skeletal muscle of livestock through the application of high
pressure to crush, grind, and pulverize bones from which most of the meat has already been removed, and then using high
pressure to force the resulting paste through a sieve to separate bone particles and fragments that result from crushing
and pulverizing bones during processing. Because of the mechanism of the machinery used to manufacture MS(S), bone
and bone particles, including bone constituents such as bone marrow and certain minerals, are incorporated into
the finished product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulation on MS(S) in 9 CFR 319.5 does not specify the type of equipment used to separate and remove bone because
it is intended to cover the product manufactured by any such machinery that operates on the differing resistance of
hard bone and soft tissue to passage through small openings, whether it employs sieves, screens, or other devices
and whether or not bones are pre-broken before being fed into such equipment. However, the regulation on MS(S) is not
intended to apply to whole pieces of muscle tissue which have been removed from livestock bones by mechanical or other
means (47 FR 28223). FSIS has determined that the consistency of MS(S) and its content of bone, including bone marrow,
and certain minerals, as well as muscle tissue, are materially different from those of ``meat,'' and that these differences
have potential consequences for finished product quality and for health and safety which are addressed by the regulations
for MS(S) (9 CFR 318.18, 319.5, and 319.6) and supported by the Agency's 1979 report on the health and safety aspects
of mechanically deboned meat.

Starting Materials 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The starting materials from which the meat from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and meat recovery systems
results are intact livestock bones with adhering skeletal muscle and other soft tissue. While it has been reported
that it is possible to use whole carcasses, the raw materials for this type of processing generally are parts of carcasses
with skeletal muscle attached. Adhering skeletal muscle tissue usually varies in amount, depending on the anatomical
origin and size of the bones. Typically, the livestock bones with adhering skeletal tissue applicable to the advances
in meat recovery are those where the adhering tissue cannot be efficiently or effectively removed by traditional
hand-deboning techniques, and the bones are of sufficient hardness and of appropriate size compatible with the operation
of the advanced meat/bone separator and meat recovery system. It is FSIS' understanding that the advanced machinery
is capable of handling medium to smaller size bones, e.g., rib bones, button bones, loin bones, and feather bones.
The fact that no bone crushing, grinding, or pulverizing occurs limits the types of bones that are used. The bones must
be hard enough to emerge from the process essentially intact and in natural physical conformation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the traditional mechanical deboning process, described in the 1982 final regulations on MS(S) (47 FR 28214), it
is possible to use whole carcasses; however, generally, the raw materials for the conventional process are parts
of carcasses from which most of the skeletal muscle already has been removed by traditional hand-deboning methods.
With the mechanical deboning technology described in the regulations on MS(S), these bones are broken up and pushed
under high pressure through equipment with apertures that allow a small amount of powdered bone to pass through with
the soft tissue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Characteristics and Composition of Meat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS has determined that the resulting product derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and meat recovery
systems is comparable to meat derived by hand-deboning techniques, including the use of high-speed mechanical knives
and that, as such it warrants classification as ``meat.'' FSIS has also determined that current relevant Federal
meat inspection regulations on labeling meat should apply and, as such, the product derived from advanced meat/bone
separation machinery and recovery systems may be described by any term that accurately reflects it as ``meat.'' Advanced
meat/bone separation machinery and meat recovery systems apply a process mechanism that shaves, presses or scrapes
adhering tissue from the surface of livestock bones. The machines do not grind, crush, or pulverize bones to separate
muscle tissue, and the bones and the interconnecting soft tissues that link bones emerge from the process in a manner
consistent with hand-deboning operations that use knives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Meat products derived by advanced meat/bone separation are characterized by identifiable muscle fiber structure,
visible differentiation of lean and fat, and components normally associated with and expected in meat obtained by
hand-deboning, including that obtained by using mechanical knives. The advanced recovery systems produce distinct
whole pieces of skeletal muscle tissue with a well-defined particulate size similar in consistency to (species)
trimmings derived by hand-deboning and used to formulate processed meat products. The color of the meat derived from
these systems is similar to that of (species) trimmings.

 As such, the meat derived from the advanced meat/bone separation and recovery systems conforms to the definition
of ``meat'' because it has the functional and chemical characteristics of meat; there are no powdered bone or constituents
of bone, e.g., bone marrow, that are not in conformance with the definition and expectation of meat or that which would
render the product adulterated or misbranded under the regulations. FSIS has determined that, unlike MS(S), consumer
expectations of ``meat'' are met with regard to the product obtained from the advances in meat/bone separation machinery
and recovery systems, because the product's characteristics, in terms of appearance and texture, and its composition
are similar to those of ``meat,'' as currently defined in 9 CFR 301.2(rr).

In contrast, MS(S) differs from hand-deboned meat and the meat derived from advanced meat/bone separation due to
its highly comminuted, spread-like consistency and its content of varying amounts of bone, including bone marrow,
and certain minerals, as well as muscle tissue. MS(S) is amorphous and lacks the characteristic components seen in
meat, e.g., muscle fiber, the presence of connective tissue fibers in the way they occur naturally, and distinct lean
and fat components. These characteristics render the product materially different than meat.

Characteristics of Meat/Bone Separation Machinery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Machinery of the type described as advanced meat/bone separation machinery and meat recovery systems has been developing
over the past 15 years. FSIS believes that the use of such machines has been limited because of the uncertain regulatory
status of the product from these machines. It has not been clearly defined through regulatory means that the product
of these machines would continue to be declared as meat or if the product might be reclassified as MS(S) or some other
unique ingredient that would be identified on the label of products in which it is used as an ingredient. In order to
clarify this situation, the Agency decided to publish a proposal that clearly defines as ``meat,'' product resulting
from these advanced systems.

The Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 3, 1994, FSIS published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a proposed rule (59 FR 10246) to amend the Federal meat inspection regulations by amending definition of ``meat''
set forth in 9 CFR 301.2(rr) to include as ``meat,'' product resulting from advanced meat/bone separation machinery
and recovery systems, establishing criteria for meat from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery
systems, and establishing requirements for the handling of meat derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery
and recovery systems, as well as the material from which it is derived. A summary of the proposed rule follows.

1. Definition of Meat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS proposed to amend the definition of ``meat'' set forth in 9 CFR 301.2(rr) of the Federal meat inspection regulations
to include as ``meat,'' product meeting certain criteria, that is derived from the mechanical separation of skeletal
muscle tissue from the bones of livestock by using advanced mechanical meat/bone separation machinery and meat recovery
systems that do not crush, grind, or pulverize bones, and from which the bones emerge comparable to those resulting
from hand-deboning, i.e., essentially intact and in natural physical conformation such that they are recognizable
as loin bones, rib bones, etc., when they emerge from the machinery.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS proposed to establish protein quality and calcium content criteria for meat derived from advanced meat/bone
separation machinery and meat recovery systems and assure its compliance with such criteria through a quality control
program in order to assure conformance with consumer expectations of ``meat'' and production of ``meat'' comparable
to that obtained by hand-deboning techniques. A maximum calcium content (as a measure of bone solids) of not more than
0.15 percent or 150 mg/100 gm of product (within a tolerance of 0.03 percent or 30 mg) and a minimum protein quality requirement
of a protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score (PDCAAS) of not less than 40 expressed as a percent, or an alternative
measure of at least 33 percent essential amino acids (EAA) of the total amino acids present, was proposed to be established
for the product.

Calcium content
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. FSIS proposed to include in the amendment to the definition of ``meat,'' criteria on maximum calcium content (as
a measure of bone solids content) of this meat to assure that the meat derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery
and recovery systems is both consistent with consumer expectations of ``meat,'' e.g., beef trimmings, and comparable
to ``meat,'' as traditionally defined, that is used to formulate further processed meat food products. The criteria
is a measure designed to ensure that bones are not crushed, ground, or pulverized during processing. The maximum calcium
content of 0.15 percent or 150 mg/100 gm of product is supported by data submitted to FSIS for the product derived from
advanced meat/bone separation machinery.

 Furthermore, based upon analytical repeatability studies conducted by the Agency for calcium, FSIS proposed to
establish a tolerance, i.e., an allowance for statistical variability, of 0.03 percent or 30 mg/100 gm for individual
samples.

Protein quality
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. FSIS proposed to require that meat derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems meet
a minimum protein quality requirement_a PDCAAS of not less than 40 expressed as a percent and to accept as evidence
of compliance with this requirement an alternative measurement_the content of 7 essential amino acids being at least
33 percent of the total of 17 amino acids present. The protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score was proposed
to be determined by methods given in sections 5.4.1, 7.2.1, and 8.00 in the ``Protein Quality Evaluation, Report of
the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation on Protein Quality Evaluation'' which was incorporated by reference in the
proposed rule. The proposed protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score of not less than 40 expressed as a percent
is consistent with nutrition labeling requirements for protein in foods for children older than one but less than
four years of age. Protein quality is a measure of the content, proportion, and availability of essential amino acids
in food protein and a measure of the ability of the food protein to support human growth and body protein maintenance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS proposed to permit an alternative measurement to the protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score method,
which requires a digestibility measurement in addition to an amino acid analysis, to control the cost of monitoring
compliance with the protein quality requirement. FSIS proposed that, for the purpose of measuring the protein quality
of meat derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems, an alternative measurement
of protein quality would be allowed that is comparable to the protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score.
This measure would be based on a comparison between the ``essential amino acid content of meat'' and ``total amino
acids present in meat,'' i.e., an essential amino acid content of at least 33 percent of the total amino acids present
in the meat. Essential amino acid content includes isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine,
and valine content, and the total amino acids present include isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine,
threonine, valine, tyrosine, arginine, histidine, alanine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, glycine, proline, serine,
and hydroxyproline content. The proposed rule required essential amino acid content to be determined by methods
given in sections 5.4.1, 7.2.1, and 8.00 in the ``Protein Quality Evaluation, Report of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation
on Protein Quality Evaluation'' which was incorporated by reference in the proposed rule.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Quality control. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS proposed to require that meat derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems be
produced under an approved quality control program. The function of a quality control program would be to restrict
potential deviations from the prescribed definition of meat by controlling the factors that can affect conformance
with the definition. Thus, FSIS proposed to require that the quality control program provide the controls and information
necessary to assure that the meat from advanced meat/bone separation and recovery systems will meet each of the requirements
of the regulations and will enable establishment personnel and FSIS to monitor it for effectiveness. FSIS focused
on methods that would maintain the uniformity of starting materials, and control the handling and processing of starting
materials and resulting product. It was proposed that the methods of analysis for calcium and protein quality that
were permitted and that were intended to be used should be identified in the quality control system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposal, the owner or operator of an establishment that intends to manufacture meat from advanced meat/bone
separation machinery and recovery systems would request the Administrator of FSIS to approve the establishment's
quality control program. The procedures and criteria for receiving such requests and assessing the adequacy of programs
for quality control, as well as for terminating approval, would be those set forth in 9 CFR 318.4.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure that product satisfies the calcium requirement, FSIS proposed that a sample of at least 1 pound from each
lot of production would be taken and analyzed for calcium. A lot would consist of the meat derived from advanced meat/bone
separation machinery and recovery systems, designated as such by the operator of the establishment or his or her agent,
from the product produced from a single species of livestock in no more than one continuous shift of up to 12 hours. The
results from chemical analyses would be compared to the requirement of 150 mg/100 gm of product within a tolerance
of 0.03 percent or 30 mg. If statistical evidence exists that product may not be in compliance, then further sampling
of the product was required to demonstrate that the product is in compliance with requirements for meat derived from
meat/bone separation and recovery systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS proposed that statistical evidence of non-compliance exists when an individual analytical result is more than
0.03 percent (i.e., 30 mg) above the requirement, i.e., greater than 0.18 percent (i.e., 180 mg). (This tolerance
is derived by equating it to three times the expected standard deviation (i.e., 0.1 percent) of the analytical procedure
used by FSIS to measure the calcium contents in samples.)

 from that lot must be taken and analyzed for calcium, either separately or as a composite (i.e., combining the three
samples for analysis), at the option of the establishment. The average of the results or the composite result must
comply with the requirement for calcium (i.e., less than or equal to 0.15 percent). Taking three samples from each
subsequently produced lot would continue until five consecutive lots

be rounded to the nearest 0.01 percent based on the precision of the methodology for measuring calcium. If the FSIS
program official detects any results out of compliance, the program official may undertake normal compliance procedures.

FSIS proposed that, if the statistical evidence indicated that a production lot was not in compliance with the calcium
requirement, the lot must be labeled as MS(S) and meet the requirements for MS(S) in 9 CFR 319.5. FSIS indicated that
in this situation, it believed that the process was out of control, and that there was the likelihood that too much calcium
had been incorporated in the recovered meat, and, therefore, it should be identified as MS(S).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS proposed that at least 1 pound of product be sampled each week during production of a lot for conformance with protein
quality criteria. It was proposed that once three consecutive results from three production lots were in compliance
with the criteria on protein quality (i.e., a protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score or essential amino
acid content), sampling of production lots could be reduced to a monthly basis. It was also proposed that after 6 months,
sampling of production lots could be reduced to a quarterly basis.

A major concern of FSIS is the assurance that consumers receive the quality of meat they expect in terms of the value
of protein needed to sustain good nutrition. Therefore, FSIS proposed that product from advanced meat/bone separation
machinery and recovery systems that did not meet the requirements of the criteria for protein quality be identified
as ``(species) fat'' or ``(species) connective tissue,'' and labeled in accordance with the applicable provisions
in 9 CFR part 317. Protein quality values less than the proposed criteria are comparable to those associated with ``(species)
fat'' and ``(species) connective tissue.''

FSIS proposed to specify requirements for the handling of material that is to be processed into meat derived from advanced

of such material comply with the same provisions as are currently prescribed in 9 CFR 318.18 for handling material
for mechanical processing. These requirements would provide that material to be processed into meat derived from
advanced meat/bone separation machinery and meat recovery systems be processed within 1 hour from the time it is cut
or separated from livestock carcasses or parts of carcasses, except that such product may be held for no more than 72
hours at 40

use for no more than 72 hours at 40

Food Manufacturers/Distributors Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Three food manufacturers/distributors who submitted comments did not provide comments that either support or take
issue with any particular facet of the proposal; their comments were general in nature. They stated that they support
harmonization of regulations for meat and poultry products and would endorse a regulation that would allow meat products
with bone solids contents of less than or equal to 1 percent (measured as calcium) to be categorized as meat (i.e., ``species''),
regardless of the processing procedure, i.e., traditional mechanical deboning or advanced meat/bone separation
and meat recovery systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The other six comments submitted by the food manufacturers/distributors supported the proposed rule, provided
that some modifications are made in specific areas, i.e., the definition of meat, calcium content criteria, protein
quality, quality control, handling requirements, and bone breakage tolerance and the new machinery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All six food manufacturers/distributors to which the previous paragraph refers had some reservations about the
definition of the meat derived from the advanced machinery and recovery systems and the types of machinery capable
of producing such meat. Their statements indicated that it is not necessary to define meat by making distinctions
based upon whether specific pieces of machinery do or do not crush, grind or pulverize bones; if product complies with
finished product calcium requirements, the specific of the methods of processing should be irrelevant. This was
based on a belief that there is equipment that can successfully separate ``meat'' where grinding, crushing, or pulverizing
is part of the process. These same commenters suggested that incidental bone breakage occurs during any meat/bone
separation operation, therefore, it should be clearly identified that incidental bone breakage would be acceptable
and would be controlled by bone particle size limits. It was also suggested by one commenter that the word ``crushing''
should be substituted with the word ``chopping'' when describing meat and machinery systems that do not ``chop,''
grind, or pulverize bones because such systems do result in some minor ``crushing.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the six food manufacturers/distributors that supported the proposal with some condition for modification, three
supported the calcium criteria in the proposed rule. The other three did not support it stating that (1) the Agency
should develop a single calcium criteria applicable to all ``meat'' species, which should be applied to all products
independent of the processing method or bone separation technique, (2) product should be from skeletal muscle tissue
and contain no more than 1 percent bone solids or an equivalent calcium content of 250 mg/100 gm of product, and (3) any
meat with 1 percent bone or more than 0.235 percent calcium should be called by its common or usual name regardless of
species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the six food manufacturers/distributors who supported the proposal with some condition, two supported the protein
quality criteria in the proposed rule. The other four did not support the proposed criteria citing that (1) the nutritive
value of meat is well recognized, and the amino acid content of meat separated by hand, or by machine, will be the same
when the same beginning sources are used; (2) to segregate ``meat'' from a mechanical source from hand deboned ``meat''
by requiring an amino acid analysis casts undeserved doubts upon the meat from mechanical means, especially if it
is asserted to be compositionally the same as hand-deboned meat; (3) if this ruling is to recognize meat from a mechanical
process as ``meat,'' then the protein quality requirement for mechanically ``harvested'' meat is unfounded; (4)
the marketplace will determine the quality of the protein in the meat produced by meat/bone separation machinery
and meat recovery systems; (5) protein quality was not an issue with the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990,
so it should not be of concern as a processing control for a product that will eventually be nutritionally labeled;
(6) if the protein quality is of such a concern, it should be a mandatory parameter and required to be labeled in the Nutrition
Facts panel on all products; and (7) products that require such extensive testing will take 2 to 3 days turnaround just
to ensure the product meets compliance.

Of the six food manufacturers/distributors who supported the proposal with some condition for modification, only
one supported the quality control criteria in the proposed rule. The other five did not support the provisions for
quality control in the proposed rule and their statements included the following: (1) Mandatory quality control
programs will be an additional burden for the meat processor in situations where special controls are not needed;
(2) the process of separating meat from bones has been historically accepted by the Agency and the industry without
mandatory programs; (3) the process is comparable to removing meat from bones by hand, a situation that does not require
a mandatory quality control program; (4) if the definition of meat includes an evaluation of the physical condition
of the bones after the meat has been removed plus the bone content of the meat as measured by calcium content, the proposal
should be referring to a partial quality control program to ensure appropriate labeling requirements are met; (5)
the Department can and should maintain its focus on food safety questions and not quality issues, possibly through
the requirement of some type of Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) program; and (6) issues of product
quality, as opposed to safety, should remain within the discretion of the processing establishment.

Of the six food manufacturers/distributors who supported the proposal with a condition for modification, three
supported the handling requirements criteria in the proposed rule. The other three did not support the rule and their
statements included the following: (1) If the current industry practices are reviewed, the Agency will find numerous
processors that exceed the proposed 72-hour time limit for using starting materials and the meat derived from the
advanced systems; (2) today, storage of meat from advanced systems at temperatures colder than 40

<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; C) and pre-blending meat from advanced systems with curing ingredients allows the time necessary for transporting
and processing; (3) requiring the proposed time/temperature criteria will change the nature of meat as traded today
by restricting supply locations and will alter the economic balance of the market_some processors may discontinue
use of these materials because they cannot receive adequate supplies in 72 hours; and (4) the producing plant should
be responsible for controlling the environment around meat from advanced systems to ensure that microbial spoilage
does not occur.

Trade Association Comments

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Three of the four trade associations commenting on the proposed rule supported its provisions, provided that some
modifications are made in specific areas (i.e., the definition of meat, calcium content criteria, protein quality,
quality control, and handling requirements). The other trade association did not support the proposed rule and suggested
that parity was the issue in defining meat and that the same labeling that is required for MS(S) should apply to MDP.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All four trade associations had some concerns regarding the proposed calcium content criteria and their statements
included the following: (1) Establishing a uniform standard for calcium content for both meat and poultry (i.e.,
250 mg/100 gm of product of calcium) would create comparability; and (2) a calcium content limit is unnecessary; the
Department's nutrition labeling requirements will serve to ensure that all consumers will receive specific calcium
information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three of the four trade associations had some reservations regarding the proposed protein quality requirements
and their statements included the following: (1) A protein digestibility corrected amino acid score of not less than
40 expressed as a percent or an essential amino acid content of at least 33 percent of the total amino acids present in
the meat should not be required by this or any other regulation because protein quality varies significantly throughout
the meat and food supply as a whole; (2) protein quality is a marketplace issue and need not be regulated by an Agency
which is focusing on direct food safety concerns; (3) the United States is not a protein deficient society which requires
every protein source to be of highest ``quality''; and (4) there should be no restrictions on protein and fat content
for product qualified to be labeled as ``meat'' because the protein and fat content of finished products will either
be dictated by existing regulatory finished product standards, or by manufacturing specifications, and/or will
be fully delineated in nutrition labeling on finished food product packages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three of the four trade associations had some reservations regarding the proposed requirement for a mandatory quality
control program to assure compliance with the provisions of the definition of meat derived from advanced systems.
Their statements included the following: (1) This requirement would only serve to impose a special requirement upon
a newer technology and a discrete sub-category of product in an arbitrary manner when other technology does not induce
the same requirement; and (2) partial quality control programs should be a voluntary option. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three of the four trade associations had some reservations regarding handling requirements and their statements
included the following: (1) Proper product handling is a legitimate concern for both government and industry, but
there is no apparent basis for singling out the product to be addressed by the regulation for special scrutiny; such
detailed requirements are not in place for other meat products, e.g., ground beef; (2) issues which truly relate to
food safety concerns will be addressed more frequently in industry HACCP programs as the Agency proceeds to clarify
its HACCP strategy; and (3) because such refrigeration/freezing requirements may be more broadly applied to other
red meat products, they should be developed separately from the current proposal, be broadly based, and preferably
handled within a company's HACCP framework.

The manufacturer of machinery supported the proposed rule. The machinery manufacturer also stated that, with this
new technology, meat processors will be able to fully utilize edible portions of meat carcasses by mechanical means
without the incorporation of pulverized bone or otherwise introducing significant levels of bone that are of potential
health consequence into meat systems.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The comment from academia provided an objection to the proposed protein quality criteria for meat derived from advanced
meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems. The commenter stated that ``every available survey indicates
that all meat eating groups in the U.S. far exceed their protein quality and quantity requirements'' and suggested
that the protein quality criteria be removed from the rule. Furthermore, the commenter provided literature to support
this. The commenter also stated that they strongly agree with the red meat sausage manufacturers that have alleged
that a disparate situation exists between labeling certain poultry products produced by mechanical separation
and MS(S) which poses an unfair advantage for the manufacturers of poultry products. The commenter believes that
standards for MS(S) and meat produced by advanced meat/bone separation machinery and meat recovery systems should
be similar to the present ones for mechanically deboned poultry.

1. The Definition of Meat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the comments that it is not necessary to define meat by making distinctions based upon whether specific
pieces of machinery do or do not crush, grind, or pulverize bones, FSIS has determined that such a distinction is important
because the type of machinery affects the characteristics (in terms of appearance, texture, and composition) and
functionality of the material produced. Such distinction is critical because machinery that crushes, grinds, and/or
pulverizes bones from livestock to remove adhering muscle tissue results in a meat food product whose paste-like
consistency and content of bone, including bone marrow and certain minerals, are materially different from those
of ``meat.'' Furthermore, these differences have potential consequences for finished product quality and health
and safety. Because of the mechanism of this machinery, bone and bone particles, including bone marrow, are incorporated
into the finished product which is not consistent with that of meat as traditionally defined. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In contrast, FSIS has determined, as discussed in the section of this document entitled ``Characteristics and Composition
of Meat,'' that the product derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems that do not
crush, grind, or pulverize bones to remove adhering muscle tissue is comparable to meat derived by hand-deboning
techniques, including the use of mechanical knives, because it has the functional and chemical characteristics
of ``meat.'' As such, the product derived from the advanced systems warrants classification as ``meat.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters expressed a need for clarifying the acceptability of ``incidental'' bone breakage with regard to
the use of advanced meat/bone separation machinery and meat recovery systems. FSIS believes that the description
of the bones from which muscle tissue has been removed that emerge from the advanced meat/bone separation machinery
and meat recovery systems, set forth in the proposed regulations, sufficiently addresses this issue, and, thus,
this description remains as proposed. The description in the proposed amendment to the definition of meat is consistent
with the description of the bones resulting from the removal of muscle tissue by hand-deboning using knives, including
high-speed hand-held mechanical knives. This description indicates that these bones emerge comparable to those
resulting from hand-deboning (i.e., essentially intact and in natural physical conformation such that they are
recognizable, such as loin bones and rib bones when they emerge from the machinery), thus, recognizing that some removal
of a minute amount of the bone surface might unavoidably occur during this process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS recognizes that even with the use of hand-operated knives, e.g., at the supermarket meat counter to cut up large
cuts of beef, there is the possibility of shaving, pressing, or scraping close to the bone surface so as to unavoidably
remove a minute amount of the bone's surface when meat is removed. FSIS has determined that this is a normal occurrence
because of the difficulty in exercising precision in hand-deboning operations and, as such, it is still in conformance
with good manufacturing practices that render products safe and wholesome. The minor abrasion of bone edges or surfaces
in removing meat from bone using hand-deboning techniques, including mechanical knives, and the advanced meat/bone
separation machinery is not the same as bone crushing, grinding, or pulverizing which would result in bone and constituents
in bone being incorporated in the finished product in a manner inconsistent with meat as traditionally defined.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the suggested replacement of the word ``crush'' with the word ``chop'' in the proposed amendment of
the definition of meat, i.e., product derived from advanced meat/bone separators that ``do not crush, grind, or pulverize
bones'' to remove adhering muscle tissue, FSIS has concluded that ``crush'' is a more appropriate word. Crushing
involves altering or destroying structure and, thus, is the action which must be avoided in order for bones to emerge
essentially intact and in natural physical conformation from the advanced machinery. Therefore, the amendment
to the definition of meat to include as ``meat,'' product derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and
recovery systems remains as proposed.

2. Calcium Content Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal to amend the definition of meat to include product derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery
and recovery systems included criteria on maximum calcium content, as a measure of bone solids. A maximum calcium
content, as a measure of bone solids, of not more than 0.15 percent or 150 mg/100 gm of product (within a tolerance of
0.03 percent or 30 mg) was proposed. This equates to a bone solids content of 0.6 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS has determined that a maximum calcium content restriction for meat derived from advanced meat/bone separation

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and recovery systems is warranted. Because bones are composed primarily of calcium, calcium content is an indicator
that the advanced meat/bone separation operation is in control and that the bones with adhering tissue are not ground,
crushed, or pulverized during the process of removing the tissue from the bones. As such, by restricting the calcium
content of the product resulting from the advanced meat/bone separation and recovery systems, in combination with
the requirement that bones emerge from the advanced meat/bone separation systems essentially intact, there is an
assurance that the product derived from the advanced systems is comparable to ``meat'' derived by traditional means,
including that resulting from the use of mechanical knives. Moreover, calcium content criteria provides assurance
that the meat derived from the advanced systems is consistent with consumer expectations of ``meat,'' e.g., beef
trimmings, as traditionally defined, that is used to formulate further processed meat food products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS has also concluded that the proposed maximum calcium content for meat derived from advanced meat/bone separation
and recovery systems is supported by data that reflect its comparability with meat produced by hand-deboning techniques
and other mechanical means of removing meat from bone that do not involve crushing, grinding, or pulverizing bone.
The maximum calcium content reflects what is achievable when good manufacturing practices (GMP's) are followed.
Additionally, the criteria reflect the expected statistical variability attributed to analytical methodology
for determining calcium. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These data were available for public inspection during the comment period. The criteria on which these data are based
will assure that the meat derived from the advanced systems is both consistent with consumer expectations of ``meat,''
e.g., beef trimmings, and comparable to ``meat,'' as traditionally defined, that is used to formulate further processed
meat food products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the suggestions that the criteria be changed to a calcium content of 235 mg/100 gm or a calcium content
of 250 mg/100 gm (i.e., 1 percent bone solids content), these comments were not supported by data. These values were
considered reasonable by the commenters because they relate to the current allowance for the maximum bone solids
content permitted in boneless poultry. However, FSIS believes that because there are inherent physical and compositional
differences between the bones from poultry and bones from livestock species, one calcium criteria cannot be applied
to both types of animals. The calcium criteria FSIS is adopting here and for mechanically separated poultry reflect
these differences and what FSIS considers achievable when the respective technologies are applied in accordance
with GMP's. Therefore, FSIS is maintaining the calcium criteria of 150 mg/100 mg of product (within a tolerance of
30 mg), as proposed.

3. Protein Quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS agrees with the commenters' views regarding the lack of need for a mandated protein quality requirement for the
meat derived from the advanced meat/bone separation machinery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the proposed rule, FSIS proposed that meat derived from advanced meat/bone separation systems and recovery systems
meet a minimum protein quality requirement, i.e., a protein digestibility corrected amino acid score of not less
than 40 expressed as a percent or the alternative measurement of essential amino acids being at least 33 percent of
the total 17 amino acids present. FSIS has concluded that the lack of the need for a protein quality requirement is founded
on scientific literature provided and cited by comments from academia and statements made by other commenters regarding
the status of the quality of protein in diets of individuals in the U.S. with which FSIS agrees. According to scientific
literature,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
11
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 there has not been an indication of health problems identified with protein quality_consumption of enough high-quality
protein by humans in the U.S. is not a problem. In the preamble of the final nutrition labeling regulations, both FSIS
and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) stated that current evidence suggests that the diet typically consumed
in the U.S. provides for an adequate protein intake of sufficiently high quality to meet the nutritional needs of adults
and children 4 or more years of age (58 FR 632 and 2079). Furthermore, because there are no outstanding health implications
requiring the establishment of protein quality criteria for food products, in general, it would be unnecessary to
require such criteria for a specific product, viz., red meat. Therefore, FSIS is removing its proposed provision
for a protein quality requirement which would include the requirement for identifying product as ``(Species) fat''
and ``(Species) connective tissue.''

4. Quality Control_Compliance Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS agrees with the commenters' views regarding the lack of need for a requirement for a mandatory approved quality
control program. After reviewing the comments and re-examining the Agency's current regulatory agenda, FSIS has
concluded that because there are efforts underway within the Agency to study and address ways of reducing the potential
for situations that would render any meat or poultry product adulterated, unwholesome, and/or misbranded it is premature
to address the need for a mandatory quality control program for meat derived by this one distinct type of system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, although FSIS has concluded that a mandatory quality control program is not needed, recordkeeping, a certain
provision that would be part of any mandatory quality control program, as set forth in 9 CFR 318.4, is still needed to
prevent noncompliance with the definition of meat and to minimize the likelihood of manufacturing products that
do not comply with regulatory requirements. FSIS has concluded that a records maintenance program for assuring product
complies with the calcium content criteria is still needed and that the records must reflect data compiled in a prescribed
way, i.e., the compliance procedure set forth in its proposed regulation. In regard to this matter, the proposed regulation
stated that a prerequisite for label approval for meat derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and
recovery systems was that it should be produced by an establishment under an approved quality control program, which
had to be approved in accordance with 9 CFR 318.4 (d)(1), (d)(2), and (e). The proposed regulation also indicated that
the quality control system should provide the controls and information necessary to ensure it meets the requirements
for the product and enables establishment personnel and program employees to monitor the system for effectiveness.
Furthermore, as part of the approval process, 9 CFR 318.4(d) requires a letter to be submitted by the establishment
which indicates that all data and information generated by the program will be maintained to enable the Department
to monitor compliance and it also requires that the length of time the records will be maintained be stated. Thus, recordkeeping
was clearly part of a quality control program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The records of data from testing must be available to the inspector or any other duly authorized representative of
the Agency. The availability of these types of records for review was part of FSIS' proposed regulations for a required
quality control program. The quality control program was required to provide the information necessary to enable
program personnel to monitor the system for effectiveness, and it set up the method for determining calcium content
compliance, which is being adopted as part of this final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The goal of preventing misbranding and adulteration are key issues with regard to meat products produced by mechanical
meat/bone separation, and can be achieved effectively and efficiently where a monitoring and testing program incorporates
appropriate methods and monitoring techniques, and adheres to good manufacturing practices. FSIS believes that
product exceeding the calcium limit should not be classified as meat because it would reflect unacceptable incorporation
of bone in the product during processing. To ensure that product satisfies the calcium requirement, FSIS is maintaining
the position that a compliance program, as described below and set forth in its proposal, be used by manufacturers
of meat from advanced systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to obtain the data to ensure compliance with the calcium requirement, a sample of at least 1 pound from each
lot of production would be taken and analyzed for calcium. A lot would consist of the meat derived from advanced meat/bone
separation machinery and recovery systems, designated as such by the operator of the establishment or his or her agent,
from the product produced from a single species of livestock in no more than one continuous shift of up to 12 hours. The
results from chemical analyses would be compared to the requirement of 150 mg/100 gm of product within a tolerance
of 0.03 percent or 30 mg. If statistical evidence exists that product may not be in compliance, then further sampling
of the product would ensue to demonstrate that the product is in compliance with requirements for meat derived from
meat/bone separation and recovery systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Statistical evidence of non-compliance exists when an individual analytical result is more than 0.03 percent (i.e.,
30 mg) above the requirement, i.e., greater than 0.18 percent (i.e., 180 mg). (This tolerance is derived by equating
it to three times the expected standard deviation (i.e., 0.1 percent) of the analytical procedure used by FSIS to measure
the calcium contents in samples.)

 from that lot would be taken and analyzed for calcium, either separately or as a composite (i.e., combining the three

be rounded to the nearest 0.01 percent based on the precision of the methodology for measuring calcium. If the FSIS

FSIS believes that, if the statistical evidence indicates that product derived from advanced meat/bone separation
systems is not in compliance with the calcium requirement, the lot must be labeled as MS(S) and meet the requirements
for MS(S) in 9 CFR 319.5. In this situation, the process is out of control, and there is the likelihood that too much calcium
has been incorporated in the recovered meat and, therefore, it should be identified as MS(S).

5. Handling Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS believes that handling requirements are necessary to produce safe and wholesome product, and that potential
bacterial hazards are diminished as long as handling accords with good manufacturing practices. Proper raw material
and finished product handling is a concern for both the Agency and the meat industry. FSIS believes that it is the manufacturer's
responsibility, in concert with FSIS', to assure that wholesome materials are used in the manufacture of its product
within sound timeframes, and the safety of such product is not negatively affected. However, meat derived by advanced
meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems and the raw materials from which it is manufactured is not unique;
all meat products that result from processes that involve cutting muscle tissue present opportunities for microbiological
growth. Therefore, FSIS agrees with the commenters that there is a need to address the issue of handling requirements
for all meat products, including meat derived from meat/bone separation techniques. FSIS is currently developing
a separate rulemaking that will deal with this issue more fully and will include handling requirements for ground
meat and meat trimmings, and the materials from which they are manufactured. These products are ones in which the meat
derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems is used. Therefore, FSIS will not include

This final rule has been determined to be significant and has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under
Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule formalizes the use of relatively new, advanced meat/bone separation machinery that increases the yield
of meat trimmings from certain bones from livestock carcasses and probably also reduces the amount or type of hand-separation
labor. The rule allows, but does not require, the use of the machinery. Thus, the decision to invest in this machinery
rests with official meat establishments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The product of the advanced meat/bone separation process is distinguished from the product identified as MS(S) because
the advanced process does not crush or grind the bones, and meat output has characteristics comparable to those of
hand-deboned meat. Qualifying product will be defined as ``meat'' and needs no other special designation or standard
of identity. The product can be used in hamburger (beef), sausage, ground pork, and other products normally utilizing
meat trimmings.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The advanced meat/bone separation machinery is currently in use in approximately 50 to 60 official establishments,
all thought to be large firms. Product from such machinery is produced by several manufacturers using differing mechanisms,
i.e., pressing, shaving, and scraping. An advanced meat/bone separation machine can process up to 400 beef carcasses
an hour, yielding 3,500 to 4,000 pounds of product per hour. This calculates to 35 to 40 percent of meat from each carcass,
about 1 to 11/2 pounds more per beef carcass than that produced under a hand-deboning operation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Costs of Final Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is estimated that the annual cost for operating one machine for beef is $170,000, which includes depreciation,
repair, maintenance, labor, and compliance costs. The cost per head or per unit of output depends upon capacity utilization,
labor costs, and other factors. The cost of such machinery is $60,000 to $80,000 per unit, and requires one person to
operate each unit. The cost of compliance with the calcium content, as a measure of bone solids, is assumed to be about
$5,000 per machine annually. This includes costs for testing for calcium content and required recordkeeping to support
the validity of the calcium content.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Use of the machinery requires replacement of a $600 belt each 24 to 40 hours of operation. In addition, manufacturers
indicate that an establishment producing 100 head of cattle per hour (400 head per hour for pork) is the minimum size
necessary to justify use of such machinery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To the extent that advanced meat/bone separation machinery is already in use, a portion of the costs have already been
incurred by those establishments currently using such machinery. If such establishments choose to continue using
the advanced meat/bone separation machinery, their only additional cost would be related to compliance with the
calcium content requirement. Because this is a permissive rule, other establishments would incur the new costs associated
with the use of such machinery if increased net returns are anticipated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Benefits of the Final Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The net benefits to the economy in the first year of implementation would be over $30 million, based on use of economic
model for the U.S. livestock sector. It is estimated that annual net benefits would increase over time as the industry
increases its use of this method which yields an additional 1 to 11/2 pounds of output per carcass.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While establishments that already use advanced technology or those that adopt the new technology immediately may
enjoy high returns, the primary long-run benefits of adoption of advanced technology accrue to consumers of meat
and stem from a net increase in meat supply through increased yield from each animal processed. Under pure competition,
depending upon price elasticity of demand and supply, packer cost savings will be passed forward to consumers or backward
to producers in the marketing chain.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS believes that adoption of advanced meat/bone separation machinery may reduce the incidence of cumulative trauma
disorder among meatcutters by eliminating some tasks which contribute to the disorder. Thus, this final rule may
result in a reduction in costs associated with any reduced incidence of cumulative trauma disorder among workers.
The U.S. Department of Labor reported an incidence rate for repeated trauma of 1,493.7 per 10,000 workers in the meatpacking
industry in 1991, the highest rate of any listed private industry segment.

Executive Order 12778
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. States and local jurisdictions
are preempted under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) from imposing with respect to the premises, facilities,
and operations of federally inspected establishments any requirements that are in addition to, or different than,
those imposed under the FMIA. States and local jurisdictions may, however, impose recordkeeping and other requirements
within the scope of section 202 of the FMIA, if consistent therewith, with respect to any such federally inspected
establishment. States and local jurisdictions are also preempted under the FMIA from imposing any marking, labeling,
packaging, or ingredient requirements on federally inspected meat products that are in addition to, or different
than, those imposed under the FMIA. States and local jurisdictions may, however, exercise concurrent jurisdiction
over meat products that are outside official establishments for the purpose of preventing the distribution of meat
products that are misbranded or adulterated under the FMIA, or, in the case of imported articles, which are not at such
an establishment, after their entry into the United States. Under the FMIA, States that maintain meat inspection
programs must impose requirements that are at least equal to those required under the FMIA. The States may, however,
impose more stringent requirements on such State inspected products and establishments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No retroactive effect will be given to this rule. The administrative procedures specified in 9 CFR 306.5 must be exhausted
prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule, if the challenge involves any decision of a program
official. The administrative procedures specified in 9 CFR Part 335 must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge
to the application of the provisions of this rule with respect to labeling decisions.

Effect on Small Entities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administrator has determined that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities, as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601). This rule does not require either
large or small establishments to use advanced meat/bone separation machinery and meat recovery systems. Although
there are initial costs involved with the purchase of machinery, there are no apparent direct competitive advantages
that large establishments would have over small establishments.

Manufacturers producing ``meat'' resulting from advances in meat/bone separation machinery that does not grind,
crush, or pulverize bone in order to remove skeletal muscle tissues (i.e., meat) adhering to livestock bones are required
to maintain records of a compliance program for calcium content that provides the information necessary to assure
that the product will meet the requirements as established by this final rule for such product. The paperwork requirements
contained in this final rule have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 0583&hyph;0095.

pulverize bones, and from which the bones emerge comparable to those resulting from hand-deboning (i.e., essentially
intact and in natural physical conformation such that they are recognizable, such as loin bones and rib bones, when
they emerge from the machinery) which meets the criteria of no more than 0.15 percent or 150 mg/100 gm of product for
calcium (as a measure of bone solids content) within a tolerance of 0.03 percent or 30 mg.

(b) To verify the calcium content in meat derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems,
a compliance program consisting of the following parameters shall be followed by manufacturers of meat defined in
&sect;301.2(rr)(2) of this subchapter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) An analysis of a sample of at least 1 pound from each lot shall be performed by the operator of the establishment or
his or her agent. For purposes of this paragraph, a lot shall consist of the meat derived from advanced meat/bone separation
machinery and recovery systems, designated as such by the operator of the establishment or his or her agent, from the
product produced from a single species of livestock in no more than one continuous shift of up to 12 hours. Individual
results from the chemical analyses shall be compared to the calcium limit, prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section,
in order to demonstrate compliance. If compliance is not demonstrated, that is, if any single analytical result is
more than

 before product from a production lot that is still at the establishment or one that is subsequently produced can be
considered to be in compliance, at least three samples from that production lot shall be taken and analyzed for calcium,
either separately, or, at the option of the establishment, as a composite (i.e., combining the three samples for analysis).
The average of the results or the composite result must be less than or equal to 0.15 percent. Taking three samples from
each subsequently produced lot and analyzing them in order to demonstrate compliance shall continue until five consecutive
lots have mean or composite results less than or equal to 0.15 percent. If the statistical evidence indicates that
a production lot is not in compliance with the calcium limit, as prescribed in &sect;301.2(rr)(2) of this subchapter,
the lot must be labeled as MS(S) and meet all of the requirements for MS(S) in &sect;319.5 of this subchapter.

Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 2 of DIDRA, 12 U.S.C. 3352, authorizes the agencies to make exceptions to statutory and regulatory appraisal
requirements for transactions with respect to real property located in areas in which the President has determined,
pursuant to section 401 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. 5170, that
a major disaster exists, provided that the exception would facilitate recovery from the major disaster and is consistent
with safety and soundness.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Such exceptions expire not later than three years after the date of the President's determination that a major disaster
exists in the area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 The agencies must make the exception no later than 30 months after the date on which the President determines that a
major disaster exists in the area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since October 18, 1994, and continuing, the President has declared several areas as Major Disaster Areas in certain
Texas counties because of the extensive flooding that occurred and is continuing. The agencies believe that granting
relief from the appraisal requirements for certain real estate transactions in all such areas affected by this flooding
is consistent with the provisions of the DIDRA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies have determined that the disruption of real estate markets in all such affected areas interferes with
the ability of depository institutions to obtain appraisals that comply with statutory and regulatory requirements
and, therefore, may impede institutions in making loans and engaging in other transactions that would aid in the reconstruction
and rehabilitation of the affected area. Accordingly, the agencies have determined that recovery from this major
disaster would be facilitated by excepting transactions involving real estate located in the area directly affected
by the flooding from the real estate appraisal requirements of Title XI of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery,
and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) as amended, 12 U.S.C. 3331 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and regulations promulgated thereto. This has the effect of excepting certain transactions from the definition
of ``federally related transactions.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies have also determined that safety and soundness would not be adversely affected by such exceptions so
long as the depository institution's records relating to any such excepted transaction clearly indicate either
that the property involved was directly affected by the major disaster or that the transaction would facilitate recovery
from the disaster and there is a binding commitment to fund the transaction within three years after the date the major
disaster was declared. In addition, the transaction must continue to be subject to review by management and by the
agencies in the course of examination of the institution under normal supervisory standards relating to safety and
soundness, though the transactions need not comply with the specific requirements of Title XI of FIRREA and the agencies'
appraisal regulations.

Expiration Dates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Any exceptions provided under the order shall expire not later than three years after the date on which the President
determines, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 5170, that a major disaster exists in the area. Accordingly, exceptions for the
major disasters declared due to the flooding expire on October 18, 1997. Exceptions for any other counties that have
been declared major disasters by the President as a result of the flooding that began in Texas on or about October 11,
1994, expire three years after the date of such declaration.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to all Fokker Model F28 series airplanes.
This action requires a revision to the Airplane Flight Manual that prohibits takeoff in certain icing conditions
unless either a tactile inspection is performed or specific takeoff procedures are followed. This amendment is prompted
by several accidents in which Fokker Model F28 series airplanes lost aerodynamic lift when attempting takeoff with
ice contamination on their wings. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent degradation of aerodynamic
lift during takeoff when icing conditions exist.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The FAA has received reports of at least three accidents involving Fokker Model F28 series airplanes in which the probable
cause has been attributed to wing ice contamination prior to takeoff. The FAA has determined that airplanes with wings
that do not have leading edge high lift devices, such as the Fokker Model F28 series airplanes, are particularly susceptible
to loss of lift when attempting to take off with minimal amounts of ice accumulation (contamination) on the wings.
Further, the FAA finds that airplanes with this configuration account for a disproportionate number of the total
number of accidents attributable to wing ice contamination. In light of this, the FAA has determined that, for airplanes
with this configuration, an extra degree of protection is necessary beyond reliance solely on operation in accordance
with the current requirements specified in section 121.629 (``Operation in icing conditions''), amendment 121&hyph;231,
of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 121.629).

The FAA has determined that one acceptable (interim) method of addressing icing problems associated with airplanes
having this configuration is a physical (tactile) and visual check of the leading edge and upper wing surfaces to verify
that there is no accumulation of ice, frost, and snow prior to takeoff. The FAA previously issued AD 93&hyph;11&hyph;01
[amendment 39&hyph;8593 (58 FR 33898, June 22, 1993)], which requires such a tactile check of McDonnell Douglas Model
DC&hyph;9&hyph;10 series airplanes; those airplanes, like the Model F28, do not have leading edge high lift devices.
The intent of checks such as these is to prevent takeoff with wing ice contamination, which can result in the degradation
of wing lift, and can result in the airplane stalling at lower than normal angles-of-attack during takeoff. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the Rijksluchtvaartdienst (RLD), which is the airworthiness authority for the Netherlands, issued
Netherlands Airworthiness Directive (BLA) 93&hyph;167/2 (A), dated April 29, 1994, applicable to Fokker Model
F28 series airplanes operating in the Netherlands. This BLA describes an ``alternative'' takeoff procedure that
can be followed to improve stall margins whenever icing conditions exist. [This ``alternative'' takeoff procedure
was developed in response to the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board's (NTSB) Safety Recommendation A&hyph;93&hyph;023.]
The ``alternative'' takeoff procedure requires the availability of 120 percent of the minimum takeoff distance
for the actual gross weight. Additionally, the 20 percent increase in takeoff distance must be accounted for in the
obstacle clearance analysis. The BLA specifies that the ``alternative'' takeoff procedure is an 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
optional
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 procedure that is available for use when sufficient runway length and obstacle clearance margin are available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved this ``alternative'' takeoff procedure as an interim measure that will acceptably
address the problems associated with takeoff and operation of Model F28 series airplanes in icing conditions. Although
the RLD has classified the procedure as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
optional
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the FAA has determined that it must be mandated as one method to ensure that these airplanes have adequate lift to effect
a safe takeoff when icing conditions exist. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated previously, the FAA has determined that the accomplishment of these types of additional actions is necessary
in order to provide an extra degree of protection for Model F28 series airplanes, beyond that provided by the current
operating requirements specified in part 121 of the FAR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fokker has advised the FAA that it is currently developing a modification to the thermal anti-ice system on all Fokker
Model F28 series airplanes. This modification would allow the thermal anti-ice system to operate on the ground, which
would prevent reformation of ice on the wing leading edges after ground equipment has been used to properly de-ice/anti-ice
the airplane, and would minimize the effect of undetected ice/frost/snow contamination. Fokker has indicated that
this proposed modification will be similar to the one required by AD 93&hyph;11&hyph;01 for McDonnell Douglas DC&hyph;9&hyph;10
series airplanes. (That AD requires a modification of the wing leading edge bleed air anti-ice system on so that it
can operate on the ground to prevent the reformation of ice after de-icing procedures have been accomplished.) However,
because this proposed modification for Model F28 series airplanes currently is under development, any associated
modification instructions or required parts are not available at this time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in the Netherlands and is type certificated for operation in the United States
under the provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral
airworthiness agreement. The FAA has determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that
are certificated for operation in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, this AD is being issued to prevent degradation of the aerodynamic lift during
takeoff due to wing ice contamination, which could result in the airplane stalling at lower than normal angles-of-attack
during takeoff. This AD requires a revision to the Limitations Section of the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual
(AFM), which requires that, whenever icing conditions exist, one of the following actions must be accomplished:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. A physical (tactile) check to detect ice, frost, and snow accumulation on the leading edge and upper wing surfaces
must be performed prior to takeoff. (This check is similar to that required by AD 93&hyph;11&hyph;01 for McDonnell
Douglas Model DC&hyph;9&hyph;10 series airplanes). Or

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. The airplane must be operated in accordance with the ``alternative'' takeoff procedure developed by Fokker that
improves stall margins. Use of the ``alternative'' takeoff procedure would require weight to be off loaded, if necessary,
to meet the revised takeoff distance and obstacle clearance requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This AD also provides for the termination of these requirements if the airplane's thermal anti-ice system is modified
and operated in accordance with a method approved by the FAA. 
<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is considered to be interim action. As stated previously, Fokker currently is developing a design modification
that will positively address the unsafe condition that is the subject of this rulemaking action. Once this modification,
as well as its associated operating procedures and an implementation schedule, are developed, approved, and available,
the FAA may consider additional rulemaking action. 
<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days.

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and that it is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866.
It has been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and
Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be
significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed
in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

The Model F28 series airplane has a wing design with no leading edge high lift devices, such as slats. Wings without
leading edge high lift devices are particularly susceptible to loss of lift due to wing icing. Minute amounts of ice
or other contamination (equivalent to medium grit sandpaper) on the leading edges or upper wing surfaces can cause
significant reduction in the stall angle-of-attack. This can increase stall speed up to 30 knots. The increased stall
speed can be well above the stall warning (stick shaker) activation speed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
These final rules set forth reporting requirements for the BE&hyph;10, Benchmark Survey of U.S. Direct Investment
Abroad_1994, to be conducted by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), U.S. Department of Commerce. The rules for
the last benchmark survey, covering 1989, are deleted. The major change in reporting requirements since the last
survey that is implemented in these final rules is the raising of the exemption level for determining whether a long
form or a short form must be filed for nonbank foreign affiliates of nonbank U.S. parent companies.

In the August 26, 1994 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
, Volume 59, No. 165, 59 FR 44090, BEA published a notice of proposed rulemaking to revise 15 CFR 806.16 to set forth reporting
requirements for the BE&hyph;10, Benchmark Survey of U.S. Direct Investment Abroad_1994. No comments on the proposed
rules were received. Thus, these final rules are the same as the proposed rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The benchmark survey will be conducted by BEA under the International Investment and Trade in Services Survey Act,
hereinafter, ``the Act.'' Section 4(b) of the Act, as amended, requires that ``With respect to United States direct
investment abroad, the President shall conduct a benchmark survey covering year 1982, a benchmark survey covering
year 1989, and benchmark surveys covering every fifth year thereafter *&blank;*&blank;*'' Reporting in the survey
is mandatory. The responsibility for conducting benchmark surveys of U.S. direct investment abroad has been delegated
by the President to the Secretary of Commerce, who has redelegated it to BEA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The benchmark surveys are BEA's censuses, intended to cover the universe of U.S. direct investment abroad in value
terms. U.S. direct investment abroad is defined as the ownership or control, directly or indirectly, by one U.S. person
of 10 percent or more of the voting securities of an incorporated foreign business enterprise or an equivalent interest
in an unincorporated foreign business enterprise, including a branch.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the benchmark survey is to obtain comprehensive data on the overall operations of U.S. parent companies
and their foreign affiliates, and on positions and transactions between them. The survey is mandated by Congress
to provide a factual framework for addressing the concerns of policymakers and the general public about the effects
of direct investment abroad on the U.S. and foreign economies. The data from the survey are needed to record the size
of U.S. direct investment abroad, measure changes in such investment, and assess its impact. The data will provide
benchmarks for deriving current universe estimates of direct investment from sample data collected in other BEA
surveys in nonbenchmark years. In particular, they will serve as benchmarks for the quarterly direct investment
estimates included in the U.S. international transactions and the national income and product accounts, and for
annual estimates of the U.S. direct investment position abroad and of the operations of U.S. parent companies and
their foreign affiliates.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The benchmark surveys are the most comprehensive of BEA's surveys in terms of subject matter in order that they obtain
the detailed information on U.S. direct investment abroad needed for policy purposes. As specified in the Act, policy
areas of particular interest include, among other things, trade in both goods and services, employment and employee
compensation, taxes, and technology.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The survey consists of an instruction booklet, a claim for not filing the BE&hyph;10, and the following report forms:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Form BE&hyph;10A for reporting by a U.S. Reporter that is not a bank;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Form BE&hyph;10A BANK for reporting by a U.S. Reporter that is a bank;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Form BE&hyph;10B(LF) (Long Form) for reporting nonbank foreign affiliates of nonbank U.S. parents with assets,
sales, or net income greater than $50 million (positive or negative);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Form BE&hyph;10B(SF) (Short Form) for reporting nonbank foreign affiliates of nonbank U.S. parents with assets,
sales, or net income greater than $3 million, but not greater than $50 million (positive or negative); and

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Form BE&hyph;10B BANK for reporting foreign affiliates that are banks with assets, sales, or net income greater
than $3 million (positive or negative).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the survey is intended to cover the universe of U.S. direct investment abroad, in order to minimize the reporting
burden, foreign affiliates with assets, sales, and net income each equal to or less than $3 million (positive or negative)
are exempt from being reported on Form BE&hyph;10B(SF) or BE&hyph;10B BANK (but must be listed on Form BE&hyph;10A
SUPPLEMENT or BE&hyph;10A BANK SUPPLEMENT). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The major rule change from the last (1989) survey to the 1994 survey is the raising, from $15 million to $50 million,
of the exemption level for reporting foreign affiliates on the more detailed long form. In the 1994 survey, nonbank
foreign affiliates for which assets, sales, or net income is greater than $50 million (positive or negative) are required
to be reported on Form BE&hyph;10B(LF) (Long Form); nonbank foreign affiliates for which assets, sales, or net income
is greater than $3 million (positive or negative), but for which no one of these items is greater than $50 million (positive
or negative), are required to be reported on Form BE&hyph;10B(SF) (Short Form). In the 1989 benchmark survey, the
long-form exemption level was $15 million. This change means that approximately 6,000 foreign affiliates that previously
would have been reported on the long form will now be reported instead on the short form, thus reducing both reporting
and editing burden from what it would otherwise have been.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Forms for the 1994 benchmark survey are scheduled to be mailed out at the end of February 1995. A completed report is
due to BEA not later than May 31, 1995 for a U.S. Reporter filing less than 50 Forms BE&hyph;10B(LF), BE&hyph;10B(SF),
and/or BE&hyph;10B BANK and not later than June 30, 1995 for a U.S. Reporter required to file 50 or more Forms BE&hyph;10B(LF),
BE&hyph;10B(SF), and/or BE&hyph;10 BANK. A response is required from persons subject to the reporting requirements
of the BE&hyph;10 whether or not they are contacted by BEA. Also, a person, or their agent, who is contacted by BEA about
reporting in this survey must respond in writing.

The General Counsel, Department of Commerce, has certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, Small Business Administration,
under the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), that these final rules will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The exemption level is set in terms of the size of a U.S. company's
foreign affiliates. If an affiliate is owned 10 percent or more by the U.S. company and has assets, sales, or net income
greater than $3 million (positive or negative), it must be reported. Usually, the U.S. parent company (the one required
to file the report) is many times larger. Also, to minimize the reporting burden on smaller U.S. businesses, nonbank
foreign affiliates with assets, sales, and net income all below $50 million will be reported on the abbreviated BE&hyph;10B(SF),
or short form, rather than the BE&hyph;10B(LF), or long form.

(1) For purposes of the BE&hyph;10 survey, ``banking'' covers a business entity engaged in deposit banking or closely
related functions, including commercial banks, Edge Act corporations engaged in international or foreign banking,
foreign branches and agencies of U.S. banks whether or not they accept deposits abroad, savings and loans, savings
banks, and bank holding companies, ie., holding companies for which over 50 percent of their total income is from banks
that they hold. If the bank or bank holding company is part of a consolidated business enterprise and the gross operating
revenues from nonbanking activities of this consolidated entity are more than 50 percent of its total revenues, then
the consolidated entity is deemed not to be a bank even if banking revenues make up the largest single source of all revenues.
(Activities of subsidiaries of a bank or bank holding company that may not be banks but that provide support to the bank
parent company, such as real estate subsidiaries set up to hold the office buildings occupied by the bank parent company,
are considered bank activities.)

 A BE&hyph;10A BANK report must be completed by a U.S. Reporter that is a bank. For purposes of filing Form BE&hyph;10A
BANK, the U.S. Reporter is deemed to be the fully consolidated U.S. domestic business enterprise and all required
data on the form shall be for the fully consolidated domestic entity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If a U.S. bank had any foreign affiliates at any time during its 1994 fiscal year, whether a bank or nonbank and whether
held directly or indirectly, for which any one of the three items_total assets, sales or gross operating revenues
excluding sales taxes, or net income after provision for foreign income taxes_was greater than $3 million (positive
or negative) at any time during the affiliate's 1994 fiscal year, the U.S. Reporter must file a complete Form BE&hyph;10A
BANK and, as applicable, a BE&hyph;10A BANK SUPPLEMENT listing each, if any, exempt foreign affiliate, whether bank
or nonbank. It must also file a Form BE&hyph;10B(SF) for each nonexempt nonbank foreign affiliate and a Form BE&hyph;10B
BANK for each nonexempt foreign bank affiliate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the U.S. bank Reporter had no foreign affiliates for which any one of the three items listed in paragraph (d)(2)(i)
of this section was greater than $3 million (positive or negative) at any time during the affiliate's 1994 fiscal year,
then only items 1&hyph;4 of Form BE&hyph;10A BANK and the BE&hyph;10A BANK SUPPLEMENT, listing all exempt foreign

affiliate parent is otherwise exempt, i.e., a Form BE&hyph;10B(LF), (SF), or BANK must be filed for all affiliates
upward in a chain of ownership. However, a Form BE&hyph;10B BANK is not required to be filed for a foreign bank affiliate
in which the U.S. Reporter holds only an indirect ownership interest of 50 percent or less and that does not own a reportable
nonbank foreign affiliate, but the indirectly owned bank affiliate must be listed on the BE&hyph;10A BANK SUPPLEMENT.

 of

December 14, 1993 (58 FR 65452), FDA issued a final monograph for OTC pediculicide drug products (21 CFR part 358, subpart
G). The final monograph becomes effective on December 14, 1994. Prior to that date, jurisdiction over pediculicide
products is vested concurrently with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and with FDA. EPA and FDA labeling
requirements for these products are different. After December 14, 1994, FDA will have sole jurisdiction over labeling
and other requirements applicable to OTC pediculicide drug products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 25, 1994, the Nonprescription Drug Manufacturers Association (NDMA) submitted a citizen petition (Ref.
1) requesting certain actions because of the dual jurisdiction over OTC pediculicide drug products that exists until
December 14, 1994. On April 14, 1994, a meeting was held between FDA, EPA, and NDMA (Ref. 2). On April 22, 1994, NDMA submitted
a second, more detailed citizen petition (Ref. 3). NDMA requested FDA to provide industry at least 1 1/2 years from
December 14, 1993 (the date of publication of the final monograph for OTC pediculicide drug products), for a smooth
transition from EPA to FDA regulations for OTC pediculicide drug products. NDMA also requested FDA agreement not
to bring enforcement proceedings against OTC pediculicide drug products applied to the human body and bearing EPA-mandated
labeling for 1 year after December 14, 1994. The enforcement deferral would apply to products distributed with labeling
printed before December 14, 1994, or where the products shipped into interstate commerce had been in stock before
December 14, 1994. NDMA also submitted a citizen petition to EPA, which responded by notice dated September 6, 1994
(Ref. 4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA responded to NDMA (Refs. 5 and 6) stating that a 11/2 year extension to meet FDA labeling requirements would not
be granted on a blanket basis for all products. The agency stated that requests for extensions would be evaluated on
a case-by-case basis. The agency also indicated that any extension granted will be limited to the quantity of stock
that a company has on hand prior to December 14, 1994. FDA also stated that, in its discretion, it agrees not to bring
enforcement proceedings against OTC pediculicide drug products conforming with the final monograph and containing
EPA-required labeling for a period of 1 year after the effective date of the final monograph on December 14, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has placed all of the correspondence on this subject in docket no. 81N&hyph;0201 for OTC pediculicide drug products,
to enable interested persons to see the correspondence. The documents may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch
(address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This document contains amendments to the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR part 1) under section 401(d)(1). Sections
1022(c), 1022(d), and 2002(a)(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), Pub. L. 93&hyph;406
(1974), amended sections 401(d), 401(f), and 408 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) to permit an entity that is not
a bank to be a trustee or a custodian for purposes of those Code sections if such entity demonstrates to the satisfaction
of the Secretary of the Treasury that it will administer the trust and hold assets in a manner consistent with the law.
Although section 401(d)(1) was repealed by section 237(a) of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982,
Pub. L. 97&hyph;248 (1982), the regulations under section 401(d)(1) remain in force and effect to the extent that
they govern the determination of whether an entity can be a nonbank trustee or custodian for purposes of Treasury Regulation
&sect;&sect;1.401(f)&hyph;1 and 1.408&hyph;2(d). Section 1.401&hyph;12(n)(6)(ii) of the regulations, proposed
in 1975 and finalized in 1979 under section 401(d)(1) of the Code, sets forth net worth requirements for nonbank trustees
based on the greater of a specified dollar amount or a percentage of the value of all assets held by the nonbank trustee
in fiduciary accounts. A primary objective of this adequacy of net worth requirement has been to ensure that nonbank
trustees maintain a level of solvency commensurate with their financial and fiduciary responsibilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the existing net worth requirements, nonbank trustees may not accept new accounts unless their net worth
exceeds the greater of $100,000 or four percent of the value of all assets held in fiduciary accounts. Additionally,
nonbank trustees must take whatever steps are necessary (including the relinquishment of fiduciary accounts) to
ensure that their net worth exceeds the greater of $50,000 or two percent of the value of assets held in their fiduciary
accounts. While similar requirements apply to passive nonbank trustees (qualified nonbank entities that have no
discretion to direct the investment of assets), the percentage requirements for these trustees are lower. Specifically,
passive nonbank trustees may not accept new accounts unless their net worth exceeds the greater of $100,000 or two
percent of the value of all assets held in fiduciary accounts and they must take appropriate action (including the
relinquishment of fiduciary accounts) to ensure that their net worth exceeds the greater of $50,000 or one percent
of the value of assets held in their fiduciary accounts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The IRS has received comments that this requirement is unduly restrictive in the case of passive trustees who are broker-dealers
regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and who are required to have their fiduciary accounts protected
by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC). SIPC, established by Congress in 1970, insures customer
assets and funds held by a U.S. broker-dealer in the case of an insolvency in an amount of up to $500,000 per customer,
of which $100,000 may be cash. Thus, with respect to SIPC protected assets, the on-going net worth requirement provides
little if any increase in protection of assets held in fiduciary accounts. Accordingly, these temporary regulations
provide that SIPC protected assets will be disregarded in determining the value of assets held in fiduciary accounts
by passive trustees for purposes of the percentage prong of the net worth requirement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These temporary regulations also increase the initial net worth requirement for all nonbank trustees to better assure
that enterprises are sound and well-funded during their start-up period. Under the existing net worth requirements,
every nonbank trustee must have an initial net worth that exceeds $100,000. Under these temporary regulations, all
entities applying for nonbank trustee status must have a net worth of not less than $250,000 for the most recent taxable
year preceding the applicant's initial application. The existing net worth requirements, as modified for SIPC protected
assets, will continue to apply on an on-going basis after a nonbank trustee has obtained the approval of the IRS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the absence of evidence that the on-going net worth requirements fail to meet the underlying objectives, these
requirements (except with respect to SIPC protected assets) remain unchanged. However, the IRS recognizes that
the nonbank trustee requirements have been in effect since 1979. Accordingly, the IRS and Treasury would welcome
comments concerning the net worth requirements generally, as well as other aspects of the 1979 regulations.

It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore,
a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure
Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations,
and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue
Code, these temporary regulations will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration
for comment on their impact on small business.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (``PBGC'') is issuing an interim final rule that will enable it to refer
past-due, legally enforceable debts to the Internal Revenue Service to be offset against federal tax refunds. The
PBGC believes that adoption of this rule will enhance its debt collection ability. The procedures in this rule assure
that PBGC regulations meet the requirements for participation in the federal tax refund offset program.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (``PBGC'') administers the pension plan termination insurance program
under Title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (``ERISA'') (29 U.S.C. 1301 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
). In conjunction with the pension plan termination insurance program, persons (including organizations and entities)
incur various types of debts to the PBGC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The PBGC uses various methods to collect its debts. As part of an effort to enhance its debt collection ability, on November
30, 1994, the PBGC published a final rule adding to its regulations a new ``Debt Collection'' part (29 CFR part 2609)
that included administrative offset procedures in subpart B and reserved subpart C for tax refund offset procedures
(59 FR 61272; effective December 30, 1994). The PBGC has not previously participated in the tax refund offset program
of the Internal Revenue Service (``IRS''). Because the PBGC believes that such participation will enhance its debt
collection ability, the PBGC now is amending part 2609 to include the anticipated subpart C procedures and adding,
in subpart A, a general section (&sect;2609.1) and several definitions (&sect;2609.2). The PBGC also is amending
two provisions of part 2606 of its regulations (29 CFR part 2606, Rules of Administrative Review of Agency Decisions),
and it is reserving subpart D of part 2609 for salary offset procedures.

The Federal Tax Refund Offset Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The federal tax refund offset program is authorized by section 3720A of subchapter II (Claims of the United States),
chapter 37 of title 31 of the United States Code (31 U.S.C. 3720A). Section 3720A directs any federal agency that is
owed a past-due, legally enforceable debt to notify the Secretary of the Treasury at least once a year of the amount
of any such debt. Before doing so, an agency must meet requirements specified in subsection (b) of section 3720A or
prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury to ensure that the debt is past-due and legally enforceable and that the
agency has made reasonable efforts (pursuant to regulations) to obtain payment. It also must comply with the notice,
minimum debt, and fee requirements in Treasury regulations issued pursuant to subsection (d) of section 3720A. Upon
receiving notice that a named person owes an agency a past-due, legally enforceable debt, the Secretary of the Treasury
is to determine whether any amounts are payable to that person as a refund and, if so, to reduce the refund by the amount
of the debt and pay the amount of the reduction to the agency (subsection (c) of section 3720A).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 301.6402&hyph;6 of the IRS's Procedure and Administration Regulations (26 CFR 301.6402&hyph;6) provides
that to be eligible to participate in the tax refund offset program an agency must have promulgated temporary or final
administrative offset and federal tax refund offset regulations (under 31 U.S.C. 3716 and 3720A, respectively).
In addition, unless the agency has certified (relying on the most current information reasonably available) that
it will not refer the names of present or former federal employees or other persons whose debts are subject to offset
under section 5514(a)(1) of title 5 of the United States Code (5 U.S.C. 5514(a)(1)), it must have promulgated temporary
or final salary offset regulations (&sect;301.6402&hyph;6(b)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To be referred to the IRS for offset, IRS's regulations require, among other things, that a debt be at least $25 and,
except in the case of a judgment debt or any debts specifically exempt from this requirement, be referred within 10
years after the agency's right of action accrues (&sect;301.6402&hyph;6(c) (1) and (7)). In addition, an agency
may not refer a debt unless (1) the debt is ineligible for administrative offset (by reason of the exclusion in 31 U.S.C.
3716(c)(2) for claims explicitly provided for in other statutes) or the agency cannot currently collect it by administrative
offset against amounts payable to the taxpayer by that agency, and (2) the agency cannot currently collect the debt
by salary offset (&sect;301.6402&hyph;6(c) (2) and (3)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before referring a debt, an agency must notify, or make a reasonable attempt to notify, the taxpayer that the debt is
past-due and, unless repaid within 60 days, will be referred to the IRS for offset against a tax overpayment; give the
taxpayer at least 60 days to present evidence that all or part of the debt is not past-due or not legally enforceable;
consider evidence presented; and determine that the debt is past-due and legally enforceable (&sect;301.6402&hyph;6(c)
(4) and (5)). Under IRS regulations, an agency has made a reasonable attempt to notify the taxpayer if it uses the most
recent address obtained from the IRS pursuant to section 6103(m) (2), (4), or (5) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C.
6103(m) (2), (4), or (5)), except where agency notices are sent to a different address received in a clear and concise
notification from a taxpayer (&sect;301.6402&hyph;6(d)(1)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, if a consumer debt exceeds $100, an agency also must disclose it to a consumer reporting agency, as authorized
by section 3(d) of the Federal Claims Collection Act (31 U.S.C. 3711(f)), unless the consumer reporting agency would
be prohibited from reporting information concerning the debt because it is obsolete (see 15 U.S.C. 1681(c)) (&sect;301.6402&hyph;6(c)(6)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency referrals of debts must contain the name and identifying number of the taxpayer who is responsible for the debt,
the amount of the debt, the date on which the debt became past-due, and the agency's designation (&sect;301.6402&hyph;6(e)).
The agency must promptly notify the IRS if, after a referral, the agency determines that an error has been made with
respect to the information transmitted to the IRS, or if the agency receives a payment from the debtor (&sect;301.6402&hyph;6(f)).

Interim Final Rule

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As indicated in &sect;2609.31 (Purpose and scope), the procedures in subpart C of part 2609 apply to determinations
that a debt of at least $25 is past-due and legally enforceable, and to PBGC debt referrals to the IRS. Section 2609.32
reiterates when, under IRS regulations, a debt is eligible for tax refund offset. Among other things, a debt is not
to be referred unless the PBGC cannot currently collect it by salary offset (&sect;2609.32(b)). The PBGC intends
to promulgate salary offset regulations under section 5514(a) of Title 5 of the United States Code (5 U.S.C. 5514(a)).
Until it does so, it will not refer to the IRS the names of any persons whose debts are subject to salary offset.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 2609.33 specifies the procedures that the PBGC must complete before referring a debt to the IRS. The PBGC may
satisfy these requirements in conjunction with any other procedures that apply to the same debt, such as administrative
offset procedures or procedures prescribed in part 2606 (&sect;2609.33(a)).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The PBGC anticipates, however, that particularly in the first year of its participation in the tax refund offset program,
the debts it refers to the IRS will include debts as to which procedures previously provided do not satisfy the requirements
of new &sect;2609.33. For example, the PBGC anticipates referring debts relating to premium payments due under section
4007 of ERISA (29 U.S.C. 1307) and part 2610 of the PBGC's regulations. Determinations with respect to premiums, interest,
and late payment penalties are covered by part 2606 of the PBGC's regulations (29 CFR part 2606), Rules for Administrative
Review of Agency Decisions. Part 2606 currently provides that (subject to limited exceptions) an aggrieved person
must request reconsideration of an initial PBGC determination as to premiums, interest, and/or late payment penalties
within 30 days of the date of the determination and that the request must reference all pertinent information in the
PBGC's possession and include any additional information believed to be relevant (&sect;&sect;2606.33 and 2606.35).
Thus, the PBGC has not been providing such debtors with at least 60 days to present evidence that all or part of a debt
is not past-due or not legally enforceable, as is required for tax refund offset (&sect;2609.33(b)(2)). Nor has the
PBGC notified such debtors of its intention to refer a debt for tax refund offset (&sect;2609.33(b)(1)). Before referring
these debts to IRS, the PBGC will provide debtors any additional procedures required by new &sect;2609.33.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order that the PBGC in the future may provide, in a single review, procedures that comply both with this subpart and
with part 2606 (where applicable), the PBGC is amending &sect;&sect;2606.33 and 2606.53. The amendment adds language
that will require the PBGC, in a case where administrative review includes a procedure in &sect;2609.33, to provide
for a 60-day (or longer) period for requesting review (and, hence for presenting evidence that all or part of a debt
is not past-due or not legally enforceable).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PBGC currently has no plans to use agents, or persons other than PBGC employees acting on its behalf, to consider
evidence under &sect;2609.33. Should it decide to do so in the future, a debtor would be accorded 30 days, or more, from
the date of that person's determination within which to request review by the Director of the Financial Operations
Department or his or her designee (&sect;2609.33(b)(3)), as required by IRS regulations (&sect;301.6402&hyph;6(d)(2)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 2609.33(c) provides for consumer reporting agency disclosure. Agency reporting of delinquent debts to
a consumer reporting agency will comply with the Federal Claims Collections Standards (see 4 CFR 102.5) and with the
Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552a). However, the vast majority of debts to the PBGC are not consumer debts
subject to this requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PBGC's Financial Operations Department will have primary responsibility for PBGC participation in the IRS's
tax refund offset program (see &sect;2609.1(b)(1)). As indicated in &sect;&sect;2609.33(c) and 2609.34, this
includes responsibility for consumer reporting agency disclosure and for referral of debt for tax refund offset
(including assuring that referrals contain information, and are corrected, as required by IRS regulations (&sect;301.6402&hyph;6
(e) and (f)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ascertaining indebtedness and other aspects of agency collection activities will continue to be handled by the PBGC
organizational unit with functional responsibility for the type of claim involved (see &sect;2609.1(b)(2)). (Applicable
assignments of responsibilities are set forth in the mission and functions statements issued by the Executive Director
and included (along with organization charts) in the PBGC Directives Manual as section 30&hyph;1 of Part GA (General
Administration.)

This rule prescribes rules of agency organization and procedure, in accordance with congressional standards implemented
by the IRS after notice and comment rulemaking. Because the Administrative Procedure Act does not require publication
of a general notice of proposed rulemaking before the issuance of rules of agency organization and procedure, and
because, in view of prior IRS rulemaking, the PBGC has for good cause found further notice and public procedure unnecessary
(5 U.S.C. 553(b) (A) and (B)), the PBGC is issuing this rule as an interim final rule. However, the PBGC is soliciting
public comment on its provisions. If the comments received during this period warrant modifying provisions of the
rule, the PBGC will do so.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The PBGC has determined that this action is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the criteria set forth in
Executive Order 12866 because the rule would not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely
affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment,
public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; create a serious inconsistency or
otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements,
grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or raise novel legal or policy
issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in Executive Order
12866. The purpose of this rule is to enhance the PBGC's debt collection ability. The procedures will be triggered
only by a failure to pay a past-due, legally enforceable debt.

(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Purpose.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This subpart prescribes procedures for debt collection by tax refund offset, as authorized by section 3720A of subchapter
II, chapter 37 of title 31 of the United States Code (31 U.S.C. 3720A) and in accordance with applicable IRS regulations
(26 CFR 301&hyph;6402.6), including a related procedure for disclosure to a consumer reporting agency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Scope.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The procedures in this subpart apply to determinations that a debt of at least $25 is past-due and legally enforceable,
to referrals by the PBGC of past-due, legally enforceable debts to the IRS for offset, and to any subsequent corrections
of information contained in such referrals.

Eligibility of debt for tax refund offset.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The PBGC will determine whether a debt is eligible for tax refund offset in accordance with IRS regulations (26 CFR
301.6402&hyph;6 (c) and (d)). The PBGC may refer a past-due, legally enforceable debt to the IRS for offset if:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The debt is a judgment debt, or the PBGC's right of action accrued not more than 10 years earlier (unless the debt
is specifically exempt from this requirement);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The PBGC cannot currently collect the debt by salary offset (pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 5514(a)(1));
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The debt is ineligible for administrative offset (by reason of 31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(2)), or the PBGC cannot currently
collect the debt by administrative offset (under 31 U.S.C. 3716 and subpart B of this part) against amounts payable
by the debtor to the PBGC;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The PBGC has notified, or attempted to notify, the debtor of its intent to refer the debt, given the debtor an opportunity
to present evidence that all or part of the debt is not past-due or not legally enforceable, considered any evidence
presented by the debtor in accordance with &sect;2609.33 of this part, and determined that the debt is past-due and
legally enforceable;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) If the debt is a consumer debt and exceeds $100, the PBGC has disclosed the debt to a consumer reporting agency (as
authorized by 31 U.S.C. 3711(f) and provided in &sect;2609.33 of this part), unless a consumer reporting agency would
be prohibited from reporting information concerning the debt (by reason of 15 U.S.C. 1681c); and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) The debt is at least $25.

(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Before referring a debt for tax refund offset, the PBGC will complete the procedures specified in paragraph (b) of
this section and, if applicable, paragraph (c) of this section. The PBGC may satisfy these requirements in conjunction
with any other procedures that apply to the same debt, such as those prescribed in &sect;2609.23 of this part or part
2606 of this subchapter.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice, opportunity to present evidence, and determination of indebtedness.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) The PBGC will notify, or make a reasonable attempt to notify, a person owing a debt (a ``debtor'') that a debt is past-due
and if not repaid within 60 days, the PBGC will refer the debt to the IRS for offset against any overpayment of tax. For
this purpose, compliance with IRS procedures (26 CFR 301.6402&hyph;6(d)(1)) constitutes a reasonable attempt
to notify a debtor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A debtor will have at least 60 days to present evidence, for consideration by the PBGC, that all or part of a debt is
not past-due or not legally enforceable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If evidence that all or part of a debt is not past-due or not legally enforceable is considered by an agent or person
other than a PBGC employee acting on behalf of the PBGC, a debtor will have at least 30 days from the date of the determination
on the debt to request review by the Director of the Financial Operations Department (or a department official designated
by the Director).

(1)(i) If a consumer debt exceeds $100, the Director of the Financial Operations Department (or a department official
designated by the Director), after verifying the validity and overdue status of the debt and that section 605 of the
Consumer Credit Protection Act (15 U.S.C. 1681c) does not prohibit a consumer reporting agency from reporting information
concerning the debt because it is obsolete, will send the individual who owes the debt a written notice_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) That the debt is past-due;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) That the PBGC intends to disclose to a consumer reporting agency that the individual is responsible for the debt
and the specific information to be disclosed; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) How the individual may obtain an explanation of the debt, dispute the information in PBGC's records, and obtain
administrative review of the debt.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the PBGC does not have a current address for an individual, the Director of the Financial Operations Department
(or a department official designated by the Director) will take reasonable action to locate the individual.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Director of the Financial Operations Department (or a department official designated by the Director) will
disclose the debt if, within 60 days (or, at his or her discretion, more than 60 days) after sending the notice described
in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the individual has not repaid the debt, or agreed to repay the debt under a written
agreement, or requested administrative review of the debt.

I. Background on the Colorado Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On December 15, 1980, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Colorado program. General background
information on the Colorado program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and a detailed
explanation of the conditions of approval can be found in the December 15, 1980,

II. Proposed Amendment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated April 18, 1994, Colorado submitted to OSM a proposed amendment to its program pursuant to SMCRA (administrative
record No. CO&hyph;611). Colorado submitted the proposed amendment in partial response to a March 22, 1990, letter
(administrative record No. CO&hyph;496) that OSM sent to Colorado in accordance with 30 CFR 732.17(c), and at its
own initiative. The provisions of the rules of the Colorado Mined Land Reclamation Board at 2 Code of Colorado Regulations
407&hyph;2 that Colorado proposed to revise were: Rule 1.04, definitions; Rule 3.02, performance bond requirements
for surface coal mining and reclamation operations; Rule 3.03, release of performance bonds; Rule 3.06, special
bonding requirements for construction of mine drainage control facilities; and Rule 4.15.10, revegetation success
criteria for areas to be developed for industrial, commercial, or residential use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the May 13, 1994, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 24998), provided an opportunity for a public hearing or meeting on its substantive adequacy, and invited public
comment on its adequacy (administrative record No. CO&hyph;617). Because no one requested a public hearing or meeting,
none was held. The public comment period ended June 13, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During its review of the amendment, OSM identified concerns or requested clarification regarding Colorado's (1)
Rule 3.03.1(2)(b), concerning requirements for the demonstration of productivity on prime farmlands prior to phase
II bond release, and (2) Rule 4.15.10(3), concerning a variance from the requirement for living ground cover the control
erosion for mine support facilities located within areas where the premining and postmining land uses are industrial
or commercial. OSM notified Colorado of the concerns by letter dated July 12, 1994 (administrative record No. CO&hyph;631).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Colorado responded in a letter dated July 28, 1994, by submitting a revised amendment and additional explanatory
information (administrative record No. CO&hyph;635). Colorado proposed revisions to and additional explanatory
information for Rules 3.02.1(3)(b) and 4.25.5(3)(a), concerning the criteria for bonds released on prime farmlands,
and Rule 4.15.10(3), concerning a variance from compliance with the requirement for living ground cover to control
erosion specifically for mine support facilities located within areas where the premining and postmining land uses
are industrial or commercial.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the revisions to and additional explanatory information for the proposed program amendment submitted
by Colorado, OSM reopened the public comment period in the September 1, 1994

As discussed below, the Director, in accordance with SMCRA and 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17, finds, with one exception
and additional requirement, that the proposed program amendment submitted by Colorado on April 18, 1994, and as revised
by it and supplemented with additional explanatory information on July 28, 1994, is no less effective than the corresponding
Federal regulations. Accordingly, the Director approves the proposed amendment.

2. Rules 1.04(25), 3.02.4(1)(b), and 3.02.4(2)(c)(ix), Collateral Bonds
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
a. Rule 1.04(25), Requirements for Cash and Government Bonds Used as Forms of Collateral Bond
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Colorado proposed to revise the definition of ``collateral bond'' at Rule 1.04(25) to require that (1) cash be deposited
in a Federally insured or equivalently protected account and (2) negotiable government bonds be endorsed to the order
of the State.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal definition of ``collateral bond'' requires (1) at 30 CFR 800.5(b)(1) that cash be deposited in a Federally
insured or equivalently protected account and (2) at 30 CFR 800.5(b)(2) that government bonds be endorsed to the order
of the regulatory authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the revisions pertaining to cash and government bonds in Colorado's definition of ``collateral bond'' at
Rule 1.04(25) are substantively identical to the requirements of the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.5(b) (1) and
(2), the Director finds that Colorado's proposed Rule 1.04(25) is no less effective than the Federal regulations
at 30 CFR 800.5(b). Therefore, the Director approves the revisions pertaining to cash and government bonds as forms
of collateral bond at Rule 1.04(25).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
b. Rules 1.04(25), 3.02.4(1)(b), and 3.02.4(2)(c)(ix), Disallowance of the Use of Real Property as a Form of Collateral
Bond
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Colorado proposed to revise the definition of ``collateral bond'' at Rule 1.04(25) and the conditions applicable
to collateral bonds at Rules 3.02.4(1)(b) and 3.02.4(2)(c)(ix) by deleting language referring to a perfected first-lien
security interest in real property located in Colorado. The effect of these deletions is to disallow real property
as an allowable form of collateral bond in the Colorado program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal definition of ``collateral bond'' at 30 CFR 800.5(b)(5) provides that a perfected, first-lien security
interest in real property, in favor of the regulatory authority, may be used to support a collateral bond. The Federal
regulations at 30 CFR 800.21(c) set forth the conditions applicable to the use of real property as collateral bond.
The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11(b) also provide, however, that State laws and regulations may be more stringent
and environmentally protective than the corresponding Federal regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this case, Colorado's proposed deletion, at Rules 1.04(25), 3.02.4(1)(b), and 3.02.4(2)(c)(ix), of the use of
real property to support a collateral bond would make these proposed rules more stringent than the corresponding
Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.5(b)(5) and 800.21(c) because Colorado would allow only cash and other financial
instruments that have a fairly constant and readily ascertainable value to be used to support a collateral bond.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed above, because Colorado's proposed rules are more stringent and environmentally protective than the
corresponding Federal regulations, which is provided for in the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11(b), the Director
finds that Colorado's disallowance of the use of real property as a form of collateral bond at Rules 1.04(25), 3.02.4(1)(b),
and 3.02.4(2)(c)(ix), is no less effective than the counterpart Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.5(b)(5) and 800.21(c)
concerning the use of real property as a form of collateral bond. Therefore, the Director approves Colorado's disallowance
of real property to support a collateral bond by deleting all references to ``real property'' from Rules 1.04(25),
3.02.4(1)(b), and 3.02.4(2)(c)(ix).

3. Rules 1.04(116), 3.02.4(1)(c), and 3.02.4(2)(e), Self-Bonds
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Colorado proposed to disallow the use of a self-bond as a bond form by deleting in their entirety (1) Rule 1.04(116),
the definition of ``self-bond,'' and (2) Rules 3.02.4(1)(c) and 3.02.4(2)(e), which allow for the use of self-bonds.
Colorado defines ``self-bond'' to mean the bond of an applicant itself accompanied by one or more perfected first-lien
security interests in real property located in Colorado. Colorado's disallowance of the use of self-bonds is consistent
with its proposed disallowance of the use of real property to support a collateral bond, as discussed in finding No.
2.b above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.12 require that a regulatory authority prescribe the form of the performance
bond, but allow the regulatory authority to choose to prescribe a surety bond, a collateral bond, a self-bond, or a
combination of any of these bonding methods.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the regulatory authority is not obligated to allow all bond forms, the Director finds that Colorado's proposed
deletion of use of self-bonds at Rules 1.04(116), 3.02.4(1)(c), and 3.02.4(2)(e) is consistent with and no less effective
than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.12. Therefore, the Director approves the deletion of Rules 1.04(116),
3.02.4(1)(c), and 3.02.4(2)(e).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
a. Rule 3.02.1(7), Exemption From Bond Liability for Implementation of Features of an Alternative Postmining Land
Use That Are Beyond the Control of the Permittee
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Colorado proposed to revise Rule 3.02.1(7) to clarify that the permittee is excused from bond liability for implementation
of features of an alternative postmining land use, approved under Rule 4.16.3, that are beyond the control of the permittee.
Colorado explained in its ``Statement of Basis, Specific Statutory Authority, and Purpose,'' submitted with the
proposed amendment, that ``the exemption provision is intended to apply only to actual implementation of those features
of an approved alternative post-mining land use outside the scope of the reclamation plan, such as construction of
an industrial or commercial or residential development.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.13(d)(2) indicate that a bond need not cover the implementation of an alternative
postmining land use that is approved under the alternative postmining land use criteria at 30 CFR 816.133(c) and 817.133(c)
and that is beyond the control of the permittee. In response to comments regarding a petition to amend the Federal regulations
at 30 CFR Subchapter J, OSM justified the language at 30 CFR 800.13(d)(2), previously proposed as 805.13(e) and codified
as 805.13(f), by explaining that
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
[I]t is unreasonable to require the surety to assume liability for completion of an alternative post mining land use
plan as a condition of release of a performance bond. There is no way that a surety can guarantee that *&blank;*&blank;*
houses [are] built or an industrial complex [is] developed. In many cases a third party land owner who may be different
than the operator would be required to develop the post mining land use and would not be held liable under performance
bond by the surety. Therefore, the surety would not have any guarantee that the land owner would develop the property
as part of the operators postmining land use.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
(44 FR 28005, 28007, May 14, 1979). Therefore, the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.13(d) exclude from bond liability
features of an approved alternative postmining land use outside the scope of the reclamation plan, such as construction
of a residential or an industrial development.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated in its ``Statement of Basis, Specific Statutory Authority, and Purpose,'' Colorado's intent to apply proposed
Rule 3.02.1(7) to industrial, commercial, or residential developments is consistent with the rationale set forth
in the Federal regulation preamble. On this basis, and because the proposed rule otherwise includes the same requirement
as the Federal regulations to excuse the permittee from bond liability for implementation of features of an alternative
postmining land use that are beyond the control of the permittee, the Director finds that proposed Rule 3.02.1(7)
is no less effective than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.13(d)(2). The Director approves the proposed rule.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
b. Rules 3.02.1(7) and 3.03.1(3)(e), Requirements That Performance Bonds for Approved Alternative Postmining
Land Uses of Industrial, Commercial or Residential Must Be Sufficient To Reclaim the Site to a Condition Capable of
Supporting the Premining Land Use and Be Held Throughout the Applicable Liability Period
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Colorado proposed to revise Rule 3.02.1(7) to require that a performance bond, for an approved alternative postmining
land use of industrial, commercial, or residential, must be sufficient to reclaim the site to a condition capable
of supporting the premining land use, should the alternative postmining land use prove to be infeasible in the event
of bond forfeiture. Colorado also proposed to revise Rule 3.03.1(3)(e) to require, for areas with an alternative
postmining land use designation of industrial, commercial, or residential, bond coverage throughout the applicable
liability period that is sufficient for the regulatory authority to return the land to its premining land use in the
event of bond forfeiture.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is no specific counterpart in the Federal program to Colorado's proposal that a performance bond, for lands
with an approved alternative postmining land use of industrial, commercial, or residential, be sufficient to reclaim
the land to the premining land use. However, the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.133(a) and 817.133(a) require that
land be reclaimed to the premining land use or to a higher or better land use. If, due to bond forfeiture, the alternative
postmining land use cannot be implemented, then the requirement to return the land to the premining land use, as proposed
at Rules 3.02.1(7) and 3.03.1(3)(e), is consistent with the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.133(a) and 817.133(a).
Furthermore, the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.13(a)(1) and 800.14(b), require, respectively, that (1) bond
liability shall be for a period which is coincident with the operator's period of extended responsibility for successful
revegetation or until reclamation requirements of SMCRA, the regulatory program, and the permit are achieved, whichever
is later, and (2) the amount of bond shall be sufficient to assure the completion of the reclamation plan if the work
has to be performed by the regulatory authority. Colorado's proposal at Rule 3.03.1(3)(e) is consistent with the
requirements of the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.13(a)(1) and 800.14(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the discussion above, the Director finds that Colorado's proposed Rules 3.02.1(7) and 3.03.1(3)(e), concerning
bond coverage sufficient to return lands with an approved alternative postmining land use of industrial, commercial,
or residential, to the premining land use in the event of bond forfeiture, are no less effective than the Federal regulations
at 30 CFR 800.13(a)(1), 800.14(b), 816.133(a), and 817.133(a). The Director approves the proposed rules.

5. Rules 3.02.2(4) (b) and (d), Adjustments of Bond Amount
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Colorado proposed to revise Rule 3.02.2(4)(b) to specify that the requirements for the Division to provide a written
decision and public notice apply to any adjustment, not just an increase, in the bond amount. Colorado proposed to
revise Rule 3.02.2(4)(d) to specify that a request for bond reduction (1) must be submitted with evidence demonstrating
that the reduction is warranted due to a reduction of proposed affected acreage, change in mining or reclamation methods,
or other documented factors which reduce the cost of future reclamation, (2) must be submitted in the form of a permit
or a technical revision, and (3) cannot be based on reclamation performed, which must be requested as a bond release
under Rule 3.03.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is no Federal counterpart to Colorado's proposal at Rule 3.02.2(4)(b) that the Division issue a written decision
and provide public notice regarding adjustments in bond amounts. The counterpart Federal regulation to Colorado's
proposed Rule 3.02.2(4)(d), at 30 CFR 800.15(c), provides that a permittee may request bond reduction based upon
submission of evidence to the regulatory authority proving that the permittee's method of operation or other circumstances
reduces the estimated cost for the regulatory authority to reclaim the bonded area. The Federal regulation further
provides that a reduction in bond amount involving cost estimates and undisturbed land shall not be considered a request
for bond release.

Colorado's proposed Rules 3.02.2(4)(b) and (d) are more specific than the counterpart Federal regulations at 30
CFR 800.15(c) in that the proposed rules provide (1) procedures governing decisions on bond adjustments and (2) more
precise examples of what constitutes a basis for a reduction in bond amount. This specificity of the proposed rules
is consistent with the counterpart Federal regulations. In all other respects, the requirements of Colorado's proposed
rules are substantively identical to the Federal regulations. Therefore, the Director finds that proposed Rules
3.02.2(4)(b) and (d) are no less effective than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.15(c) and approves them.

6. Rules 3.02.3(2)(a), (b), and (c), and 4.15.10(2) and (3), Bond Liability Period and Revegetation Success Standards
for Land With an Approved Industrial, Commercial, or Residential Postmining Land Use
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

a. Rules 3.02.3(2)(a), (b), and (c), Bond Liability Period
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Colorado proposed new Rule 3.02.3(2)(c) to require, for areas where the approved postmining land use is industrial,
commercial, or residential, that the minimum period of liability shall continue until compliance with the revegetation
requirement of proposed Rule 4.15.10(2) or the alternative requirement of proposed Rule 4.15.10(3) is demonstrated.
Colorado proposed to revise existing Rules 3.02.3(2)(a) and (b), which require that the basis of a minimum 5 or 10-year
bond liability period, to reference the proposed exception at Rule 3.02.3(2)(c). Colorado's referenced proposed
rules 4.15.10(2) and 4.15.10(3), respectively, (1) require that erosion be controlled by living ground cover within
2 years of regrading or within 2 years of the designation of the land use, whichever is later, and (2) provide for a limited
exception for certain mine support facilities, where living ground cover is not necessary to control erosion. (See
finding No. 6.b below for a discussion of proposed Rules 4.15.10(2) and (3)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, Colorado's proposed rules 3.02.3(2)(a), (b), and (c), as explained by Colorado in its ``Statement of
Basis, Specific Statutory Authority, and Purpose,'' effectively exempt areas to be developed for industrial, commercial,
or residential land uses from the requirement that the success of revegetation be judged on the basis of a minimum 5
or 10-year responsibility period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.116(c)(2) and (3) and 817.116(c)(2) and (3) provide for the same 5 or 10-year
liability periods as do Colorado's Rules 3.02.3(2)(a) and (b). And, for areas to be developed for industrial, commercial,
or residential use within 2 years after regrading is completed, the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.116(b)(4) and
817.116(b)(4) require, as the revegetation success standard, vegetative ground cover sufficient to control erosion
within 2 years after regrading is completed. This same requirement is included in Colorado's proposed Rule 4.15.10(2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM's 1979 and 1983 preambles to the Federal regulations address issues pertinent to Colorado's proposed Rules 3.02.3(2)(a),
(b), and (c), which concern release of liability on areas with an approved industrial, commercial, or residential
postmining land use upon demonstration of the revegetation success standard for the land use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM explained in the preamble to the 1979 Federal regulations at 30 CFR 807.12(d), concerning criteria for bond release,
that, unlike other performance standards, the performance standards at 30 CFR 816.116 and 817.116 for revegetation
contain a special exception for industrial, commercial, or residential postmining land use plans approved by the
regulatory authority. OSM explained that the exception allows permittees to meet a less stringent revegetation
test for reclaimed areas that will be developed for industrial, commercial, or residential use within 2 years following
completion of regrading. OSM also stated that, if an approved industrial, commercial, or residential land use is
not implemented within 2 years, it becomes necessary to comply with the full-scale general revegetation success
standards at 30 CFR 816.116 and 817.116 (44 FR 14902, 15122, March 13, 1979). In other words, the Federal regulations
at 30 CFR 816.116(b)(4) and 817.116(b)(4), on lands developed within 2 years after regrading for industrial, commercial,
or residential use, function as a limited exception to the full revegetation requirements of 30 CFR 816.116 and 817.116,
which include the requirement at 30 CFR 816.116(c)(2) and (3) and 817.116(c)(2) and (3) for a minimum 5 or 10-year liability
period.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM, in the preamble to the 1983 Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.13, concerning the period of bond liability, provides
clarification that under 30 CFR 800.13(d)(2), which states that implementation of an alternative postmining land
use that is beyond the control of the permittee need not be covered by the bond, the permittee is excused from bonding
for third-party actions only insofar as they relate to implementation of approved postmining land uses by the third
party (48 FR 32932, 32943, July 19, 1983). In other words, because the Federal regulation at 30 CFR 800.13(d)(2) is
operative only upon implementation of an industrial, commercial, or residential land use, it is improper to release
a bond where there is no actual implementation of the approved land use. Therefore, a final bond release decision must
be based in part on submission of adequate proof that the industrial, commercial, or residential land use has substantially
commenced and is likely to be achieved. If the industrial, commercial, or residential land use was approved as an alternative
land use, and the use has not been substantially commenced within 2 years following completion of regrading, bond
release decisions must be based upon the permittee's demonstration of compliance with the revegetation success
standards for the premining land use according to the full revegetation requirements of 30 CFR 816.116 and 817.116,
which include the requirement at 30 CFR 816.116(c) (2) and (3) and 817.116(c) (2) and (3) for a minimum 5- or 10-year
liability period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM's decisions in appeals of ten-day letter and notice enforcement actions (under 30 CFR 842.11(b)(1)(iii)) have
been consistent with the above interpretations of the 1979 and 1983 preamble discussions concerning the Federal
regulations at 30 CFR 800.13(d)(2), 816.116(b)(4), and 817.116(b)(4) as they relate to release of bond liability
on areas with approved industrial, commercial, or residential land uses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Colorado's proposed Rules 3.02.3(2) (a), (b) and (c), which provide for bond release when the permittee successfully
demonstrates that it has met the revegetation requirement for lands with an approved postmining land use of industrial,
commercial, or residential, is consistent with the requirements of the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.116(b)(4)
and 817.116(b)(4) as explained in the 1979 preamble to the Federal regulations concerning bond liability. However,
Colorado's proposed Rule 3.02.3(2)(c) does not require a demonstration that the land use has substantially commenced
and is likely to be achieved prior to release of bond liability, as discussed in the preamble to the 1983 Federal regulations
concerning bond liability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Colorado's proposed Rule 3.02.1(7), discussed in finding No. 4.b above, is relevant to the need for the permittee
to comply with the full revegetation requirements of 30 CFR 816.116 and 817.116 in the event that approved alternative
industrial, commercial, or residential land use has not been substantially commenced within the 2 years following
completion of regrading. Colorado's proposed Rule 3.02.1(7) requires that the permittee's performance bond must
be sufficient to reclaim the site to a condition capable of supporting the premining land use in the event of bond forfeiture.
This proposed rule is consistent with the requirements of the 1983 Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.13(d) as discussed
above, that, if the permittee cannot demonstrate that an approved alternative industrial, commercial, or residential
land use has substantially commenced and is likely to be achieved, the permittee must demonstrate compliance with
the revegetation success standards for the premining land use according to the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.116
and 816.117.

Based on the above discussion, the Director finds that Colorado's proposed Rules 3.02.3(2)(a), (b), and (c) are less
effective than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.13(d)(2), 816.116(c), and 817.116(c). The Director does not
approve Colorado's proposed Rules 3.02.3(2)(a), (b), and (c) to the extent that they would provide for release of
bond liability on lands with an approved industrial, commercial, or residential land use 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

prior 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to a demonstration that the land use has substantially commenced and is likely to be achieved. The Director requires
that Colorado revise proposed Rule 3.02.3(2)(c) to require that, prior to release of bond liability, the permittee
must demonstrate that development of the land use has substantially commenced and is likely to be achieved, in addition
to compliance with the revegetation requirement of proposed Rule 4.15.10(2) or 4.15.10(3).

b. Rules 4.15.10(2) and (3), Revegetation Success Standards for Land With an Approved Industrial, Commercial, or
Residential Postmining Land Use
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Colorado proposed to revise Rule 4.15.10(2) to clarify, for areas reclaimed for industrial, commercial, or residential
use, that (1) the living ground cover standard must be achieved for bond release and (2) the standard must be met within
2 years after completion of regrading or within 2 years after approval of such land use, whichever is later (i.e., Colorado
acknowledges that there may be an approved change in land use after regrading).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Colorado's revisions of proposed Rule 4.15.10(2) have no identical Federal counterpart. The Federal regulations
at 30 CFR 816.116(b)(4) and 817.116(b)(4) require, for industrial, commercial, or residential postmining land
uses, that vegetative ground cover be sufficient to control erosion. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 780.23(a)(3)
require that changes in land use must be approved according to 30 CFR 816.133 and 817.133, which provide for designation
of postmining and alternative postmining land uses. Thus, the only substantive differences between the requirements
of Colorado's proposed Rule 4.15.10(2) and the requirements of the Federal regulations are (1) Colorado specifies
that operator must use ``living plants'' to control erosion on areas to be developed for an industrial, commercial,
or residential land use, and (2) Colorado allows for a change in the designation of postmining land use after final
grading has taken place.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With respect to the first difference, the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.116(b)(4) and 817.116(b)(4) use the term
``vegetative'' ground cover, implying that the ground cover used to control erosion must be living plants. Colorado's
explicit use of the term ``living plants'' simply adds specificity to the Colorado regulation. The use of the term
``living plants'' supplements the more general Federal term ``vegetative ground over'' and does not conflict with
it.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the second difference, the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 780.23(a)(3), 816.133, and 817.133 do not
restrict when changes in the postmining land use may occur. Colorado has discretion to approve a change in the designated
postmining land use for a reclaimed area after final grading has occurred if such a change will satisfy the environmental
protection requirements of the Colorado program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, with respect to these differences, Colorado's proposed Rule 4.15.10(2) is not inconsistent with the
Federal regulations at 30 CFR 780.23(a)(3), 816.116(b)(4), 816.133, 817.116(b)(4), and 817.133.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Colorado also proposed at Rule 4.15.10(2) allowance for a limited exception from the requirement for living ground
cover by reference to proposed Rule 4.15.10(3). Proposed Rule 4.15.10(3) provides an exception from compliance
with the revegetation requirement of Rule 4.15.10(2) specifically for mine support facilities located within areas
where both the premining and postmining land use is industrial or commercial, if it is (1) demonstrated that the mine
support facilities will support the approved postmining land use, and (2) requested in writing by the landowner,
and if the Division determines, that revegetation is not necessary to control erosion. Colorado stated in its ``Statement
of Basis, Specific Statutory Authority, and Purpose'' that, in limited cases, living ground cover could be in conflict
with the proposed land use, and that alternative erosion control measures such as gravel surfacing and appropriate
site grading would effectively control erosion. Colorado cited as the most common example of this situation a pre-existing
railroad siding utilized by a coal company to store and load coal for railroad shipment. Colorado stated that, in such
cases, revegetation would often be impractical due to the historic industrial nature of the site and could conflict
with railroad right-of-way fire hazard provisions and adjacent industrial uses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is no allowance in the Federal program for exceptions to the requirement for ground cover as a revegetation success
standard on areas designated for use as industrial or commercial; however, the stated goal of the requirement for
ground cover is to control erosion, not to demonstrate the capability of the soils to support a land use such as grazing
or crop production. Although Colorado's proposed Rule 4.15.10(3) allows, under limited circumstances, that ground
cover need not be ``living,'' Colorado does not propose to waive the requirement for erosion control. As explained
in Colorado's ``Statement of Basis, Specific Statutory Authority, and Purpose,'' alternative erosion control
measures such as gravel surfacing and appropriate site grading would effectively control erosion. Therefore, the
allowance proposed at Rule 4.15.10(3), for erosion control measures other than live vegetation on lands with premining
and postmining land uses of industrial or commercial, is not inconsistent with the ultimate goal of the revegetation
requirement for erosion control in the Federal regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above discussion, the Director finds that Colorado's proposed Rules 4.15.10(2) and (3) are no less effective
than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 780.23(a)(3), 816.116(b)(4), 816.133, 817.116(b)(4), and 817.133, and approves
them.

Colorado proposed to revise Rule 3.02.4(2)(d)(i) to require that irrevocable letters of credit be issued by a bank,
not only authorized to do business in the United States, but also located in the State of Colorado. In its ``Statement
of Basis, Specific Statutory Authority, and Purpose,'' Colorado stated that it proposed this revision because it
has experienced problems with bankruptcy notification from out-of-State banks, which caused delays in timely legal
responses necessary to secure claims.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The corresponding Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.21(b)(1) only require that the bank be authorized to do business
in the United States. Colorado's proposed Rule 3.02.4(2)(d)(i) provides a requirement for letters of credit as forms
of collateral bond that is in addition to those provided in the Federal program. This requirement affords a measure
of protection beyond that afforded by the Federal regulations and is not inconsistent with the Federal regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Director finds that proposed Rule 3.02.4(2)(d)(i) is not less effective than the Federal regulation
at 30 CFR 800.21(1)(e), and approves it.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Colorado proposed to revise Rules 3.03.1(2) and (3)(d) to use the term ``amount'' in place of ``liability'' when referring
to the portion of a bond that may or may not be released. These proposed rules, respectively, (1) set forth the amount
of a bond that may be released after certain conditions are met and (2) require that the amount of a performance bond
may never be less than that necessary for the Division to complete the approved reclamation plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The counterpart Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.40(c) and 30 CFR 800.14(b), respectively, (1) set forth the amount
of a bond which can be released in phases I, II, or III, and (2) require that the amount of bond shall be sufficient to assure
the completion of the reclamation plan if the work has to be performed by the regulatory authority. These Federal regulations
also use the term ``amount.'' Thus, Colorado's proposed changes simply revise the State regulations so that they
are consistent with the corresponding Federal regulations, which use the term ``amount.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above discussion, the Director finds that the revisions to proposed Rules 3.03.1(2) and (3)(d) are consistent
with and no less effective than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.40(c) and 800.14(b), and approves them.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Colorado proposed to revise Rule 3.03.1(2)(b) to specify certain requirements and revegetation success standards
that must be met prior to phase II bond release. Specifically, Colorado proposed to require, prior to the phase II release
of up to 85 percent of the applicable bond amount, (1) seasonality and species composition consistent with the ultimate
achievement of the success standards and (2) establishment of vegetation which meets the approved success standards
according to Rule 4.15.8 for cover, Rule 3.03.1(3)(b) for productivity on prime farmlands or alluvial valley floors,
and Rule 4.15.9 for productivity on croplands.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Colorado clarified that the demonstrations of successful establishment of vegetation required by Rule 3.03.1(2)(b)
shall be based on statistically valid data for the each parameter collected during a single year of the liability period,
with the exception of productivity on prime farmlands for which establishment of vegetation shall be based on statistically
valid data collected during 3 years (administrative record No. CO&hyph;648). These requirements replace the following
requirements in Rule 3.03.1(2)(b) that Colorado proposed to delete: (1) a more general requirement that phase II
bond release can occur after successful establishment of vegetation in accordance with the approved reclamation
plan and (2) the requirement that such release shall be based on the costs of reclamation activities, including but
not limited to replacement of topsoil, seeding, irrigation and fertilizing.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The counterpart Federal regulation at 30 CFR 800.40(c)(2) includes the more general requirement that, at the completion
of phase II, after revegetation has been established on the regraded mined lands in accordance with the approved reclamation
plan, an additional amount of bond may be released. Colorado's proposed Rule 3.03.1(2)(b) is more specific than the
Federal regulation at 30 CFR 800.40(c)(2) in that Colorado has defined, as discussed below, what is meant by ``revegetation
establishment'' for phase II bond release. The Federal regulation does not specify the percentage of the bond amount
that may be released at phase II, but it does require that the regulatory authority shall retain that amount of bond
for the revegetated area which would be sufficient to cover the cost of re-establishing revegetation if completed
by a third party. Although Colorado's proposed Rule 3.03.1(2)(b) provides for release of up to 85 percent of a bond
at phase II, Colorado's Rules 3.03.1(3) (a) and (d) also require, that when determining the amount of bond to be released,
Colorado must retain the amount of bond necessary for Colorado to complete the approved reclamation plan (see discussion
of Colorado's proposed revisions at Rule 3.03.1(3)(d) in finding No. 8.a above).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to Colorado's proposed requirement that prior to phase II bond release an operator establish vegetation
which exhibits seasonality and species composition consistent with the ultimate achievement of the success standards,
the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.111 and 817.111 require, among other things, that a permittee establish where
appropriate a vegetative cover that is diverse, effective, and permanent, and to re-establish plant species that
have the same seasonal characteristics of growth as the original vegetation and are capable of self-regeneration
and plant succession. Colorado's requirement for seasonality and species composition that are consistent with
ultimate achievement of the success standards is consistent with the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.111 and 817.111.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the requirement that, prior to phase II bond release, an operator must establish vegetation which
meets the approved success standards according to Rule 4.15.8 for cover, referenced Rule 4.15.8 is consistent with,
and has been previously approved by OSM as no less effective than, the requirements for vegetative cover in the Federal
regulations at 30 CFR 816.111, 816.116 (a) and (b), 817.111, and 817.116(a) (1) and (2).

With respect to the requirement that, prior to phase II bond release, an operator must establish vegetation which
meets the approved success standards according to Rule 3.03.1(3)(b) for productivity on prime farmlands or alluvial
valley floors, as discussed in finding No. 8.c below, Colorado's referenced Rule 3.03.1(3)(b) is no less effective
than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.40(c)(2) and 823.15.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the requirement that, prior to phase II bond release, an operator must establish vegetation which
meets the approved success standards according to Rule 4.15.9 on croplands, Colorado's referenced Rule 4.15.9 sets
forth the requirements for demonstration of success of revegetation on cropland. The requirements of Colorado's
Rule 4.15.9 are substantively identical to the requirements of the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.116(c)(3) and
817.116(b)(3) for cropland that receives less than 26 inches of annual average precipitation. Colorado's proposed
Rule 3.03.1(2)(b) requires that, prior to phase II bond release on cropland, an operator must demonstrate that vegetation,
which meets the approved success standard for productivity on cropland during a single year of the liability period,
has been established. Colorado's proposed Rule 3.03.1(2)(b), in conjunction with referenced Rule 4.15.9, is consistent
with the phase II bond release and revegetation success requirements of the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.40(c)(2),
816.116(c)(3), and 817.116(c)(3) for areas that receive less than 26 inches of annual average precipitation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the discussion above, the Director finds that Colorado's proposed Rule 3.03.1(2)(b) is no less effective
than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.40(c)(2), 816.111, 816.116 (a), (b), and (c), 817.111, and 817.116 (a),
(b), and (c). The Director approves the proposed rule.

At proposed Rule 3.03.1(2)(b), Colorado requires, prior to phase II bond release, that an operator establish vegetation
which meets, among other things, the approved revegetation success standards according to Rule 3.03.1(3)(b) for
productivity on prime farmlands and alluvial valley floors.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With respect to prime farmlands, Colorado's proposed Rule 3.03.1(3)(b) requires that no more than 60 percent of a
performance bond shall be released until soil productivity for prime farmlands has returned to equivalent levels
of yield as unmined land of the same soil type on the surrounding area under equivalent management practices as determined,
among other things, from the success determination methodology of Rule 4.25.5(3)(a). Colorado proposed to revise
referenced Rule 4.25.5(3)(a) to require that crop production on prime farmland shall be measured for the 3 cropping
years immediately prior to full release of bond in accordance with Rule 3.03.1(2)(c), or partial release of bond in
accordance with Rules 3.03.1(2)(b) and 3.03.1(3)(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.40(c)(2) require for phase II bond release, among other things, that no part
of the bond shall be released until soil productivity for prime farmland has returned to the equivalent levels of yield
as unmined land of the same soil type in the surrounding area under equivalent management practices as determined
from the soil survey performed pursuant to Section 507(b)(16) of SMCRA and 30 CFR Part 823. The Federal regulations
at 30 CFR 823.15(b)(3) specify requirements for demonstration of success of productivity on prime farmlands and
require that the measurement period for determining average annual crop production shall be a minimum of 3 crop years
prior to release of the operator's performance bond. Therefore, the Federal regulations require that, prior to phase
II bond release, an operator must demonstrate productivity success on prime farmlands with a minimum of 3 years of
productivity data.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Colorado's revised Rules 3.03.1(2)(b), 3.03.1(3)(b), and 4.25.5(3)(a) clarify that phase II or phase III bond release
requires demonstration of productivity on prime farmland and that the demonstration of productivity must include
the data from the 3 crop years prior to the requested bond release. Because an operator may wait the full term of responsibility
before requesting any bond release and may request full bond release without going through individual phase releases,
Colorado has ensured that the same demonstration of productivity on prime farmlands must occur at either phase II
or III bond release.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to alluvial valley floors, Colorado's referenced Rule 3.03.1(3)(b) requires that no more than 60 percent
of the bond shall be released until the essential hydrologic functions and agricultural productivity have been re-established.
This requirement is consistent with the requirement in the Federal regulations at 30 CFR Part 822 that an operator
preserve the essential hydrologic functions of an alluvial valley floor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above discussion, the Director finds that Colorado's proposed Rules 3.03.1(3)(b) and 4.25.5(3)(a)
are no less effective than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.40(c)(2), 822, and 823.15(b)(3), and approve them.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Colorado proposed to revise Rule 3.03.2(4)(c), concerning informal conferences held to resolve written comments
or objections to a bond release, to specify that the conference must be held within 30 days from the date of the permittee's
published notice of requested bond release and must conclude by the 60th day following the inspection and evaluation
that is required in Colorado's Rule 3.03.2(2). (Colorado's Rule 3.03.2(2) is substantively identical to the Federal
regulations at 30 CFR 800.40(b)(1) in requiring an inspection and evaluation of the bond release site within 30 days
after receipt of the application for bond release or as soon thereafter as weather conditions permit. See finding
No. 1 above for a discussion of Colorado's proposed revisions to Rule 3.03.2(2).)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Colorado proposed to revise Rule 3.03.2(5)(a), concerning the Division's responsibility to publish written notification
of its proposed decision on a bond release request, to require that the notification include the right to request a
public hearing within 60 days after the completion of the inspection and evaluation required in Rule 3.03.2(2), rather
than 30 days after the completion of the inspection and evaluation or 30 days from the close of the public comment period
if comments are received. Colorado proposed to delete in its entirety Rule 3.03.2(5)(b) concerning the Division's
responsibility to provide written notification of its proposed decision on a bond release request within 30 days
after the conclusion of an informal conference.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.40(a)(2) require a permittee to publish notice of its bond release request.
The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.40(f) provide that any person with a valid legal interest has the right to file
written objections to the proposed bond release and request a public hearing within 30 days after the public notice
required by 30 CFR 800.40(a)(2). This Federal regulation also requires the regulatory authority to hold a public
hearing within 30 days after receipt of the request for the hearing. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.40(b)(2)
require the regulatory authority to provide written notice of its final decision to release or not to release all or
part of the performance bond within 60 days from the filing of the bond release application, if no public hearing provided
for by 30 CFR 800.40(f) is held, or, within 30 days after such a public hearing has been held.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unlike the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.40(b)(2), which provide that written notification of the regulatory's
authority's decision must occur within 60 days of the filing of the bond release application, Colorado's proposed
Rules 3.03.2(4)(c) and 3.03.2(5)(a) provide that the notification must occur within 60 days after the completion
of the Division's inspection and evaluation of the reclaimed site for which bond release is sought. Since this inspection
and evaluation does not occur until 30 days after the permittee's publishing of the bond release application, Colorado's
proposed Rules 3.03.2(4)(c) and 3.03.2(5)(a) provide the Division with 30 more days for review than would be afforded
under the Federal regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.40(b)(2) are authorized by section of 519(b) SMCRA, which requires that the
regulatory authority notify the permittee in writing of its decision regarding the bond release request within 60
days from the filing of the request, or within 30 days after a public hearing on the request when one is held.

Because the SMCRA deadline is procedural, OSM can evaluate Colorado's counterpart provisions under a ``same as or
similar to'' standard in determining whether a proposed State procedure is consistent with and in accordance with
SMCRA and no less effective than the Federal regulations. The only difference in the procedure is an extra 30 days,
which increases the amount of time for the regulatory authority to carry out its review responsibilities and does
not prejudice a permittee's right to due process. For these reasons, OSM considers the extra 30 days to be reasonable
and finds that Colorado's procedure itself is similar to the procedural requirements of section 519(b) of SMCRA and
the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.40(b)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, based on the above discussion, the Director finds that the revisions proposed by Colorado at Rules 3.03.2(4)(c)
and 3.03.2(5) are in accordance with and consistent with SMCRA and no less effective than the Federal regulations
at 30 CFR 800.40(a)(2), (b)(2), and (f), and approves them.

10. Rules 3.06, Bonding Requirements for Construction of Mine Drainage Control Facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Colorado proposed to delete in its entirety Rule 3.06 (including Rules 3.06.1 through 3.06.3), concerning special
bonding requirements for construction of mine drainage control facilities. Colorado's Rule 3.06 contains exemptions,
from several of Colorado's bonding requirements, for special reclamation techniques. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rule 3.06 has no counterpart in the Federal program. The exemptions it provides, however, are less effective than
the bonding requirements concerning the determination of bond amount, long-term periods of liability, and bond
release in the respective Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.14, 800.17, and 800.40. In addition, Colorado's program
at Rule 3 includes the counterpart provisions to these Federal regulations, which conflict with the existing exemptions
at Rule 3.06. The proposed deletion of the exemptions at Rule 3.06, therefore, removes less effective provisions
from the Colorado program and, at the same time, remedies an internal conflict in the Colorado program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Director finds that Colorado's proposed deletion of Rule 3.06 is consistent with and no less effective
than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.14, 800.17, and 800.40, and approves it.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 732.17(h)(11)(i), OSM solicited comments on the proposed amendment from various Federal agencies with
an actual or potential interest in the Colorado program (administrative record Nos. CO&hyph;615 and CO&hyph;641).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The U.S. Bureau of Mines responded on May 12, 1994, that it had no comments (administrative record No. CO&hyph;614).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers responded on May 25 and September 8, 1994, that the proposed amendment was satisfactory
(administrative record Nos. CO&hyph;618 and CO&hyph;647). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service (SCS), responded on May 26, 1994, by stating that (1)
it supported the proposed deletion of the use of first-lien security interests from the definition for ``collateral
bond'' at Rule 1.04(25); and (2) regarding the proposed deletion of the requirement for bond liability on disturbed
lands that are outside of the permit area from Rule 3.02.1(4), it believed mining companies should be liable for all
lands that are disturbed by their activities regardless of the relative location of these lands. SCS also questioned
(1) who would be responsible for site-specific standards of success for revegetation proposed at Rule 3.03.1(2)(b);
and (2) whether there would be language proposed to replace the proposed deletion of Rule 3.02.4(2)(c)(ix), regarding
real and personal property as a form of collateral bond, and Rule 3.06, regarding special bonding requirements for
construction of mine drainage control facilities (administrative record No. CO&hyph;619).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With respect to SCS's support of the proposed deletion of the use of first-lien security interests from the definition
for ``collateral bond'' at Rule 1.04(25), the Director is approving, as discussed in finding No. 2.b, the proposed
deletion of all forms of real and personal property as forms of collateral bond.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the SCS comment that mining companies should be liable for all lands that are disturbed by their activities
regardless of the relative location of these lands, Colorado, by definition of ``surface coal mining and reclamation
operations'' at Rule 1.04(133) and the requirement to obtain a permit at Rule 2.01.3(1), requires that any land disturbed
by mining and reclamation activities must be included within the permitted area. Therefore, if land outside of the
permit area has been disturbed by mining activities, the operator is mining in violation of the approved permit. As
discussed in finding No. 1, the Director is approving the proposed deletion of the requirement for bond liability
on disturbed lands that are outside of the permit area from Rule 3.02.1(4).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the SCS question concerning who would be responsible for site-specific standards of success for revegetation
proposed at Rule 3.03.1(2)(b), the applicant for a permit is responsible for proposing site-specific revegetation
success standards that are in accordance with the Colorado rules. The proposed success standards, as well as the permittee's
demonstration that the standards have been achieved, must be approved by the Division. As discussed in finding No.
8.b, the Director is approving, at proposed Rule 3.03.1(2)(b), the requirements for revegetation success that must
be met prior to phase II bond release.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the SCS question concerning whether there would be language proposed to replace the proposed deletion
of Rule 3.02.4(2)(c)(ix), regarding the disallowance of real and personal property as a form of collateral bond,
and Rule 3.06, regarding the deletion of special bonding requirements for construction of mine drainage control
facilities, Colorado has not proposed replacement language. As discussed in finding Nos. 2.b and 10, the Director
is approving the proposed deletions at Rules 3.02.4(2)(c)(ix) and 3.06.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Mine Safety and Health Administration responded on August 15 and September 8, 1994, that there was no conflict
with the Federal regulations (administrative record Nos. CO&hyph;640 and CO&hyph;645).

on July 28, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director approves, as discussed in: finding No. 1, Rules 3.02.1(4), 3.02.4(2)(b)(i)(A), 3.02.4(2)(b)(v)(A),

With the requirement that Colorado further revise Rule 3.02.3(2)(c), the Director does not approve, as discussed
in finding No. 6.a, Rules 3.02.3(2) (a), (b), and (c) to the extent that they could provide for release of bond liability
on lands with an approved land use of industrial, commercial, or residential prior to a demonstration that the land
use has substantially commenced and is likely to be achieved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with 30 CFR 732.17(f)(1), the Director is also taking this opportunity to clarify in the required amendment
section at 30 CFR 906.16 that, within 60 days of the publication of this final rule, Colorado must either submit a proposed
written amendment, or a description of an amendment to be proposed that meets the requirements of SMCRA and 30 CFR Chapter
VII and a timetable for enactment that is consistent with Colorado's established administrative or legislative
procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal regulations at 30 CFR Part 906, codifying decisions concerning the Colorado program, are being amended
to implement this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program amendment
process and to encourage States to bring their programs into conformity with the Federal standards without undue

The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA
(30 U.S.C. 1253 and 12550) and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed
State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.

The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The State submittal that is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an economic
analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic effect
upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements previously
promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have
a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart Federal regulations.

 Section 8003 of Pub. L. 101&hyph;508 required VA to reduce the pension benefits of any veteran having neither spouse
nor child who receives Medicaid-covered nursing home care to $90 per month. These statutory provisions expired September
30, 1992. Section 601 of Pub. L. 102&hyph;568 reestablished this requirement, effective until September 30, 1997,
and required an identical reduction in death pension payments to surviving spouses having no children who receive
Medicaid-covered nursing home care. Section 12005 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Pub. L. 103&hyph;66,
further extends these statutory provisions with respect to both veterans and their surviving spouses until September
30, 1998. VA accordingly hereby amends 38 CFR 3.551(i) to reflect this statutory change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
VA is issuing a final rule to amend 38 CFR 3.551(i) to be consistent with the provisions of Pub. L. 103&hyph;66. Because
this amendment merely corresponds to the provisions of section 12005 of Pub. L. 103&hyph;66, publication as a proposal
for public notice and comment is unnecessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

This document amends the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) adjudication regulations concerning eligibility
for Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) in cases where it has been established that a veteran has a permanent
and total service-connected disability. This action conforms the regulations to a decision of the Court of Veterans
Appeals which held that entitlement to DEA may be established in such cases where the disabilities are of paired organs
or extremities that are treated as service-connected under 38 U.S.C. 1160. Section 1160 provides that the combination
of service-connected disability of one organ or extremity and nonservice-connected disability of the respective
paired organ or extremity is treated as if the combination of disabilities is the result of service-connected disability.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Survivors' and Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) Program, established under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35, authorizes
monetary educational benefits to a qualifying spouse or child, or surviving spouse or child, of a veteran whose death
or permanent and total disability was due to military service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
38 CFR 3.807 provides that a spouse or child of a veteran has basic eligibility for Chapter 35 benefits if the veteran
has a permanent total service-connected disability. The surviving spouse or child of a deceased veteran has basic
eligibility for Chapter 35 benefits if a permanent total service-connected disability was in existence at the date
of the veteran's death or the veteran died of a service-connected disability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
38 U.S.C. 1160 provides that where a veteran has suffered service-connected loss of use of an eye, kidney, ear, hand,
foot, or lung and nonservice-connected loss of use of the paired eye, kidney, ear, hand, foot, or lung, the veteran
shall be paid compensation as if the combination of disabilities were the result of service-connected disability.
38 CFR 3.383 is the corresponding regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In Precedent Opinion 75&hyph;90 dated July 18, 1990, the VA General Counsel held that Chapter 35 eligibility is not
established where a disability of paired organs treated as if service-connected under 38 U.S.C. 1160 for purposes
of disability compensation is evaluated as permanently and totally disabling. The General Counsel reasoned that
the threshold criterion for DEA eligibility is total service-connected disability and stated that this criterion
is not satisfied where permanent and total disability is based on the ``as if service-connected'' status established
under 38 U.S.C. 1160.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a recent decision (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Kimberlin v. Brown,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 No. 91&hyph;1972), however, the United States Court of Veterans Appeals held that Chapter 35 entitlement was established
where the veteran was entitled to compensation for a total disability, permanent in nature, regardless of whether
entitlement was based on loss of use of paired organs treated as if service-connected under 38 U.S.C. 1160. The Court's
opinion overrules General Counsel Precedent Opinion 75&hyph;90 insofar as it relates to Chapter 35 eligibility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently the regulation does not specifically address whether Chapter 35 eligibility may be established based
on a combination of disabilities treated as if service-connected under 38 CFR 3.383(a). We are amending 38 CFR 3.807
to reflect the Court's determination that such an evaluation may be the basis for Chapter 35 eligibility.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 National emission standards for hazardous air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pollutants (NESHAP) for ethylene oxide commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sterilization and fumigation operations were proposed in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on March 7, 1994. This

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action announces the EPA's final decisions on the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action promulgates NESHAP for ethylene oxide commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sterilization and fumigation operations. These standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implement section 112 of the Clean Air Act (Act) and are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on the Administrator's determination that commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sterilization and fumigation operations emit ethylene oxide, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a pollutant identified in the Act list of 189 hazardous air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pollutants (HAP). The intent of the standards is to protect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public health by requiring existing and new major sources to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control emissions to the level achievable by the maximum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achievable control technology (MACT) and by requiring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing and new area sources to control emissions using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generally available control technology (GACT). These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards are consistent with section 112(d) of the Act.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The promulgated standards include multiple alternatives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to allow owners or operators maximum compliance flexibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A summary of today's final standards is listed in Table 1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Included in this table are applicability cutoffs based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annual EO use, general descriptions of the standards, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the estimated impacts associated with these standards for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each vent type. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 114(a)(3) of the Act requires enhanced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring and compliance certifications of all major 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stationary sources. The annual compliance certifications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certify whether compliance has been continuous or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intermittent. Enhanced monitoring shall be capable of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detecting deviations from each applicable emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limitation or standard with sufficient representativeness, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accuracy, precision, reliability, frequency, and timeliness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to determine if compliance is continuous during a reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period. The monitoring in this regulation satisfies the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of enhanced monitoring. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Owners or operators of all commercial EO sterilization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and fumigation operations with an initial startup date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before December 8, 1997 that are subject to the emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards are required to install the control technology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needed to comply with the standards within 3 years from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
December 6, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Owners or operators of new commercial EO sterilization and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fumigation operations with initial startup after December 8, 1997 would be required to comply with all requirements

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upon startup.

II. Summary of Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These standards will reduce nationwide emissions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazardous air pollutants (HAP) from ethylene oxide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial sterilization and fumigation operations by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1,030 Mg (1,140 tons), or 96 percent, in 1997 compared to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the emissions that would result in the absence of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards. No significant adverse secondary air impacts, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water, solid waste or energy impacts are anticipated from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the promulgation of these standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The implementation of this regulation is expected to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result in nationwide annualized costs for existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial EO sterilization facilities of about $6.6 million 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beyond baseline based on an analysis of the application of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controls to all existing facilities not currently controlled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the level of the standards. Capital costs incurred by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
typical uncontrolled existing source such as a large 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial EO sterilization and fumigation operation using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
68,000 kg/yr (75 ton/yr) of EO would be about $310,000 for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controlling the sterilization chamber vent emissions, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about $290,000 for controlling the aeration room vent and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chamber exhaust vent emissions. The annualized cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incurred by this typical source to operate the control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
devices would be about $100,000 to control the sterilization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chamber vent emissions and about $80,000 to control the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aeration room vent and chamber exhaust vent emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The economic impact analysis done prior to proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
showed that the economic impacts from the proposed standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not be significant. No changes have been made to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule that would increase the economic impacts to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

III. Significant Changes to the Proposed Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Public Participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Prior to proposal of the standards, interested parties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were advised by public notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(56 FR 1186), of a meeting of the National Air Pollution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Control Techniques Advisory Committee to discuss the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ethylene oxide commercial sterilization and fumigation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
source category recommended for proposal. This meeting was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
held on January 29&hyph;31, 1991. The meeting was open to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public and each attendee was given an opportunity to comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the standards recommended for proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The standards were proposed and the preamble was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on March 7, 1994 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(59 FR 10591). The preamble to the proposed standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussed the availability of the regulatory text and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal BID, which described the regulatory alternatives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered and the impacts of those alternatives. Public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments were solicited at the time of proposal, and copies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the regulatory text and BID were distributed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interested parties. Electronic versions of the preamble, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation, and BID were made available to interested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parties via the TTN (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
section of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preamble). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To provide interested persons the opportunity for oral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presentation of data, views, or arguments concerning the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed standards, a public hearing was offered at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal; however, one was not requested. The public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment period was from March 7 to May 6, 1994. Twenty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment letters were received (two letters were received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from one commenter; nineteen commenters submitted comments). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments have been carefully considered, and changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been made to the proposed standards when determined by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Administrator to be appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Comments on the Proposed Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments on the proposed standards were received from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nineteen commenters composed mainly of States, environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
groups, control device vendors, industry, and trade 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associations. A detailed discussion of these comments and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responses can be found in the promulgation BID, which is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
referred to in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
section of this preamble. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
summary of comments and responses in the BID serve as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis for the revisions that have been made to the standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between proposal and promulgation. Most of the comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
letters contained multiple comments. The comments have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
divided into the following areas: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

C. Significant Changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several changes have been made since the proposal of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these standards. The majority of the changes have been made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to clarify portions of the rule that were unclear to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters. Other changes include adding additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flexibility to sources by allowing alternative monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approaches to meet the standards. A summary of the major 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes is presented below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A controlled MACT floor for chamber exhaust vents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at operations using 9,070 kg/yr (10 tons/yr) or more of EO 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was determined based on data submitted by commenters (see 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Docket Entry IV&hyph;B&hyph;02). Existing and new sources using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9,070 kg/yr (10 tons/yr) or more of EO are now required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control the emissions from the chamber exhaust vent. Owners 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or operators of new and existing chamber exhaust vents at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources using 9,070 kg/yr (10 tons/yr) or more of EO must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parametrically monitor the control device used in achieving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the emissions reduction requirements of the standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above, the Agency has required control of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions from the chamber exhaust vent at major sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because data were received from commenters indicating that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the emissions from this vent are routed to a control device 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used to control emissions from other vent types 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i.e., manifolded to either the aeration room vent or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sterilization chamber vent). The Agency also received data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
showing minimal nationwide annualized cost impacts of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately $240,000 associated with manifolding these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions (see Docket Entry IV&hyph;B&hyph;03). The Agency therefore 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that the requirements to control this vent at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MACT floor are not burdensome for major sources and do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
represent a significant change in the Agency's regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The format of the standard for aeration room vents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at sources using 9,070 kg/yr (10 tons/yr) or more of EO was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revised to provide owners or operators flexibility to either 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meet a maximum emission limit of 1 ppmv ethylene oxide or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieve a 99 percent reduction in ethylene oxide emissions, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whichever is less stringent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The compliance date for all sources has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changed from 2 to 3 years. This extension has been provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to allow sources additional time to achieve compliance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these standards. New sources with startup after the 3 year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance date will be required to comply upon startup of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the source. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Owners or operators of all chamber exhaust vents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at sources using 907 kg/yr (1 ton/yr) or more but less than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9,070 kg/yr (10 tons/yr) of EO were provided additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flexibility to show compliance by either measuring the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ethylene oxide concentration in the chamber prior to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activation of the chamber exhaust vent (as proposed) or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parametrically monitoring the performance of a control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
device used to reduce emissions from this vent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The monitoring requirements for aeration room 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vents at sources using 9,070 kg/yr (10 tons/yr) or more of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EO were revised to provide sources additional flexibility to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitor either the ethylene oxide outlet concentration or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameters of control device performance. For sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
choosing to measure the EO outlet concentration, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurements of ethylene oxide concentration that are below 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the detection limit of 0.5 ppmv for ethylene oxide are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accepted as a demonstration of compliance with the aeration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
room vent standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The Agency reduced the frequency of monitoring of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the ethylene glycol concentration in the scrubber liquor for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources complying with emission reduction standards using an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acid-water scrubber. Owners or operators are now only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to monitor the ethylene glycol concentration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weekly. The Agency also provided sources using this control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technology flexibility to alternatively monitor the level of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the scrubber liquor in the liquor tank on a weekly basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Several commenters suggested that maintenance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
catalytic oxidizers within a temperature range was not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate. In the final rule, a baseline temperature is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established as a minimum oxidation temperature.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Based on information from commenters, compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions and monitoring requirements have been included in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the final rule for thermal oxidizers. These requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include the establishment of a baseline temperature and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuous monitoring of this temperature. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(9) The frequency for calibrating the temperature monitor used for catalytic oxidizers and thermal oxidizers has
been reduced from once per month to twice per year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) Several commenters requested clarification of the general provisions to part 63 as they relate to this rule.
A table identifying the relationship of the final General Provisions requirements has been added to the final regulation.
Language similar to that in the General Provisions has been added to subpart O in cases where a direct reference to the
General Provisions was not appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(11) Based on comments received, an excess emissions report is required semi-annually, whether the source has experienced
excess emissions or not; the Administrator may determine on a case basis that more frequent reporting is necessary.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(12) Revisions to definitions and phrasing have been made to clarify the regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One topic for which comments were received that did not result in a change in the regulation concerned hospital sterilization.
Several comments were received that recommended the inclusion of hospital ethylene oxide sterilization operations
under the standards promulgated in today's action. While the EPA listed ``commercial sterilization facilities''
and ``hospital sterilization facilities'' as two separate categories on the proposed source category list, hospital
sterilizers were removed from the final source category list and only commercial sterilization facilities were
included on the list. Section 112(c) specifies that the source category list will periodically be revised, and hospitals
(with EO emissions greater than 1 ton/yr) may be added to the source category list at a future date. Hospital sterilization
sources (under 1 ton/yr ethylene oxide emissions) will likely be assessed as part of section 112(k) of the Act.

IV. Administrative Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Docket 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Docket is an organized and complete file of all the information considered by the EPA in the development of this
rulemaking. The Docket is a dynamic file, since material is added throughout the rulemaking development. The docketing
system is intended to allow members of the public and industries involved to readily identify and locate documents
so that they can effectively participate in the rulemaking process. Along with the statement of basis and purpose
of the proposed and promulgated standards and the EPA responses to significant comments, the contents of the Docket
will serve as the record in case of judicial review (section 307(d)(7)(A)).

This collection of information has an estimated burden per affected facility of about 510 hours for the first year.
In subsequent years, the burden is approximately 60 hours per affected facility. These burden estimates include
time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and
completing and reviewing the collection of information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

C. Administrative Designation and Regulatory Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)), the EPA is required to judge whether a regulation is ``significant''
and therefore subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review and the requirements of this Executive Order
to prepare a regulatory impact analysis (RIA). The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is
likely to result in a rule that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect
in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public
health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; (2) create a serious inconsistency or otherwise
interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements,
grants, user fees, or loan programs, or the rights and obligation of recipients thereof; or (4) raise novel legal or
policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive
Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been determined that this rule is not ``significant'' because
none of the listed criteria apply to this action. Consequently, this action was not submitted to OMB for review under
Executive Order 12866.

D. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.) requires the EPA to consider potential impacts of proposed regulations on small business ``entities.'' If a preliminary
analysis indicates that a proposed regulation would have a significant economic impact on 20 percent or more of small
entities, then a regulatory flexibility analysis must be prepared. The EPA's analysis of these impacts was provided
in the preamble to the proposed rule (59 FR 10591).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the EPA certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small business entities because: (1) In all industry categories except the contract
sterilization industry, there is not a substantial number of small entities, and (2) contract sterilizers should
experience an increase in demand for their services as other facilities switch from in-house to contract sterilization
(see Docket Entry II&hyph;A&hyph;22). As a result, contract sterilizers will not be adversely impacted by this rule.

) shall be calculated by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuously monitoring the flow rate and concentration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using the following procedure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Measure the flow rate through the control device 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exhaust continuously during the first evacuation using the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedure found in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, Test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Methods 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D, as appropriate. (Method 2D (using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
orifice plates or Rootstype meters) is recommended for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measuring flow rates from sterilizer control devices.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Record the flow rate at 1-minute intervals throughout the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test cycle, taking the first reading within 15 seconds after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time zero. Time zero is defined as the moment when the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pressure in the sterilizer is released. Correct the flow to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard conditions (20
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C and 101.325 kPa (68
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F and 1 atm)) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and determine the flow rate for the run as outlined in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test methods listed in paragraph (b) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

run for an integrated bag sample. Whenever a Tedlar bag is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
full, a new bag must be reattached immediately. Note the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time the bag is changed so the sample time and corresponding

summary: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This regulation establishes Federal mail management policy within the Federal Property Management Regulations.
The regulation is necessary to improve the management of Federal incoming, internal, and outgoing mail, and to reduce
mail costs through a comprehensive mail management program. This mail management program requires that agencies
keep mail processing steps to a minimum; apply sound workflow principles; use automation and modern equipment, supplies,
and training to the maximum extent cost-effective; and streamline operations to increase efficiency. Each Federal
agency is expected to establish an appropriate program for the management of mail at each agency facility as well as
on an agencywide basis.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Ensuring agencywide awareness and compliance with the mail management standards set forth by the U.S. Postal
Service in the Domestic Mail Manual, the International Mail Manual, the Memo to Mailers, and the Postal Bulletin,
as well as GSA standards and guidelines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

procedures for services acquired from private delivery vendors and couriers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Developing and distributing throughout the agency an agency mail cost control program. The agency cost control
program must include, in addition to written policies regarding actions and procedures necessary to provide timely
and cost-effective dispatch and delivery of mail, a plan for transition to automated mailing procedures, including:
automated addressing, address list management, and electronic mail. This program must include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Developing and issuing on an agencywide basis program directives, guidance, and policies for timely and cost-effective
mail management. Copies of program directives, policies, and guidance must be available for inspection by GSA. This
includes at a minimum:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Instructing mailers to use expedited mail only when required. Mail managers should require that mailers avoid
excessive use of expedited mail services. Generally, expedited mail should not be used on Fridays, weekends, or the
day before a holiday. When expedited mail is needed on Fridays, weekends, or the day before a holiday, the mail manager
must coordinate with the mailer to ensure delivery to the addressee. For example, if the addressee's building will
not be opened consider other delivery arrangements. The mail manager must establish control procedures including
written instructions on cost-effective use of expedited mail and must review scheduled expedited mail dispatches
to determine if expedited service is necessary. If expedited mail is not necessary, alternatives to be considered
include, but are not limited to: First-Class and Priority Mail, from the U.S. Postal Service and package delivery
services from other vendors, if the agency has the authority to contract for or enter into agreements with such vendors
and in accordance with any existing contracts or agreements for such services to which the agency is a party.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Maximizing agency cost-effective participation in worksharing programs. This includes proper address list
management, compliance with automation addressing standards, presorting, and barcoding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Monitoring through the agency's local mail managers at all mail facilities, mailings, and other mail management
activities using onsite inspections, checklists, or other inspection/review methods.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Developing and directing agency programs and plans for proper use of transportation, equipment, and supply vendors,
relative to mail management.

(4) Maintaining records of agencywide volumes (in pieces) and agency postage expenditures (in dollars) by class,
weight, special services, and subclass/rate category of mail. One consolidated report on outgoing mail volumes,
postage expenditures, and mailable matter dispatched to all carriers must be maintained. (Suggested format appears
in &sect;101&hyph;9.4902.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Establishing procedures for the review and verification of vendor charges including charges contained in the
U.S. Postal Service's Official Mail Accounting System billings. U.S. Postal Service charges and other vendor charges
must be reviewed and verified at each facility to ensure billing accuracy.

generate and process mail. Each facility must designate a mail manager. The facility mail manager is responsible
for:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Reviewing, on a continuing basis, facility mail practices and procedures to identify opportunities for improvement
and simplification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Providing centralized control at each facility of all mail processing activities including regularly scheduled
and specialized mail messenger services, equipment, and personnel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Providing training which:

(1) Informs all levels of facility personnel on cost-effective mailing practices for incoming, internal, and outgoing
mail.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Includes supplemental guidance and instruction in a format designed for easy reference, revision, and use by

must be distributed to all persons processing mail and users of mail messenger services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Establishes a policy of and procedures for participation in the Cooperative Administrative Support Unit (CASU)
program where applicable and when cost-effective. A CASU can typically provide pickup, sorting, and dispatch of
mail through a CASU-managed mail center.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Where authorized, contracting for worksharing programs when mail volumes or lack of resources for proper mail
preparation; e.g., presorting and barcoding, make contracting for worksharing the cost-effective choice. Any
solicitation for contracting for a mail center must require the contractor to comply with operational procedures
of the agency mail cost control program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Conducting discussions with local U.S. Postal Service for mail related services and implementing operational
procedures for services acquired from mail delivery vendors or couriers.

(g) Processing mail by class with expedited mail, First-Class, and Priority Mail being processed before lower classes
of mail.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Attempting to deliver mail to the action office (the office responsible for taking action on the mail once it is
received) within 6 hours after it is received by the agency from the carrier. Every attempt should be made to deliver
mail to the address or addressee's office; however, incoming bulk business rate mail addressed to an individual may
be discarded if the facility cannot readily ascertain the name or whereabouts of the addressee. Incoming First-Class
mail that cannot be delivered must be returned to the sender, per the U.S. Postal Service's Domestic Mail Manual.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Reporting unauthorized use of agency postage including penalty or commercial mail stamps, meter impressions,
or other postage indicia immediately upon discovery to the agency Inspector General or internal security office,
as appropriate.

(j) Reporting mail center deviations from the agency's occupational, safety and health program, in accordance with
29 CFR part 1960 and 29 CFR part 1910.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(k) Establishing and implementing procedures to ensure that mail complies with U.S. Postal Service addressing standards
which include automated and electronically generated mailing addresses in order to eliminate as many handwritten
addresses as possible. Compliance includes ensuring machine readability, proper formatting, use of directionals
(N. Main St., 4th St., NW, etc.), and accurate mail preparation for the various classes and discount rates and/or for
the best possible delivery service. The U.S. Postal Service publications (Domestic Mail Manual, International
Mail Manual, Memo to Mailers, and the Postal Bulletins) contain all U.S. Postal Service regulations for proper mail
preparation and dispatch, and must be utilized at each location where outgoing mail is processed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(l) Establishing and reviewing annually in conjunction with the agency security office, a mail security program
to ensure appropriate security requirements while not creating undue delay in mail processing. The mail security
program must, at a minimum, detail policy and procedures for safe and secure facility operations and for the safe transportation
and processing of mail.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule extends certain effective dates for clinical laboratory requirements in regulations published
on February 28, 1992, which implemented provisions of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA)
and announces our approval of a certifying organization for qualifying cytotechnologists. This rule extends the
date by which an individual must enroll in an HCFA-approved cytology proficiency testing (PT) program and the date
by which an individual with a doctoral degree must possess board certification to qualify as a director of a laboratory
that performs high complexity testing. In addition, we are extending the phase-in of the quality control requirements
applicable to unmodified, moderate complexity tests cleared for commercial distribution by the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA). We are extending the date to meet applicable CLIA QC requirements for laboratories using commercial, nonmodified
tests to fulfill certain quality control (QC) requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These effective date extensions do not reduce the current requirements for quality test performance. The date extensions
are necessary due to the limited number and scope of currently operating cytology PT programs, resource constraints
that have prevented commencement of the substantial number of quality control reviews, and inability of many laboratory
directors to complete certification requirements within the time period originally specified.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These regulations established uniform requirements for all laboratories regardless of location, size or type.
In developing the regulations, we included requirements that would ensure the quality of service and be in the best
interest of the public health. We recognized that a rule of this scope required time for laboratories to understand
and to implement the new requirements. Therefore, certain requirements were phased-in and given prospective effective
dates. We also planned to address comments on the February 28 rule and make modifications, if necessary, in a successor
final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On January 6, 1994, we published a final regulation in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, at 59 FR 682. This revision to the February 28, 1992 rule extended the time for individuals to meet the educational
qualifications for a cytotechnologist by either completing a training program or being certified by an approved
organization. These changes were made to prevent the loss of qualified personnel in the field of cytotechnology and
to allow the Department the time necessary to recognize organizations that certify cytology personnel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the February 28, 1992 regulations, there are three prospectively set dates that need extensions to prevent disruption
in implementation of the CLIA requirements. At &sect;493.855, Standard; Cytology: Gynecologic examinations,
we required the laboratory, by January 1, 1994, to enroll each individual engaged in the examination of gynecologic
preparations in a PT program approved by HCFA. At &sect;493.1202, Standard; Moderate or high complexity testing,
or both: Effective from September 1, 1992, to September 1, 1994, we established quality control (QC) requirements
for high complexity or moderate complexity tests including less stringent requirements for unmodified, moderate
complexity testing cleared for commercial distribution by the FDA. At &sect;493.1203, Standard; Moderate or high
complexity testing, or both: Effective beginning September 1, 1994, we established a mechanism for laboratories
using commercial, non-modified tests to fulfill certain QC requirements by following manufacturer's instructions
that have been reviewed and determined by the FDA to meet applicable CLIA QC requirements. At &sect;493.1443, Standard;
Laboratory director qualifications, until September 1, 1994, an individual holding a doctoral degree may qualify
with either (1) board certification, or (2) two years of laboratory training or experience, or both, and two years
of experience directing or supervising high complexity testing. After September 1, 1994, all individuals qualifying
with a doctoral degree must have board certification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For each of these requirements, we allowed what we considered as adequate time for laboratories to enroll personnel
in a HCFA-approved cytology PT program, for manufacturers to obtain a QC review from the FDA, and for individuals to
obtain certifications, given our planned publication date of the final regulations. However, approximately 16,000
comments were received on the February 28 rule, which required reevaluation of numerous provisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As of January 1994, no cytology PT program had met the requirements for HCFA approval, we have not yet been able to implement
the FDA review of QC instructions, and we do not anticipate that a final rule will be issued prior to the September 1994
date affecting the board certification requirement for an individual with a doctoral degree to qualify as a laboratory
director. Therefore, we need to extend these prospectively set dates to allow time for laboratories and individuals
to meet the CLIA requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the regulations published on February 28, 1992, we established a pathway at &sect;493.1483 that allows an individual
to qualify as a cytotechnologist if she or he is certified in cytotechnology by an HHS-approved agency. In the preamble
to this rule, we are announcing HHS approval of an agency to certify cytotechnologists.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this rule we also address the comments we received in response to two major areas: Effective dates for implementation
of the requirements mentioned above and approval of an agency to certify cytotechnologists. The comments on implementation
effective dates focused on the need for phase-in periods, feasibility of achieving compliance with the requirements
by the end of the phase-in periods, and alternatives to the phase-in periods. The comments on the cytology qualification
requirements included recommendations that HHS approve an agency that certifies cytotechnologists.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 493.855 requires that a laboratory ensure that, as of January 1, 1994, each individual performing gynecologic
cytology services is enrolled in a gynecologic cytology PT program approved by HCFA. A Request for Proposal was issued
for a contractor to undertake procurement of glass slides necessary to operate the cytology PT program nationally.
We received no responses. However, we did receive comments from the cytology societies and individuals indicating
that the program was logistically and financially unworkable. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
cosponsored a cytology symposium in November 1993 to establish possible alternatives to providing a cytology PT
program. In December 1993, the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Advisory Committee (CLIAC) established under &sect;493.2001
of our regulations recommended that legislative and regulatory changes be pursued to provide for an alternative
program for cytology PT, including encouraging private or State-administered programs to meet current regulations.
To date, only two cytology PT programs have applied for HCFA approval. The two programs are State-operated and enrollment
capacity is limited.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One group of commenters believed that the PT requirements, as currently written, are impossible to implement. The
commenters noted the limited availability of PT programs and believed that the timeframe for implementing cytology
PT is unrealistic. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We understand the commenters' concerns. Although a State program has been approved for calendar year 1995, it has
not been possible to implement a national program within the timeframe specified in the regulations. Therefore,
in this final rule, we are changing the effective date for individuals to enroll and participate in a HCFA-approved
cytology PT program from January 1, 1994 to January 1, 1995. Enrollment by this date is required if an approved program
is available in the State in which the individual is employed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For individuals engaged in the examination of gynecologic preparations who are employed in a State in which an approved
cytology PT program is available, cytology PT enrollment and participation is required beginning January 1, 1995.
For individuals engaged in the examination of gynecologic preparations who are employed in a State in which a HCFA-approved
cytology PT program is not available beginning January 1, 1995, enrollment and participation in cytology PT is required
when a HCFA-approved program becomes available. We recognize that additional time is needed for development and
approval of cytology PT programs that will apply nationwide. Presently, the major impediment in making cytology
PT available on a national basis is the difficulty in obtaining a sufficient number of properly referenced glass slides.
It has been suggested, and we agree, that programs using facsimiles of glass slides (for example, transparencies,
computer images, etc.) should be considered for PT purposes. We plan to revise the regulations to allow approval of
programs that employ testing media other than glass slides. The CDC is undertaking studies to evaluate alternative
cytology PT programs. If alternative programs are feasible, we will ensure that such programs are comparable to glass
side programs. Implementation of PT using alternative media will be phased-in to familiarize cytology personnel
and evaluate the programs. During the phase-in, we will ensure that individuals are not penalized due to performance
in an alternative program. We believe that this approach will meet the statutory mandate that PT be available nationwide
to evaluate the performance of all cytology personnel.

B. Quality Control Requirements for Unmodified, Moderately Complex Tests (&sect;&sect;493.1202 and 493.1203)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 493.1202 and 493.1203 provide for a 2-year phase-in period during which manufacturers could submit QC instructions
relevant to their products to FDA for review and clearance. Under the regulations, laboratories would be in compliance
with the QC provisions of part 493 subpart K by meeting less stringent QC requirements and following the manufacturer's
instructions, as long as the laboratory has not modified the instrument, kit, or test system's procedure.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Of the approximately 16,000 letters of comment received in response to the February 28, 1992 regulations, nearly
300 were in reference to the general QC requirements of subpart K. Over 25 percent of these commenters were opposed
to allowing a laboratory to meet the CLIA QC requirements by following the manufacturer's FDA-cleared QC instructions.
The majority of commenters indicated that all laboratories should be subject to the same QC requirements. Less than
two percent of the commenters agreed with the provision. Approximately two percent of the commenters expressed concern
that a laboratory may be penalized if the FDA does not complete the assessment of a manufacturer's QC instructions
prior to the end of the phase-in period.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We acknowledge the commenters' concerns. Having encountered difficulties in commencing the review of manufacturers'
QC instructions, we are extending the effective date of &sect;493.1203, which contains the quality control requirements
for moderate or high complexity testing, or both, from September 1, 1994 to September 1, 1996. In addition, we are extending
the September 1, 1994 sunset date until September 1, 1996 of &sect;493.1202, which contains the quality control standards
for moderate or high complexity testing, or both.

C. Board Certification of a Laboratory Director With Doctoral Degree (&sect;493.1443(b)(3)) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 493.1443(b)(3) provides that a director of a laboratory performing high complexity testing who has an earned
doctoral degree in a chemical, physical, biological or clinical laboratory science from an accredited institution
must, as of September 1, 1994, be certified by a board recognized by HHS. The 2-year phase-in was designed to allow HHS
additional time to review requests for approval of certification programs and to ensure that a laboratory director
with a doctoral degree had sufficient time to successfully complete the requirements for board certification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters on the final rule suggested that board certification not be a mandatory requirement for currently
employed individuals. In addition, CLIAC has suggested, and we are considering, development of alternative provisions
to qualify currently employed individuals with a doctoral degree on the basis of laboratory training or experience,
in lieu of requiring board certification. Furthermore, in at least one specialty, there is currently no board certification,
but a program is being developed.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter suggested that doctoral degree training and education were sufficient without requiring board certification
to qualify as a laboratory director. One commenter agreed with requiring board certification.

Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In reply to these comments and to the recommendations of CLIAC, we are allowing additional time to review the qualifications
required to ensure that they are appropriate. We are extending the phase-in period in &sect;493.1443 from September
1, 1994, to September 1, 1996 to allow additional time for this evaluation.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We recognize that, at this time, not all specialties have board certification programs. In at least one specialty,
certification programs are being developed. To allow additional time for boards to request HHS approval, for us to
review the requirements for appropriateness, and to ensure that laboratory directors can continue to meet the requirements
as boards apply, we are extending the time period in &sect;493.1443 from September 1, 1994, to September 1, 1996.

D. Agency Approved by HHS To Certify Cytotechnologists (&sect;493.1483(b)(2)) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the personnel requirements in &sect;493.1483(b)(2), an individual may qualify as a cytotechnologist if he or
she is certified in cytotechnology by a certifying agency approved by HHS. In response to the regulations published
February 28, 1992, numerous commenters suggested that the American Society of Clinical Pathologists (ASCP) be recognized
by the Department since it is a national certifying agency for cytotechnologists in the United States. The ASCP applied
for approval and provided materials in support of its request for recognition as a cytotechnologist certifying agency.
The qualifications used by ASCP to qualify an individual as a cytotechnologist include both educational and training
components that are similar to, or more stringent than, the current CLIA requirements for cytotechnologists. In
addition, ASCP requires successful completion of a competency examination to measure skills in cytology. Since
the ASCP's requirements for certifying individuals in cytotechnology meet the CLIA requirements, we are announcing
that, effective on the date of publication of this rule, we have approved the ASCP as a certifying agency for cytotechnologists.
Cytotechnologists certified by ASCP now meet the CLIA cytotechnologists personnel qualification requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Waiver of Delayed Effective Date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by the Administrative Procedure Act, we generally provide for final rules to be effective 30 days after
the date of publication unless we find good cause to waive the delay. We believe that these revisions are essential
to the effective implementation of the CLIA program and should be implemented immediately. Delaying the effective
date of this regulation would potentially disrupt public access to laboratory services and create unnecessary confusion
among laboratories in understanding the standards they must meet. Accordingly, we find good cause to waive the delayed
effective date as contrary to the public interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Regulatory Impact Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)
(5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) unless the Secretary certifies that a final rule will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, all laboratories are considered to be small entities.
Individuals and States are not included in the definition of a small entity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a final rule may
have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. This analysis must conform
to the provisions of section 604 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital
as a hospital that is located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer than 50 beds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule extends the date by which an individual must enroll in an approved cytology proficiency testing program,
the date by which an individual with a doctoral degree must obtain board certification to qualify as a director of a
laboratory that performs high complexity testing, and the expiration date of the phase-in for quality control requirements
for unmodified, moderate complexity testing cleared through the FDA 510(k) or PMA processes. Because controlling
components of the regulations (for example, approved PT programs and approved board certification programs) are
not yet fully in place, compliance with these existing regulations is unachievable for most laboratories and their
personnel. Extending the phase-in periods will result in continuation of previously published requirements and
will not result in changed costs, savings, burden or opportunities to manufacturers, laboratories, individuals
administering tests, or patients receiving them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule also announces the approval of ASCP as a certifying agency for cytotechnologists. The February 28, 1992
regulation added certification by an approved certifying agency as an optional method of qualifying as a cytotechnologist.
The majority of those who commented on the cytotechnologist qualification requirements specified in the February
28, 1992 rule identified certification by ASCP as the preferred alternative method of qualifying and recommended
that ASCP be approved by HHS as a certifying agency. The ASCP's certification requirements have been shown to meet
or exceed CLIA requirements; therefore, the announcement of ASCP's approval should be well received by all affected
entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are not preparing an analysis for either the RFA or section 1102(b) of the Act since we have determined, and the Secretary
certifies, that this final rule will not result in a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
and will not have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In the Second Memorandum Opinion and Order (Second Reconsideration Order), the Commission revises the national
radio ownership limits to permit minority broadcasters to own a controlling interest in up to 25 AM and 25 FM stations,
and to permit non-minority broadcasters to hold a non-controlling interest in an additional five AM and five FM stations
over the general national limits that are controlled by minorities or small businesses. The Commission declines
to revise its local radio ownership limits or its rules and policies regarding time brokerage. The actions taken in
the Second Reconsideration Order, in conjunction with the other actions taken in this proceeding, are needed to permit
radio broadcasters to combine resources, as well as to provide greater opportunities for minority and small business
broadcasters.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 resolves issues raised in three petitions for reconsideration of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Memorandum Opinion and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in MM Docket No. 91&hyph;140, 7 FCC Rcd 6387 (1992), 57 FR 42701 (Sept. 16, 1992) (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
First Reconsideration Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Those petitions were filed by the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), the National Association of
Black Owned Broadcasters, Inc. and the National Black Media Coalition (NABOB/NBMC), and the Telecommunications
Research and Action Center and the Washington Area Citizens Coalition Interested in Viewers' Constitutional Rights
(TRAC/WACC). The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Reconsideration Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 also addresses a Petition for Rule Making (RM&hyph;8414) filed by the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB),
and denies a NABOB/NBMC request for stay and rescission of the previous increase in the national ownership rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
First Reconsideration Order,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 upon which the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Reconsideration Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is based, revised the Commission rules governing the ownership of interests in multiple radio stations. The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
First Reconsideration Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 revised &sect;73.3555 of the Commission's Rules (47 CFR 73.3555) to increase the national radio ownership limit
from 12 AM and 12 FM stations to 20 AM and 20 FM stations. The Commission also revised the national minority ownership
cap, which had permitted non-minority owners to take a non-controlling interest in an additional two AM and two FM
stations that were minority-controlled, and permitted minority owners to hold a controlling interest in 14 AM and
14 FM stations. The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
First Reconsideration Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 modified the rule to permit all owners to take a non-controlling interest in an additional three stations per service
above the national caps if those stations were controlled by minorities or small businesses. It declined to adopt
a provision allowing minority broadcasters to own more stations outright.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
First Reconsideration Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 also relaxed the local ownership limit, which had been one AM and one FM station per area, to permit common ownership
of up to two AM and two FM stations, depending on the size of the market. Specifically, in markets with 15 or more stations,
an individual or group was permitted to acquire up to two AM and two FM stations provided that the combined audience
shares of those stations did not exceed 25 percent of the local radio market. In markets with fewer than 15 stations,
a single owner was permitted to acquire a total of three stations, no more than two of which may be in the same service
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 AM/AM/FM or AM/FM/FM), provided that the group owner's stations represent less than half of the total number of stations
in the market. The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
First Reconsideration Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 also declined to revisit the Commission's prior determination that certain time brokerage arrangements would be
treated as attributable ownership interests for purposes of the multiple ownership rules.

4. The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Reconsideration Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
generally affirms the rules adopted in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
First Reconsideration Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
except that the Commission has decided to revise the national ownership rule with respect to minority and small business
broadcasters. The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Reconsideration Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
increase the national limits for minority owners to 25 AM and 25 FM stations, and raises to five the number, in excess
of the national limits, of minority or small business controlled AM or FM stations in which a non-minority broadcaster
may hold a non-controlling interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. In addition, because of concerns raised by a number of parties with respect to the effects of the revised rules on
competition and diversity in radio markets, the Commission, on its own motion, reviews the radio ownership rules
in light of relevant economic and antitrust principles. Pursuant to its analysis of these principles, the Commission
concludes that the radio ownership rules are consistent with established principles of competitive analysis and
at the present time provide adequate safeguards to ensure acceptable levels of diversity in the radio marketplace.

6. The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
First Reconsideration Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
revised &sect;73.3555 to permit a single owner in a larger market to own up to two AM and two FM stations, subject to an
audience share cap of 25 percent, and to permit an owner in a smaller market to own up to three stations, provided that
no more than two are in the same service and that the stations represent fewer than half of the total number of stations
in the area. A ``market'' is defined with respect to overlapping signal contours. For instance, the relevant market
with respect to a combination of two stations in the same market would encompass those two stations as well as all other
radio stations whose principal community contours overlap those of the two stations involved in the proposed transaction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Urging reconsideration, LULAC argues that the new local rules disadvantage small stations, and reiterates its
suggestion that, rather than change the local ownership rules, the Commission should allow greater consolidation
for financially failing radio stations. NABOB/NBMC reiterate their previous argument that increased ownership
limits will substantially reduce opportunities for increased minority ownership in broadcasting and will force
minority broadcasters out of the radio industry. In opposition, NAB contends that adoption of LULAC's proposal would
impede the positive effects of the new rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. The Commission notes that it directly addressed LULAC's suggestion to adopt a failed station standard in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
First Reconsideration Order. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It concludes that LULAC's argument, that its ``failing'' station would permit a troubled station to obtain ownership
relief well before it actually fails, does not adequately address the Commission's fundamental concern with the
vitality of the industry generally. It therefore finds that LULAC has presented no new evidence or argument to revisit
that review. The Commission also concludes that NABOB/NBMC likewise have not presented any new information that
would persuade it to further modify the local limits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. While it does not modify its local ownership rules, the Commission does make a minor correction. A reference to ``the
most recent published audience share data available at the time that the application is filed'' was deleted from &sect;73.3555(a)(3)(iii)
when that rule section was revised (and renumbered) pursuant to the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
First Reconsideration Order. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
That deletion was inadvertent, and the quoted provision was intended by the Commission to remain in the rules. Section
73.3555(a)(3)(iii) will be modified to reinsert that language, as set forth below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. In its petition for rule making. NAB suggests that when only one of the stations in a proposed combination has a principal
community contour that would place the transaction in a market of 15 or more stations, the parties to the transaction
should be permitted to elect whether to be governed by (1) the rules for small markets based on the number of stations
overlapping the smaller facility's contour (thus avoiding the audience share limitation); or (2) the rules for large
markets, but with the audience share calculated based on all counties receiving any one of the 15 or more stations counted
as in the market pursuant to &sect;73.3555(a)(3)(ii).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. NAB also proposes that the local ownership rule be modified so that ownership of ``not greater than 50 percent''
of the stations in a market would be permitted rather than the current ``less than 50 percent'' rule. In addition, NAB
contends that any single station or AM/FM combination licensee should be allowed in all situations to add one additional
station to common ownership.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. Finally, in the event the above changes are not adopted, NAB believes that a clear and liberal set of criteria should
be established for requests for waiver of the local ownership rule in traditionally small markets. Among the critical
elements of any waiver policy according to NAB, would be the effort to save a dark or failing station.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. Duke Broadcasting, commenting on the NAB petition, raises similar concerns with the contour-based market definitions
in the new rules when applied in small markets, but proposes a different solution. Duke suggests a delineation of two
tiers of markets based on Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) ranking, with ``larger'' markets still subject to
the combined audience share limitation of 25 percent, and ``smaller'' markets not subject to the combined audience
share limitation in the absence of a showing that the particular combined share exceeding 25 percent creates an excessively
high concentration of audience. Duke proposes that MSAs ranked above 150 would be placed in the larger market tier,
while those ranked 150 and below, as well as non-MSA markets, would be placed in the smaller tier.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
14. The Commission declines to modify the local ownership rules. It notes that in designing the signal overlap standard,
it specifically rejected suggestions that Arbitron data, MSAs (proposed by Duke here) or other narrow geographic
designations be employed to count the number of stations in a market. It concludes that there is no evidence to suggest
that the rationale underlying the adoption of the contour overlap approach_a more accurate measure of where a station's
signal can be adequately received and, therefore, where it can compete for listeners_is any less appropriate for
stations in smaller markets under the circumstances presented by NAB and Duke. It notes that a station combination
with an aggregate principal community contour overlapped by 15 or more stations can be expected to compete for listeners
with those stations, and the audience share cap is applied in such a case as an additional safeguard intended to identify
potential concentration problems that may threaten diversity and competition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. The Commission states that it declines to, in effect, ignore those stations, such as Class C FM stations, with superior
signal coverage. It also declines to redefine the area to which county-by-county audience share calculations apply
in the manner suggested by NAB. The Commission believes that the suggested change would unduly dilute the diversity
and competition safeguards adopted in its previous orders, and, in any event, would not reflect competitive conditions
in the areas in which stations proposed to be combined provide the majority of their service, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
within their principal community contours.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. With respect to NAB's other proposals, the Commission notes that it already expressly rejected a change of the
rule applicable to markets of fewer than 15 stations to permit ownership of half of the stations in a small market because
it could result in an unwarranted level of consolidation in too many markets. Further, the Commission states that
it is not persuaded that the specific changes NAB advocates are warranted as a means of rescuing failing or dark stations.
The Commission is concerned that the proposed changes would be applicable without regard to the circumstances of
an individual facility or its financial condition, and would have the potential to increase concentration signifcantly.
It also believes that cases involving a genuine threat of station failure are best addressed via a waiver process that
can appropriately account for the specific factual circumstances at hand. Moreover, the Commission states that
because of the variety of circumstances that may be present in any given radio market, requests for waiver of the rule
should not be limited to specific criteria.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Minority Ownership and Small Business Incentives
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
17. NABOB/NBMC urge the Commission to reinstate the aspect of the prior rule that permitted minority-owned companies
to take a controlling interest in additional stations above the national ownership caps. NABOB/NBMC maintain that
the change from the prior rule will decrease the total number of stations that can be controlled by existing minority
licensees, and, with the increase of the national ownership limits generally, will lead to further concentration
of ownership in the broadcast industry, diluting substantially the opportunities for increased minority ownership.
NABOB/NBMC also contend that the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
First Reconsideration Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
did not provide evidence with which to evaluate the effect of the rule changes on minority ownership, and they reiterate
their argument that the Commission's appropriations legislation prohibits modification of the minority ownership
incentive. Further, NABOB/NBMC reiterate their request, denied in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
First Reconsideration Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
that the national ownership limits be returned to 12 stations per service. LULAC, NABOB/NBMC and NAB urge the Commission
to repeal the small business incentive established in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
First Reconsideration Order. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
LULAC and NAB argue that adoption of the small business incentive violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA),
5 U.S.C. 553, because such an incentive was not proposed in the initial 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice of Proposed Rule Making 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in this proceeding. They also maintain that the small business incentive will dilute or otherwise undermine any incentive
for group owners to invest in minority-controlled stations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
18. The Commission states that it continues to believe, as discussed both above and previously in this docket, that
further expansion of the national ownership limits would not hinder diversity of viewpoint and could spur competition
in the industry. The Commission notes that the arguments raised by petitioners with respect to the increase in the
general national ownership limits from 12 to 20 stations per service were fully addressed earlier in this proceeding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
19. The Commission is persuaded by petitioners, however, that permitting minority owners to hold a controlling interest
in additional radio stations will serve the goal of increasing minority ownership without posing a significant threat
to competition or diversity. It will therefore amend &sect;73.3555 of its rules to permit minority owners to own and
control additional stations over and above the general national caps. Moreover, based on its belief that further
national consolidation is appropriate, it will increase from three to five the number of additional stations per
service that may be acquired pursuant to the incentive. The Commission's aim in making these modifications is to permit
minorities to own more stations as well as to make the investment incentive aspect of the rule more attractive to large
group owners.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
20. The Commission is not persuaded to delete the small business incentive. It states that its current application
processing standards, which involve a case-by-case analysis of each transaction, are sufficient to guard against
sham small business applications. With respect to petitioners' arguments regarding notice, the Commission points
out that the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice of Proposed Rule Making
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in this proceeding, 6 FCC Red 3275 (1991), 56 FR 26365 (June 7, 1991), invited commenters to discuss a range of issues
regarding the national ownership caps, and some commenters emphasized that access to capital is a problem for new
entrants and small businesses in general, not just minority-owned entities. The Commission further notes that it
intends to explore minority ownership issues in an upcoming proceeding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 21. Pursuant to the rules adopted in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
First Reconsideration Order,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the national ownership limits automatically increased from 18 AM and 18 FM to 20 AM and 20 FM on September 16, 1994. On
October 7, 1994, NABOB and NBMC filed a ``Joint Motion for Rescission and Stay'' asking the Commission to rescind the
automatic increase and stay the effective date of that increase until the Commission has acted on their petition for
reconsideration and evaluated the effect of the 18AM/18FM cap on minority ownership. The Commission notes that NABOB/NBMC's

22. The Commission defines time brokerage as a type of joint venture that generally involves the sale by a licensee
of discrete blocks of time to a ``broker'' who then supplies the programming to fill that time and sells the commercial
spot announcements to support it. The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
First Reconsideration Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 affirmed the Commission's earlier holding that if a time brokerage agreement between two stations in the same market
involves more than 15 percent of the brokered station's programming per week, the brokered station will be treated
as if it was owned by the brokering station for purposes of the national and local ownership rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 23. TRAC/WACC note that time brokerage decisions have been made by the Commission's staff and argue that the Commission
should not be bound in future rulemakings by policy decisions of its staff made in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 informal adjudications. TRAC/WACC also note that members of the public are not given notice of, and may not have standing
to participate in, declaratory rulings at the staff level. NAB counters that the revised time brokerage rules and
policies, as adopted and applied by the staff in its rulings, are lawful and are designed to adequately ensure that
licensees do not relinquish control of their stations and remain responsive to the obligations of a licensee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 24. The Commission states that the language of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
First Reconsideration Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 was intended to reflect the Commission's continuing view that particular situations are better resolved on a case-by-case
basis. The Commission further finds that the specific aspects of time brokerage arrangements questioned by TRAC/WACC
in its petition were thoroughly discussed previously in this proceeding, where the Commission adopted restrictions
on time brokerage arrangements so that they will be counted as ownership interests where significant brokering between
competing stations is involved. Furthermore, the Commission reiterates that a licensee must retain ultimate control
over its station. The Commission concludes that TRAC/WACC has not introduced any new arguments to convince it that
it needs to take further action in this proceeding with respect to time brokerage. It also states its belief that imposition
of any additional restrictions on time brokerage arrangements would run counter to one of the objectives of this proceeding,
which was to strengthen the radio industry by giving radio broadcasters more flexibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 25. The Commission notes that it previously decided not to require the termination of an agreement that does not comply
with the local ownership rules if the agreement was entered into prior to the effective date of the rules. These agreements
were, in effect, ``grandfathered.'' The Commission clarifies that when a brokering station is sold, an existing
brokerage agreement that would be barred by the rules if entered initially at the time of the sale, may be transferred.
The new owner may enjoy all rights and limitations with respect to the multiple ownership rules as the original owner,
but only for the duration of the term of the agreement in effect at the time of transfer. The purchaser of a station or
stations involved in a brokerage agreement, however, cannot create a new violation or exacerbate an existing rule
violation by that acquisition. Thus, for example, a station combination that involves a brokerage agreement and
that exceeds the 25 percent audience share limit, but is nonetheless permissible under the rules, could not be acquired
by a party with another station in the same market. A similar station combination with an audience share of 24 percent
could not be acquired by a licensee with a station enjoying a 3 percent share in the same market. In addition, parties
will not be permitted to renew or extend time brokerage agreements, including those that are grandfathered, once
the initial term expires if, at the time of expiration, the agreement would not be permissible under the rules.

Remaining Matters
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
26. There is an inconsistency between the language of the First Reconstruction Order and that of &sect;73.3555(a)(1)(ii)
as published, as to the benchmark for permissible audience share. In order to remove any ambiguity on this point, the
Commission states that it intended the language of the rule to be controlling. Thus, only audience shares that exceed
25 percent are to be considered 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
prima facie 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
inconsistent with the public interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
27. Further, the Commission clarifies that while it is appropriate to exclude non-operational stations from calculation
of the number of stations in the market where it cannot be presumed that they will add to the competition and diversity
in a market, such as analysis is not appropriate when the non-operational station is a part of the transaction under
scrutiny, because the applicant has control over and can generally be presumed to intend to put the station on the air.
Thus, if the non-operational station is one of the proposed commonly owned stations involved in the transaction,
the principal community contour of the non-operational station will not be disregarded in calculating how many stations
are counted as in the market or in determining the geographic area for which audience share is calculated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
28. The Commission also notes that current rules permit an AM licensee to own an existing AM station in the 535&hyph;1605
kHz band and apply for a construction permit for an AM station in the expanded band, 1605 kHz&hyph;1705 kHz, without
regard to otherwise prohibited principal community contour overlap. Moreover, the national ownership restrictions
are not applied when an entity with an attributable interest in an AM station in the existing band applies for an AM station
in the expanded band. Note 10 to &sect;73.3555 specifies a five-year period during which joint ownership of existing
band and expanded band AM authorizations will be acceptable; at the expiration of this five-year period, the licensee
must elect to operate either the expanded band station or to operate the station on its former frequency in the existing
band.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
29. The Commission clarifies that if, during the five-year transition period, the licensee has not yet elected whether
to move to the expanded band or retain its existing facility, the expanded band station will be disregarded for purposes
of the local and national ownership rules. Thus, the principal community contour of the existing band station will
be considered for purposes of determining the relevant market and for purposes of determining the number of stations
in the market. Moreover, if it is necessary to determine whether the combination complies with the audience share
cap, the Commission will consider only the audience share attributable in the relevant market to the existing band
station.

(iii) A station's ``audience share'' is the average number of persons age 12 or older on an average quarter-hour basis,
Monday&hyph;Sunday, 6 a.m.&hyph;midnight, who listen to the station expressed as a percentage of the average number
of persons listening to AM and FM stations in that radio metro market or a recognized equivalent, in which a majority
of the overlap between the same service stations involved in the transaction takes place. The ``combined audience
share'' is the total audience share of all AM or FM stations that would be under common ownership or control following
a proposed acquisition. In situations where the majority of the overlap between the same service stations does not
lie in a single metro market, the relevant audience share data is the data for all counties that are within the principal
community contours of the mutually overlapping stations proposed for common ownership, in whole or in part, weighted
based on the listening population, age 12 and older, and totalled to determine the average audience share. Audience
share shall be calculated by using the most recent published audience share data available at the time that the application
is filed, unless an alternative showing is submitted pursuant to the Note following 47 CFR 73.3555(a)(1)(ii).

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has adopted a Sixth Order on Reconsideration and Fifth Report and Order to provide cable operators
with additional incentives to expand their facilities and services in a way that both ensures that cable rates are
reasonable and expands the opportunities for cable programmers to reach viewers. These incentives will: allow cable
operators to offer new product tiers (``NPTs'') to be priced as operators elect, provided certain limited conditions
are met; permit cable operators to add new channels to existing cable programming services tiers (``CPSTs'') subject
to certain price caps; and create an additional option pursuant to which small cable operators may recover headend
costs expended plus programming costs when they add channels to CPSTs. In addition, the Commission determined that
a la carte packages are CPSTs and therefore subject to rate regulation. The Commission also confirmed that cable operators
do not have to obtain the affirmative consent of subscribers before making rate adjustments so long as the changes
are permitted under our rules and the fundamental nature of the affected tier is unaltered. Finally, the Commission
decided not to adopt its proposal modifying restrictions on transactions between cable operators and their affiliates;
instead it will retain its existing cable affiliate transaction rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this order, the Commission modifies its rules in light of comments, filed, in response to petitions for reconsideration,
and on its own motion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this Report and Order, unless indicated otherwise, the Commission uses ``CPSTs'' to mean cable programming service
tiers that are rate regulated under &sect;76.922 of its rules. Although new product tiers are CPSTs within the meaning
of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 543(l)(2), in this Report and Order, they are separately referred
to as new product tiers or NPTs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Cable Television Consumer Protection Act of 1992 (``1992 Cable Act''), 47 U.S.C. 543(c), requires the Commission
to ensure that CPST rates are not unreasonable upon the receipt of a specific complaint. The Act requires the Commission
to establish criteria for determining whether a rate is unreasonable after considering a number of factors, such
as the rates of similar systems, the rates charged by cable operators that face competition, and the operator's costs
and revenues. The 1992 Cable Act also permits the Commission to consider other relevant factors for determining what
constitutes unreasonable rates for CPSTs. In the Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in MM
Docket No. 92&hyph;266 (``Rate Order''), 58 FR 29736 (May 21, 1993), the Commission adopted benchmark and cost-of-service
rules which reflect a reasonable balancing of the statutory factors. The Commission has also adopted rules which
allow cable operators to increase rates for their Basic Service Tiers (``BSTs'') and CPSTs to reflect inflation,
increases in external costs, and the addition of new channels. The current formula for channel additions permits
operators to collect a sliding per channel adjustment for adding new programming channels to CPSTs and to recover
all programming expenses associated with adding channels, plus a 7.5% mark-up on new programming expenses. 47 CFR
76.922 (d), (e).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of programmers have expressed the view that the cable industry's ability to create new programming networks
that can benefit consumers depends on operators' being able to offer new services in packages of programming. These
programmers urge the Commission to provide increased incentives to cable operators to offer such packages of new
programming services. Other commenters suggest that a marketplace system is preferable to regulation in certain
programming and tiering decisions. In addition, as reflected in the record, many 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 comments support the adoption of rules allowing operators to establish tiers of new services priced at market rates.

2. Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is concerned, based on the comments filed by operators and programmers, that the current rules may
not provide sufficient incentives for operators to expand capacity and provide new services to consumers. Accordingly,
the Commission is establishing a new category of CPST_an NPT_that will provide additional incentives for operators
to provide new services to consumers because operators will be permitted to price these tiers as they choose. The new
rules also will help programmers by encouraging operators to add new attractive programming to NPTs in order to induce
customers to subscribe to the NPTs. NPTs are, by definition. ``cable programming services'' under the 1992 Cable
Act, because NPTs are composed of video programming provided over cable systems that are not carried on the BST and
are offered in a package rather than exclusively on a per channel or per program basis.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 47 U.S.C. 543(1)(2). The Commission therefore has a duty under the 1992 Cable Act to ensure that NPTs are not unreasonably
priced.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of the FCC Forms 1200 and 1210, however, channels that are on an operator's NPT will not be considered regulated
channels.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission finds that, so long as the conditions set forth below are met, the rates for NPTs will not be unreasonable.
The conditions set forth below will ensure that subscribers may choose to subscribe to BSTs, NPTs, or CPSTs or combinations
of those tiers and, that as a result, NPTs will face competition from BSTs and CPSTs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, operators offering NPTs are prohibited from making fundamental changes to what they offer on their BSTs and
CPSTs on September 30, 1994. This requirement is necessary to ensure that cable subscribers continue to receive basically
the same cable service they now receive at prices the Commission has set pursuant to its rate regulations. This requirement,
however, is not intended to freeze BSTs and CPSTs. Operators remain free to move channels from the existing tier to
a single channel offering or drop channels entirely, so long as the aggregation of such changes does not constitute
a fundamental change of their BSTs or CPSTs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, operators may not drop channels from BSTs and CPSTs and move them to NPTs (including time-shifted, slightly
altered or renamed versions of channels offered on other tiers), if the channels were offered on their BSTs or CPSTs
on September 30, 1994. This will protect consumers by ensuring that operators electing to provide NPTs do not dilute
the BSTs and CPSTs that are currently available to consumers. This will also help ensure that BSTs and CPSTs provide
a competitive option to NPTs. A channel that occupied a BST or a CPST part-time may be offered full-time on an NPT, as
long as it continues to be offered on the BST or CPST under substantially the same conditions as it was offered on September
30, 1994. If a channel occupies a BST or CPST full-time, however, and is subsequently reduced to part-time on the BST
and CPST, that channel may not be offered on an NPT full-time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, BSTs and CPSTs must continue to be cognizable services. That is, the operator must continue to market its BSTs
and CPSTs so that customers are reasonably aware of: (1) The availability of those tiers to the public; (2) the names
of the channels available on those tiers; and (3) the price of the tiers. Within 30 days of the offering of an NPT, operators
shall file with the Commission a copy of the new rate card that contains the following information on their BSTs, CPSTs,
and NPTs: (1) The names of the programming services contained on each tier, and (2) the price of each tier. Operators
also must file with the Commission copies of notifications that were sent to subscribers regarding the initial offering
of NPTs. After this initial filing, cable operators must file updated rate cards and copies of customer notifications
with the Commission within 30 days of rate or service changes affecting the NPT. This information will help the Commission
ensure that operators are complying with our conditions for NPTs. No prior regulatory approval, however, is required
to offer an NPT. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, in accordance with the 1992 Cable Act's prohibition on negative option billing, an operator may not
charge any subscriber for an NPT unless the subscriber has requested the NPT by name. Moreover, fundamental changes
to an NPT must be approved by subscribers in accordance with the negative option billing rules. Channel changes involving
relatively few channels generally will not change the fundamental nature of a tier and thus will not implicate the
negative option billing rule.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Operators may not require the subscription to any tier, other than a BST, as a condition for subscribing to an NPT. Further,
operators may not require subscription to an NPT as a condition to subscribing to a CPST. We believe that restricting
the ability of operators to link the purchase of NPTs and other CPSTs will maximize subscriber choice and foster competition
between NPTs and CPSTs. These buy-through restrictions will not apply, however, to cable operators that, prior to
October 5, 2002, lack the capacity to offer BSTs and NPTs without also providing other intermediate tiers of service.
See 47 CFR 76.921.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Apart from the foregoing limited, specific requirements, operators will have complete flexibility to offer programming
services on an NPT. Thus, the Commission's NPT rules provide that operators may offer the same programming services
on NPTs as are on one or more BSTs and CPSTs so long as they do not state or imply that any such channel is available only
on an NPT.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operators may add any channel to an NPT that was previously on a BST or CPST if the channel was dropped from the BST or CPST
before September 30, 1994. If a channel was offered on a system on a BST or CPST on September 30, 1994, however, the channel
may not be moved to an NPT unless the operator waits at least two years from the date the channel is dropped from the BST
or CPST. However, operators may offer new channels (i.e., channels first offered on a system after September 30, 1994)
on CPSTs before moving them to NPTs, subject to the conditions outlined in this Report and Order. The flexibility to
move new channels to NPTs will keep the prices for CPSTs from becoming unreasonable and will create additional capacity
for new services on CPSTs. This capacity should help create opportunities for programmers to establish an audience
for their new channels.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If after initially electing to offer an NPT, a cable operator decides that offering an NPT is no longer desirable, the
cable operator is free to drop the tier upon proper notice to subscribers. An operator that drops an NPT may reestablish
that tier at a later time by complying with the conditions outlined above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission's conclusion that the rates at which cable operators choose to offer NPTs will not be unreasonable
reflects its consideration of the statutory factors that it must consider in establishing criteria for determining
whether a rate for a CPST is unreasonable. As explained above, the Commission believes that the rates charged for NPTs
will be constrained by the rates charged for BSTs and CPSTs. The rate standards for BSTs and CPSTs were set directly
by analysis of the factors the 1992 Cable Act instructs the Commission to consider. The Commission believes that the
rates charged for NPTs must be competitive with the rates charged for CPSTs or consumers will decline to subscribe
to NPTs. Therefore, the rates charged for NPTs will reflect the Commission's analysis of the statutory factors because
cable operators will have to offer NPTs at prices that are attractive in comparison to services subject to benchmark
or cost-of-service regulation.

Under the 1992 Cable Act, video programming offered on a per channel or per program (a la carte) basis is not subject
to rate regulation. 47 U.S.C. 543(l)(2). In the April 1993 Rate Order, 58 FR 29736 (May 21, 1993), the Commission held
that it would not regulate packages of otherwise exempt per channel or per program services so long as: (1) The price
for the combined package does not exceed the sum of the individual charges for each component of service, and (2) the
cable operator continues to provide the component parts of the package to subscribers separately. The Commission
stated that the second condition would be met only when the per channel offering provides subscribers with a realistic
service choice.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the Second Reconsideration Order, 59 FR 17943 (April 15, 1994), in order to address concerns that some packages
established by operators in response to rate regulation were not consistent with the 1992 Cable Act and Commission
regulations, and the fact that other offerings raising similar concerns could be initiated in the future, the Commission
provided 15 interpretive guidelines for determining whether an operator's collective offering of a la carte channels
should be accorded regulated or unregulated treatment. The Commission also determined that packages of a la carte
channels offered prior to April 1, 1993, (the date it adopted the Rate Order) would be accorded unregulated treatment.
This limited ``grandfathering'' of packages available on April 1, 1993, was intended to avoid elimination of discounts
that were available to consumers and clearly were not offered to evade rate regulation.

Also, on November 17, 1993, the Commission issued 16 letters of inquiry to various cable operators, and on December
13, 1993, it issued another 35 letters of inquiry, most of which addressed the issue of removal and repackaging of channels.
On February 22, 1994, the Commission issued 11 letters of inquiry to cable operators that, among other things, asked
operators to justify a la carte offerings that may be inconsistent with the Commission's rate regulations.

The Commission has received numerous comments with respect to a la carte issues. Most of the commenters requested
greater clarification of the Commission's a la carte rules and guidelines. Commenters also made suggestions concerning
the treatment of a la carte offerings that are found not to meet Commission guidelines. Some suggest that cable operators
should not be penalized for failing to satisfy the Commission's test for a la carte packages because it is unclear.

2. Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The evidence obtained in response to the letters of inquiry issued to cable operators offering a la carte packages
and the comments we received from cable operators convinced the Commission that it should reconsider its approach.
It seems clear that some cable operators have evaded rate regulation by purporting to offer channels a la carte, when
in fact the individual offerings were not a realistic service alternative. On the other hand, there is merit to the
industry's claim that neither the Commission's original two-part test nor its interpretative guidelines provides
a clear answer with respect to the permissibility of some a la carte packages that have been offered. Indeed, it is perhaps
inevitable that the test would not be capable of precise application in many instances because it is not clear how various
factors should be weighed and applied.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission's analysis leads it to conclude, contrary to its prior decisions, that a la carte packages are CPSTs
within the meaning of the 1992 Cable Act. The conclusion that all packages are ``cable programming services'' is supported
by the language of the statute, the legislative history, and practical considerations as well.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3(l)(2) of the 1992 Cable Act defines CPSTs as ``any video programming provided over a cable system, regardless
of service tier, including installation or rental of equipment used for the receipt of such video programming, other
than (A) video programming carried on the basic service tier, and (B) video programming offered on a per channel or
per program basis.'' 47 U.S.C. 543(l)(2). A package of channels, whether or not the channels also are offered a la carte,
plainly is ``video programming provided over a cable system,'' and hence is a ``cable programming service.'' The
package is not ``video programming offered on a per channel or per program basis;'' the individual channels are. Accordingly,
it is apparent from the statutory language that a la carte packages are cable programming services. The conclusion
that a package of a la carte channels is a CPST is further supported by the legislative history, which focused on the
fact that bundled offerings of cable programming would be subject to rate regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A conclusion that rate regulation does not apply at all to video programming packages if the channels are offered individually
would fatally undermine the rate regulations rules Congress enacted. If a package of a la carte channels is not a CPST,
any cable operator may avoid rate regulation simply by announcing the offering of channels on an a la carte basis even
if very few subscribers would choose the a la carte offerings rather than the package.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, as the Commission recognized in the Rate Order, there are sound policy reasons to treat as reasonable any
price offered for a package of channels that traditionally have been offered on a per-channel basis. Indeed, the Commission
can not envision circumstances in which any price of a collective offering such as the commonly offered ``HBO/Showtime''
package would be found to be unreasonable. For the future, the new rules authorizing ``new product tiers'' should
provide cable operators with sufficient flexibility to offer such packages at whatever price they choose. Although
cable operators may not remove channels from regulated tiers and offer them on NPTs, they are free to create packages
of a la carte channels under the new rules governing NPTs. Moreover, as stated above, the Commission previously ``grandfathered''
packages available on April 1, 1993. The difficult question concerns the treatment of a la carte packages created
between April 1, 1993, and September 30, 1994. In some cases, the Commission thinks it is clear that the package at issue
was not a permissible package under a fair reading of its test. In other cases, however, it is not clear how the test should
be applied to the package at issue. In those cases, the Commission thinks it is fair, in light of the uncertainty created
by its test, to allow cable operators to treat existing packages as NPTs even though it would not qualify under the new
rules, provided that such packages involve only a small number of migrated channels.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission sees little reason to require an operator to ``reverse migrate'' a package that was not clearly ineligible
for unregulated treatment under our a la carte policy. The Commission intends to address whether specific operator
packages should be treated as NPTs in rulings on individual cases in the near future.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to Section 623 of Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. 543, the Commission adopted a comprehensive framework governing
the rates for BSTs and CPSTs. Under this framework, once initial rates are set pursuant either to the benchmark or cost-of-service
approaches set forth in the rules, rates are governed by a price cap designed to assure that rates for regulated cable
services remain reasonable. Under the cap, operators may adjust rates annually for inflation as measured by the gross
national product price index (``GNP&hyph;PI'') and for certain categories of external costs. 47 CFR 76.922(b),(c),(d).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission's price cap rules were amended in March, 1994 to specify a ``going forward'' mechanism under which
capped rates are adjusted for changes in the number of channels offered on BSTs and CPSTs. Fourth Report and Order 59
FR 17943, 17955&hyph;17956 (April 15, 1994). Under these provisions, operators first remove all external costs
from the tier charge and then adjust the residual component of the tier charge by a specified per channel adjustment
amount when the total number of regulated channels changes. The methodology for adjusting capped rates when channels
are added or deleted from a regulated tier is set forth in detail in &sect;76.922(e) of the Commission's rules and in
FCC Form 1210.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The March, 1994 rule amendments also permitted operators to include a mark-up of 7.5% on new programming expense related
to programming added on or after May 15, 1994. Form 1210 allows the 7.5% mark-up on all programming cost increases occurring
after March 31, 1994, no matter when the channel was first offered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Parties filing petitions for reconsideration and many commenters filing in response to the Fifth Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking ask the Commission to revise the existing going forward rules substantially. Many criticize the existing
per channel adjustment on the grounds that it fails to provide sufficient incentives to add channels. Some cable operators,
programmers, and networks state that the percentage-based approach to the programming mark-up results in disincentives
for operators to add low or no-cost services to BSTs and CPSTs (noting that 7.5% of zero is zero).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most of the alternatives on going forward issues proposed by the industry involve a flat per channel charge. Two Commenters
submitted economic studies to support a flat per channel adjustment of at least 25 to 30 cents. Some propose a flat-fee
mark-up subject to an annual cap.

2. Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted, the Commission previously adopted a machanism by which cable operators may adjust rates when adding channels
to BSTs and CPSTs. The Commission is supplementing its existing going forward rules by creating an alternative channel
adjustment methodology. Cable operators adding channels to CPSTs under the new, supplemental rules may receive
(1) a flat per channel mark-up, subject to a cap through December 31, 1997, and (2) recovery of programming costs, subject
to a cap through December 31, 1996, and pursuant to the Commission's existing rules on permitted programming costs
through December 31, 1997, modified to remove the 7.5% mark-up. In so doing, the Commission seeks to permit operators
to provide new services on CPSTs, while assuring that rates for CPSTs are not unreasonable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operators may adjust rates for CPSTs pursuant to the new going forward rules beginning January 1, 1995, the effective
date of the new rules, for channel changes, if any, made to these tiers on or after May 15, 1994, the effective date of
the existing going forward rules. Operators adding channels to CPSTs on and after May 15, 1994, may use either the new
rules or the existing rules for adjusting rates. Thus, the permitted charge for a CPST will consist of two elements.
The first element is the permitted rate for channels offered on CPSTs on May 14, 1994, determined under current rules.
The second element is the permitted rates for channels added to, or dropped from, CPSTs on or after May 15, 1994, determined
under the new rules, or, if the operator so elects with respect to channel additions, the current rules as modified
to remove the 7.5% mark-up on increases in programming costs under certain circumstances described below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operators must elect to apply either the new rules or the current rules the first time they adjust rates after December
31, 1994, to reflect a channel addition to a CPST that occurred on or after May 15, 1994, and must use the elected methodology
for all rate adjustments through December 31, 1997. The Commission is allowing operators to choose to continue using
the current rules because the current rules provide greater channel addition incentives than the new rules in certain
limited circumstances and some operators may have relied on the current rules in deciding to add channels. While the
Commission is requiring that operators use either the existing or the new going forward rules consistently for channel
additions to CPSTs after December 31, 1994, an operator that chooses to use the new rules after that date may, but is
not required to, adjust rates to reflect the new rules for channel additions made between May 15, 1994 and December
31, 1994. Rates for the BST will continue to be governed exclusively by the current rules, except that where a system
offered only one tier on May 14, 1994, the cable operator will be allowed to use the revised rules for channel additions
to the BST, as if the tier was a CPST.

a. ``Going Forward'' price cap structure. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Operators electing to use the new rules may adjust their rates between January 1, 1995 and December 31, 1997, by up to
20 cents, exclusive of license fees, for each new channel added to CPSTs on or after May 15, 1994, subject to the Operator's
Cap and the reserve for license fees, described below. Operators are not required to raise rates, but rather are permitted
to do so. Operators may add channels under the new rules at any time from May 15, 1994, to December 31, 1997. They may not,
however, raise their prices as a result of channel additions by more than $1.20 per subscriber per month between January
1, 1995, and December 31, 1996, and by more than $1.40 between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 1997 (``Operator's
Cap'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operators may use may portion of the Operator's Cap to pay for license fees between January 1, 1995, and December 31,
1996, for channels added between May 15, 1994, and December 31, 1996. Moreover, operators may recover an additional
amount of not more than 30 cents per subscriber per month for license fees (the ``License Fee Reserve'') between January
1, 1995, and December 31, 1996, for channels added between May 15, 1994, and December 31, 1996. After December 31, 1996,
license fees may be passed through to subscribers pursuant to the existing rules, except that, as described below,
operators will not be allowed the current 7.5% mark-up on programming costs for channels on or after May 15, 1994. The
Operator's Cap and License Fee Reserve only apply to costs associated with new channels on CPSTs and do not affect the
ability of operators to obtain rate adjustments for inflation or changes in external costs other than increases in
programming costs of channel added under the new going forward rules. See 47 CFR 76.922(d)(2), (3). The new going-forward
rules for channel additions should benefit consumers by increasing their viewing options on existing CPSTs, while
avoiding unreasonable price increases for those tiers.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b. Per channel adjustment factor. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As indicated, the Commission establishes a ``per channel adjustment factor'' of up to 20 cents per channel for channels
added to CPSTs. Operators may increase rates by up to 20 cents, exclusive of programming costs, for each channel added
to a CPST on and after May 15, 1994, subject to the Operator's Cap of $1.20 on rate increases attributable to channel
additions through December 31, 1996, and $1.40 through December 31, 1996, and $1.40 through December 31, 1997. An
operator may choose a lower per channel adjustment, if that would further its business plan by, for example, allowing
it to devote a portion of the Operator's Cap to license fees. An operator that added a channel on or after May 15, 1994,
and raised pursuant to the existing rules, may revise its rates after December 31, 1994, using the new channel addition
rules. As noted, an operator must use either the existing or the revised rules consistently for all channel additions
on and after January 1, 1995.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The per channel adjustment factor will compensate the operator for its costs of adding the channel plus a reasonable
profit. Twenty cents falls within the historical range of 15&hyph;22 cents by which operators in a competitive environment
would adjust rates for the addition of a new programming channel, exclusive of programming costs. The methodology
the Commission used in deriving the 15&hyph;22 cent range is set forth in the Technical Appendix to the full text of
this Report and Order.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission's rules provide that any revenues received from a programmer, or shared by a programmer and an operator,
must be netted against costs for purposes of calculating whether there has been an increase or decrease in external
costs. 47 CFR 76.922(d)(3)(x). We extend this requirement for offsetting revenues against costs to the per channel
adjustment factor for channels added to CPSTs pursuant to our revised channel adjustment rules. The revenues must
be deducted from programming costs and then, to the extent revenues are remaining, from the per channel adjustment.
Offsetting will apply on a channel-by-channel basis. Commissions received by an operator from programmers will
be treated as revenues received from programmers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The per channel adjustment factor permitted by this Report and Order will apply only to net increases in channels from
the highest number of channels offered on all CPSTs (excluding NPTs) on May 15, 1994, or any date thereafter.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 If an operator substitutes a new channel for an existing channel, no per channel adjustment may be made under the revised
channel adjustment rules. Rather, the operator should continue to charge the residual associated with the channel
that was dropped. To permit an operator to receive a per channel adjustment in these situations would encourage operators
to evade the purpose of the revised going forward incentives by substituting new for existing channels simply to get
an additional per channel adjustment.

An operator may receive a per channel adjustment for channel X if it substitutes channel Y for channel X and then adds
channel X back to the system, so long as the addition of channel X represents the required net increase in the number
of CPST channels. In contrast, an operator that had 20 channels on its CPSTs on May 15, 1994, 22 channels on its CPSTs
on May 15, 1995, and 21 channels on its CPSTs on January 1, 1996, may not obtain a per channel adjustment for adding the
22nd channel back to its system on May 15, 1996. Rather, the 22nd channel is treated as a channel substitution.

c. Operator's cap. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the addition of new channels to CPSTs on or after May 15, 1994, the Commission establishes a per subscriber cap on
the amount by which monthly cable rates may increase between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 1997. Operators may
not make rate adjustments to monthly rates totalling more than $1.20 per subscriber over the first two years of the
three-year period or more than $1.40 over the full three-year period. Rate changes prior to January 1, 1997, resulting
from programming costs of new channels must fall within the Operator's Cap unless they are covered by the License Fee
Reserve. Price increases will be counted against the Operator's Cap when rates are increased as a result of channel
additions, not when the addition occurs. Any rate increases pursuant to the revised rules shall be subject to the notice
and prior approval requirements of the Commission's regulations. See 47 CFR 76.932, 76.933, 76.958, 76.964. In addition,
operators will be required to send the Commission copies of the notices sent to subscribers. The Operator's Cap will
apply only to operators using the 20 cent per channel adjustment in our new rules. It will not apply to operators that
elect to use the existing rules to adjust rates for channel additions occurring on and after May 15, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Operator's Cap on the rate increase attributable to the addition of new channels to CPSTs is based on historical
increases in numbers of channels offered. It is necessary because without such a cap, the per channel mark-up could
create an incentive for operators to add large numbers of channels to CPSTs so as to increase the aggregate mark-up
received. This result would undermine the 17% competitive rate reduction previously ordered by the Commission and
could raise overall rates toward monopoly levels that would have occurred in the absence of the 1992 Cable Act. An unreasonable
CPST rate also would cause the CPST to be an unattractive choice for subscribers, thereby removing it as a viable competitor
to an NPT.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Commission adopts the Operator's Cap because there is no evidence that consumers want to pay for an
unlimited number of channels in CPSTs. The cap will also provide operators with incentives to choose which new services
offered on CPSTs would be most demanded by subscribers. Finally, because the per channel adjustment of up to 20 cents
reflects an average based on historical data, adjusted for the lack of effective competition, it may provide some
operators with a greater incentive to add channels than would exist in a competitive market.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
d. License fee reserve. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission also establishes a License Fee Reserve of 30 cents which operators may use, between January 1, 1995,
and December 31, 1996, to recover programming costs for new channels. The License Fee Reserve may be applied against
the initial license fee or any increase in the license fee for channels added during the first two years that the Operator's
Cap is in effect. During this period, operators also may use all or any portion of the amount permitted as a per channel
adjustment under the Operator's Cap to pay for license fees in excess of the License Fee Reserve. License fees incurred
in the third year the Operator's Cap is in effect may be passed through to subscribers as external costs without counting
against either the License Fee Reserve or the Operator's Cap.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 30 cents License Fee Reserve would allow 6 channels to be added at an average license fee of 5 cents per channel. The
5-cents average, per channel license fee falls within the range which the Commission observed.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has adopted a License Fee Reserve in response to programmers' concerns that a cap on total rate increases
attributable to new channels, without a reserve for license fees, might give rate-regulated cable operators incentives
to increase profits by adding only no cost or low cost channels.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e. Programming cost increase mark-up.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission has decided not to allow operators using the per channel adjustment under the new rules to take the 7.5%
mark-up on programming cost increases, including retransmission consent fees and copyright fees incurred for coverage
of broadcast signals, for channels for which the per channel mark-up of up to 20 cents was taken. The Commission's analysis
indicates that the per channel adjustment of up to 20 cents for additional channels, in addition to the License Fee
Reserve, will provide full and fair compensation to operators adding channels to CPSTs. Operators who have added
channels prior to the effective date of the new rules will not be harmed by this change since the operators may elect
to add channels to CPSTs under the old or the new rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
f. Deletion and substitution of channels.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The new regulations also specify how operators shall adjust rates for BSTs and CPSTs when channels are dropped from,
or moved between, BSTs and CPSTs. In general, when dropping a channel from a BST or CPST, operators will be required
to make their rates reflect the net reduction in external costs as is required under the existing rules. See 47 CFR 76.922(d)(3)
(i) and (ii). Operators also will be required to reduce the price of that tier by the ``residual'' associated with that
channel. For channels that were on a BST or CPST on or before May 14, 1994 or channels added after that date pursuant to
the current rules, the per channel residual is the charge for the tier, minus the external costs for the tier, and any
per channel adjustments made after that date, divided by the number of channels on the tier. For channels added to a
CPST on or after May 15, 1994, pursuant to the new channel addition rules, the residuals shall be the actual per channel
adjustment taken for that channel when it was added to the tier plus any inflation adjustment since that time. The residual
and programming cost shall be calculated as of the date the channel is dropped.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above, when an operator substitutes a new channel for an existing channel on a CPST, no per channel adjustment
may be taken. The residual for the new channel is that of the channel it replaced. Operators substituting channels
will be required to adjust their rates for changes in license fees as provided by the current rules. To preserve the
overall effectiveness of the Operator's Cap and the License Fee Reserve, if the license fee for the new service is greater
than the license fee for the replaced service, and the operator chooses to pass that increase through to subscribers,
the excess shall count against the aggregate of the Operator's Cap and the License Fee Reserve. If the license fee for
the new channel is less than the license fee for the replaced channel, no credit shall be given against the cap or the
reserve, so as not to create an artificial incentive to replace higher license fee channels with lower license fee
channels. With respect to channels to which the 7.5% markup on new programming costs applies, the operator shall treat
the mark-up as part of its programming costs and subtract the mark-up from its external costs when a channel is dropped.
When such a channel is substituted, the operator may retain in its rates the 7.5% mark-up on the license fee of the dropped
channel, so long as that amount is not more than 7.5% of the license fee of the new channel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When a channel is shifted between a BST and a CPST or between CPSTs, it shall be treated as if it was dropped from one tier
and the residual and programming cost associated with the shifted channel shall be shifted to the other tier. The residuals
associated with the shifted channel shall be adjusted by reference to the number of subscribers on each tier to ensure
aggregate revenues remain the same.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 Revenue neutrality protects consumers by ensuring that the Commission's requirements do not create incentives
for operators to move channels to tiers with more subscribers solely to increase revenues. And because the per channel
adjustment of up to 20 cents applies only to the CPSTs, an operator may not move a channel for which it received a per channel
adjustment under the new rules from a CPST to the BST.

An operator may use the equivalent billing (``EBU'') methodology in calculating the number of subscribers on a tier,
provided it does so for both the tier from which the channel is shifted and the tier to which the channel is shifted and
provided that the operator otherwise meets the conditions for using EBU methodology. See Public Notice: Question
and Answer on Cable Television Rate Regulation (July 27, 1994) Question and Answer 1.

g. Headend upgrades for small systems.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission decided to adopt a special streamlined cost-of-service procedure for independent small systems
and small systems owned by small MSOs that upgrade their headend equipment to add new channels to CPSTs. Small systems
may find it difficult to recover the fixed costs of the headend equipment required for adding channels, since the cost
must be recovered over a small subscriber base. The Commission limits this relief to independent small systems and
small systems owned by small MSOs because (1) systems with more than 1,000 subscribers can spread the fixed costs of
headend equipment over a larger customer base and (2) small systems owned by larger operators should have adequate
financial resources to add channels under our generally applicable rules. Qualified small systems that add channels
to their CPSTs, therefore, have the option of either using this special procedure or using the existing or revised
going forward rules applicable to all operators.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under this streamlined cost-of-service procedure for upgrading headend equipment, independent small systems
and small systems owned by small MSOs may increase rates to recover the costs associated with new headend equipment
that is used to add channels to CPSTs. In order to recover costs for headend equipment, qualified small systems will
be required to certify to the Commission the level of costs they have actually incurred for adding headend equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission also decided to limit the amount small systems may recover under this special allowance to prevent
unreasonably sharp rate increases to small system subscribers. The amount a small system may recover for each channel
added shall be limited to programming costs incurred plus the lesser of the actual cost of the headend equipment or
$5,000, which is consistent with comments that the addition of a satellite channel can cost between $2,500 and $5,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Headend costs that are to be recovered through increased rates must be depreciated over the useful life of the equipment.
While the Commission has not prescribed depreciation rates, cable operators are required to follow reasonable depreciation
practices. Depreciation and useful life of the equipment are to be submitted to the Commission with the cost certification.
In addition, the rate of return the small system may earn on this investment may not exceed 11.25%.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Small systems may apply this streamlined cost-of-service procedure for channels added after May 14, 1994, but may
not use this methodology to increase rates to reflect channel additions until January 1, 1995. Moreover, small systems
that increase rates as a result of any channel additions pursuant to either this methodology may add a maximum of seven
channels to CPSTs over the next three years. This is equal to the number of channels that a system taking the maximum
20 cent per channel adjustment may add under the Operator's Cap.

h. Systems with more than 100 channels.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the Fifth Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the Commission noted that the Fourth Report and Order 59 FR 17943, 17955&hyph;17956
(April 15, 1994), established per channel adjustments for systems with total channels on regulated tiers of 100 channels
or fewer. It did not establish per channel rates for systems that provide more than 100 channels. The Commission solicited
comment on whether it should establish a method for adjusting capped rates in situations where there are more than
100 regulated channels and, if so, what that method should be. The Commission additionally asked whether the going
forward methodology should be modified to provide greater or lesser compensation to operators for adjustments to
capped rates when channels are added or deleted from BSTs and CPSTs, and whether this would better meet the goals of
encouraging infrastructure development and growth of programming.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The existing going forward regulations use a declining per channel adjustment as the number of channels on a system
increase. In contrast, in this Report and Order the Commission has decided to allow (1) a flat per channel adjustment
for the addition of new channels to CPSTs, subject to an Operator's Cap, and the License Fee Reserve, and (2) NPTs for
which cable operators set the price. Because the revised regulations allow operators to set the price for an unlimited
number of channels on NPTs, the Commission does not believe it is necessary to adopt any other rules that are based on
a specific number of channels. Cable operators continuing to add channels under the current rules may receive a per
channel incentive only for the first 100 channels on BSTs and CPSTs.

December 31, 1997, and will be reviewed prior to the end of that period to determine if there is any reason to continue
to provide incentives to increase the number of channels on any CPST. The new rule will expire on that date and will be
replaced by the existing rule unless the new rule is reinstated by the Commission. The special streamlined cost-of-service
procedure for headend equipment costs for small systems also will expire on December 31, 1997, unless it is reinstated
by the Commission.

1. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 3(f) of the 1992 Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. 543(f), prohibits negative option billing, which occurs when a cable
operator charges a subscriber for any service or equipment that the subscriber has not affirmatively requested by
name. A subscriber's failure to refuse a cable operator's proposal to provide such service or equipment may not be
deemed to be an affirmative request for such service or equipment. The Rate Order, 58 FR 29736, 29748 (May 21, 1993),
provided that changes in the mix of programming in a tier, including additions or deletions of channels, will not be
subject to the negative option billing provision unless they change the fundamental nature of the tier. The Commission
believed that, on balance, the benefits to subscribers from giving operators the ability to diversify, improve or
otherwise modify their offerings in a tier outweigh the slight reduction in subscriber choice that results from exempting
such changes from the negative option billing prohibition.

In the Third Reconsideration Order, 59 FR 17961, 17969&hyph;17970 (May 21, 1993), the Commission concluded that
the Commission concluded that the Commission and state and local governments have concurrent jurisdiction to regulate
negative option billing. The rationale for this conclusion was that regulation of negative option billing, while
discussed in the section of the 1992 Cable Act governing rate regulation, is more in the nature of a consumer protection
measure than rate regulation per se. Section (8)(c)(1) of the 1992 Cable Act, codified in Section 632(c)(1) of the
Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. 552(c)(1), provides that nothing in the ``Consumer Protection Laws'' title of the
Communications Act may ``be construed to prohibit any State or any franchise authority from enacting or enforcing
any consumer protection law, to the extent not specifically preempted by this title.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters request that the Commission clarify what channel additions to a tier will not require affirmative marketing
under Section 3(f) of the 1992 Cable Act. They also ask the Commission to declare that local authorities may not require
affirmative marketing for channel additions under state or local laws. More specifically, NCTA asks the Commission
to clarify that three specific ``scenarios'' do not trigger the federal negative option billing rule and that state
or local authorities are preempted from enacting or enforcing their own negative option billing laws.

2. Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In determining whether any of the scenarios involve negative option billing, the Commission is guided by the language
of the negative option billing provision, its legislative history, and our prior interpretations. In light of that
guidance, the Commission reaffirms that a change in the mix of channels in a tier, including additions or deletions
of channels, will not be subject to the negative option billing provision, unless they change the fundamental nature
of the tier. With respect to NCTA's first scenario, which involved passing through external costs or inflation adjustments,
the Commission holds that these types of rate changes do not in and of themselves invoke the federal negative option
billing rule. As an initial matter, they do not constitute ``service or equipment'' within the meaning of Section
3(f). Moreover, under our rate regulations, operators are specifically permitted to pass through to subscribers
increases in external costs and inflation adjustments. 47 CFR 76.922(d). These types of rate changes do not constitute
a change in the fundamental nature of a tier, and, therefore, do not implicate the federal negative option billing
prohibition for that reason as well.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the second and third scenarios identified in NCTA's letter, the Commission stated in the Rate Order,
58 FR 29748 (May 21, 1993), that ``a change in the mix of channels in a tier, including additions or deletions of channels,
will not be subject to the negative option billing provision, unless they change the fundamental nature of the tier.''
Determinations as to what constitutes a change in the fundamental nature of a tier will generally depend on the individual
circumstances of each case. Channel changes involving relatively few channels generally will not change the fundamental
nature of that tier, and thus will not implicate the federal negative option billing rule. Consistent with this approach,
additions of channels and rate adjustments within the Operator's Cap and License Fee Reserve of the revised going
forward rules generally will not change the fundamental nature of a tier. Affirmative marketing also is not required
when an operator moves channels pursuant to our conditions for establishment of NPTs, so long as the movements do not
change the fundamental nature of the tier. Because the Commission's rules require operators to give subscribers
30-days' advance notice of any changes in rates, programming or channel positions, the Commission does not believe
subscribers need the additional protection of the negative option billing provision for relatively modest changes.
See 47 CFR 76.309(c)(3)(i)(B); 76.964(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 632(c)(1) of the Communications Act makes clear that state and local authorities generally may apply statutes
proscribing fraud or misleading advertising practices to cable operators. However, Section 3(a)(1) of the 1992
Cable Act makes clear that regulation of ``the rates for the provision of cable service'' is governed exclusively
by the federal statute and Commission regulations. The scenarios NCTA presents require the Commission to consider
again the relationship between Section 632(c)(1) of the Communications Act and Section 3(a)(1) of the 1992 Cable
Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission concludes that a two-step approach is warranted. First, is the state or local negative option rule
consistent with the federal rule? If it is, then the state or local rule may be enforced. If the state or local rule is
inconsistent with the federal rule, then it is necessary to consider whether its enforcement ``approaches, actual
regulation of `rates for the provision of cable service.'' In elaborating on that inquiry, the Commission now concludes
that state or local consumer protection laws may not be enforced in a manner that conflicts with or undermines our rate
regulation rules established pursuant to Section 3 of the 1992 Cable Act. If there is an actual conflict between federal
and state law or where state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full objectives of
Congress, the state law is preempted.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The scenarios NCTA presents involve situations where enforcement of state and local negative option billing rules
would be inconsistent with the federal rule and enforcement might undermine implementation of the cable rate rules
promulgated pursuant to Congress's instruction. With respect to the first scenario, the federal negative option
billing rule plainly would not require cable operators to obtain affirmative consent from subscribers before passing
through external costs and inflation adjustments as permitted by the Commission's rules, as explained above. In
addition, enforcement of a state or local negative option billing rule requiring affirmative consent prior to the
pass-through of external costs and cost-of-service increases, as permitted by the Commission's rate rules, would
undermine the federal regime governing cable rates. The Commission has issued detailed rate rules implementing
Section 3 of the 1992 Cable Act. Under the Commission's rules, most cable operators must reduce their rates from pre-1992
levels, many by as much as 17%, to ensure that cable rates are reasonable. However, as the first scenario presented
by NCTA recognizes, the rules also allow cable operators to increase their rates to reflect increases in the cost-of-living
or other external costs, most of which are beyond cable operators' control. The 17% rate reduction and the rules authorizing
the pass-through of external costs and inflation adjustments are of a piece; the rate cut would not be fair to cable
operators if they were prohibited from raising rates to reflect increased costs that are beyond their control.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The other two scenarios presented by NCTA involve the addition, deletion and replacement of channels. The negative
option billing regulation makes clear that the requirement that cable operators obtain affirmative consent before
charging for a new service ``shall not preclude the addition or deletion of a specific program from a service offering,
the addition or deletion of specific channels from an existing tier of service, or the restructuring or division of
existing tiers of service that do not result in a fundamental change in the nature of an existing service, or tier of
service.'' 47 CFR 76.981. Accordingly, the replacement of a single channel, NCTA's third scenario, would not be prohibited
by the federal negative option billing provision, because that would not result in a ``fundamental change'' unless
the tier was very small. With respect to NCTA's second scenario, involving the addition or deletion of channels, the
answer would depend on how many channels were added or deleted and other factors relevant to determining whether a
``fundamental change'' had occurred. As stated above, however, changes that are permitted under the ``Operator's
Cap'' generally would not constitute ``fundamental changes.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the addition, deletion, or replacement of channels did not constitute a fundamental change in a tier, so that the
federal negative option billing rule was not triggered, preemption of enforcement of a stricter state or local negative
option billing rule would depend on whether enforcement would conflict with or undermine the rate regulation rules
established pursuant to Section 3 of the 1992 Cable Act. It is not possible to provide a blanket response to NCTA's second
and third scenarios in the absence of a specific set of facts to evaluate. However, it bears emphasis that the rate rules
governing the addition, deletion, and replacement of channels are designed to ensure reasonable rates without impeding
the provision of new services. Indeed, the rate rules are designed to encourage the provision of new services that
subscribers desire at the reasonable rates mandated by Congress. Therefore, an interpretation of state or local
law that required a cable operator to obtain the affirmative consent of every subscriber before making a change that
did not fundamentally alter the affected tier would, in most cases, interfere with the accomplishment of Congress's
objectives. In relatively few cases, in the Commission's view, would state or local officials be likely to seek to
enforce negative option billing rules that conflict with or undermine federal rate regulation provisions. But in
any event, on further consideration the Commission is convinced that, however numerous such cases are likely to be,
state and local officials may not enforce negative option billing rules that obstruct the accomplishment of the objectives
of Congress's cable rate provisions.

1. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the Cost Order in MM Docket No. 93&hyph;215, 59 FR 17975 (April 15, 1994), the Commission promulgated a rule for valuing
transactions between cable operators and affiliated companies. The Commission found that it would be inconsistent
with Congressional intent to allow rates for regulated cable service to reflect the prices affiliates charge each
other for transactions that occur at other than arm's length. The Commission found that allowing cable companies
to pass increases in their costs through to rate payers could motivate those companies to pay excessive amounts for
assets and services obtained from unregulated affiliates. The Commission therefore adopted a rule for affiliate
transactions that applies to cable operators who elect cost-of-service regulation or seek to adjust benchmark/price
cap rates for affiliated programming costs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the Cost Further Notice, 59 FR 18066, 18067&hyph;18068 (April 15, 1994), the Commission tentatively concluded
that the general changes it proposed for affiliate transactions involving telephone companies should be applied
to cable operators. The Commission tentatively concluded that the use of prevailing company pricing as a valuation
method for transactions between cable operators and their affiliates should only be permitted where the predominant
purpose of the transaction is to serve non-affiliates. To that end, the Commission proposed that any affiliate that
sells less than 75 percent of its output to non-affiliates has too large a volume of affiliate transactions to be deemed
to have a predominant purpose of serving non-affiliates. The Commission therefore proposed to continue to allow
prevailing company pricing as a valuation method for affiliate transactions only where at least 75 percent of the
cable operators output is sold to non-affiliates.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The cable industry generally opposes the proposed rule arguing that the proposal would require operators and programmers
to adopt costly, inefficient and unnecessary methodologies to document the estimated fair market value of the assets
or services exchanged. Some operators argue that the 75% bright-line test would impose administrative burdens that
would be excessive and outweigh the speculative benefits that might result. Several other parties oppose the proposed
rules on the grounds that these requirements would discourage vertical integration and would result in decreased
investment in quality cable programming. Others also oppose the proposal and state that the only rationale for the
rules comes from an incorrect premise that the application of such rules in the telephone context necessitates similar
rules in the cable industry.

2. Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission declines to adopt the proposal to prevent cable operators from valuing assets or services at the operators'
prevailing company prices unless the providing affiliates sell more than 75% of their output to non-affiliates.
The Commission finds that this proposal would prevent, in many cases, cable operators from establishing a prevailing
company price for programming services that have achieved wide distribution among cable operators. In addition,
the Commission is concerned that by preventing cable operators from valuing programming at the prevailing company
price, it may discourage major MSOs with substantial resources from investing in cable programming and related services
that could benefit subscribers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission will, therefore, retain the existing cable affiliate transaction rule which provides that a cable
operator may value an asset or service at the prevailing company price if the provider has sold the same kind of service
or asset to a substantial number of third parties at a generally available price. For cable affiliate transactions,
the sale of an asset to a substantial number of third parties will ensure that cable operators will not have an incentive
to pay excessive prices when they obtain services and assets from affiliates because in such cases the primary purpose
of the transaction would not be to provide services and assets to the affiliated programmer. However, the Commission
will continue to examine our test for the establishment of a prevailing company price in MM Docket No. 93&hyph;215
and as the Commission gains experience with our current cable affiliate transaction rule, it may seek further comment
in order to refine the rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Cost Further Notice sought comment on (1) the proposal to require cable operators that do not meet the
prevailing company price test to value services at the higher of cost and fair market value when the cable operator
is the seller and the lower of cost and fair market value when the cable operator is the buyer; (2) whether the current
definition of an affiliate should be retained; (3) whether the interim cable affiliate transaction rules should
be adopted as our final rules; and (4) whether our final cable affiliate transaction rule should be included in the
uniform system of accounts that we adopted for cable operators. The Commission will address these issues in conjunction
with our general consideration of final cost rules in MM Docket No. 93&hyph;215 at a later time.

Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;12, the Commission's final analysis with respect
to the Sixth Order on Reconsideration and Fifth Report and Order is as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Need and purpose of this action. The Commission, in compliance with section 3(i) of the Cable Television Consumer
Protection and Competition Act of 1992 pertaining to rate regulation, adopts rules and procedures intended to ensure
cable subscribers reasonable rates for cable services with minimum regulatory and administrative burden on cable
entities.

Summary of issues raised by the public comments in response to the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis. There
were no comments submitted in response to the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis. The Chief Counsel for Advocacy
of the United States Small Business Administration (SBA) filed comments in the original rulemaking order. The Commission
addressed the concerns raised by the Office of Advocacy in the Rate Order. The SBA also filed reply comments in response
to the Fifth Notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Significant alternatives considered and rejected. Petitioners representing cable interests and franchising
authorities submitted several alternatives aimed at minimizing administrative burdens. In the course of this proceeding,
the Commission has attempted to accommodate the concerns expressed by these parties. For example, the revised going
forward mechanisms are designed to enhance incentives to add new channels to regulated tiers without creating new
regulatory burdens and to provide additional options tailored to the concerns of small systems. In addition, the
New Products Tier is designed to ensure that regulated cable service rates are reasonable while reducing administrative
burdens.

Generally. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A system may adjust the residual component of its permitted rate for a tier to reflect changes in the number of channels
offered on the tier on a quarterly basis. Cable systems shall use FCC Form 1210 (or FCC Form 1211, where applicable)
to justify rate changes made on account on changes in the number of channels on a basic service tier (``BST'') or a cable
programming service tier (``CPST''). Such rate adjustments shall be based on any changes in the number of regulated
channels that occurred from the end of the last quarter for which an adjustment was previously made through the end
of the quarter that has most recently closed preceding the filing of the FCC Form 1210 (or FCC Form 1211, where applicable).
However, when a system deletes channels in a calendar quarter, the system must adjust the residual component of the
tier charge in the next calendar quarter to reflect that deletion. Operators must elect between the channel addition
rules in paragraphs (e)(2) and (e)(3) of this section the first time they adjust rates after December 31, 1994, to reflect
a channel addition to a CPST that occurred on or after May 15, 1994, and must use the elected methodology for all rate
adjustments through December 31, 1997. A system that adjusted rates after May 15, 1994, but before January 1, 1995
on account of a change in the number of channels on a CPST that occurred after May 15, 1994, may elect to revise its rates
to charge the rates permitted by paragraph (e)(3) of this section on or after January 1, 1995, but is not required to
do so as a condition for using the methodology in paragraph (e)(3) of this section for rate adjustments after January
1, 1995. Rates for the BST will be governed exclusively by paragraph (e)(2) of this section, except that where a system
offered only one tier on May 14, 1994, the cable operator will be allowed to elect between paragraphs (e)(2) and (e)(3)
of this section as if the tier was a CPST.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to adjust the residual component of the tier charge when there is an increase in the number of channels on a tier,
the operator shall perform the following calculations:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Take the sum of the old total number of channels on tiers subject to regulation (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 tiers that are, or could be, regulated but excluding New Product Tiers) and the new total number of channels and divide
the resulting number by two;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Consult the above table to find the applicable per channel adjustment factor for the number of channels produced
by the calculations in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section. For each tier for which there has been an increase in the
number of channels, multiply the per-channel adjustment factor times the change in the number of channels on that
tier. The result is the total adjustment for that tier.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Alternative methodology for adjusting rates for changes in the number of channels offered on a cable programming
service tier or a single tier system between May 15, 1994, and December 31, 1997. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This paragraph at the Operator's discretion as set forth in paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall be used to adjust
permitted rates for a CPST after December 31, 1994, for changes in the number of channels offered on a CPST between May
15, 1994, and December 31, 1997. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(3) of this section, a single tier system may be treated
as if it were a CPST.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Operators cap attributable to new channels on all CPSTs through December 31, 1997.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Operators electing to use the methodology set forth in this paragraph may increase their rates between January 1,
1995, and December 31, 1997, by up to 20 cents per channel, exclusive of programming costs, for new channels added to
CPSTs on or after May 15, 1994, except that they may not make rate adjustments totalling more than $1.20 per month, per
subscriber through December 31, 1996, and by more than $1.40 per month, per subscriber through December 31, 1997 (the
``Operator's Cap''). Except to the extent that the programming costs of such channels are covered by the License Fee
Reserve provided for in paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section, programming costs associated with channels for which
a rate adjustment is made pursuant to this paragraph (e)(3) of this section must fall within the Operator's Cap if the
programming costs (including any increases therein) are reflected in rates before January 1, 1997. Inflation adjustments
pursuant to &sect;76.922(d)(2) are not counted against the Operator's Cap.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Per channel adjustment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Operators may increase rates by a per channel adjustment of up to 20 cents per subscriber per month, exclusive of programming
costs, for each channel added to a CPST between May 15, 1994, and December 31, 1997, except that an operator may take
the per channel adjustment only for channel additions that result in an increase in the highest number of channels
offered on all CPSTs as compared to May 14, 1994, and each date thereafter. Any revenues received from a programmer,
or shared by a programmer and an operator in connection with the addition of a channel to a CPST shall first be deducted
from programming costs for that channel pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(x) of this section and then, to the extent revenues
received from the programmer are greater than the programming costs, shall be deducted from the per channel adjustment.
This deduction will apply on a channel by channel basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
License fee reserve.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In addition to the rate adjustments permitted in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) and (e)(3)(ii) of this section operators that
make channel additions on or after May 15, 1994 may increase their rates by a total of 30 cents per month, per subscriber
between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 1996, for license fees associated with such channels (the ``License Fee
Reserve''). The License Fee Reserve may be applied against the initial license fee and any increase in the license
fee for such channels during this period. An operator may pass-through to subscribers more than the 30 cents between
January 1, 1995, and December 31, 1996, for license fees associated with channels added after May 15, 1994, provided
that the total amount recovered from subscribers for such channels, including the License Fee Reserve, does not exceed
$1.50 per subscriber, per month. After December 31, 1996, license fees may be passed through to subscribers pursuant
to paragraph (d) of this section, except that license fees associated with channels added pursuant to this paragraph
(d)(3) of this section will not be eligible for the 7.5% mark-up on increases in programming costs.

(iv) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Timing.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For purposes of determining whether a rate increase counts against the maximum rate increases specified in paragraphs
(e)(3)(i) through (e)(3)(iii) of this section, the relevant date shall be when rates are increased as a result of channel
additions, not when the addition occurs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Deletion of Channels.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 When dropping a channel from a BST or CPST, operators shall reflect the net reduction in external costs in their rates
pursuant to paragraphs (d)(3) (i) and (ii) of this section. With respect to channels to which the 7.5% mark-up on programming
costs applied pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(xi) of this section, the operator shall treat the mark-up as part of its
programming costs and subtract the mark-up from its external costs. Operators shall also reduce the price of that
tier by the ``residual'' associated with that channel. For channels that were on a BST or CPST on May 14, 1994, or channels
added after that date pursuant to paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the per channel residual is the charge for the tier,
minus the external costs for the tier, and any per channel adjustments made after that date, divided by the total number
of channels on the tier minus the number of channels on the tier that received the per channel adjustment specified
in paragraph (e)(3) of this section. For channels added to a CPST after May 14, 1994, pursuant to paragraph (e)(3) of
this section, the residuals shall be the actual per channel adjustment taken for that channel when it was added to the
tier.

Movement of channels between tiers.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 When a channel is moved from a CPST or a BST to another CPST or BST, the price of the tier from which the channel is dropped
shall be reduced to reflect the decrease in programming costs and residual as described in paragraph (e)(4) of this
section. The residual associated with the shifted channel shall then be converted from per subscriber to aggregate
numbers to ensure aggregate revenues from the channel remain the same when the channel is moved. The aggregate residual
associated with the shifted channel may be shifted to the tier to which the channel is being moved. The residual shall
then be converted to per subscriber figures on the new tier, plus any subsequent inflation adjustment. The price of
the tier to which the channel is shifted may then be increased to reflect this amount. The price of that tier may also
be increased to reflect any increase in programming cost. An operator may not shift a channel for which it received
a per channel adjustment pursuant to paragraph (e)(3) of this section from a CPST to a BST.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Substitution of channels on a BST or CPST.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If an operator substitutes a new channel for an existing channel on a CPST or a BST, no per channel adjustment may be made.
Operators substituting channels on a CPST or a BST shall be required to reflect any reduction in programming costs
in their rates and may reflect any increase in programming costs pursuant to paragraphs (d)(3)(i) and (d)(3)(ii)
of this section. If the programming cost for the new channel is greater than the programming cost for the replaced channel,
and the operator chooses to pass that increase through to subscribers, the excess shall count against the License
Fee Reserve or the Operator Cap when the increased cost is passed through to subscribers. Where an operator substitutes
a new channel for a channel on which a 7.5% mark-up on programming costs was taken pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(xi)
of this section, the operator may retain the 7.5% mark-up on the license fee of the dropped channel to the extent that
it is no greater than 7.5% of programming cost of the new service.

Headend upgrades for small systems.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 When adding channels to CPSTs, independent small systems, as defined in &sect;76.901(c), and small systems owned
by small multiple system operators, as defined in &sect;76.922(b)(5), may choose among the methodologies set forth
in this paragraph and in paragraphs (e)(2) and (e)(3) of this section. Operators choosing the methodology of this
paragraph may increase rates to recover the actual cost of the headend equipment required to add up to seven channels
to CPSTs, not to exceed $5,000 per additional channel, plus any applicable programming costs. Rate increases pursuant
to this paragraph may occur between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 1997, as a result of additional channels offered
on those tiers after May 14, 1994. Headend costs shall be depreciated over the useful life of the headend equipment.
The rate of return on this investment shall not exceed 11.25 percent. In order to recover costs for headend equipment
pursuant to this paragraph, small systems must certify to the Commission their eligibility to use this paragraph,
the level of costs they have actually incurred for adding the headend equipment and the depreciation schedule for
the equipment.

(a) A cable operator shall not charge a subscriber for any service or equipment that the subscriber has not affirmatively
requested by name. A subscriber's failure to refuse a cable operator's proposal to provide such service or equipment
is not an affirmative request for service or equipment. A subscriber's affirmative request for service or equipment
may be made orally or in writing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The requirements of paragraph (a) of this section shall not preclude the adjustment of rates to reflect inflation,
cost of living and other external costs, the addition or deletion of a specific program from a service offering, the
addition or deletion of specific channels from an existing tier or service, the restructuring or division of existing
tiers of service, or the adjustment of rates as a result of the addition, deletion or substitution of channels pursuant
to &sect;76.922, provided that such changes do not constitute a fundamental change in the nature of an existing service
or tier of service and are otherwise consistent with applicable regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) State and local governments may not enforce state and local consumer protection laws that conflict with or undermine
paragraph (a) or (b) of this section or any other sections of this Subpart that were established pursuant to Section

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Collective offerings of unregulated per-channel or per-program (``a la carte'') video programming shall be
regulated as CPSTs pursuant to &sect;76.922. For purposes of this section, ``multiplexed'' channels shall be treated
as one channel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) A discounted package price offered by a cable system is not unreasonable with respect to any collective offering
of channels if the component channels' collective offering also have been continuously available on the system on
a per channel basis since April 1, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) A collective offering of per channel offerings may be treated as New Product Tier if:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The collective offering meets the conditions set forth in &sect;76.987; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The operator had reasonable grounds to believe the collective offering involving only a small number of migrated
channels complied with the Commission's requirements as of the date it was first offered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) In reviewing a basic service rate filing, local franchising authorities may make an initial decision addressing
whether a collective offering of ``a la carte'' channels will be treated as a cable programming service tier that is
an NPT under &sect;76.987 or a CPST that is regulated under &sect;76.922. The franchising authority must make this
initial decision within the 30 day period established for review of basic cable rates and equipment costs in &sect;76.933(a),
or within the first 60 days of an extended 120 day period (if the franchise authority has requested an additional 90
days) pursuant to &sect;76.933(b). The franchising authority shall provide notice of its decision to the cable system
and shall provide public notice of its initial decision within seven days pursuant to local procedural rules for public
notice. Operators or consumers may make an interlocutory appeal of the initial decision to the Commission within
14 days of the initial decision. Operators shall provide notice to franchise authorities of their decision whether
or not to appeal to the Commission within this period. Consumers shall provide notice to franchise authorities of
their decision to appeal to the Commission within this period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) A limited initial decision under paragraph (b) of this section shall toll the time periods under &sect;76.933
within which local authorities must decide local rate cases. The time period shall resume running seven days after
the Commission decides the interlocutory appeal, or seven days following the expiration of the period in which an
interlocutory appeal pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section may be filed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) A local franchising authority alternatively may decide whether a collective offering of ``a la carte'' channels
will be treated as an NPT as a part of its final decision setting rates for the basic service tier. That decision may then
be appealed to the Commission as provided for under &sect;76.945.

(b) In order to be eligible to offer NPTs, cable operators must meet the following conditions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Operators offering NPTs are prohibited from making fundamental changes to what they offer on their BSTs and CPSTs
offerings on September 30, 1994. Operators may drop channels or move channels between BSTs and/or CPSTs or to an a la
carte offering so long as the aggregation of such changes do not constitute a fundamental change in their BST or CPSTs.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Operators may not drop channels that were offered on their BSTs or CPSTs on September 30, 1994 and move them to NPTs
unless they wait at least two years from the date the channels were dropped from the BSTs or CPSTs. Time shifted versions,
slightly altered versions or renamed versions of channels offered on BSTs and CPSTs on September 30, 1994 shall not
be exempt from this restriction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Operators must market their BSTs and CPSTs so that customers should be reasonably aware that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Those tiers are being offered to the public;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The names of the channels available on those tiers; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The price of the tiers. A subscriber may not be charged for an NPT unless the cable operator has obtained the subscriber's
affirmative consent. Changes to the fundamental nature of an NPT must be approved by subscribers in accordance with
&sect;76.981.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Operators may not require the subscription to any tier, other than a BST, as a condition for subscribing to an NPT
and operators may not require subscription to an NPT as a condition for subscribing to a CPST. These restrictions will
not apply to cable operators prior to October 5, 2002, if such operators lack the capacity to offer BSTs and NPTs without
also providing other intermediate tiers of service as provided in &sect;76.900(c).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Operators may offer the same service on NPTs as are on one or more BSTs or CPSTs. A channel that occupied a CPST or BST
part-time on September 30, 1994 also may be offered full-time on an NPT as long as it continues to be offered at least
part-time on CPST or BST, under substantially the same conditions as before it was offered on the NPT. If a channel occupies
a BST or CPST (regulated pursuant to &sect;76.922) full-time on September 30, 1994, and is subsequently reduced to
part-time on the BST or CPST, that channel may not be offered on an NPT full-time. Operators that offer a channel both
on an NPT and a BST or CPST will have a continuing obligation to ensure that subscribers are aware that the channels are
available on the CPST or BST.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Operators may temporarily place new channels on CPSTs for marketing purposes and then move them to NPTs. In order
for an operator to move a channel from a CPST to an NPT pursuant to this paragraph, the channel must not have been offered
on a BST or CPST prior to October 1, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) After initially electing to offer an NPT, a cable operator may cease to provide the NPT, upon proper notice to subscribers
pursuant to &sect;76.964. If an operator drops an NPT and subsequently determines to reestablish that tier, at the
time of the reestablishment it must comply with the conditions for offering NPTs set forth in paragraph (b) of this
section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) If the Commission receives a complaint about an NPT, the operator need not file the rate justification provided
in &sect;76.956, but shall within the time period provided by that rule file documentation that the NPT meets all the
conditions set forth in this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Within 30 days of the offering of an NPT, operators shall file with the Commission, a copy of the new rate card that
contains the following information on their BSTs, CPSTs and NPTs:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The names of the programming services contained on each tier; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The price of each tier. Operators also must file with the Commission, copies of notifications that were sent to
subscribers regarding the initial offering of NPTs. After this initial filing, cable operators must file updated
rate cards and copies of customer notifications with the Commission within 30 days of rate or service changes affecting
the NPT.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The FMP and its implementing regulations (50 CFR part 663) provide for rapid changes to specific management measures
that have been designated ``routine.'' Trip landing and frequency limits (hereafter referred to as trip limits)
for Dover sole, thornyheads, sablefish, and widow rockfish are among those management measures that have been designated
as routine at 50 CFR 663.23(c). Implementation and further adjustment of those measures may occur after consideration
at a single Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) meeting.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A trip limit is defined at 50 CFR 663.2 as the total allowable amount of a groundfish species or species complex by weight,
or by percentage of weight of fish on board, that may be taken and retained, possessed, or landed from a single fishing
trip. Trip limits may limit the amount of fish that a vessel may legally land per fishing trip or cumulatively per unit
of time, or the number of landings that may be made by a vessel in a given period of time. A daily trip limit is the maximum
amount that may be taken and retained, possessed or landed per vessel in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
24 consecutive hours, starting at 0001 hours local time. Only one landing of groundfish may be made in that 24-hour
period. A cumulative trip limit is the maximum amount that may be taken and retained, possessed, or landed per vessel
in a specified period of time, without a limit on the number of landings or trips. Cumulative trip limits for 1994 apply
to calendar months.

The 1994 sablefish harvest guideline of 7,000 metric tons (mt) north of 36
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;00
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; N. lat. is divided among several fishing groups (59 FR 685; January 6, 1994). After subtracting 300 mt for the
Washington coastal treaty Indian tribes, the remaining 6,700 mt is allocated 6,070 mt for the limited entry fishery
and 630 mt for the open access fishery. The limited entry allocation is further subdivided 3,520 mt (58 percent) for
the trawl fishery and 2,550 mt (42 percent) for the nontrawl fishery. At the Council's October 1994 meeting, review
of the best available information on sablefish catches indicated that, at current catch rates, the limited entry
allocation for the trawl fishery would be reached by November 4, and if not curtailed, would be exceeded by about 529
mt, or 15 percent, by the end of 1994. By October 8, 1994, the nontrawl limited entry fishery had already exceeded its
allocation by 681 mt, or 27 percent. The open access sablefish fishery has not reached its allocation, 630 mt, and is
not likely to before the end of 1994. Nevertheless, the overall harvest guideline north of 36
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;00
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; N. lat. has already been reached and is projected to be exceeded by about 9 percent in 1994 if landings are not
curtailed. To keep landings from further exceeding the harvest guideline in 1994, the Council recommended closure
of the commercial sablefish fishery north of 36
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;00
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; N. lat. for the remainder of the year, beginning December 1, 1994. NMFS agrees with the Council's recommendation,
and is implementing a closure by setting the trip limit for sablefish at zero for all commercial gear types north of
36
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;00
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; N. lat. Although closure of the entire sablefish fishery results in closure of the open access fishery for
sablefish as well, it was considered necessary to prevent the transfer of effort from the limited entry fishery, which
could result in the open access allocation quickly being reached and the harvest guideline being further exceeded.
Even with the closure in December, the 1994 harvest guideline for sablefish will be exceeded by an estimated 4.7 percent.
Since the 1994 sablefish harvest guideline does not apply to the area south of 36
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;00
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; N. lat., that area remains open to sablefish fishing under existing trip limits. Those are 350 lb (159 kg) daily
for limited entry nontrawl and open access fisheries, and for the limited entry trawl fishery, 6,000 lb (2,722 kg)
cumulative per month, with a per-trip limit of no more than 1,000 lb (454 kg) or 33.333 percent of the legal thornyheads
and Dover sole, whichever is greater.

Limited Entry Trawl Fishery_Dover Sole and Thornyhead Trip Limits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the limited entry trawl fishery, Dover sole, thornyheads, and sablefish are managed collectively as the ``DTS
complex,'' because they are unavoidably caught together. If the trawl trip limits for Dover sole and thornyheads
are not reduced to minimal levels, substantial amounts of sablefish are likely to be caught and discarded. In order
to minimize the incidental catch and wastage of sablefish in the trawl fishery for Dover sole and thornyheads after
the retention of sablefish is prohibited, the Council also recommended reductions in the trip limits for these species.
NMFS agrees with this recommendation. The Dover sole cumulative monthly trip limit is reduced from 30,000 lb (13,608
kg) to 6,000 lb (2,722 kg) and the cumulative monthly trip limit for thornyheads is reduced from 8,000 lb (3,629 kg)
to 1,500 lb (680 kg) beginning December 1, 1994. Because sablefish cannot be landed, the cumulative limit for the DTS
complex, which was designed primarily to protect sablefish, is no longer needed and will no longer apply north of 36
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;00
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; N. lat. At the Council's October 1994 meeting, the best available data suggested that, at then-current rates,
58 percent of the coastwide harvest guideline for Dover sole (16,900 mt) would be utilized (9,854 mt), and the harvest
guideline for thornyheads (7,000 mt) would be reached near December 15, 1994, with about a 2 percent overage by the
end of the year. These trip limit reductions will exacerbate the failure to achieve the harvest guideline for Dover
sole, but may keep landings within the harvest guideline for thornyheads.

a vessel that fishes for any species north of 36
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->

for sablefish, the daily trip limit and closure would be applied the same way, except on a daily rather than a monthly
basis.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Widow Rockfish:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The 1994 harvest guideline for widow rockfish is 6,500 mt, which is further allocated between the limited entry (6,260
mt) and the open access fisheries (240 mt). On January 1, 1994, the cumulative trip limit for widow rockfish was set
at 30,000 lb (13,608 kg) per month (59 FR 685, January 6, 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the Council's October 1994 meeting, a continuing review of the best information available indicated that, through
early October, 80 percent (5,207 mt) of the 1994 harvest guideline for widow rockfish had been landed and the harvest
guideline would be reached by November 25, 1994. Therefore, the Council recommended that the cumulative trip limit
for widow rockfish be reduced from 30,000 lb (13,608 kg) per month to 3,000 lb (1,361 kg) per trip. NMFS agrees. Even
by reducing the trip limit to 3,000 lb (1,361 kg) on December 1, the harvest guideline may still be exceeded by about
3 percent for the year.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the authority of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended, the EPA is promulgating air
standards that will further reduce organic emissions from hazardous waste management activities. The air standards
apply to owners and operators of hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities (TSDF) subject to RCRA
subtitle C permitting requirements and to certain hazardous waste generators accumulating waste on-site in RCRA
permit-exempt tanks and containers. Under these standards, air emission controls must be used for tanks, surface
impoundments, and containers in which hazardous waste is placed on or after June 5, 1995 except under certain conditions
specified in the rule. Air emission control requirements are also added to the RCRA permit terms and provisions specified
for TSDF miscellaneous units. In addition, this action establishes a new EPA reference test method (Method 25E) to
determine the organic vapor pressure of a waste.

The final rule promulgated today establishes additional air standards for TSDF owners and operators subject to 40
CFR part 264 or 40 CFR part 265. In addition, this rule amends the conditions for hazardous waste generators accumulating
waste on-site in RCRA permit-exempt tanks and containers pursuant to 40 CFR 262.34(a) to include air emission control
requirements. All of these rule requirements are effective as of June 5, 1995. All hazardous waste placed in the affected
tanks, surface impoundments, containers, and other affected units on and after this date must be managed in accordance
with the requirements of the final rule. This includes implementing the required air emission controls on an affected
unit or performing the required waste determinations and recordkeeping to indicate that the affected unit is exempted
from these air emission control requirements. Under circumstances when the air emission control equipment required
to comply with the rule cannot be operational at an existing TSDF by June 5, 1995, an implementation schedule for installation
of the equipment must be developed and placed in the facility operating records no later than June 5, 1995. In such cases,
the facility owner or operator must have all air emission controls required by the final rule in operation no later
than December 8, 1997.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Today's action amends 40 CFR 270.4 to require that owners and operators of TSDF for which a final permit has been issued
by the EPA prior to June 5, 1995 must comply with the air emission control requirements for interim-status TSDF under
40 CFR 265 subparts AA, BB, and CC until the facility's permit is reviewed or reissued by the EPA. The EPA's rationale
for adopting this implementation practice for today's rulemaking is explained in section VI.E of this preamble.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For tanks in which waste stabilization activities (sometimes referred to as waste fixation) are performed as of December
6, 1994, be the effective date of the final rules will December 6, 1995. As of the extended effective date for stabilization
tanks, each TSDF owner or operator and each hazardous waste generator subject to the final rules must either install
and operate the specified air emission control requirements on all affected tanks used for stabilization, or begin
performing the specified waste determinations and recordkeeping to indicate that a stabilization tank is exempted
from these requirements. Under circumstances where required air emission control equipment cannot be operational
on stabilization tanks by December 6, 1995, an implementation schedule for installation of the required air emission
controls must be developed and placed in the facility operating records no later than December 6, 1995.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In such cases, for stabilization tanks, the facility must have all air emission controls required by the final rules
in operation no later than June 8, 1998.

II. Summary of Rule Changes Since Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA proposed the rule on July 22, 1991 (refer to 56 FR 33491). Based on public comments received by the EPA at proposal
as well as the EPA's evaluation of additional information obtained after proposal, certain requirements of the rulemaking
have been changed from those proposed. The major changes affect provisions establishing the rule applicability,
the procedures for determining the average volatile organic concentration of a waste, and the air emission control
requirements for containers. In addition, the EPA has made many changes to the specific regulatory text to clarify
the EPA's intent in the application and implementation of the rule requirements. The substantive changes to the rulemaking
since proposal are summarized below. A summary of the requirements of the rule as promulgated is presented in section
VII of this preamble.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A new subpart CC is added by today's action to both 40 CFR parts 264 and 265. Subpart CC under 40 CFR part 264 applies to
owners and operators of permitted TSDF while subpart CC under 40 CFR part 265 applies to owners and operators of interim-status
TSDF. All changes since proposal to subpart CC in 40 CFR part 264 and to subpart CC in 40 CFR part 265 are identical with
the exception of changes to the rule reporting requirements. There are no reporting requirements under 40 CFR 265
subpart CC for owners and operators of interim-status TSDF. Hereafter for convenience in this preamble, the term
``subpart CC standards'' is used collectively to refer to both subpart CC in 40 CFR part 264 and subpart CC in 40 CFR part
265.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The compliance time for the subpart CC standards has been revised since proposal to allow up to an additional 30 months
after June 5, 1995 to install and begin operation of air emission control equipment required by the rule provided that
the owner or operator develops and places in the facility operating records by this date an implementation schedule
for installation of the equipment. Compliance dates and implementation requirements for the final rule are explained
in sections I and VIII of this preamble.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Applicability
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The applicability of the subpart CC standards has been revised since proposal to specifically exempt from the rule
certain tanks surface impoundments, and containers in which the owner or operator has stopped adding hazardous waste.
The subpart CC standards do not apply to a tank, surface impoundment, or container that meets either of the following
conditions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) No hazardous waste is added to the waste management unit on or after June 5, 1995 (see generally 55 FR 39409, September
27, 1990); or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Addition to hazardous waste to the waste management unit is stopped and the owner or operator has begun implementing
or completed closure pursuant to an approved closure plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the applicability of the subpart CC standards has been changed such that the rule is not applicable to
any container having a design capacity less than 0.1 m3 (approximately 26 gallons) regardless of the organic content
of the hazardous waste handled in the container. In response to comments on the proposed rule, the EPA reviewed the
types of small containers commonly used to accumulate and transfer hazardous waste. Considering the small quantity
of hazardous waste handled in a sample collection vial, safety can, disposal can, and other types of small containers
and the short periods of time that the waste normally remains in one of these containers, the EPA concluded that existing
rules for containers having a design capacity less than 0.1 m3 are sufficient to protect human health and the environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the EPA has decided to temporarily defer application of the subpart CC standards to tanks, surface impoundments,
and containers managing hazardous wastes under certain special circumstances. For now, the EPA is deferring application
of the subpart CC standards to waste management units that are used solely to treat or store hazardous wastes generated
on-site from remedial activities required under RCRA corrective action or CERCLA response authorities (or similar
State remediation authorities). Also, the EPA is deferring application of the subpart CC standards to waste management
units that are used solely to manage radioactive mixed wastes. The EPA's rationale for these deferrals is explained
in section VIII.A.1 of this preamble.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. General Standards
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For each tank, surface impoundment, or container to which the subpart CC standards apply (referred to here as an ``affected
unit''), the owner or operator is required to use the air emission controls specified in the rule except when the hazardous
waste placed in an affected unit meets certain conditions. As explained in the following paragraphs, the conditions
under which an affected unit is exempted from the air emission control requirements of the subpart CC standards have
been revised since proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a. Waste volatile organic concentration exemption.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under the final subpart CC standards, an affected unit is exempt from the air emission control requirements of the
rule if all hazardous waste placed in the unit is determined to have an average volatile organic concentration less
than 100 parts per million by weight (ppmw) based on the organic composition of the hazardous waste at the point of waste
origination. This waste volatile organic concentration limit incorporates several revisions that have been made
by the EPA since proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, the format for the limit has been changed to be the average volatile organic concentration of the hazardous
waste on a mass-weighted basis during normal operating conditions for the source or process generating the waste
(in contrast to the proposed format of the maximum volatile organic concentration for the hazardous waste never to
be exceeded). Averaging periods up to 1 year in duration are allowed for each individual waste stream under the final
rule. The procedures for determining the average volatile organic concentration of a waste are explained further
under ``Waste Determination Procedures'' in this section and in section VII.A.3 of this preamble.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Second, determination of the volatile organic concentration of the waste under the final rule is based on the organic
composition of the waste at the ``point of waste origination'' (instead of the ``point of waste generation'' as proposed).
The ``point of waste origination'' is defined in the final rule with respect to the point where the TSDF owner or operator
first has possession of a hazardous waste. When the TSDF owner or operator is the generator of the hazardous waste,
the ``point of waste origination'' means the point where a solid waste produced by a system, process, or waste management
unit is determined to be a hazardous waste as defined in 40 CFR part 261. In this case, this term is being used in a similar
manner to the use of the term ``point of generation'' in waste operations air standards established under authority
of the Clean Air Act in 40 CFR parts 60, 61, and 63 of this chapter. When neither the TSDF owner nor operator is the generator
of the hazardous waste, the ``point of waste origination'' means the point where the owner or operator accepts delivery
or takes possession of the hazardous waste.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the EPA revised the impact analysis used for this rulemaking after proposal to incorporate additional TSDF
industry data. An opportunity for public comment on this analysis was provided by the EPA (refer to sections III.B
and VI.B of this preamble). Based on the revised analysis results, the EPA selected a new value for the volatile organic
concentration limit. Section V.C of this preamble presents the rationale for the selection of the control option
used as the basis for the final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b. Treated hazardous waste exemption. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the subpart CC standards, each affected tank, surface impoundment, and container that manages hazardous waste
having an average volatile organic concentration equal to or greater than 100 ppmw, as determined by the procedures
specified in the rule, is required to use air emission controls in accordance with the rule requirements. The owner
or operator must install and operate the specified air emission controls on every affected tank, surface impoundment,
and container used in the waste management sequence from the point of waste origination (as applies to the specific
hazardous waste stream) through the point where the organics in the waste are removed or destroyed by a process in accordance
with the requirements of the rule. If a particular hazardous waste is not treated to meet these requirements, then
all affected units at the TSDF used in the waste management sequence for this hazardous waste are required to use the
air emission controls specified by the subpart CC standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the hazardous waste is treated to remove or destroy the organics in the waste by a process that meets or exceeds a minimum
level of performance as specified in the rule, then affected units at the TSDF operated downstream of the treatment
process in the waste management sequence for this hazardous waste are not required to use the air emission controls
specified by the subpart CC standards. It is important to emphasize that tanks, surface impoundments, and containers
(subject to the rule) in which the treatment process is conducted are required to use the applicable air emission controls
specified by the subpart CC standards with the exception of certain tanks and surface impoundments used for active
biological treatment of hazardous waste and achieving the performance requirements specified in the rule (this
exception is explained further in section VII.A.4 of this preamble).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The conditions under which a treated hazardous waste no longer is required to be managed in affected units using air
emission controls under the subpart CC standards have been revised and expanded since proposal to include many alternatives
from which an owner or operator can choose one with which to comply. The final subpart CC standards allow an owner or
operator to use any type of treatment process that can continuously achieve one of the specified sets of performance
conditions. These conditions have been changed to include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The average volatile organic concentration of the hazardous waste exiting the process is less than 100 ppmw (except
for certain site-specific situations where multiple hazardous waste streams are treated by a single process in which
case a volatile organic concentration limit for the waste exiting the process is established by the rule procedures
at a value lower than 100 ppmw);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The organic reduction efficiency for a process treating multiple hazardous waste streams is equal to or greater
than 95 percent, and the average volatile organic concentration of the hazardous waste exiting the treatment process
is less than 50 ppmw; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The actual organic mass removal rate for the process is greater than the required mass removal rate established
for the process. The alternative treatment process performance requirements specified in the final subpart CC standards
are discussed further in section VII.A.2 of this preamble.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed explicit exemption for hazardous wastes complying with the land disposal restriction (LDR) treatment
standards is not included in the final subpart CC standards. The EPA concluded that the expanded number of alternatives
for treated hazardous waste and other provisions added to the final rule provide a reasonable regulatory mechanism
by which a TSDF owner or operator can determine whether a hazardous waste complying with the LDR treatment standards
is exempted from being managed in accordance with the air emission control requirements of the subpart CC standards.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Waste Determination Procedures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As already noted, the procedures that a TSDF owner or operator may use to determine the volatile organic concentration
of a hazardous waste have been revised for the final subpart CC standards. For a case when direct measurement is chosen
for determining the volatile organic concentration of a hazardous waste, the proposed statistical calculation
procedure using Method 25D results is not included in the final subpart CC standards. Instead, procedures are specified
in the final rule to compute the mass-weighted average volatile organic concentration of a hazardous waste using
Method 25D results for waste generated as part of a continuous process and for waste generated as part of a batch process.
Under circumstances when the same batch process is performed repeatedly but not necessarily continuously, the final
rule allows the owner or operator to determine the average volatile organic concentration of the waste from this process
by averaging results for one or more representative waste batches generated by the process. In all cases, a sufficient
number of waste samples for analysis (with a minimum of four samples) must be collected to be representative of the
normal range of the operating conditions for the source or process generating the hazardous waste. Normal operating
conditions for the source or process generating the waste include cyclic process operations such as startup and shutdown.
Process malfunctions, maintenance activities, or equipment cleaning are not considered to be normal operating
conditions for the purpose of determining the average volatile organic concentration of a waste. These waste determination
procedures are discussed further in section VII.A.3 of this preamble.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed explicit requirements for determining the volatile organic concentration of a hazardous waste using
information in a waste certification notice prepared by the waste generator are not included in the final rule. Instead,
for hazardous waste that is not generated by the TSDF owner or operator (i.e., waste shipped to the TSDF from off-site
sources under different ownership), the final rule allows the TSDF owner or operator to determine the waste volatile
organic concentration by either testing the waste when he or she accepts delivery of the hazardous waste or using appropriate
information about the waste composition that is prepared by the generator of the waste. The generator prepared information
can be included in manifests, shipping papers, or waste certification notices accompanying the waste shipment,
as agreed upon between the waste generator and the TSDF owner or operator.

4. Tank Standards
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several changes to the tank standards have been made since proposal. An exemption from the tank standards has been
added for those affected tanks used for biological treatment of a hazardous waste in accordance with requirements
specified in the rule. Changes have been made to clarify the regulatory text regarding the tank cover design and operating
requirements. Also, the conditions have been clarified that must be met for a particular tank to use a fixed-roof type
cover without any additional controls in accordance with the subpart CC standards. Finally, provisions have been
added to the rule to address those special situations in which emergency venting of the tank or the air emission controls
installed on the tank is necessary for safety.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Changes to the surface impoundments standards have been made to be consistent with the changes to the tank standards
as applicable.

6. Container Standards
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several changes have been made to the container standards since proposal in addition to limiting the applicability
of the subpart CC standards to containers having a design capacity equal to or greater than 0.1 m3. The air emission
control requirements for affected containers have been revised to provide several air emission control alternatives
from which an owner or operator may choose one with which to comply. For containers having a design capacity less than
or equal to 0.46 m3 (approximately 119 gallons), an owner or operator may place the hazardous waste in drums that meet
U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) specifications under 49 CFR part 178 without any additional testing, inspection,
or monitoring requirements. An owner or operator is also allowed under the final rule to place the hazardous waste
in tank trucks and tank railcars that are annually demonstrated to be vapor tight using Method 27 in 40 CFR part 60, appendix
A without any additional testing, inspection, or monitoring requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirements for waste transfer operations for containers have been revised under the final subpart CC standards.
Submerged-fill of hazardous waste that is loaded into containers by pumping is required only when transferring the
waste into containers having a design capacity greater than 0.46 m3. Submerged fill of the waste is not required when
filling smaller size containers such as 55-gallon drums.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The air emission control requirements for owners and operators treating hazardous waste in open containers have
been revised. Whenever it is necessary for the container to be open during the treatment process, the container is
required to be located in an enclosure connected to a closed-vent system with an operating organic emission control
device. The final subpart CC standards include specific enclosure design and operation requirements which allow
the enclosure to have permanent openings for worker access.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the container standards have been revised to be consistent with the safety venting provisions added to the
tank and surface impoundment standards.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The design and operating requirements for closed-vent systems and control devices have been changed to be consistent
with those requirements already applicable to TSDF owners and operators under subpart AA in 40 CFR parts 264 and 265.
The subpart AA standards have been in effect since 1990 and establish RCRA air standards to control organic emissions
from process vents on certain types of hazardous waste treatment units.

8. Inspection and Monitoring Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The inspection and monitoring requirements under the subpart CC standards have been revised since proposal. The
requirements for inspection and monitoring of closed-vent systems and control devices have been changed to be identical
to the inspection and monitoring requirements under subpart AA in 40 CFR parts 264 and 265. The required interval for
the visual inspection of covers installed on tanks, surface impoundments, and certain containers has been changed
to once every 6 months. After the initial cover inspection and monitoring for detectable organic emissions is completed,
the owner or operator is only required to inspect and monitor those cover openings that have been opened (i.e., have
not continuously remained in a closed, sealed position) since the last visual inspection and monitoring. Special
inspection and monitoring provisions have been added for cover fittings that are unsafe or difficult, as defined
in the rule, for facility personnel to inspect and monitor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The subpart CC standards have been changed to allow leak repair on tank and surface impoundment covers to be delayed
beyond 15 calendar days if both of the following conditions occur: (1) Repair of the leak requires first emptying the
contents of the tank or surface impoundment; and (2) temporary removal of the tank or surface impoundment from service
will result in the unscheduled cessation of production from the process unit, or operation of the waste management
unit, that is generating the hazardous waste managed in the tank or surface impoundment. Repair of a leak must be performed
at the next time the process, system, or waste management unit that is generating the hazardous waste managed in the
tank or surface impoundment stops operation for any reason.

9. Recordkeeping Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The subpart CC standards have been changed to require cover design documentation only for floating roof-type tank
covers, surface impoundment covers, and enclosures used for control of air emissions from containers. Also, the
recordkeeping requirements have been revised as appropriate to address the changes to the final rule described previously
in this section of the preamble.

10. Reporting Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The reporting requirements in the subpart CC standards are the same as proposed with one exception. The time interval
within which TSDF owners and operators subject to the subpart CC standards under 40 CFR part 264 must report to the Regional
Administrator all circumstances resulting in noncompliance with the applicable conditions has been changed to
within 15 calendar days of the time that an owner or operator becomes aware of the circumstances.

B. TSDF Miscellaneous Units
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Today's action amends 40 CFR 264.601 by adding to the permit terms and provisions required for RCRA permitting of a
miscellaneous unit the appropriate air emission control requirements in 40 CFR part 264, subparts AA, BB, and CC.
This amendment is the same as proposed.

C. Generator 90-Day Tanks and Containers
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The conditions with which a hazardous waste generator must comply, pursuant to 40 CFR 262.34(a), to exempt tanks and
containers accumulating hazardous waste on-site for no more than 90 days from the RCRA subtitle C permitting requirements
are amended by today's action to include compliance with the air emission control requirements of 40 CFR part 265,
subparts AA, BB, and CC. This amendment is the same as proposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Other RCRA Regulatory Actions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA proposed several amendments to existing RCRA air standards. One amendment proposed adding requirements
for the management of spent carbon removed from a carbon adsorption system to the closed-vent system and control device
standards under 40 CFR part 264, subparts AA and BB, and 40 CFR part 265, subparts AA and BB. The final amendment has been
revised to allow the owner or operator the additional option of burning the spent carbon in a boiler or industrial furnace
that is permitted under subpart H of 40 CFR part 266. A second amendment promulgated today updates the leak detection
monitoring provisions under 40 CFR part 264, subparts AA and BB, and 40 CFR part 265, subparts AA and BB for closed-vent
systems to be consistent with other air standards recently promulgated by the EPA. Under this amendment, annual leak
detection monitoring is not required for those closed-vent system components which continuously operate in vacuum
service or those closed-vent system joints, seams, or other connections that are permanently or semi-permanently
sealed (e.g., a welded joint between two sections of metal pipe, a bolted and gasketed pipe flange).

E. Test Methods
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As part of this rulemaking, the EPA proposed two new reference test methods (Method 25D and Method 25E) to be added to
40 CFR part 60, Appendix A. Method 25D is a test method for the determination of the volatile organic concentration
of waste materials. Since proposal, the EPA decided it is also appropriate to use method 25D to implement other EPA
air standards being developed under authority of the Clean Air Act. The promulgation of some of these other air standards
prior to today's action required the EPA to promulgate Method 25D in a separate rulemaking (refer to 59 FR 19402, April
22, 1994). Comments and responses relevant to Method 25D for this rulemaking are in the BID for the final rule and in
the dockets pertaining to this rulemaking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Method 25E is being promulgated today. Method 25E is the test method for determining the organic vapor pressure of
wastes. The sampling requirements for Method 25E have been revised since proposal to provide for sampling of the waste
in a tank.

III. Summary of Final Rule Impacts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA estimates that implementation of the subpart CC standards will reduce nationwide organic emissions from
TSDF tanks, surface impoundments, and containers by approximately 970,000 Mg/yr. In addition, the EPA estimates
that nationwide organic emissions from 90-day tanks and containers will be reduced by approximately 73,000 Mg/yr.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Control of organic air emissions addresses many air quality problems including ambient ozone formation, adverse
human health effects from inhalation of air toxics, and, to a lesser extent, depletion of stratospheric ozone. Ambient
ozone concentrations exceed the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) in many metropolitan areas throughout
the United States. Thus, the rule promulgated today will contribute to progress in attaining the NAAQS for ozone in
nonattainment areas and also in preventing significant deterioration of the air quality in those areas of the United
States currently in attainment with the NAAQS for ozone.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's action will also significantly reduce the risk to the public of contracting cancer posed by exposure to toxic
constituents contained in the organic emissions from hazardous waste management activities. The cancer risk to
the entire exposed population nationwide (i.e., annual cancer incidence) from exposure to organic emissions from
TSDF is estimated by the EPA to be reduced from approximately 48 cases per year to a level of 2 cases per year. Annual cancer
incidence as a result of exposure to organic emissions from 90-day tanks and containers is estimated by the EPA to be
reduced from approximately four cases per year to less than one case per year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Maximum individual risk (MIR) is a measure of the added probability of a person contracting cancer if exposed continuously
over a 70-year period to the highest annual average ambient concentration of the air toxics emitted from a TSDF site.
There are approximately 2,300 TSDF locations in the United States. The MIR for all but approximately 20 of these facilities
is estimated by the EPA to be reduced by implementation of the subpart CC standards to a level that is less than 1 &times;
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
&cent;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
4. The target MIR levels historically used by the EPA for other promulgated RCRA standards range from 1 &times; 10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
&cent;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Because the MIR values for a few TSDF are estimated to remain higher than the historical RCRA target, the EPA is continuing
to evaluate the waste management practices and the individual chemical compounds composing the organic emissions
at these TSDF. Following this evaluation, the EPA will determine what other actions are necessary to attain the health-based
goals of RCRA section 3004(n). The omnibus permitting authority in section 3005(c)(3) can be invoked to supplement
or add to the requirements in today's rule, should the rule be determined to be insufficient to assure protection of
human health and the environment at a particular facility.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The total nationwide capital investment cost to TSDF owners and operators to implement the subpart CC standards is
estimated by the EPA to be approximately $290 million. The total nationwide annual cost for these standards is estimated
to be approximately $110 million per year. The total nationwide capital costs to hazardous waste generators of installing
the required air emission controls on 90-day tanks and containers is estimated by the EPA to be approximately $23 million.
Total nationwide annual cost for the 90-day tank and container controls is estimated to be approximately $7 million.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA concludes that the rule promulgated today will not have a significant economic impact on hazardous waste generators
or TSDF owners and operators. Prices for commercial hazardous waste management services are estimated by the EPA
to increase by less than 1 percent on a nationwide annualized basis. The quantity of hazardous waste handled by commercial
hazardous waste management companies is projected to be reduced by less than 1 percent on a nationwide annualized
basis. Few, if any, facility closures are anticipated. Job losses in the hazardous waste industry are estimated to
be less than 1.5 percent. Furthermore, this impact on employment does not reflect positive employment effects on
industries producing the air emission control equipment that will be used to comply with the rule. No significant
impacts are expected on small businesses.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 added section 3004(n) to RCRA. Section 3004(n) directs the EPA to
promulgate regulations for the monitoring and control of air emissions from TSDF as may be necessary to protect human
health and the environment. The EPA completed the first phase of its regulatory development program to implement
this Congressional directive with the promulgation of RCRA air standards that control organic emissions vented
from certain hazardous waste treatment processes (i.e., distillation, fractionation, thin-film evaporation,
solvent extraction, steam stripping, and air stripping) as well as from leaks in certain ancillary equipment used
for hazardous waste management processes (55 FR 25454, June 21, 1990). Today's action completes the second phase
of the EPA's regulatory development program with the promulgation of RCRA air standards for tanks, surface impoundments,
containers, and miscellaneous units operated at TSDF. This rulemaking also adds air emission control requirements
for certain hazardous waste generators accumulating waste on-site in RCRA permit-exempt tanks and containers.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As described at proposal (56 FR 33496, July 22, 1991), the EPA decided in both the first and second phases to develop
standards that control organic emissions as a class (as opposed to constituent-by-constituent). Implementation
of these nationwide standards will achieve significant organic emission and cancer risk reductions. However, the
EPA estimates the cancer risk at a few TSDF after implementation of these nationwide standards to remain at a level
that is higher than the range of target risk levels for other promulgated RCRA standards (refer to section V.C of this
preamble.) The third phase of this regulatory development program is to determine what other actions are necessary
to attain the health-based goals of RCRA section 3004(n). To make this determination, the EPA is evaluating hazardous
waste operations at those individual TSDF estimated to have MIR values greater than the historical RCRA target MIR
levels.

B. Public Participation in Rulemaking
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA is promulgating today's final rule after careful consideration of public comments on the proposed rule (56
FR 33491, July 22, 1991). The preamble to the proposed rule discussed the availability of the background information
document (BID) pertaining to the health effects of organic emissions from hazardous waste TSDF using tanks, surface
impoundments, and containers. The EPA mailed copies of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice and the BID for the proposed rule to industry representatives, environmental groups, and State and Federal
agencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA solicited comments from the public at the time of proposal and provided a 90-day comment period, from July 22,
1991 to October 21, 1991, for the public to prepare and submit written comments on the proposed rule. In addition, the
EPA provided the opportunity for a public hearing to allow interested persons to present oral comments to the EPA concerning
the proposed rule. However, no one requested that the EPA hold a public hearing on the proposed rule. The EPA did receive
written comments from more than 80 companies, industrial trade associations, environmental groups, and State and
Federal agencies. The BID for the final rule summarizes all of the comments on the proposed rule and presents the EPA's
response to each of the comments. Section VI of this preamble presents responses to selected major comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following the EPA's review of public comments received on the proposed rule, the EPA revised the impact analysis used
for its final determination regarding today's rulemaking. This analysis used additional TSDF industry data obtained
by the EPA. The EPA provided an opportunity for public comment on the additional TSDF industry data used for the impact
modeling revisions. A

 Notice of Data Availability (57 FR 43171, September 18, 1992) listed these additional data. The EPA also made the data
available for public inspection at the EPA RCRA Docket Office. A 30-day comment period, from September 18, 1992 to
October 19, 1992, provided the public the opportunity to comment on the additional data. The EPA received comments
on the additional data from one industrial trade association. Section VI.B of this preamble presents a summary of
these comments.

1. RCRA Rules for TSDF Owners and Operators
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Today's action establishes organic air emission control requirements for TSDF tanks, surface impoundments, and
certain containers. Other types of waste management units operated at TSDF may be subject to these air emission control
requirements as follows.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a. Miscellaneous units.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under RCRA in 40 CFR 260.10, the EPA defines a ``miscellaneous unit'' as a hazardous waste management unit where waste
is treated, stored, or disposed of that is not a container, tank, surface impoundment, wastepile, land treatment
unit, landfill, incinerator, boiler, industrial furnace, underground injection well with appropriate technical
standards under 40 CFR part 146, or a unit eligible for a research, development, and demonstration permit under 40
CFR 270.65. The EPA has established provisions under 40 CFR part 264, subpart X to allow TSDF owners and operators to
obtain permits to operate miscellaneous units. The EPA permits miscellaneous units on a case-by-case basis with
terms and provisions as needed to protect public health and the environment through generic performance standards
specified in 40 CFR 264.601.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's rule amends &sect;264.601 to state that the air emission controls required by the standards under 40 CFR 264
subparts AA, BB, and CC are among the ``appropriate'' controls a permit writer may require for a miscellaneous unit
``to ensure protection of human health and the environment.'' Applicability of today's rule to miscellaneous units
is discussed further in Section VII.B of this preamble.

b. Land disposal restrictions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The RCRA LDR treatment standards under 40 CFR part 268 require TSDF owners and operators to treat hazardous waste to
reduce the toxicity or mobility of specific constituents in the waste before the TSDF owner or operator can place the
waste in a land disposal unit. Under certain conditions, the EPA may grant a TSDF owner or operator permission to land
dispose a hazardous waste that does not meet the LDR treatment standards in a particular land treatment unit, landfill,
wastepile, or surface impoundment. This action is referred to as the ``no migration'' variance. To obtain a ``no migration''
variance, a TSDF owner or operator must demonstrate in a petition to the EPA that, with a reasonable degree of certainty,
there will be no migration of hazardous constituents from the disposal unit for as long as the waste remains hazardous.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 11, 1992, the EPA proposed its interpretation of the term ``no migration'', the procedures and substantive
requirements for submitting to the EPA a petition to demonstrate ``no migration'' from a land disposal unit, and the
EPA's criteria for evaluating the petitions (57 FR 35940). This proposal includes amending 40 CFR 268.6 to add as a
condition for receiving a no migration variance that the applicant demonstrate that the subject land disposal unit
complies with the applicable air emission standards the EPA has developed under 40 CFR parts 264 and 265.

c. Corrective action requirements. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA is temporarily deferring applicability of the subpart CC standards to any tank, surface impoundment, or container
which is used solely for on-site treatment or storage of hazardous waste that is generated as the result of implementing
remedial activities required under the RCRA corrective action authorities of 3004(u), 3004(v) or 3008(h). The EPA's
rationale for this temporary deferral is explained in section VII.A.1 of this preamble.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

2. RCRA Rules for Hazardous Waste Generators
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Hazardous waste generators who accumulate waste on-site in containers or tanks for short periods of time can elect
to be exempted from RCRA subtitle C permitting requirements provided that a generator complies with provisions specified
in 40 CFR 262.34. The EPA allows a generator who generates 1,000 kilograms or more of hazardous waste per month to accumulate
the hazardous waste on-site for up to 90 days in tanks and containers without a permit provided the generator complies
with certain conditions specified in 40 CFR 262.34(a). These conditions include compliance with the requirements
of 40 CFR part 265, subpart I when the waste is accumulated in a container and 40 CFR part 265, subpart J when the waste
is accumulate in a tank. Tanks and containers used to accumulate hazardous waste on-site for 90 days or less pursuant
to the conditions of 40 CFR 262.34(a) are hereafter referred to in this preamble as ``90-day tanks and containers.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule promulgated today only amends the RCRA permit exemption requirements for generators operating 90-day tanks
and containers. This action does not affect the existing RCRA permit exemption requirements for generators operating
tanks and containers for on-site accumulation of hazardous waste in accordance with the provisions of 40 CFR 262.34
(d) or (e). Applicability of today's rule to 90-day tanks and containers is discussed further in Section VI.D of this
preamble.

3. RCRA Rules for Hazardous Waste Transporters
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulations in 40 CFR part 263 establish standards that apply to persons transporting hazardous waste within the
United States if the transportation requires a manifest under 40 CFR part 262. Today's action does not change the RCRA
rules under 40 CFR part 263. However, the air standards promulgated today may indirectly affect transporters accepting
certain organic-containing hazardous wastes from TSDF owners and operators. The final subpart CC standards require
that TSDF owners and operators only load these hazardous wastes into containers (including tank truck, railcars,
and roll-off boxes) that use air emission controls as specified in the rule. Consequently, to continue accepting
hazardous waste from a TSDF owner or operator, in some cases, transporters may need to ensure that their containers
meet the subpart CC standards.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Relationship to CERCLA Standards
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), authorizes the EPA to undertake
removal and remedial actions to clean up hazardous substance releases. Under CERCLA, on-site remedial actions are
required to comply with the requirement of Federal and more stringent State environmental laws that are applicable
or relevant and appropriate (ARAR) to the remedial action unless certain statutory waivers apply. In addition, the
National Oil and Hazardous Substances Contingency Plan (NCP) provides that removal actions shall attain ARAR to
the extent practicable considering the exigencies of the situation. [40 CFR 300.415(i)]. As explained in section
VII.A.1 of this preamble, the EPA has decided to temporarily defer application of the subpart CC standards to tanks,
containers and surface impoundments which are being used to treat or store hazardous wastes containing organics
generated on-site from remedial activities required under RCRA corrective action or CERCLA response authorities,
or similar State remediation authorities, provided that the wastes are managed in units that do not also manage other
hazardous waste containing organics. However, after the temporary deferral has been lifted, today's rules may be
considered an ARAR for certain types of remedial and removal actions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A requirement under a Federal or State environmental law may be either ``applicable'' or ``relevant and appropriate,''
but not both, to a remedial or removal action conducted at a CERCLA site. An ARAR is identified on a site-specific basis
in a two-part analysis that considers first, whether a given requirement is applicable; then, if it is not applicable,
whether it is nevertheless both relevant and appropriate. ``Applicable'' requirements as defined in the NCP are
those that specifically address a hazardous substance, pollutant, contaminant, remedial action, location, or
other circumstances found at a CERCLA site. [40 CFR 300.415(i)]. ``Relevant and appropriate'' requirements are
those that, while not ``applicable'' at a CERCLA site, address problems or situations sufficiently similar to those
encountered at the CERCLA site that their use is well suited to the particular site. [40 CFR 300.415(i)].

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some waste management activities used for remedial and removal actions of hazardous organic substances require
the use of tanks, surface impoundments, and containers. For example, a TSDF may treat hazardous organic liquids and
surface water contaminated with hazardous organic waste on site using destruction, detoxification, or organic
removal processes that occur in tanks or surface impoundments. The facility may perform on-site solvent washing
of soils contaminated with hazardous organic sludges in a tank or container. At a TSDF, hazardous waste in leaking
drums may be repacked in new containers for treatment and disposal at another site.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Once today's deferral is lifted, the air emission control requirements of the subpart CC standards are likely to be
``applicable'' to on-site remedial and removal actions that use tanks, surface impoundments, and containers to
manage substances exhibiting characteristics or listed under RCRA as hazardous waste and having an average volatile
organic concentration equal to or greater than 100 ppmw. In other cases, the standards may be ``relevant and appropriate'';
this determination must be made on a site specific basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other hand, the subpart CC standards do not specify control requirements for wastepiles, landfills, and land
treatment units that manage hazardous wastes at TSDF. Therefore, the standards are not likely to be ``applicable''
to excavation, capping of wastes, land treatment, land farming, in situ treatment activities, and other activities
involving wastepiles and landfills at CERCLA sites. Although in most cases the EPA does not expect the subpart CC standards
to be ``relevant and appropriate'' to these types of units at CERCLA sites, remedial and removal actions performed
in wastepiles may in some cases be similar in nature and scale to the waste management activities performed in surface
impoundments; and waste stabilization may involve the basic process and air emission mechanism regardless of whether
the mixing of the waste and binder is conducted in a tank, surface impoundment, container, wastepile, landfill, or
land treatment unit. Thus, in some cases the subpart CC standards may be ``relevant and appropriate'' for such actions;
this determination must be made on a site specific basis.

Section 112 of the Clean Air Act (CAA) regulates stationary sources of hazardous air pollutants (HAP). This section
was comprehensively amended under Title III of the 1990 Amendments to the CAA. Under the amended CAA section 112(b),
Congress listed 189 chemicals, compounds, or groups of chemicals as HAP. The EPA is directed by the CAA to regulate
HAP emissions from stationary sources by establishing national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants
(NESHAP).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 1990 Amendments to the CAA required the EPA to develop and publish a list of source categories that emit HAP for which
NESHAP will be developed. The EPA published its initial list of NESHAP source categories on July 16, 1992 (refer to
57 FR 31576). Many industrial sectors that may manage hazardous wastes are listed as specific NESHAP source categories.
Consequently, facilities at which hazardous wastes are managed may be subject to both NESHAP and the RCRA air standards
under 40 CFR part 264 and 265. At these facilities, some waste management units would be subject to either air emission
control requirements under the NESHAP or the air emission control requirements under the RCRA air standards. However,
in certain situations, some waste management units would be subject to air emission control requirements under both
sets of rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CAA requires that the requirements of standards developed under the Act be consistent, but avoid duplication,
with requirements of standards developed under RCRA. Consequently, the EPA is taking into account the air standards
promulgated under RCRA section 3004(n) in determining the requirements for NESHAP affecting air emission sources
at which hazardous waste could be managed.

F. Relationship to Nuclear Regulatory Commission Standards
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Radioactive mixed wastes are wastes that contain radioactive materials as well as materials listed or identified
as hazardous under RCRA. Radioactive mixed wastes must be managed in accordance with RCRA regulations, in addition,
these wastes also are subject to standards administered by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) under the Atomic
Energy Act and Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 that address the safe handling and disposal of radioactive waste.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA has previously stated its general position that the management of radioactive mixed waste at TSDF is subject
to regulation under subtitle C of RCRA (51 FR 24504, July 3, 1986; 53 FR 37045, September 23, 1988). In developing the
RCRA standards applicable to radioactive mixed wastes, the EPA considers the management practices required for
these wastes to avoid inconsistencies between the EPA's hazardous waste management requirements and the NRC's radioactive
waste management requirements. Furthermore, RCRA section 1006(a) precludes any solid or hazardous waste regulation
by the EPA or a State that is ``inconsistent'' with the requirements of the Atomic Energy Act. Thus, in a case where the
regulatory requirements for radioactive mixed waste are conflicting, the NRC requirement takes precedence over
the RCRA requirement. Because of the potential that air emission control equipment required by the subpart CC standards
promulgated today may conflict with certain radioactive waste management requirements under NRC standards, the
EPA has decided to temporarily defer application of the subpart CC standards to tanks, containers, and surface impoundments
which are being used solely to manage radioactive mixed wastes. This deferral is discussed further in section VII.A.1
of this preamble.

V. Basis for Final Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. New Control Options
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA developed a national impacts model specific to the air emission sources affected by this rulemaking to compare
the human health and environmental protection provided by the different air emission control options. Following
proposal of the rule, the EPA revised this model to incorporate new information obtained by the EPA and to address public
comments on the impact analysis methodology received at proposal. Section VI.B of this preamble presents a further
discussion of the impact analysis revisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At proposal, the EPA gave notice that consideration of new results from revisions to the national impacts analysis
could lead to selection of any one of the control options considered at proposal or possibly a new control option (56
FR 33516). Upon reviewing preliminary results for the revised national impacts model, the EPA decided to expand the
number of control options considered for the final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA first performed a screening evaluation by using the revised national impacts model to estimate the nationwide
organic emission and cancer incidence reductions for the original five control option configurations described
at proposal (56 FR 33512), plus nine new control option configurations. The EPA included a summary of the impacts model
results for these 14 control options in the information listed in the Notice of Data Availability (57 FR 43171) and
made available for public inspection at the EPA RCRA Docket Office (refer to RCRA docket entry number F&hyph;92&hyph;CESA&hyph;00018).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA used the screening evaluation results to select a final group of control options selected for further analysis.
The EPA eliminated a control option from further consideration if another one of the control options was estimated
to provide the same level of nationwide organic emission or cancer incidence reduction but at a lower cost. This is
the same control option selection approach the EPA used at proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the screening evaluation results, the EPA selected four control options for further analysis. In addition
to the control option used as the basis for the proposed rule, the EPA also analyzed ``baseline'' impacts. These ``baseline''
impacts represent the estimated nationwide organic emissions and other impacts that would occur in the absence of
implementing any of the control options. The final group of five control options (designated Options A through E)
differ by the value used for the volatile organic concentration limit and the type of air emission controls used for
surface impoundments.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Option A requires air emission controls on all TSDF tanks, surface impoundments, and containers managing hazardous
waste with any detectable volatile organic concentration as determined at the point where the waste is generated
(i.e., a volatile organic concentration action level of 0 ppmw). Under Option A, tanks use a cover vented to a control
device except for tanks handling certain hazardous wastes. Tanks in which the organic vapor pressure of the hazardous
waste in the tank is less than 10.4 kPa (approximately 1.5 psi) may use a cover without additional controls. All surface
impoundments use a cover vented to a control device. Containers use cover and submerged fill for loading hazardous
wastes into the containers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Option B requires air emission controls only on those TSDF tanks, surface impoundments, and containers used to manage
hazardous wastes having a volatile organic concentration at the point where the waste is generated equal to or greater
than 100 ppmw. The control requirements are the same as described for Option A with one exception; surface impoundments
used for storage of hazardous waste and surface impoundments used for treatment of hazardous waste by a process not
requiring aeration or agitation of the waste require covers only.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Option C requires air emission controls only on those TSDF tanks, surface impoundments, and containers used to manage
hazardous wastes having a volatile organic concentration at the point where the waste is generated greater than 500
ppmw. The air emission control requirements are the same as described for Option B. Option C is the same control option
selected as the basis for the proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Option D requires air emission controls only on those TSDF tanks, surface impoundments, and containers used to manage
hazardous wastes having a volatile organic concentration at the point where the waste is generated greater than 1,500
ppmw. The air emission control requirements are the same as described for Options B and C.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Option E requires air emission controls only on those TSDF tanks, surface impoundments, and containers used to manage
hazardous wastes having a volatile organic concentration at the point where the waste is generated greater than 3,000
ppmw. The air emission control requirements are the same as described for Options B, C, and D.

B. Control Option Impacts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA estimated nationwide organic emission and cancer risk reductions that would be achieved if air standards
were implemented for each of the five control options. The ``baseline'' nationwide organic emissions from TSDF are
estimated to be approximately 1 million Mg/yr. The estimated nationwide TSDF organic emissions assuming implementation
of the individual control options are 30,000 Mg/yr for Option A, 41,000 Mg/yr for Option B, 48,000 Mg/yr for Option
C, 51,000 Mg/yr for Option D, and 90,000 Mg/yr for Option E.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assess the risk of contracting cancer posed by exposure to organic emissions from TSDF, the EPA used two measures
of health risk: Annual cancer incidence and maximum individual risk (MIR). The annual cancer incidence parameter
represents an estimate of population risk and, as such, measures the aggregate risk to all people in the United States
estimated to be living within the vicinity of TSDF. The MIR parameter represents the potential of air emissions from
a particular source to cause cancer in the most exposed hypothetical individual under the assumptions used in the
risk and exposure assessments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Estimation of these health risk parameters requires the EPA to make several critical assumptions regarding the TSDF
plant configurations and operating practices, the composition of wastes managed at these TSDF, the cancer potency
of the organics contained in these wastes, the emission of these organics to the atmosphere from TSDF sources, and
the exposure of people living near TSDF to these air toxic emissions. The complex interrelationship of the various
assumptions prevents the EPA from definitively characterizing the estimated health risk parameter values as being
overestimates or underestimates.

The EPA estimated annual cancer incidence for baseline and the five control options using the EPA's Human Exposure
Model (HEM), the site-specific cancer risk factors, and TSDF industry profile data bases. This risk value is based
on the estimated number of excess cancers occurring in the nationwide population after a lifetime exposure (defined
to be 70 years). For statistical convenience, the EPA divided the aggregate risk by 70 and expressed the risk as cancer
incidence per year. The information provided in RCRA docket entry numbers F&hyph;92&hyph;CESA&hyph;S00014 and
S00015 describes the estimation methodology in more detail. The EPA estimates baseline nationwide annual cancer
incidence from exposure to TSDF organic emissions to be 48 cases per year. The estimated nationwide TSDF cancer incidences,
assuming implementation of the individual control options, are two cases per year for Option A, two cases per year
for Option B, four cases per year for Option C, five cases per year for Option D, and nine cases per year for Option E. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA uses the MIR parameter for relative comparisons of pollutants, emission sources, and control alternatives.
For the impact analysis, the EPA estimated the MIR parameter assuming that exposure of the individual to the ambient
air toxic concentrations occurs for 24 hours per day for a lifetime of 70 years. The EPA realizes that this is a conservative
assumption since most people do not spend their entire lives at one location. However, it is completely possible for
an individual to live in the same place for his or her entire life. Furthermore, other uncertainties in the analysis
could lead to underestimating the risk. For example, the actual exposed subpopulations (such as children or asthmatics)
may be more sensitive to the emitted air toxics than the reference adult male for which the unit risk factor extrapolations
are based. In addition, the analysis does not address potential indirect exposure pathways to humans, or potential
harm to environmental receptors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The MIR parameter reflects the added probability that a person would contract cancer if exposed continuously over
a 70-year period to the highest annual average ambient concentration of the air toxics emitted from a TSDF. Baseline
MIR from exposure to TSDF organic emissions is estimated to be 3 &times; 102. The estimated MIR's, assuming implementation
of the individual control options, are: 4 &times; 10

 for Option E. These MIR values apply only to the very few TSDF, of the approximately 2,300 TSDF operating in the United
States, that are estimated to have the potential to cause the highest risk. The values do not represent actuarially
measured risks nor do they apply to all TSDF in the United States. The EPA is not attempting to estimate any specific
individual's potential of developing cancer. Finally, the EPA is not interpreting any of these estimates as indicators
of the absolute risks of contracting cancer. Rather, the purpose of this cancer risk assessment, both for incidence
and MIR, is to compare relative differences among the individual control options (i.e., ``degree'' of human health
protection).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to estimating organic emissions and cancer risk parameters, the national impacts model provides an estimate
of the total nationwide capital costs and annual costs to the TSDF owners and operators to install and operate the air
emission controls specified by each control option. For these nationwide cost estimates, the EPA assumed that, at
every TSDF location, treatment of all hazardous wastes to remove or destroy the organics in the waste occurs as the
last step prior to disposal of the waste. In actuality, the EPA expects that, at many TSDF, the owner or operator (after
becoming aware of the air standards) will elect to treat waste at an earlier step in the waste management sequence.
By treating organics in compliance with one of the waste treatment alternatives provided in final rule, the owner
or operator could avoid the costs of installing and operating control equipment on the downstream tanks, surface
impoundments, and containers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Capital investment cost represents the cost to TSDF owners and operators to purchase and install the air emission
control equipment. The estimated nationwide capital costs in 1986 dollars to implement the control options are:
$520 million for Option A, $290 million for Option B, $240 million for Option C, $200 million for Option D, and $140 million
for Option E. Annual cost represents the total cost to TSDF owners and operators each year to pay for operating and maintaining
the air emission controls as well as to repay the capital investment for the air emission controls. The capital recovery
was estimated using an interest rate of 10 percent applied over a period ranging from 10 to 20 years depending on the
expected service life for each type of air emission control equipment. The estimated nationwide annual costs to implement
the control options are: $190 million/yr for Option A, $110 million/yr for Option B, $90 million/yr for Option C, $80
million/yr for Option D, and $60 million/yr for Option E.

C. Selection Rationale
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
From Options A through E, the EPA selected one control option to serve as the basis for today's final rule. The EPA applied
the same decision rationale used at proposal for this rulemaking (56 FR 33515&hyph;33516, July 22, 1991) as well as
for RCRA air standards promulgated under subparts AA and BB to 40 CFR parts 264 and 265 (refer to 55 FR 25470, June 21,
1990). This decision rationale requires the EPA to select, whenever possible, the level of control that provides
an acceptable degree of protection of human health and the environment. If no control option is available to achieve
acceptable levels of protection, the EPA's approach historically has considered cost under RCRA only for equally
protective control options.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All five of the control options considered for the final rule are estimated to achieve similar levels of substantial
reductions in nationwide organic emissions from TSDF. The nationwide organic emission reductions for the control
options are estimated to be approximately 970,000 Mg/yr for Option A, 960,000 Mg/yr for Option B, 950,000 Mg/yr for
Option C, 950,000 Mg/yr for Option D, and 910,000 Mg/yr for Option E.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both Options A and B are estimated to achieve the lowest cancer MIR and greatest reduction in annual cancer incidence
of the five options. However, none of the control options reduces MIR to the target cancer risk levels used for other
promulgated RCRA standards, which have been in the range of 1&times;10

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
^6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The estimated MIR is an order-of-magnitude higher for Options C, D, and E (2&times;10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
^2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 for Options C and D) compared to Options A and B (4&times;10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
^3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Annual cancer incidence reductions estimated for Option C (44 cases per year), Option D (43 cases per year), and
Option E (39 cases per year) are lower than the annual cancer incidence reductions estimated for Options A and B (46
cases per year).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the basis of the estimated annual cancer incidence and MIR, the EPA concluded that Options A and B are more protective
of human health than Options C, D, or E. Therefore, the EPA eliminated Options C, D, and E from further consideration
as the basis for the final rule.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Both Options A and B are estimated to achieve the same level of cancer risk reduction (MIR to 4 &times; 10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
&cent;3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and annual cancer incidence to two cases per year). Therefore, the EPA concluded that Options A and B are equally protective
of human health and the environment (to the extent ascertainable by this modelling methodology). Historically under
RCRA, the EPA has considered control option costs only to select between options estimated to achieve equivalent
levels of protection. Therefore, to select between Options A and B, the EPA compared the estimated costs to implement
each of the control options. Option B requires the use of air emission controls only on those TSDF tanks, surface impoundments,
and containers used to manage hazardous wastes with a volatile organic concentration at the point where the waste
is generated equal to or greater than 100 ppmw. Because TSDF owners and operators would need to install and operate
air emission controls on fewer TSDF tanks, surface impoundments, and containers, Option B would be less expensive
for the TSDF industry to implement than Option A. Therefore, the EPA selected Option B as the basis for the final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While Option B does not achieve the target MIR levels historically used for other promulgated RCRA rules, Option B
does achieve substantial reductions in cancer risk. The annual cancer incidence is estimated to be reduced by greater
than 95 percent from the baseline value. Furthermore, the MIR for most of the 2,300 TSDF nationwide are estimated to
achieve the target MIR levels. To address the remaining cancer risk at TSDF after implementation of the air standards
promulgated today, the EPA is further evaluating the waste management practices and the specific chemical compounds
composing the organic emissions from those individual TSDF for which the MIR values are estimated to be greater than
the historical RCRA target MIR levels. Following this evaluation, the EPA will determine what other actions, such
as the use of section 3005(c)(3) omnibus permitting authority or additional rulemaking, are necessary to attain
the health-based goals of RCRA section 3004(n).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Many comments were received regarding the extent to which the congressional directive of RCRA section 3004(n) should
be implemented using air standards established by the EPA under Clean Air Act (CAA) authority. Commenters stated
the position that protection of human health and the environment from TSDF air emissions is most appropriately, effectively,
and efficiently addressed by developing air standards under the CAA authority. Therefore, commenters believe that
the EPA should make the determination that the requirements of RCRA section 3004(n) are best fulfilled by deferring
to air standards established under CAA authority. Commenters stated that the air standards proposed by the EPA under
authority of RCRA section 3004(n) are:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Not needed because existing CAA programs adequately address the control of TSDF organic emissions;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

as directed by section 112 of the CAA;

(3) Not in compliance with RCRA section 1006(b) regarding duplication or contradiction of CAA requirements;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Inconsistent with CAA programs that establish ozone precursor control requirements depending on the national
ambient air quality standards attainment status of the region in which a source is located;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Inconsistent with the EPA's pollution prevention policy;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Contrary to the EPA's ``cluster concept'' of examining and coordinating regulations addressing the same emission
source to minimize duplicative or contradictory requirements; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Difficult to administer and enforce because, traditionally, one State regulatory agency administers rules
regulating air emissions while another administers rules regulating hazardous waste management.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments to RCRA added section 3004(n), which directs the EPA to ``*&blank;*&blank;*
promulgate regulations for the monitoring and control of air emissions from hazardous waste treatment, storage,
and disposal facilities, including but not limited to open tanks, surface impoundments, and landfills, as may be
necessary to protect human health and the environment.'' The EPA considers the most appropriate, effective, and
efficient way to fulfill this congressional mandate is to develop air standards for TSDF that are implemented under
the existing RCRA subtitle C permitting program already in place for these facilities. However, the EPA disagrees
with one commenter's assertion that, in establishing these RCRA air standards, the EPA cannot consider the impact
of air standards promulgated or currently being developed under other statutory authorities such as the CAA. On the
contrary, RCRA section 1006(b) requires the EPA to coordinate its regulations under RCRA statutes and to avoid duplication,
to the maximum extent practicable, with appropriate provisions of the CAA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA disagrees that the requirements of RCRA section 3004(n) are best fulfilled by deferring to air standards established
under CAA authority. There is no indication that Congress intended for air standards to be issued only within the authority
granted to the EPA by the CAA. If this was the case, then Congress would not have amended RCRA section 3004(n) under HSWA
after Congress had already authorized the EPA to control air emissions under the CAA. Refer to S. Rep. No. 284, 98th
Cong. 1st sess. 63. Thus, both RCRA and the CAA authorize the EPA to control air emissions from TSDF.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although historically many standards promulgated by the EPA under authority of RCRA have addressed the prevention
of soil and water contamination from improper management of hazardous waste, the EPA is not limited by RCRA to promulgating
standards only for certain media (e.g., surface waters, groundwater, and soils). Indeed, RCRA section 3004(n) specifically
directs the EPA to issue regulations controlling air emissions from TSDF as necessary to protect human health and
the environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The selection of TSDF air emission sources for control by establishing air standards under RCRA section 3004(n) is
based on controlling those TSDF air emission sources determined by the EPA to have significant toxic and ozone precursor
emission potential but for which emission control is not adequately addressed by other standards promulgated by
the EPA such as NESHAP and NSPS established under the CAA. At proposal, the EPA concluded that additional air emission
control requirements for TSDF tanks, surface impoundments, and containers are needed. This decision was based on
the EPA's determination that existing and future Federal standards under the CAA and State air standards do not adequately
address the control of TSDF organic air emissions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As previous described in section III.E of this preamble, CAA section 112 has been amended by Congress since RCRA section
3004(n) was enacted. Section 112 of the CAA as amended requires the EPA to identify major sources and area sources of
HAP emissions and to develop NESHAP for these sources. To date for this air standards development program, the EPA
has either promulgated or proposed several NESHAP that may apply to some hazardous waste management activities at
TSDF. However, in general, these NESHAP added requirements to address HAP emissions from certain waste and material
recovery operations that are not subject to or exempted from regulation under the RCRA air standards in 40 CFR parts
264 and 265. Thus, the NESHAP and other air standards being developed under CAA are not intended to duplicate the RCRA
air standards, but instead to integrate with the RCRA air standards to create a comprehensive air program for addressing
organic air emissions from all waste and related material recovery operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, on-site wastewater treatment operations at synthetic organic chemicals manufacturing industry (SOCMI)
facilities are regulated under the hazardous organic NESHAP (``the HON'') promulgated on April 22, 1994 (see 59 FR
19402). At many of these facilities, the hazardous wastewaters generated by process units and resulting wastewater
treatment sludges are managed in tank systems that are exempted from RCRA permitting requirements under provisions
in 40 CFR 264.1(g)(6) or 40 CFR 265.1(c)(10). Thus, the air emission control requirements under the HON, in most cases,
affect wastewater treatment tanks not subject to the RCRA air standards.

A second example is the recently proposed NESHAP for off-site waste and recovery operations (59 FR 51913, October
13, 1994). This NESHAP would apply to owners and operators of facilities, with certain exceptions, that manage wastes
or recoverable materials which have been generated off-site at another facility and contain specific organic HAP.
The rule would apply to operations managing solid wastes as defined under RCRA (hazardous and nonhazardous wastes)
as well as operations handling recovered materials excluded from the RCRA definition of solid waste (e.g., recycled
materials containing organic HAP, used oil reprocessed for sale as a fuel). As a result, certain off-site waste and
recovery operations with organic HAP emissions, but exempted from regulation under the RCRA air standards, would
be required to use air emission controls under this NESHAP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In contrast to the NESHAP now being developed under CAA section 112, the EPA has already achieved progress toward full
implementation of RCRA section 3004(n), which requires a ``cradle to grave'' approach to hazardous waste management
that addresses protection of air, water, and groundwater. Air standards have been promulgated for TSDF treatment
process vents (subpart AA in 40 CFR parts 264 and 265) and for TSDF process equipment leaks (subpart BB in 40 CFR parts
264 and 265) in addition to the development of these air standards for TSDF tanks, surface impoundments, and containers.
There is no benefit to delaying implementation of air standards for TSDF tanks, containers, and surface impoundments
to a future rulemaking under amended CAA section 112 when the EPA can proceed now with the promulgation of effective
air standards under RCRA section 3004(n) for these air emission sources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The RCRA air standards adopted today do comply with RCRA section 1006(b). This section requires that the air standards
be consistent with and not duplicative of CAA standards. Although RCRA section 1006(b) requires some accommodation
with existing regulatory standards, it ``does not permit the substantive standards of RCRA to be compromised.''

, 976 F.2d at 23 (D.C. Cir. 1992). It is obviously reasonable for the EPA to view the RCRA section 3004(n) mandate as a
standard which cannot (or at least need not) be compromised. Similarly, the CAA Amendments of 1990 require that air
standards developed under the CAA be consistent with RCRA rules. To conform with the dual RCRA and CAA requirements
that standards be consistent, the air standards developed under RCRA section 3004(n) do not duplicate or contradict
existing NESHAP or NSPS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA is fully aware that at many facilities where hazardous wastes are managed, the RCRA air standards under 40 CFR
part 264 and 265 as well as NESHAP and NSPS for specific source categories may be applicable to a particular TSDF. Certain
testing, monitoring, inspection, recordkeeping, and other requirements under the RCRA air standards may be similar
to or duplicative of requirements under the applicable NESHAP or NSPS. In many cases at a TSDF, individual waste operations
will be subject to either the air emission control requirements under the RCRA air standards or the air emission control
requirements under the applicable NESHAP or NSPS. Thus, it is necessary to include testing, monitoring, inspection,
recordkeeping, and other implementation requirements in each rule to assure compliance with and enforcement of
the rule. However, in certain situations, some individual waste operations at a TSDF could be subject to air emission
control requirements under both the RCRA air standards as well as a NESHAP or NSPS. In such cases, the EPA believes it
is unnecessary for owners and operators of these waste management units to conduct duplicative waste testing, keep
duplicate sets of records, or perform other duplicative actions to demonstrate compliance with both sets of rules.
Therefore, to be consistent with RCRA section 1006(b) to the maximum extent practicable, the EPA is coordinating
the testing, recordkeeping, reporting, and other implementation activities required under the RCRA air standards
and related rules developed under the CAA. The EPA has requested public comment in a related proposed NESHAP rulemkaing
(the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP, see 59 FR 51919, October 13, 1994) on how the applicable requirements
included in the RCRA air standards should be incorporated into CAA rules being developed by the EPA for waste and recovery
operations that will allow owners and operators subject to both sets of rules to demonstrate compliance with all applicable
rules without having to repeat the duplicative requirements.

, 976 F.2d at 23. In this case, Congress has indicated that TSDF air emissions need to be controlled on the RCRA timetable,
not that of the CAA. Deferring totally to the CAA would vitiate this key RCRA requirement. [See also RCRA section 3004(q)
and CAA section 112(n)(7) in which Congress indicated that pendency of CAA air standards for RCRA units does not vitiate
RCRA requirements.]
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA's approach to developing air standards for TSDF under RCRA is consistent with CAA programs to achieve attainment
and to maintain national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). The NAAQS specify limits to pollutant concentrations
in the ambient air to protect public health and welfare. A NAAQS has been established for ozone. Ambient ozone concentrations
in many metropolitan regions of the United States exceed the NAAQS. Organic emissions from TSDF as well as other sources
react photochemically with other chemical compounds in the atmosphere to form ozone. The CAA requires that States
develop and the EPA approve air emission control plans called ``State implementation plans'' (SIP's). For those
regions within a State that are in nonattainment with the NAAQS for ozone, the SIP specifies the standards and other
control measures to be implemented by the State to attain the NAAQS. However, the CAA requires the EPA not only to implement
programs to attain the NAAQS in nonattainment areas but also to maintain, and prevent significant deterioration
of, the air quality in those areas of the Nation currently in attainment with the NAAQS. Consequently, in addition
to the CAA control programs to address specific regional NAAQS attainment problems, the EPA also develops under the
CAA authority minimum national emission standards applicable to stationary sources independent of whether the
source is located in a NAAQS attainment or nonattainment area. The EPA considers the subpart CC standards to be reasonable
national standards needed to control emissions of air toxics as well as to attain and maintain NAAQS for ozone.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The subpart CC standards are consistent with the EPA's pollution prevention policy. Pollution prevention involves
reducing the quantity of pollution produced for a given quantity of product prior to recycling, treatment, or control
of emissions. Activities defined as source reduction measures in the Pollution Prevention Act include technology
modifications, process and procedure modifications, reformulation or redesign of products, and substitution
of raw materials. A decrease in production alone does not qualify as pollution prevention. Under the subpart CC standards,
a TSDF owner or operator is not required to manage a hazardous waste in a tank, surface impoundment, or container using
the specified air emission controls in cases when the owner or operator determines that the organic content of all
hazardous waste placed in the unit meets certain conditions specified in the rule. Thus, the subpart CC standards
encourage pollution prevention by providing an incentive to generators to initiate source reduction measures that
will reduce the concentration of organics in a hazardous waste.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The development of TSDF air standards under RCRA is not contrary to the EPA's ``cluster'' approach of examining and
coordinating regulations addressing the same emission source to minimize duplicative or contradictory requirements.
The different EPA Offices responsible for implementing RCRA and CAA requirements are coordinating the development
of this rulemaking to ensure that subpart CC standards are compatible with other rules and programs applicable to
TSDF owners and operators.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The air emission control requirements for tanks under the subpart CC standards incorporate provisions of NSPS that
were promulgated under the authority of the CAA and apply to storage tanks constructed or modified after July 23, 1984,
that contain volatile organic liquids (40 CFR part 60, subpart Kb). Therefore, air emission controls already in use
on a TSDF tank in compliance with 40 CFR part 60, subpart Kb will comply with air emission control requirements of the
subpart CC standards. Also, the subpart CC standards for closed-vent systems and control devices cross reference
the requirements for closed-vent systems and control devices promulgated under subpart AA in 40 CFR parts 264 and
265. The subpart AA requirements are consistent with the requirements for closed-vent systems and control devices
under several CAA air standards.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The implementation of air standards under RCRA does not create difficulties in administration and enforcement of
the rules by State regulatory agencies. Although many existing RCRA standards focus on preventing the contamination
of soil and water, other existing RCRA regulations regulate air emissions from some TSDF sources (e.g., combustion
of hazardous waste is regulated under 40 CFR part 264, subpart O for hazardous waste incinerators and under 40 CFR part
266 subpart H for boilers and industrial furnaces). Air emissions are also sometimes addressed through the EPA's
omnibus permitting authority under RCRA section 3005(c)(3). States authorized by the EPA administer and enforce
the requirements of RCRA rules in lieu of the EPA administering the rules in that State. The EPA is aware that, in many
States, one State agency administers air standards while another State agency administers rules regulating the
management of hazardous waste in the State. Similarly, it is common for yet another State agency to administer water
quality rules. The experience of authorized States administrating existing RCRA rules shows that responsibility
for administrating these rules can be delegated to a separate State agency without impeding the administration and
enforcement of non-RCRA air and water rules by other State agencies.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The commenter on the Notice of Data Availability (NDA) (57 FR 43171, September 18, 1992) supports the EPA's use of the
updated waste data base for the national impacts analysis and the EPA's changes to the emission models for biological
treatment processes. In addition, the commenter agrees with the EPA's conclusion that many surface impoundments
reported in the waste data base to be managing waste at TSDF have been or are being replaced with tanks to comply with
the RCRA land disposal restriction and other regulations. However, the commenter believes that the EPA's assumption
that 75 percent of the total waste quantity reported in the waste data base to be managed in surface impoundments is
now managed in tanks is too low. The commenter agrees with the EPA's revised approach in the impact analysis of using
site-specific cancer risk factors to estimate cancer risk due to exposure to TSDF emissions. However, the commenter
states that some of the specific assumptions made by the EPA for the risk analysis are implausible (e.g., assuming
exposure of the individual for 70 years) and the analysis should be conducted in accordance with the EPA's own Exposure
Assessment Guidelines. Finally, the commenter does not believe that any MIR estimate is necessary to assess the need
for and effectiveness of the rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the national impacts analysis, the EPA believes that 75 percent is a reasonable assumption for the amount of waste
that is converted from surface impoundment to tank management. As discussed further in the BID for the final rule,
the EPA selected the 75 percent value based on information obtained by the EPA from a telephone survey of owners and
operators of large TSDF and from TSDF site visits as well as information provided to the EPA by several TSDF owners and
operators in comments on the proposed rule. The EPA did not find nor receive any additional information from the commenter
that justifies increasing the percentage of waste converted from surface impoundment to tank management.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The cancer risk impact analysis for this rulemaking was conducted in accordance with the EPA's Exposure Assessment
Guidelines. With regard to the 70 year lifetime assumption used in the impact analysis, the EPA believes 70 years to
be conservative, but plausible. The EPA did however conduct a second risk assessment assuming a 33 year exposure scenario
(95 percentile). Using this assumption reduced risk estimates by one-half, but did not change the decision to control
these facilities, nor the choice of control options. Furthermore, the risk assessment conducted here was for the
purpose of determining relative differences in risk estimates between the control options. For this application,
the exposure scenario would not matter; the results, i.e., the relative differences in risk estimates, would not
change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA holds that the assumptions used to determine the MIR are, as with the 70 year exposure scenario, conservative,
but plausible, and result in a reasonable overall estimate of risk. In addition, while the EPA acknowledges the uncertainties
associated with the MIR, such uncertainties cancel out when the risk assessment is used to discern relative risk,
as in this case. Thus the EPA believes that the use of the MIR is an appropriate tool to apply in the impact analysis for
this rulemaking to both estimate risk and to discern differences between risk estimates associated with the various
control options.

Many commenters disagree with the EPA's decision to require air emission controls for containers under the subpart
CC standards. One group of commenters argues that the organic emission potential from TSDF containers does not warrant
the application of additional controls beyond those already required by existing RCRA standards. A second group
of commenters contends that TSDF containers should not be subject to this rulemaking because the EPA analysis does
not show organic emissions from TSDF containers to be a significant emission source warranting controls.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The EPA maintains that the management of organic-containing wastes in containers at TSDF is a potentially significant
source of organic emissions that is not adequately regulated by existing regulations. Control requirements for
containers under the subpart CC standards are needed to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Ensure that containers used for storage of organic-containing waste use covers effective for organic emission
control;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Control organic emissions from treatment of organic-containing wastes in containers by waste stabilization
and other processes; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Prevent circumvention of the containment and control strategy that serves as a key component of the integrated
approach to implementing RCRA section 3004(n).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA disagrees with the commenters' conclusion that existing regulations are sufficient to control organic emissions
from containers used to manage hazardous waste at TSDF. Existing RCRA regulations under 40 CFR 264.173 require containers
used to store hazardous waste at TSDF to be closed except when necessary to add or remove waste. This requirement for
closed containers during storage does not specify organic air emission controls for these covers. Furthermore,
no RCRA requirements exist that address organic emissions associated with other container operations such as hazardous
waste transfer or treatment in open containers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA also disagrees with the commenters' conclusion that managing hazardous wastes in containers is not a significant
potential source of organic air emissions. The baseline analysis to estimate nationwide TSDF organic emissions
by waste management category is not the only factor that the EPA considered in assessing the organic emission potential
of containers. The revised nationwide baseline emissions from storage of hazardous waste in TSDF containers is estimated
to be approximately 5,000 Mg/yr. However, this emission estimate for containers does not include organic emissions
from hazardous waste treatment in containers. As described in the BID for the final rule, the EPA estimates the total
organic emissions from waste fixation operations performed in containers to be approximately 11,000 Mg/yr. Information
obtained by the EPA representatives during site visits to TSDF conducting waste fixation operations indicates that
use of containers for waste fixation continues to be a common industry practice. Thus, treatment of hazardous waste
in containers is a large potential source of organic emissions that is not regulated by the existing RCRA regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The air emission control requirements for the subpart CC standards are based on applying a containment and control
strategy to TSDF tanks, surface impoundments, and containers from generation of the waste through treatment of the
waste to remove or destroy the organics in the waste. Requiring control of only TSDF tanks and surface impoundments
but not containers creates a significant potential organic emission source if large quantities of hazardous waste
currently stored or treated in tanks required to use air emission controls under subpart CC standards are transferred
to containers not using air emission controls. This would allow organics in the hazardous waste managed in uncontrolled
containers to escape to the atmosphere prior to treatment and, thus, reduce the effectiveness of the containment
and control approach.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Many commenters disagree with the EPA's decision to apply the proposed air standards to 90-day tanks and containers
for the following reasons:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The EPA is not authorized under RCRA section 3004(n), or under other provision, to extend the air standards to 90-day
tanks and containers;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The proposed rule failed to cite authority to extend the requirements to 90-day tanks and containers, in violation
of section 553(b)(2) of the Administrative Procedures Act;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If the EPA imposes air emission controls on generators, this must be accomplished pursuant to the pre-HSWA authorization
process and thus should not become effective in authorized States until enacted and implemented as State law; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Application of air emission control requirements to 90-day tanks and containers impermissibly interferes with
manufacturing processes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The EPA disagrees with each of these comments. The provisions of 40 CFR 262.34 (promulgated under the authority of
RCRA section 2002, 3001&hyph;3005, and 3007) allow generators to accumulate hazardous waste in tanks and containers
for specified time periods without obtaining RCRA permits, provided the generator meets certain conditions. Amending
these conditions is a valid exercise of the EPA's authority under RCRA section 3004(n).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The intent of including the provisions of 40 CFR 262.34 in the RCRA requirements for hazardous waste generators is
to obtain a reasonable balance between the Congress's desire not to interfere with the generator's manufacturing
or production processes with the need to provide adequate protection of human health and the environment (45 FR 12730,
February 26, 1980). Thus, 40 CFR 262.34 does not provide a hazardous waste generator with a complete exemption from
all RCRA requirements. On the contrary, it incorporates most of the relevant tank and container requirements under
40 CFR part 265 and requires compliance with these standards as a condition for maintaining RCRA permit-exempt status
[refer to 40 CFR 262.34(a)(1)]. The intent of these provisions is not to exclude 90-day tanks and containers from future
technical TSDF requirements. Therefore, it is wholly appropriate for the EPA to update the technical requirements
for tanks and containers that serve as the basis for the RCRA permit exemption. The EPA has already done so, for example,
when tank standards were amended in 1986.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although 90-day tanks and containers are not required to be permitted under RCRA subtitle C, the EPA rejects the commenters'
narrow reading of RCRA section 3004(n) as limiting the EPA's authority to extend the requirements to these units.
Section 3004(n) of RCRA requires the EPA to promulgate standards for the control of air emissions from ``hazardous
waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities.'' The EPA does not agree that RCRA section 3004(n) reflects a
congressional intend that the EPA regulate air emissions only from permitted and interim-status TSDF and not from
90-day tanks and containers. These tanks and containers are physically identical (i.e., the same types of tanks and
containers are used by generators to accumulate and by TSDF owners and operators to store and treat waste). There is
no environmental basis for not considering them subject to the section 3004(n) mandate. Such units are, in fact, storing
or treating hazardous waste and are subject to numerous standards promulgated under the authority of both RCRA sections
3002 and 3004. The exemption of 90-day tanks and containers from the permitting requirements of RCRA subtitle C is
regulatory, not statutory; there is no directive in the RCRA legislation that precludes the EPA from imposing any
or all of the TSDF requirements on them. The use of the term ``facility'' in RCRA section 3004(n) can certainly be read
to encompass 90-day tanks and containers, given the EPA's flexibility to construe that term (see

standards for tanks and containers and pose precisely the same potential environmental risks as other tanks and containers
holding hazardous waste. In addition, the EPA sees to reason that Congress intended 90-day tanks and containers to
be subject to air emission controls at a different time than other tanks and containers (which would be the case if the
90-day units are not regulated pursuant to a HSWA provision).

Therefore, it is proper for the EPA to use its authority under RCRA section 3004(n) to amend 40 CFR 262.34(a) by adding
air emission control requirements to the conditions required for a 90-day tank or container to be exempted from the
RCRA permitting requirements. For these reasons, the EPA rejects the commenters' arguments that the Agency is not
authorized or failed to cite authority to use this rulemaking to amend the exemption requirements for 90-day tanks
and containers. In addition, the EPA rejects the argument that the exemption requirements are under the EPA's pre-HSWA
authority and, therefore, are not applicable in authorized States until the individual States are authorized to
implement the rule (See 51 FR 25464, July 14, 1986, where the EPA indicated that the modifications to 40 CFR 262.34,
to reflect amended tank standards, were HSWA rules).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a variation of the argument that 90-day tanks and containers should not be regulated, one commenter asserts that
RCRA section 3004(n) reflects a congressional intent that the EPA regulate air emissions only from permitted and
interim-status TSDF and not from 90-day tanks and containers. The commenter apparently argues that the explicit
inclusion of such authority under RCRA section 3004(n) and not under RCRA section 3002 implies a congressional finding
that waste accumulation does not significantly contribute to air pollution. The EPA finds no indication, in the legislative
history of RCRA, or elsewhere, that Congress ever made such a finding, and the EPA's conclusion, as discussed later
in this section, is that on-site accumulation of hazardous waste in 90-day units is a significant source of organic
air emissions. Again, the EPA finds no indication that Congress intended to preclude the EPA from regulating air emissions
from nonpermitted hazardous waste storage and treatment under RCRA section 3004(n).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to RCRA section 3004(n), the EPA has authority under RCRA section 3002 to amend 40 FR 262.34(a). One commenter
states that, although RCRA section 3002(a)(3) authorizes the EPA to require the use of appropriate containers, RCRA
section 3002 provides no authority to regulate air emissions. The EPA disagrees with this statement. The RCRA section
3002(a)(3) authority, as well as the general authority under RCRA section 3002 to promulgate such rules regulating
generators ``as may be necessary to protect human health and the environment,'' is broad enough to encompass the regulation
of air emissions from units storing or treating hazardous waste at generator facilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the EPA cited both RCRA sections 3002 and 3004 as the statutory authority for the proposed rule. Therefore,
this rulemaking is in full conformance with section 553(b)(2) of the Administrative Procedures Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA also rejects the argument that the application of air emission controls to 90-day tanks and containers impermissibly
interferes with manufacturing processes. The EPA concluded in 1980, as cited above, that the appropriate balance
between protection of the environment and noninterference with manufacturing processes was achieved by requiring
90-day tanks and containers to comply with certain technical requirements as a condition of being exempt from the
requirement to have a RCRA permit. The EPA estimates that nationwide baseline organic emissions from 90-day tanks
and containers are approximately 76,000 Mg/yr. Given the significant organic emissions from 90-day tanks and containers,
the same rationale has led the EPA to require that these units comply with the appropriate air emission control requirements
of the subparts AA, BB, and CC standards to maintain an exemption from RCRA permitting. In contrast, the EPA decided
not to extend under this rulemaking the requirements of these air standards to containers used for satellite accumulation
because of the widespread use of these containers by manufacturing process operators to collect small quantities
of hazardous waste as generated, and the integrated use of these containers with the manufacturing operations (discussed
further in section 7.2 of the BID for today's rule). The EPA believes that this regulatory framework maintains the
appropriate balance between environmental protection and noninterference with manufacturing processes.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A total of 24 commenters addressed the EPA's proposed action of modifying the ``permit-as-a-shield'' practice to
require that owners and operators of TSDF that have been issued final permits prior to the effective date of this rulemaking
comply with the air standards under 40 CFR 265 subparts AA, BB, and CC until the facility's permit is reviewed or reissued
by the EPA. Four of the commenters support the EPA's proposed modification. The other 20 commenters oppose the proposed
modification and maintain that ``permit-as-a-shield'' practice should remain unchanged because any action by
the EPA to remove this practice:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Is without the legal authority and that to do so would be contrary to congressional intent;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Violates the due process rights of permittees, which are normally protected through the permit process;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Negates the purpose and importance of the RCRA permit because the ``permit-as-a-shield'' practice serves to
unify all the regulatory requirements in the permit for a TSDF;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Is contrary to previously stated policy whereby the EPA binds itself to the principle of using ``permit-as-a-shield''
(45 FR 33290, May 19, 1980); and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Is disruptive to TSDF owner and operator planning, burdensome to comply with, and has an adverse effect on the availability
and cost of control equipment.

Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The practice known as ``permit-as-a-shield'' is derived from an exercise of the EPA's regulatory authority and was
first codified in the 1980 implementing regulations of the RCRA permit program (45 FR 33290, May 19, 1980). It is not
a provision of RCRA and is therefore no part of the statutory mandate by Congress to manage the Nation's hazardous wastes.

 950 F.2d at 741, 762 (D.C. Cir. 1991). Because it is a regulatory and not a statutory provision, the EPA can modify the
``permit-as-a-shield'' practice in any situation where the Agency determines that the practice does not serve the
EPA's mandate to protect human health and the environment. For the final subpart CC standards, the EPA estimates that
baseline nationwide excess cancer incidence resulting from exposure to TSDF organic emissions is 48 cases per year.
In addition, total nationwide organic emissions from TSDF are estimated to be approximately 1 million Mg/yr and,
thus, contribute significantly to the formation of atmospheric ozone. These health and environmental impacts are
very high relative to the impacts of emissions from other sources regulated under RCRA and the CAA. Accordingly, the
EPA has determined that the health and environmental impacts resulting from organic air emissions from TSDF are of
a magnitude to warrant narrowly rescinding the ``permit-as-a-shield'' practice for this limited case.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ``permit-as-a-shield'' practice is not a consequence of Constitutional or statutory obligations of the EPA
to any individual and its removal does not violate any substantive or procedural due process rights of individuals.
The ``permit-as-a-shield'' practice was established by regulations promulgated by the EPA and therefore can be
modified when the EPA determines it is necessary to do so for the protection of human health and the environment. Numerous
government regulations have a direct effect on regulated entities, and the EPA's ``permit-as-a-shield'' practice
does not vest the regulated community with a right to a variance from all new RCRA regulations. Furthermore, the proposal
put the public on notice that the EPA was planning to modify the ``permit-as-a-shield'' practice in this rule, and
the public has therefore had an opportunity for meaningful comment on the issue.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA continues to believe that the permit process and requirements are fundamental components of the RCRA program
and that, by and large, compliance with the permits should constitute compliance with the RCRA program. For the other
rulemakings for which the EPA rescinded the ``permit-as-a-shield'' practice, the EPA determined that the risk to
human health and the environment was too high to allow the practice to continue (for remaining permit periods), and
required that all TSDF comply with the new requirements regardless of their permit status. The EPA has determined
that allowing owners and operators of permitted TSDF to be shielded from compliance with the regulatory requirements
of subparts AA, BB, and CC standards will allow excessively high risks. Today's action by the EPA does not negate the
value of the RCRA permit program or the ``permit-as-a-shield'' practice. Instead, the EPA is making a distinction
between a provision that is sufficiently protective in most cases and one that, under specific situations, is not
sufficiently protective.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA disagrees with the commenters' claims that the permit modification process can adequately accommodate the
timely implementation of the subpart CC standards. For the EPA to apply the subpart CC standards into permits by way
of modifications would require a significant and unreasonable resource commitment. Furthermore, the fact that
existing permits can be modified to incorporate new regulatory requirements [per 40 CFR 270.41(a)(3), which implements
RCRA section 3005(c)(3)] shows that ``permit-as-a-shield'' is hardly an inviolate principle. The ruelmaking simply
accomplishes nationally what a modification would accomplish individually. Accordingly, the EPA developed the
subpart AA, BB, and CC standards to be ``self-implementing'' so that State and Regional permit writers will not be
required to reopen and rewrite permits to incorporate the provisions. Permitted facilities will be able to comply
directly with the regulatory standards in the same way that interim-status facilities must comply. Modifying ``permit-as-a
shield'' for these rules eliminates any confusion or ambiguity as to which TSDF is subject to the requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted by the commenters, the EPA stated a policy for ``permit-as-a-shield'' in the so-called consolidated permit
regulations issued in 1980 (45 FR 33290). However, this does not mean that the policy for ``permit-as-a-shield''
can never be amended. The EPA has never agreed to ``bind'' itself to any particular policy or provision. Instead, the
EPA may adhere to a general practice or policy with the understanding that, if the circumstances warrant and the EPA
provides a rational explanation, it can modify or rescind a particular provision. It should be noted, for example,
that Congress has since amended RCRA to require that air emissions from TSDF be controlled, and in the same amendments
provide that the EPA may reopen permits to add conditions reflecting new control practices and to redress potential
risks posed by the facility (RCRA section 3005(c)(3) and S. Rep. No. 284, 98th Cong. 1st Sess. at 31). Here, the EPA is
determining that there are excessively high risks from these facilities, and therefore that these more protective
provisions should become effective immediately.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should also be noted that the EPA does not intend to rescind ``permit-as-a-shield'' on a regular or frequent basis
for other rulemakings. As stated earlier, the EPA generally does view ``permit-as-a-shield'' as a beneficial and
legitimate part of the RCRA program and that, in most cases, it will apply.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA believes that the commenters claiming that removing ``permit-as-a-shield'' will be disruptive to TSDF implementation
planning are greatly overstating the adverse or disruptive effects that an accelerated implementation will have
on TSDF owner and operator planning and operations because the control technologies for the different kinds of management
units are varied and widely available. The EPA specifically considered the costs and economic impacts of the various
control options in the regulatory impact analysis for the proposed rule (RCRA docket entry number F&hyph;91&hyph;CESP&hyph;S00494).
Based on this analysis, the EPA found that the costs of installing and operating air emission control equipment required
by the control options are projected to be less than 1 percent of the total cost of hazardous waste management at TSDF.
Any air emission control equipment supply availability constraints resulting from these rules should be short term,
if at all. Furthermore, TSDF owners and operators required to install air emission control equipment to comply with
the subpart CC standards are allowed up to an additional 30 months after the rule's effective date to complete the equipment
design and installation if they can document that the air emission controls cannot be installed and operating by the
effective date, for reasons such as the unavailability of control equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, the EPA expects that many TSDF owners and operators will choose to treat their hazardous waste earlier in the
management sequence that they now do to reduce the organic content of the waste in accordance with one of the treatment
requirements allowed for in the final subpart CC standards, and thus avoid the cost of installing and operating the
control equipment on the downstream tanks, surface impoundments, and containers. The EPA also encourages the use
of pollution prevention techniques as a means of reducing the quantity of waste generated, the organic concentration
of the waste, or the toxicity of constituents in the waste.

F. Waste Stabilization in Tanks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Just prior to the long-scheduled and publicly-known promulgation date, representatives from the hazardous waste
treatment industry notified the EPA of their opinion that the draft requirements for waste stabilization operations
performed in tanks are economically and technically infeasible. These draft requirements are included in a May 19,
1994 interim review draft of the final rule, made publicly available in June 1994. (See RCRA docket entry number F&hyph;94&hyph;CESP&hyph;S00509.)
Moreover, the industry indicated that volatilization of organic constituents during stabilization operations
are negligible. No data were submitted to the EPA in support of these assertions. Industry representatives nevertheless
feel strongly that for the majority of waste streams treated by stabilization, the organic constituents in the waste
are not volatilized during the stabilization process. Additionally, they allege that for these same stabilization
operations: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) It is technically infeasible to comply with the air emission control requirements for tanks in the subpart CC standards;
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) It is not feasible to treat organic waste prior to stabilization such that the volatile organic concentration
of the waste entering the stabilization process would be below 100 ppmw, and the downstream units managing the waste
(including the stabilization tanks) would thereby be exempt from subpart CC tank control requirements. (See RCRA
docket number F&hyph;94&hyph;CESF&hyph;FFFFF.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These statements contradict the conclusions drawn by the EPA based on site visits to observe hazardous waste stabilization
processes, and experiments and studies conducted by the EPA to characterize waste stabilization processes and estimate
associated organic emissions. The most recent EPA studies were mentioned in the Notice of Data Availability (see
57 FR 43171, September 18, 1992) and were made available for public review and comment in the docket for this rulemaking
(see RCRA docket number F&hyph;92&hyph;CESA&hyph;FFFFF). No comments were received concerning the validity of
these stabilization study conclusions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the same time, however, and despite the inappropriate timing of industry's comments on this issue (compounded
by the industry's failure to comment on the information presented by the Notice of Data Availability), the EPA has
determined that it may be worthwhile to review pertinent data for current waste stabilization activities at hazardous
waste TSDF. Industry has pledged to provide detailed data from an emissions test conducted to measure organic emissions
from a full-scale stabilization operation treating hazardous waste streams. The test will be conducted using the
EPA approved sampling and analytical methods, and the volatile organic concentration of the waste streams will be
measured using Method 25D, with gas chromatography and with mass spectrometry (see RCRA docket number F&hyph;94&hyph;CESF&hyph;FFFFF).
The EPA will accept until September 6, 1995 all pertinent information and comments on the following limited issues:
(1) Volatilization of organics during waste stabilization activities, (2) feasibility of treating organic wastes
to destroy or remove organics prior to stabilization to immobilize toxic metals, and (3) alternative organic emission
controls applicable to stabilization tanks. Persons interested in submitting comments or data pertaining to these
issues should notify the EPA of their intent by contacting Ms. Michele Aston at the address listed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 section at the beginning of this preamble. Written information and comments regarding the above issues should be
mailed to the RCRA Docket Office (5305), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, room 2616, 401 M Street SW., Washington,
DC 20460. Please send an original and two copies of all information, and refer to RCRA docket number F&hyph;94&hyph;CESA&hyph;FFFFF.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA will assess all submitted information, and will make a rapid determination whether to amend the requirements
under the subpart CC standards being promulgated today for tanks in which waste stabilization operations are performed.
The EPA emphasizes that the current record does not support any amendment to these standards. However, if the EPA were
to amend the requirements for stabilization tanks, the amendment could include any of the provisions described below,
a modification of today's promulgated requirements, or possibly other options.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA may choose to amend the final subpart CC tank standards such that stabilization tanks could comply with alternative
air emission controls to those included in today's promulgation. The EPA will determine the appropriateness of such
an amendment based on the evaluation of:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Information that is submitted relating to industry's comments that it is not feasible to comply with the technical
requirements of today's final rule or to pretreat waste prior to stabilization; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Information related to alternative emission controls that could be applied to stabilization tanks for effective
organic emission reduction; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Data related to the specific characteristics of hazardous waste that is stabilized at TSDF;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Detailed information regarding the stabilization processes performed in TSDF tanks; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Other related information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For a given stabilization tank to qualify for certain compliance options, the EPA could require the facility owner
or operator to demonstrate (through specified testing, monitoring, sampling, or other means) that organic constituents
are not volatilized during the hazardous waste stabilization operations performed in that tank. A similar requirement
for biological treatment performed in tanks and surface impoundments is included in the final subpart CC standards
(for example see 40 CFR 264.1085(a)(2)) as well as other air standards developed by the EPA under the Clean Air Act (e.g.,
the Hazardous Organic NESHAP (59 FR 19402, April 22, 1994) and the proposed Off-Site Waste and Recovery Operations
NESHAP (59 FR 51919, October 13, 1994)). For biological treatment processes, which are generally acknowledged by
the EPA as appropriate treatment for organic constituents in waste with respect to controlling organic emissions,
the EPA considers such a demonstration to be a reasonable requirement for certain compliance options. Therefore,
the EPA also could consider it reasonable to require that stabilization operations, which the EPA does not consider
appropriate treatment for organic constituents in waste with respect to controlling organic emissions, perform
at least an equivalent demonstration for certain compliance options. If the EPA were to amend today's promulgated
subpart CC tank standards to include such a demonstration, the required procedure could include any of the following,
or possibly other procedures: whole waste analyses, full-scale analyses, specified emissions monitoring, material
balance calculations, temperature monitoring, and water content information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of this supplemental comment opportunity, the EPA considers it appropriate to extend the effective date
of the final rules for tanks that could be affected if the EPA chooses to modify the standards. Therefore, a separate
compliance schedule is applicable to tanks in which waste stabilization activities are performed as of December
6, 1994. It is important to note that all applicable requirements with respect to other units at a facility subject
to the subpart CC standards will be effective June 5, 1995. For these stabilization tanks, the effective date of the
final rules will be December 6, 1995. As of the extended effective date for stabilization tanks, each TSDF owner or
operator and each hazardous waste generator subject to the final rules must either install and operate the specified
air emission control requirements on all affected tanks used for stabilization, or begin performing the specified
waste determinations and recordkeeping to indicate that a stabilization tank is exempted from these requirements.
Under circumstances where required air emission control equipment cannot be operational by December 6, 1995, an
implementation schedule for installation of the required air emission controls must be developed and placed in the
facility operating records no later than December 6, 1995. In such cases, the facility must have all air emission controls
required by the final rules in operation no later than June 8, 1998.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Today's action by the EPA promulgates air emission standards for TSDF tanks, surface impoundments, and containers
as a new subpart CC in both 40 CFR parts 264 and 265. Subpart CC under 40 CFR part 265 establishes standards for owners
and operators of interim-status TSDF. As discussed in section VIII.A of this preamble, owners and operators of permitted
TSDF that have been issued final permits prior to June 5, 1995, are required to comply with subpart CC under 40 CFR part
265 until the facility's permit is reviewed or reissued by the EPA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The air emission control requirements of the final subpart CC standards in 40 CFR part 264 and 40 CFR part 265 are identical
with the exception of the reporting requirements. There are no reporting requirements in subpart CC under 40 CFR part
265.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a. General applicability.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In general, the subpart CC standards apply to RCRA-permitted tanks, surface impoundments, and containers subject
to 40 CFR part 264, subparts J, K, or I, respectively, as well as to interim-status TSDF tanks, surface impoundments,
and containers subject to 40 CFR part 265, subparts J, K, or I, respectively. However, certain specific types of TSDF
tanks, surface impoundments, and containers are not subject to the subpart CC standards under applicability provisions
in other RCRA regulations as well as provisions included specifically in the subpart CC standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The subpart CC standards do not apply to those TSDF tanks, surface impoundments, or containers excluded from regulation
under 40 CFR 264.1. For example, TSDF owners and operators are not required to obtain a RCRA permit for tanks or tank
systems that manage hazardous wastewaters or wastewater treatment sludges and are subject to regulation under either
section 402 or 307(b) of the Clean Water Act [refer to 40 CFR 264.1(g)(6) and 40 CFR 265.1(c)(10)]. Because these tanks
are exempted from RCRA permitting requirements, they are not subject to the requirements of 40 CFR parts 264 and 265.
Thus, the subpart CC standards do not apply to a TSDF tank that is considered to be a part of a ``wastewater treatment
unit'' as defined in 40 CFR 260.10. Similarly, the subpart CC standards do not apply to TSDF tanks, surface impoundments,
or containers when these units are used for emergency or spill management activities in accordance with 40 CFR 264.1(g)(8)(i)
or 40 CFR 265.1(c)(11)(i).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b. Exemptions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The subpart CC standards are only applicable to containers with a design capacity greater than or equal to 0.1 m3 (approximately
26 gallons). This means that any container that has a design capacity less than 0.1 m3 is not subject to the subpart CC
standards regardless of the volatile organic concentration of the hazardous waste placed in the container.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The subpart CC standards apply only to TSDF tanks, surface impoundments, and containers in which an owner or operator
places hazardous waste on or after June 5, 1995. With respect to surface impoundments, the EPA has already explained
that RCRA regulations do not apply to impoundments at which there is no active management of hazardous waste after
the rule's effective date (see 55 FR 39410, September 27, 1990). This would include impoundments that cease operation
before the rule's effective date, and impoundments that convert to non-hazardous waste impoundments before the
effective date. This latter class of impoundments includes those impoundments that contain hazardous wastes deposited
before the rule's effective date for which the impoundment is the final disposal site for hazardous waste already
in the unit (i.e., the impoundment is a disposal unit) and hazardous wastes are not actively managed in the impoundment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Id.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The principle in today's rule is consistent with this existing interpretation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rationale for not applying the subpart CC standards to tanks and containers that do not receive hazardous waste
after the effective date is somewhat different. Under the subpart CC standards, the need to apply air emission controls
to a particular tank or container is determined by the organic content of the hazardous waste at a point prior to being
placed in the tank or container (this is discussed in the following section under ``General Standards''). In many
situations where existing tanks and containers at a TSDF already hold hazardous waste but no longer receive new wastes,
a TSDF owner or operator will be unable to perform a waste determination as specified in the rule because waste samples
cannot be collected at the required locations and the owner or operator has insufficient knowledge about the waste.
Furthermore, even if a waste determination can be performed for these tanks or containers but the units presently
are uncovered or have other openings, most if not all of the volatile organics in the waste have most likely already
been emitted to the atmosphere. Thus, the EPA decided that air emission control requirements should only apply to
those tanks and containers in which hazardous waste is placed on or after the effective date of the rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA decided not to apply the subpart CC standards to a tank once an owner or operator stops adding hazardous waste
to the unit and begins closure pursuant to an approved closure plan because in many cases, use of the required air emission
controls would hinder or prevent closure activities from being performed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The EPA has further decided to temporarily defer application of the subpart CC standards to tanks, containers, and
surface impoundments which are being used on-site to treat or store hazardous wastes containing organics generated
from remedial activities required under RCRA corrective action or CERCLA response authorities, or similar State
remediation authorities, provided that the wastes are managed in units that do not also manage other hazardous wastes.
This deferral applies only to on-site management of such wastes. For remediation waste transported off-site, the
point of waste origination will be the point at which the wastes are physically moved outside the facility boundary
(or for CERCLA response actions, outside the site boundary).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As the D.C. Circuit recently explained, a temporary deferral such as today's is permissible if the Agency legitimately
needs further time to ascertain the best means of integrating concurrent statutory and regulatory schemes to avoid
potential interference with the objectives of both schemes, and where Congress has not expressly forbidden a temporary
deferral.

of RCRA for purposes of administration and enforcement, and to avoid duplication to the maximum extent practicable
in doing so.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This situation is presented here. Control of air emissions from units at remediation sites implicates the overlapping
and potentially competing concerns of RCRA section 3004(n) and the complex statutory provisions under RCRA, CERCLA,
and State laws relating to remediation. The EPA's primary goal in this rulemaking has been to develop air emission
standards for tanks, containers, and surface impoundments holding as-generated hazardous wastes containing organics.
At proposal, the EPA thus did not fully consider the issue of whether different standards should appropriately apply
to wastes that are generated and managed as the result of remedial activities, or how the proposed rule for air emissions
could best be integrated with the remediation authorities of RCRA and other Federal or State laws. 56 FR at 33497&hyph;98
(July 22, 1991).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters on the proposed subpart CC regulations pointed out that these were important issues deserving careful
attention. The EPA agrees. It is possible that certain provisions of the air emission requirements promulgated today
may be inappropriate or unnecessarily restrictive if applied to remediation activities (see 58 FR 8660, February
16, 1993).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA notes that some measure of control of air emissions from remediation tanks, containers, and impoundments
will be assured during the deferral period. Remediation authorities of RCRA and CERCLA and similar State authorities
allow overseeing officials to impose, on a site-specific basis, appropriate air emission controls on these types
of units, as well as on other waste management units and handling operations. In addition, hazardous wastes containing
organics that are managed off-site (i.e., outside a RCRA facility's boundary, or outside a CERCLA site) would be subject
to the subpart CC management standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the EPA emphasizes that the deferral is indeed temporary. The issue of appropriate air emission controls
for remediation units is likely to be addressed in the context of the Hazardous Waste Identification Rules which are
currently being developed by the EPA. The issue is also potentially part of the third phase of the RCRA section 3004(n)
implementation. In addition, waste remediation sites are on the initial list of source categories under CAA section
112, and the EPA currently is scheduled to issue technology-based standards to control emissions of hazardous air
pollutants from this source (see 57 FR 31576, July 16, 1992). Consequently, the EPA will be addressing this issue in
the reasonably near future.

d. Radioactive mixed wastes.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As explained in section IV.F of this preamble, the management of radioactive mixed waste at TSDF is subject to regulation
under subtitle C of RCRA. The EPA reviewed the special nature of radioactive mixed wastes with respect to the air emission
control requirements under the final subpart CC standards. In certain cases, the air emission controls used as the
basis for the subpart CC standards are not compatible with the NRC requirements for safe handling of radioactive mixed
wastes. For example, drums used to store radioactive mixed waste cannot be sealed with vapor leak-tight covers because
of unacceptable pressure buildup of hydrogen gas to levels that can potentially cause rupture of the drum or create
a potentially serious explosion hazard. This generation of hydrogen gas results from the radiolytic decomposition
of organic materials (e.g., plastics) or aqueous solutions stored in the drums. Consequently, a drum used for storage
of radioactive mixed wastes must be continuously vented through special filters in accordance with technical guidance
issued by the NRC to prevent the hydrogen concentration in the drum from reaching dangerous levels. The EPA is planning
to further investigate methods for effective control of organic emissions from waste management units handling
radioactive mixed waste that are consistent with the NRC waste management practices.

2. General Standards
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final subpart CC standards require that TSDF owners and operators install and operate air emission controls on
each tank, surface impoundment, and container subject to the rules except when all of the hazardous waste placed in
the unit is determined to meet certain conditions. These conditions are based on properties of the hazardous waste
determined at either one of two locations:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The point where a hazardous waste is generated or the point where the waste is received by an off-site facility;
or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The point following treatment of a hazardous waste to remove or destroy the organics in the waste.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a. Point of waste origination.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under the final subpart CC standards, a TSDF owner or operator is exempted from managing a hazardous waste in a tank,
surface impoundment, or container in accordance with the air emission control requirements of the rule when the owner
or operator determines that all hazardous waste placed in the unit has an average volatile organic concentration
at the point of waste origination less than 100 ppmw. The point of waste origination is defined in the rule with respect
to the point where the TSDF owner or operator first has possession of a hazardous waste. When the TSDF owner or operator
is the generator of the hazardous waste, the point of waste origination means the point where a solid waste produced
by a system, process, or waste management unit is determined to be a hazardous waste as defined in 40 CFR part 261. As
previously stated, the term ``point of waste origination'' applied to this situation is being used in a similar manner
to the use of the term ``point of generation'' in waste operations air standards established under authority of the
Clean Air Act in 40 CFR parts 60, 61, and 63 of this chapter. When neither the TSDF owner nor operator is the generator
of the hazardous waste, point of waste origination means the point where the owner or operator accepts delivery or
takes possession of the hazardous waste.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b. Treated Hazardous Waste.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If a hazardous waste has an average volatile organic concentration equal to or greater than 100 ppmw based on the hazardous
waste composition at the point of waste origination, then this waste is required under the subpart CC standards to
be managed in accordance with the air emission control requirements of the rule. Under these requirements, specific
air emission controls must be installed and operated on every tank, surface impoundment, and container subject to
the rule used in the waste management sequence from the point of waste origination through the point where the organics
in the waste are removed or destroyed by a process that meets or exceeds a minimum level of performance specified in
the rule. In other words, once a hazardous waste is treated to remove or destroy the organics in the waste in accordance
with the rule requirements, the subsequent downstream tanks, surface impoundments, and containers used to manage
this particular hazardous waste are not required to meet the air emission control requirements of the subpart CC standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final subpart CC standards provide TSDF owners and operators with several alternative provisions for determining
when a treated hazardous waste is no longer required to be managed in tanks, surface impoundments, and containers
meeting the air emission control requirements of the rule. Treated hazardous waste provisions are specified in the
subpart CC standards for the following processes:

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) An organic destruction, biological degradation, or organic removal process that reduces the organic content
of the hazardous waste and is designed and operated in accordance with certain conditions specified in the rule;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A hazardous waste incinerator that is designed and operated in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 264 subpart
O or 40 CFR 265 subpart O; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A boiler or industrial furnace that is subject to the requirements of 40 CFR part 266 subpart H.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A process that simply mixes, blends, combines, or aggregates a hazardous waste stream with other materials does not
destroy the organics in the waste stream or remove the organics from the waste stream. While diluting a hazardous waste
stream having a volatile organic concentration greater than 100 ppmw with sufficient quantities of other hazardous
waste streams having a volatile organic concentration less than 100 ppmw (or water or other low organic content materials)
would reduce the volatile organic concentration of the resulting hazardous waste mixture to a level below 100 ppmw,
the total mass quantity of organics in the waste does not change since no organics were removed or destroyed from the
waste. The potential for organic emissions from handling the waste mixture is essentially the same as for the individual
hazardous waste streams prior to being mixed. Therefore, the EPA does not allow dilution of a hazardous waste as a means
for complying with the requirements specified in the subpart CC standards for placing treated hazardous waste in
affected tanks, surface impoundments, or containers not using the required air emission controls. Consequently,
when a hazardous waste is treated by an organic destruction or removal process and the hazardous waste has been mixed
or aggregated together with other hazardous wastes or materials with a volatile organic concentration less than
100 ppmw prior to the point of waste treatment, the subpart CC standards require that TSDF owners and operators meet
special requirements to ensure that organics in the hazardous waste have actually been removed or destroyed. An owner
or operator can choose from several alternative provisions to comply with these requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One provision requires that mixed hazardous wastes be treated by an organic destruction or removal process that reduces
the volatile organic concentration of the hazardous waste to meet a site-specific treatment process exit concentration
limit. This limit is determined by the TSDF owner or operator on a case-by-case basis using an equation specified in
the rule that accounts for the portion of the reduction in the volatile organic concentration in the resulting treated
hazardous waste stream due to dilution. To use this equation, the owner or operator must first determine the volatile
organic concentration at the point of waste origination for each individual hazardous waste stream that is mixed
together prior to entering the treatment process. As an alternative to calculating the exit concentration limit
for a treatment process, the subpart CC standards allow the owner or operator to treat the mixed hazardous wastes to
a volatile organic concentration level that is less than or equal to the lowest waste volatile organic concentration
at the point of waste origination for all of the individual hazardous waste streams mixed together prior to entering
the treatment process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another alternative in the subpart CC standards available to owners and operators allows mixed hazardous wastes
to be treated using a single process that achieves an organic reduction efficiency of 95 percent or greater on a mass
basis, and reduces the average volatile organic concentration of the resulting hazardous waste stream exiting the
process to a level less than 50 ppmw. This alternative does not require the owner or operator to perform any volatile
organic concentration waste determinations for the hazardous wastes prior to mixing, yet still accommodates the
mixing of wastes that have different volatile organic concentrations. For a waste stream having a volatile organic
concentration greater than 2,000 ppmw, requiring only a minimum 95 percent reduction of the organic content in the
waste stream would not lower the volatile organic concentration of the treated waste stream to the 100 ppmw level of
the rule. However, if such a waste stream had been mixed together prior to treatment with other waste streams having
lower volatile organic concentrations, then the volatile organic concentration of the treated waste exiting the
process could be less than 100 ppmw. The EPA does not consider such situations to be unlikely, and has therefore chosen
for this alternative to require an exit concentration for the treated waste lower than 100 ppmw. The EPA considers
an exit concentration of 50 ppmw, combined with a 95 percent treatment efficiency, to be an appropriate demonstration
that the reduction in volatile organic concentration for a mixture of hazardous waste streams has been achieved through
destruction or removal of organic constituents in the waste, rather than by dilution.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final subpart CC standards also provide another alternative that does not require the owner or operator to perform
any volatile organic concentration waste determinations for the hazardous wastes prior to mixing when the waste
is treated by a biological process that destroys or degrades the organics contained in the hazardous waste to meet
certain performance requirements specified in the rule. These conditions are either of the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Achieve an organic reduction efficiency for the biological treatment process equal to or greater than 95 percent,
and achieve an organic biodegradation efficiency for the process equal to or greater than 95 percent; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Achieve a total actual organic mass biodegradation rate for all hazardous waste treated by the process equal to
or greater than the required organic mass removal rate for the process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compliance with these parameters is determined using the procedures specified in rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA may at any time measure or request that the owner or operator measure using Method 25D the volatile organic concentration
of a hazardous waste that is placed in a tank, surface impoundment, or container not using air emission controls in
accordance with the requirements of the subpart CC standards. Measurement results showing that the volatile organic
concentration of the hazardous waste is equal to or greater than 100 ppmw constitutes noncompliance with the subpart
CC standards. However, in a case where the owner or operator has used an averaging period greater than 1 hour for determining
the volatile organic concentration of a hazardous waste, the Regional Administrator may consider information that
was used by the owner or operator to determine the average volatile organic concentration of the hazardous waste (e.g.,
test results, measurements, calculations, and other documentation) together with the results of the waste determination
in determining whether the owner or operator is in compliance with the subpart CC standards.

3. Waste Determination Procedures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A determination of the volatile organic concentration of a hazardous waste is required by the subpart CC standards
only when a hazardous waste is to be placed in a tank, surface impoundment, or container subject to the rule that does
not use air emission controls in accordance with the requirements of the rule. A TSDF owner or operator is not required
to determine the volatile organic concentration of the waste if it is placed in a tank, surface impoundment, or container
using the required air emission controls.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the hazardous waste is generated as part of a continuous process, the owner or operator is required to perform
an initial waste determination of the average volatile organic concentration of the waste stream before the first
time any portion of the material in the waste stream is placed in a waste management unit subject to the rule, and thereafter
update the information used for the waste determination at least once every 12 months following the date of the initial
waste determination. When the hazardous waste is generated as part of a batch process that is performed repeatedly
but not necessarily continuously, the owner or operator is required to perform an initial waste determination of
the average volatile organic concentration for one or more representative waste batches generated by the process
before the first time any portion of the material in the these waste batches is placed in a waste management unit subject
to the rule, and thereafter update the information used for the waste determination at least once every 12 months following
the date of the initial waste determination. For either case, the owner or operator is required to perform a new waste
determination whenever changes to the process generating the hazardous waste are reasonably likely to cause the
average volatile organic concentration to increase to a level at or above 100 ppmw. If an average volatile organic
concentration is used, an initial waste determination must be performed for each averaging period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Waste determinations should be performed for any waste that is generated as a part of an unplanned event or is generated
as a part of an event that is not included in the normal operating conditions for the source or process generating the
hazardous waste. Examples of an unplanned event include malfunctions that affect the operation of the process or
that alter the composition of the waste or product. Examples of events that are not normal operating conditions include
maintenance activities and equipment cleaning. Normal operating conditions for the source or process generating
the waste include cyclic process operations such as start-up and shutdown.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For processes that have variations in normal operating conditions such that the waste volatile organic concentration
may exceed 100 ppmw, but for which the average waste volatile organic concentration for the averaging period is below
100 ppmw, documentation must be retained in the facility operating record that specifies the following information:
(1) The maximum and minimum waste volatile organic concentration values that will occur for that averaging period;
(2) the circumstances under which a waste volatile organic concentration above 100 ppmw would occur, and; (3) the
calculations and waste determination procedures used as the basis for the determination of the average volatile
organic concentration. For a given averaging period, if there are no deviations from the operating circumstances
or from the maximum or minimum waste volatile organic concentrations specified in the operating plan, then no additional
waste determinations would be required after the initial waste determination for that averaging period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The subpart CC standards include provisions that allow a TSDF owner or operator to use either direct measurement or
knowledge of the waste to determine the volatile organic concentration of a hazardous waste. The following paragraphs
describe these two options available to the owner or operator for performing a waste determination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Direct measurement.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 When the hazardous waste is generated on a continuous basis, the averaging period to be used for determining the volatile
organic concentration on a mass-weighted average basis must be designated and recorded. This averaging period can
represent any time interval that the hazardous waste flows until such time that a new waste determination must be performed
pursuant to the requirements of the rule. However, this averaging period cannot exceed 1 year. A sufficient number
of samples, but no less than four, must be collected to represent the complete range of organic compositions and organic
quantities that occur in the hazardous waste stream during the entire averaging period due to normal variations in
the operating conditions for the source or process generating the hazardous waste.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the hazardous waste is generated as part of a batch process that is performed repeatedly but not necessarily continuously,
samples are collected from one or more representative waste batches generated by the process. The volatile organic
concentration for the waste is calculated as a mass-weighted average based on the analysis results for all of the waste
samples collected for these waste batches. A sufficient number of samples, but no less than four, must be collected
to represent the organic composition for each representative batch.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each sample of the hazardous waste is to be collected in accordance with the requirements specified in ``Test Methods
for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods,'' EPA Publication No. SW&hyph;846, third edition, November
1986, as amended by Update I, November 15, 1992. Sufficient information must be recorded to document the waste quantity
and the operating conditions for the source, process, or waste management unit generating the hazardous waste represented
by each sample collected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each of the collected waste samples is to be prepared and analyzed in accordance with the requirements of Method 25D
in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. The volatile organic concentration for a hazardous waste on a mass-weighted average
basis is then calculated by entering the analysis results for all of the collected waste samples into an equation specified
in the rule.

886 F.2d 355, 370&hyph;71 (D.C. Cir. 1989) upholding the use of generator knowledge to determine if treatment standards
are met). Information may be used that is prepared by either the facility owner or operator or by the generator of the
hazardous waste. Examples of information that could constitute acceptable knowledge include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Organic material balances for the source, process, or waste management unit generating the waste; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Documentation that lists the raw materials or intermediate products fed to a process showing that no organics
are used in the process generating the waste; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Information that shows the waste is generated by a process that is substantially similar to a process at the same
or another facility that generates a waste that has previously been determined by direct measurement to have a volatile
organic content less than the action level;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Test data that provide speciation analysis results for the waste that are still applicable to the current waste
management practices and from which the total concentration of organics in the waste can be computed; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Other knowledge based on manifests, shipping papers, or waste certification notices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When test data are used as the basis for knowledge of the waste, the owner or operator must provide documentation describing
the testing protocol and the means by which sampling variability and analytical variability are accounted for in
the determination of the volatile organic concentration of the hazardous waste. For example, an owner or operator
may use individual organic constituent concentration test data that are validated in accordance with Method 301
in appendix A to 40 CFR part 63 as the basis for knowledge of the waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Tank Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The tank standards establish the requirements for tanks using air emission controls to comply with the general standards
of the rule. No air emission controls are required under the subpart CC standards for a tank in which all hazardous waste
placed in the unit has been treated to remove or destroy organics in accordance with the requirements specified in
the general standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, the tank standards do not apply to a tank in which biological degradation of the organics in the hazardous waste
treated in the unit is demonstrated to achieve specific performance levels. Either of the following sets of conditions
must be demonstrated to qualify for this exemption: (1) The organic reduction efficiency for the process is equal
to or greater than 95 percent, and the organic biodegradation efficiency for the process is equal to or greater than
95 percent; or (2) the total actual organic mass biodegradation rate for all hazardous waste treated by the process
is equal to or greater than the required organic mass removal rate. The organic biodegradation efficiency or the organic
mass biodegradation rate for a biological treatment unit is determined by procedures specified in the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The tank standards specify that the owner or operator install and operate on each affected tank one of the following
air emission control systems: (1) A cover that is connected through a closed-vent system to a control device; (2) a
fixed-roof type cover with an internal floating roof that is designed and operated in accordance with the requirements
equivalent to the new source performance standard (NSPS) for volatile organic liquid (VOL) storage; (3) an external
floating roof that is designed and operated in accordance with the requirements equivalent to the VOL storage NSPS;
or (4) a pressure tank that is designed to operate as a closed system. Under the subpart CC standards, an owner or operator
is allowed to use a fixed-roof type cover (without any additional controls) for affected tanks under certain conditions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four conditions must be met for a particular tank before use of a fixed-roof type cover (without any additional controls)
is allowed under the subpart CC standards. First, the hazardous waste cannot be mixed, stirred, agitated, or circulated
within the tank by a process that results in splashing, frothing, or visible turbulent flow on the waste surface except
during limited circumstances. Second, the hazardous waste in the tank cannot be heated by the owner or operator except
when necessary to prevent the waste from freezing or to maintain adequate waste flow conditions for continuous normal
process operations. Third, the hazardous waste cannot be treated using a waste stabilization process or a process
that produces an exothermic reaction. Finally, the maximum organic vapor pressure of the hazardous waste in the tank
must be less than the limit established in the rule by tank design capacity. For a tank having a design capacity equal
to or greater than 151 m3 (approximately 40,000 gallons), then the maximum organic vapor pressure of the hazardous
waste in the tank must be less than 5.2 kPA. For a tank having a design capacity equal to or greater than 75 m3 (approximately
20,000 gallons) but less than 151 m3, then the maximum organic vapor pressure of the waste in the tank must be less than
27.6 kPa. For a smaller tank (design capacity less than 75 m3), the maximum organic vapor pressure must be less than
76.6 kPa. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The subpart CC standards require each cover opening not vented to a control device to be maintained in a closed, sealed
position except at those times when a specific opening must be used to add, remove, inspect, or sample the waste in the
tank or when it is necessary to use the opening to inspect, maintain, or repair equipment located inside the tank. Also,
safety devices that vent directly to the atmosphere may be used on the tank, cover, closed-vent system, or control
device provided that the safety device is not used for planned or routine venting of organic vapors. These safety devices
are to remain in a closed position except when an unplanned event requires that the device be open for the purpose of
preventing physical damage or permanent deformation of the tank, cover, closed-vent system, or control device in
accordance with good engineering and safety practices for handling flammable, combustible, explosive, or other
hazardous materials. An example of an unplanned event is a sudden power outage.

5. Surface Impoundment Standards
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The surface impoundment standards establish the requirements for surface impoundments using air emission controls
to comply with the general standards of the rule. No air emission controls are required under the subpart CC standards
for a surface impoundment in which all hazardous waste placed in the unit has been treated to remove or destroy organics
in accordance with the requirements specified in the general standards. Also, air emission controls are not required
for a surface impoundment in which biological treatment of a hazardous waste is performed under the same conditions
specified in the rule for tanks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The surface impoundment standards specify that the owner or operator install and operate on each affected surface
impoundment a cover (e.g., air-supported structure) that is connected through a closed-vent system to a control
device. Under the subpart CC standards, an owner or operator is allowed to use a floating membrane cover (without any
additional controls) for affected surface impoundments under certain conditions specified in the rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirements under the subpart CC standards for surface impoundment air emission control equipment are consistent
with the requirements for tanks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Container Standards
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The container standards establish the requirements for affected containers (containers with a design capacity
greater than or equal to 0.1 m3) using air emission controls to comply with the general standards of the rule. No air
emission controls are required by the subpart CC standards for any container with a design capacity less than 0.1 m3
regardless of the volatile organic concentration of the hazardous waste placed in the container.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For affected containers used for storage, treatment, or handling of hazardous waste, the owner or operator is required
to use either: (1) A container that is equipped with a vapor leak-tight cover; (2) a container having a design capacity
less than or equal to 0.46 m3 (approximately 119 gallons) that is equipped with a cover and complies with all applicable
U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations on packaging hazardous waste for transport under 49 CFR part
178; or (3) a container that is attached to or forms a part of any truck, trailer, or railcar and that has been demonstrated
within the preceding 12 months to be organic vapor tight in accordance with the procedure specified in Method 27. For
a container in which treatment of hazardous waste is performed, the owner or operator is required to place the container
inside an enclosure that is connected through a closed-vent system to a control device at all times that the container
is completely or partially uncovered during the treatment operation. Transfer of hazardous waste by pumping into
a container having a design capacity greater than 0.46 m3 is required to be performed using submerged fill loading.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirement for use of leak-tight covers on containers is established by testing the cover for no detectable organic
emissions as determined using Method 21 in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. The test is performed when all openings in the
cover (e.g., lids, bungs, hatches, and sampling ports) are secured in a closed, sealed position. Under certain circumstances,
the EPA has determined that a cover other than a rigid, gasketed cover can be used on a container that will meet the requirement
for no detectable organic emissions. For example, the EPA has concluded that use of a tarpaulin with a vapor-suppressing
foam is an acceptable cover for roll-off boxes used for short-term storage (e.g., less than 30 days) of bulk solid materials
(refer to RCRA docket entry number F&hyph;94&hyph;CESP&hyph;S00507 for specific conditions under which this type
of cover is acceptable).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As an alternative to using covers tested for no detectable organic emissions on drums and other containers with a design
capacity less than or equal to 0.46 m3, the subpart CC standards allow an owner or operator to place the hazardous waste
in drums meeting the DOT specifications and testing requirements under 49 CFR part 178. When a container meeting these
DOT regulations is used, no leak detection monitoring nor recordkeeping for the container is required by the subpart
CC standards. It is important to note that none of the exceptions to the 49 CFR part 178 regulations other than the exception
for lab packs used for combination packagings as specified in 49 CFR 173.12(b) apply to a container for the purpose
of complying with the subpart CC standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The subpart CC container standards allow use of a tank truck or tank railcar that has been tested for organic vapor tightness
within the preceding 12 months in accordance with the requirements of Method 27. This method is a pressure test procedure
originally developed by the EPA for determining the vapor-leak tightness of a tank truck into which gasoline is placed.
The EPA considers Method 27 also appropriate for determining vapor-leak tightness of tank trucks and railcars into
which hazardous wastes containing volatile organics are placed. No Method 21 leak monitoring or recordkeeping is
required for tank trucks or tank railcars complying with this provision of the rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When it is necessary for a container to be open during certain treatment processes, the subpart CC standards require
the container to be located in an enclosure connected to a closed-vent system with control device. The enclosure must
be designed to operate with sufficient airflow into the structure to capture all organic vapors vented from the container
and route the vapors through the closed-vent system to the control device. The enclosure may have permanent or temporary
openings to allow worker access, passage of containers through the enclosure by conveyor or other mechanical means,
entry of permanent mechanical or electrical equipment, or to direct airflow into the enclosure. Whenever an open
container is placed inside the enclosure, the pressure drop across each opening in the enclosure is to be maintained
at a pressure below atmospheric pressure such that no organic vapors released from the container can exit the enclosure
through the opening.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the container standards include the same unit and control equipment safety venting provisions allowed
under the subpart CC standards for tanks and surface impoundments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Closed-Vent System and Control Device Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The design and operating requirements under the final subpart CC standards for a closed-vent system with control
device are the same as those already applicable to TSDF owners and operators under subpart AA in 40 CFR parts 264 and
265 with one exception. The subpart CC standards require that each control device achieve at least a 95 percent reduction
in the total organic content of the vapor stream vented to the device or, in the case of an enclosed combustion device,
a reduction of the total organic content of the vapor stream to a level less than or equal to 20 ppmw on a dry basis corrected
to 3 percent oxygen.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The standards do not require the use of any specific type of equipment or add-on control device. The standards allow
the owner or operator the flexibility of choosing the control device best suited for a control application based on
the characteristics of the particular organic vapor stream. Furthermore, the subpart CC standards do not require
that each tank, surface impoundment, and container be vented to a separate control device dedicated to that particular
unit. Vent streams from several units can be combined and discharged to a single control device that achieves the required
level of performance.

8. Inspection and Monitoring
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The subpart CC standards provide exemptions from inspection and monitoring for specific circumstances defined
in the rule. In the case of an underground tank, only those portions of the tank cover and those connections to the tank
cover or tank body (e.g., fill ports, access hatches, gauge wells, etc.) that extend to or above the ground surface
and can be opened to the atmosphere must be inspected and monitored. Leak monitoring using Method 21 in 40 CFR part 60,
appendix A, is not required for the following: (1) Drums that meet applicable DOT regulations specified in the rule;
(2) tank trucks and tank railcars that are annually demonstrated to be vapor-tight by Method 27 in 40 CFR part 60, appendix
A; and (3) closed-vent systems and control devices operated in vacuum service (i.e., equipment that is operated at
an internal pressure that is at least 5 kPa below ambient pressure) or closed-vent system connections that are permanently
or semi-permanently sealed (e.g., a welded joint between two sections of metal pipe or a bolted and gasketed pipe flange).
Also, semiannual leak monitoring is not required for a cover opening that has continuously remained in the closed,
sealed position for the entire period since the cover opening was last monitored.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure that emission control equipment is properly operated and maintained, the subpart CC standards require
the TSDF owner or operator to visually inspect certain emission control equipment items semiannually. For example,
emission control equipment covers on tanks are to be checked semiannually by facility employees to ensure that equipment
is being used properly (e.g., covers are closed and latched except when an opening must be used to add, remove, inspect,
or sample the waste in the tank or to inspect, maintain, replace, or repair equipment located inside the tank or to vent
gases or vapors from the tank) and the equipment is being maintained in good condition (e.g., no visible holes, gaps,
tears, or splits have developed in covers).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Continuous monitoring of control device operation is required under the subpart CC standards. This involves the
use of automated instrumentation to measure critical operating parameters that indicate whether the control device
is operating correctly or is malfunctioning. Semiannual leak detection monitoring using Method 21 under 40 CFR part
60, appendix A, is required for certain cover components to ensure gaskets and seals are in good condition and for closed-vent
systems to ensure all fittings remain leak-tight. In addition, with the previously noted exception of permanently
or semi-permanently sealed connections, each closed-vent system must be monitored for leaks using Method 21 at least
once per year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Special inspection and monitoring provisions are included in the final subpart CC standards for cover fittings that
are unsafe or difficult for facility personnel to inspect and monitor. A TSDF owner or operator may designate a cover
fitting as ``unsafe to inspect and monitor'' if a worker would be exposed to dangerous, hazardous, or other unsafe
conditions when performing the inspection or monitoring. A cover fitting that is designated as unsafe must be inspected
and monitored as frequently as practicable during those times when it is safe to inspect and monitor the fitting. Similarly,
a cover may be designated as ``difficult to inspect and monitor'' if in so doing a worker would be elevated to a height
more than 2 meters above a support surface and the cover was installed before June 5, 1995. A cover fitting that is designated
as difficult must be monitored and inspected at least once per calendar year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The subpart CC standards require that the TSDF owner or operator repair a cover fitting found to be leaking within 15
days of detection. Repair of control equipment on a tank or surface impoundment may be delayed beyond 15 calendar days
under certain circumstances. To delay repair, the owner or operator must document that the repair cannot be completed
without emptying the contents of the unit and also that removing the unit from service would result in the unscheduled
cessation of production from the process unit or operation of the waste management unit that is generating the hazardous
waste. Repair of this control equipment must be completed the next time the process unit or waste management unit that
is generating the hazardous waste managed in the tank or surface impoundment is shut down.

9. Recordkeeping Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final subpart CC standards require the TSDF owner or operator to record certain information in the on-site facility
operating logs or files. This information is to be readily available for review by authorized representatives of
the EPA. Consistent with 40 CFR 264.73 and 40 CFR 265.73, the rule requires that air emission control equipment design
records and certain other records be maintained in the facility operating record until facility closure. Records
and results of waste determinations, inspections, and monitoring are required to be kept for at least 3 years from
the date of entry.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The information to be collected and recorded includes: the results of all waste determinations such as of volatile
organic concentration at the point of waste origination and organic vapor pressure; design specifications for closed-vent
systems and control devices and certain control equipment; emission control equipment inspection and monitoring
results; Methods 27 test results; control device exceedances and actions taken to remedy them; leak repairs; management
of carbon removed from carbon adsorption systems; identification of incinerators, boilers, or industrial furnaces
used to treat hazardous waste in accordance with the general requirements of the rule; documentation for biological
wastewater treatment units using air emission controls in accordance with the rule requirements; and identification
of equipment fittings designated as unsafe or difficult to monitor or inspect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At a facility where air emission control equipment required by the final rule cannot be in operation by June 5, 1995,
the owner or operator is required to prepare an implementation schedule for the air emission control equipment specifying
dates by which progress will be completed by the facility owner or operator to ensure the required air emission controls
are in operation no later than December 8, 1997. Alternatively, the owner or operator may come into compliance by modifying
facility processes to eliminate waste streams with average volatile organic concentration greater than or equal
to 100 ppmw at the point of waste origination. At a minimum, specific calendar dates shall be established for award
of contracts or issuance of purchase orders for the air emission control equipment; initiation of on-site installation
of the equipment; completion of the equipment installation; and performance of any testing to demonstrate that the
installed air emission control equipment meets the standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA recognizes that, in some cases, owners or operators may be unable to meet the implementation date for reasons
beyond their control. For example, several commenters pointed out that permit modifications may be required to implement
necessary changes, and that modification processes can be lengthy. The EPA developed this rule to be self-implementing
and to eliminate the need for permit modifications to the extent possible; furthermore, in the final rule the implementation
period has been extended from 2 to 3 years. Therefore, the EPA expects that most if not all facilities will be able to
comply. However, the EPA acknowledges that in some cases State permits may have to be modified (e.g., when surface
impoundments are replaced with tanks). If the permit process is lengthy, or undergoes extensive appeal, the facility's
ability to comply with the implementation date may be jeopardized. To address this and similar situations, the EPA
has included a provision that will allow the Regional Administrator to extend the implementation date in situations
beyond the owner or operator's control, where he or she made all reasonable and prudent efforts to meet the date. The
EPA emphasizes that this extension would be available only where meeting the date was truly beyond the facility's
control, and the EPA expects its application would be limited to situations such as delays in State permit processing.
The extension would not be available where the facility's planning was at fault, a permit application was submitted
unreasonably late, or permit processing was delayed because the permit application was inadequate.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In some cases, the owner or operator of a facility in interim status at the time this rule becomes effective may not be
able to implement the requirements of the rule before EPA (or an authorized state) issues the facility its RCRA permit.
In this case, the EPA will generally incorporate the facility's implementation schedule into the permit, in accordance
with the requirements of 40 CFR 270.33, which allows schedules of compliance in RCRA permits. Consistent with this
approach, 40 CFR 270.27(a)(7) requires permit applicants to submit their schedules of implementation with their
permit applications, if the owner or operator cannot implement the requirements of this rule before permit issuance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As the EPA develops new hazardous waste listings or characteristics in the future, new containers, tanks, and surface
impoundments will become subject to subpart CC standards. For these units, the effective date of the standards will
be the effective date of the new listing or characteristic. Owners or operators of these units must institute controls
by that date. In cases when owners or operators cannot comply with the applicable requirements of the subpart CC standards
by this date, they must install and operate required air emission control equipment no later than 30 months after the
effective date provided that they prepare a implementation schedule (as described above) for this control equipment
by the effective date.

10. Reporting Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final subpart CC standards in 40 CFR part 264 require a TSDF owner or operator to submit reports to the EPA only when
circumstances occur at the facility resulting in noncompliance with certain provisions of the rule. There are no
reporting requirements under 40 CFR 265 subpart CC for owners and operators of interim-status TSDF.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each report required under the final subpart CC standards in 40 CFR part 264 is to be submitted to the EPA Regional office
having jurisdiction for a particular TSDF location. The report is required to be signed and dated by an authorized
representative of the facility owner or operator.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A TSDF owner or operator subject to the requirements of 40 CFR 264 subpart CC must report to the EPA all circumstances
resulting in placement of a hazardous waste in a tank, surface impoundment, or container subject to the rule and not
using air emission controls required by the rule when either of the following conditions occur: (1) The hazardous
waste has a volatile organic concentration equal to or greater than 100 ppmw as determined on a mass-weighted average
basis at the point of waste origination, or (2) the process used to treat the hazardous waste fails to meet the applicable
conditions specified in the rule. The owner or operator must submit a written report within 15 calendar days of the
time that the owner or operator becomes aware of the circumstances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A TSDF owner or operator subject to the requirements of 40 CFR part 264, subpart CC and using a control device in accordance
with the requirements of the rule is required to submit a semiannual written report to the EPA. This report is to describe
each occurrence during the previous 6-month period when a control device is operated continuously for 24 hours or
longer in noncompliance with the applicable operating values defined in 40 CFR 264.1035(c)(4) or when a flare is operated
with visible emissions as defined in 40 CFR 264.1033(d). A TSDF owner or operator is not required to submit this report
for a 6-month period during which all control devices at a facility subject to the subpart CC standards are operated
by the owner or operator so that during no period of 24 hours or longer did a control device operate continuously in noncompliance
with the applicable operating values defined in the rule.

B. TSDF Miscellaneous Unit Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA permits miscellaneous units at TSDF on a case-by-case basis with terms and provisions as needed to protect
public health and the environment through generic performance standards specified in 40 CFR 264.601. Today's rule
amends &sect;264.601 to include the air emission controls required by the standards under 40 CFR part 264, subparts
AA, BB, and CC among the ``appropriate'' controls a permit writer may require for a miscellaneous unit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Application of the air standards under 40 CFR part 264, subparts AA, BB, and CC to subpart X miscellaneous units will
require determining which one of the waste management unit categories (e.g., tank, surface impoundment, container),
if any, is most similar to the miscellaneous unit. As an example, hazardous waste is sometimes stored or treated in
a miscellaneous unit consisting of a flexible, synthetic liner supported by an above ground metal frame (instead
of a depression formed of earthen materials as is the case for a surface impoundment). Placing hazardous waste containing
organics in this type of miscellaneous unit could result in significant organic emissions from the exposed waste
surface comparable to those resulting from placing the waste in a similar size surface impoundment. Using the types
of air emission controls applicable to surface impoundments (e.g., floating membrane cover) would reduce organic
emissions from this type of miscellaneous unit. Therefore, in the case where the miscellaneous unit is determined
to resemble a surface impoundment, a subpart X permit may be issued that includes air emission control requirements
for surface impoundments under the subpart CC standards. The same application of the rule would be true for a miscellaneous
unit used to manage organic-containing hazardous waste and determined to be similar to a tank or a container.

Today's final rulemaking amends subparts I and J of 40 CFR part 265 to add a requirement that 90-day tanks and containers
covered by these subparts also have to comply with air emission control requirements in subparts AA, BB, and CC. The
rule adds these provisions as conditions with which generators must comply to not be required to obtain a permit for
on-site tanks and containers used to accumulate hazardous waste.

Today's action adds new requirements for TSDF owners and operators using activated carbon adsorption systems to

specify the procedures for managing the spent carbon removed from the control devices, and are consistent with the
requirements promulgated today in subpart CC under 40 CFR parts 264 and 265.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Today's action by the EPA modifies the ``permit-as-a-shield'' practice for implementation of RCRA rules by owners
and operators of existing TSDF for which final RCRA permits have been issued by the EPA. The EPA is amending 40 CFR 270.4
to require that owners and operators of TSDF that have been issued final permits prior to June 5, 1995, comply with the
air standards under 40 CFR part 265, subparts AA, BB, and CC until the facility's permit is reviewed or reissued by the
EPA. This amendment eliminates application of the ``permit-as-a-shield'' practice for these air standards but
does not require that the EPA or the TSDF owner or operator initiate a permit modification to add the requirements of
40 CFR part 264, subparts AA, BB, or CC. The EPA believes that this will minimize the administrative burden on the TSDF
owner or operator as well as limit the additional burden on the permitting resources of the EPA. However, when a permit
is reopened or subject to renewal, or when a TSDF owner or operator submits a Class 3 modification request pertaining
to an existing unit or addition of a new unit subject to these standards (e.g., a modification regarding a tank, surface
impoundment, or container), then the applicable requirements of 40 CFR part 264, subparts AA, BB, and CC shall be incorporated
into the permit conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The subpart CC standards promulgated today are implemented on the following schedule by owners and operators of existing
TSDF (except for tanks in which waste stabilization activities are performed as of December 6, 1994, as explained
in section VI.F of this preamble):
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) All owners and operators of existing TSDF become subject to the requirements of 40 CFR part 265, subparts AA, BB,
and CC effective June 5, 1995.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Beginning June 5, 1995, each TSDF owner or operator is required to be in compliance with 40 CFR part 265, subparts
AA, BB, and CC. Implementation of the leak detection and repair program required by the subpart BB standards is required
by this date. At a facility where the air emission controls required by the subpart AA, BB, and CC standards are not in
place, the owner or operator must have one of the following in the facility's operating record: An implementation
schedule for the air emission controls in accordance with the recordkeeping requirements of the rule or the facility's
waste determination that indicates that air emission controls are not required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) No later than December 8, 1997, the air emission controls required by 40 CFR part 265, subparts AA, BB, and CC must
be installed and in operation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All final permits, or Class 3 permit modifications, issued by the EPA after June 5, 1995, must incorporate the requirements
of 40 CFR part 264, subparts AA, BB, and CC. The owner and operator of an interim status TSDF who have submitted Part B
applications to the EPA but have not received a draft permit as of June 5, 1995, are required to modify the Part B application
to incorporate the requirements of 40 CFR part 264, subparts AA, BB, and CC prior to a draft permit being issued by the
EPA. However, if the owner and operator have received a draft permit as of June 5, 1995, then the requirements of 40 CFR
part 264, subparts AA, BB, and CC must be incorporated into the permit conditions prior to final permit determination.
The Regional Administrator may establish, on a case-by-case basis, a reasonable date for submittal of the revised
Part B application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An existing solid waste management unit (or facility) may become a hazardous waste management unit (or facility)
requiring a RCRA permit when a waste becomes newly listed or identified as hazardous. Owners and operators of TSDF
not previously requiring a RCRA permit who have existing units handling newly listed or identified hazardous waste
can submit a Part A application and gain interim status. The air standards being promulgated today are implemented
at these facilities on the following schedule:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 180 days following the date the waste is listed or identified as hazardous waste, the standards become effective;
all facilities become subject to the standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Beginning June 5, 1995, each TSDF owner or operator is required to be in compliance with the subpart AA, BB, and CC
standards. At a facility where the air emission controls required by the subpart AA, BB, and CC standards are not in
place, the owner or operator must have one of the following in the facility's operating record: an implementation
schedule for the air emission controls in accordance with the recordkeeping requirements of the rule, or the facility's
waste determination that indicates that air emission controls are not required.

All air emission controls required by 40 CFR part 264, subparts AA, BB, and CC must be in place and operating upon startup
of a new TSDF. Under 40 CFR 270.10, owners and operators of new TSDF are required to submit Part A and Part B permit applications
and to receive a final permit from the EPA prior to construction of the facility. The Part B application for a new facility
must incorporate the requirements of 40 CFR part 264. Owners and operators who have submitted a Part B application
for a new TSDF but have not been issued a final permit as of June 5, 1995, are required to modify their Part B applications
to incorporate the requirements of 40 CFR part 264, subpart CC.

Under RCRA section 3006, the EPA may authorize a qualified State to administer and enforce the RCRA program within
the State (refer to 40 CFR part 271 for the standards and requirements for authorization). Although an authorized
State has primary responsibility for enforcement of RCRA, the EPA retains enforcement authority under RCRA sections
3008, 7003, and 3013, as well as inspection authority under RCRA section 3007.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to the enactment of the HSWA, a State with final authority administered its hazardous waste program entirely
in lieu of the EPA administering the Federal program in that State. The Federal requirements no longer applied in the
authorized State, and the EPA could not issue permits for facilities in that State. When new, more stringent Federal
requirements were promulgated or enacted, the State was obligated to enact equivalent requirements within specified
time frames. The new Federal requirements did not take effect as Federal law in an authorized State until the State
adopted the requirements as State law and was granted authority by the EPA to administer the requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In contrast, new Federal requirements promulgated under authority of the HSWA, become effective in authorized States
at the same time they are effective in nonauthorized States. Under RCRA section 3006(g)(1), the EPA is directed to
administer the new Federal requirements in authorized States, including the issuance of permits, until the State
is granted authority to do so. While authorized States must still adopt all new RCRA provisions as State law to retain
final authorization, requirements promulgated under RCRA provisions added by the HSWA are administered by the EPA
as Federal law in authorized States in the interim.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's rules are promulgated under authority of RCRA section 3004(n), a provision added to RCRA by the HSWA. Therefore,
the EPA is adding the requirements of the rules to Table 1 in 40 CFR 271.1(j). This table identifies the Federal program
requirements that are promulgated pursuant to the HSWA and that take effect in all States, regardless of their authorization
status.

The EPA will implement the air standards promulgated today in an authorized State until such a time when the State either:
(1) Modifies its RCRA program to adopt the rule and receives final authorization from the EPA for the modification;
or (2) receives interim authorization from the EPA as described below. Because these air standards are promulgated
under authority of the HSWA, a State submitting a program modification may apply to receive either interim or final
authorization under RCRA section 3006(g)(2) or 3006(b), respectively, on the basis of requirements that are substantially
equivalent or equivalent to the EPA's. The procedures and schedule for State program modifications for either interim
or final authorization are described in 40 CFR 271.21. The availability of HSWA interim authorization was recently
extended by the EPA until January 1, 2003 (see 57 60129, December 18, 1992).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 271.21(e)(2), States with final authorization must modify their programs
to reflect Federal program changes and subsequently must submit the modifications to the EPA for approval. The deadline
by which a State must modify its RCRA program to adopt today's rulemaking is determined by the date of promulgation
of the final rule, in accordance with 40 CFR 271.21(e)(2). This deadline can be extended in certain cases [40 CFR 271.21(e)(3)].
Once the EPA approves the modification, the State requirements become subtitle C RCRA requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A State that submits its Base program application less than 12 months after the effective date of these standards is
not required to include standards equivalent to these standards in its application. However, the State must modify
its program by the deadlines set forth in 40 CFR 271.21(e). States that submit official applications for final authorization
12 months after the effective date of these standards must include standards equivalent to these standards in their
applications. The 40 CFR 271.3 sets forth the requirements a State must meet when submitting its final authorization
application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States with authorized RCRA programs may already have requirements similar to those in today's rule. Such State regulations
have not been assessed against the Federal regulations being finalized today to determine whether they meet the tests
for authorization. Thus, a State is not authorized to implement these requirements as RCRA requirements until the
State program modification is assessed against Federal requirements and approved. Of course, States with existing
standards may continue to administer and enforce their standards as a matter of State law. In implementing the Federal
program, the EPA will work with States under cooperative agreements to minimize duplication of efforts. In many cases,
the EPA will be able to defer to the States in their efforts to implement their programs, rather than take separate actions
under Federal authority.

A. Method 25D
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Method 25D in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A is the applicable test method for the determination of the volatile organic
concentration of wastes. Method 25D was originally proposed as a part of this rulemaking but was subsequently promulgated
in a separate rulemaking (see 56 FR 19402, April 22, 1994). Responses to comments received on the proposed Method 25D
as part of this rulemaking are presented in the BID for today's final rule. Additional comments and responses relevant
to the proposed Method 25D that were received as part of other EPA rulemakings are available in Air Docket Number A&hyph;90&hyph;23
located at the EPA's Air and Radiation Docket Information Center, Waterside Mall, room 1500, 1st Floor, 401 M Street,
SW., Washington, DC 20460.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The sampling requirements in Method 25D have been changed since proposal. The promulgated version of Method 25D requires
that samples of waste be collected from a source following specific procedures for sampling a single-phase or well-mixed
waste, a multiple-phase waste, and solid materials. Each sample is suspended in an organic/aqueous matrix, then
heated and purged with nitrogen for 30 minutes to separate certain organic compounds. A portion of the sample is analyzed
for carbon concentration, as methane, with a flame ionization detector. The other portion of the sample is analyzed
for chlorine concentration, as chloride, with an electrolytic conductivity detector. The volatile organic concentration
of the waste is then computed as the sum of the measured carbon and chlorine contents.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Method 25E is the applicable test method for determining the organic vapor pressure of waste managed in tanks. The
version of Method 25E promulgated today in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, is the same as the proposed version with one addition
to the sampling requirements to provide for sampling waste in a tank. Method 25E requires collection of a waste sample
in a headspace sample vial and transfer of the vial to a balanced pressure headspace sampler. The headspace vapor of
the sample is analyzed for carbon content by a headspace analyzer, which uses a flame ionization detector.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The information collection requirements in these rules have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget
(OMB) under the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Paperwork Reduction Act, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq., and have been assigned control number 1593.02.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To aid the EPA with enforcement of the rule being promulgated today, TSDF owners and operators and hazardous waste
generators subject to today's action are required to record certain information in the on-site facility operating
logs or files. The recordkeeping requirements for each respondent (i.e., person subject to the rule) will vary depending
on a variety of site-specific factors. These factors include: the number of tanks, surface impoundments, and containers
subject to the rule in operation at the respondent's facility; the number of hazardous waste streams managed at the
facility; the type of waste determination methods selected by the respondent; and the type of air emission control
equipment selected by the respondent to comply with the requirements of the rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This collection of information has an estimated reporting burden averaging 1.4 hours per response and an estimated
annual recordkeeping burden averaging 62.5 hours per respondent. These estimates include time for reviewing instructions,
searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection
of information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, a respondent is not required to submit any reports to the EPA unless certain events occur at the respondent's
facility in which a hazardous waste is improperly managed in a unit not using the required air emission controls or
a control device malfunction cannot be corrected by the respondent within 24 hours of being detected. Thus, the EPA
expects that many respondents complying with this rule will have no reporting burden. On a nationwide average basis,
the public reporting burden resulting from today's action is estimated by the EPA to be approximately 2 hours per year
per respondent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions
for reducing this burden to Chief, Information Policy Branch; EPA; 401 M St., S.W. (Mail Code 2136); Washington, DC
20460; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866, (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines
``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal
governments or communities;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been determined that this rule is a ``significant regulatory
action'' based on the estimated annual cost of the rulemaking to the economy (i.e., the EPA's estimate of nationwide
annual costs for the subpart CC standards exceeds $100 million). As such, the EPA has submitted this action to OMB for
review. Changes made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations will be documented in the public record.

C. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), whenever a Federal agency publishes any proposed or final
rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, it must prepare a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (RFA) that describes the impact of the rule on small entities (i.e.,
small businesses, organizations, and governmental jurisdictions). This analysis is not necessary, however, if
the agency certifies that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA has established guidelines for determining whether an RFA is required for the EPA rulemaking. These guidelines
state that, if a preliminary analysis indicates that a proposed regulation would affect 20 percent or more of ``small
entities'', then an RFA is to be prepared. In addition, these guidelines are used to evaluate if a regulation will have
a ``significant impact'' on small entities. A regulation is considered by the EPA to have a ``significant impact''
if any one of the following four criteria is met:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Annual compliance costs increase the relevant production costs for small entities by more than 5 percent;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The ratio of compliance costs to sales will be 10 percent higher for small entities than for large entities;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Capital costs of compliance will represent a significant portion of the capital available to small entities,
taking into account internal cash flow plus external financing capabilities;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Costs of the regulation will likely result in closures of small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA used the economic impact model developed for the RIA to estimate the effects of today's rulemaking on small
entities (refer to Chapter VI of the RIA for additional details). The results of this analysis indicate that the effects
of the air standards on small entities are minimal. The number of affected small entities is insubstantial, and the
impacts are insignificant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that these final rules promulgated today will not have
a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, an RFA is not required for this rulemaking.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The enclosure may have permanent or temporary openings to allow worker access; passage of containers through
the enclosure by conveyor or other mechanical means; entry of permanent mechanical or electrical equipment; or to
direct airflow into the enclosure. The pressure drop across each opening in the enclosure shall be maintained at a
pressure below atmospheric pressure such that whenever an open container is placed inside the enclosure no organic
vapors released from the container exit the enclosure through the opening. The owner or operator shall determine
that an enclosure achieves this condition by measuring the pressure drop across each opening in the enclosure. If
the pressure within the enclosure is equal to or greater than atmospheric pressure then the enclosure does not meet
the requirements of this section.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(iii) The owner or operator shall prepare and record sufficient information that documents the average VO concentration
for the hazardous waste. Information may be used that is prepared by either the facility owner or operator or by the
generator of the hazardous waste. Examples of information that may be used as the basis for knowledge of the waste include:
organic material balances for the source or process generating the waste; VO concentration measurements for the
same type of waste performed in accordance with the procedure specified in paragraph (a)(5)(iv) of this section;
previous individual organic constituent test data for the waste that are still applicable to the current waste management
practices; documentation that the waste is generated by a process for which no organics-containing materials are
used; previous test data for other locations managing the same type of waste; or other knowledge based on manifests,
shipping papers, or waste certification notices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) If test data other than VO concentration measurements performed in accordance with the procedure specified
in paragraph (a)(5)(iv) of this section are used as the basis for knowledge of the waste, then the owner or operator
shall document the test method, sampling protocol, and the means by which sampling variability and analytical variability
are accounted for in the determination of the average VO concentration. For example, an owner or operator may use individual
organic constituent concentration test data that are validated in accordance with Method 301 in appendix A of 40 CFR
part 63 as the basis for knowledge of the waste.

in a waste management unit exempted under the provisions of &sect;265.1083(c)(2) of this subpart from using air emission
controls in accordance with standards specified in &sect;265.1085 through &sect;265.1088 of this subpart, as applicable
to the waste management unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The owner or operator shall perform a waste determination for each discrete quantity of treated hazardous waste
as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) When the hazardous waste is treated by a continuous process, the owner or operator shall: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Perform an initial waste determination for the treated waste stream before the first time any portion of the material
in the waste stream is placed in a waste management unit subject to this subpart, and thereafter update the information
used for the waste determination at least once every 12 months following the date of the initial waste determination;
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Perform a new waste determination whenever changes to the hazardous waste streams fed to the process are reasonably
likely to cause the characteristics of the hazardous waste at the point of waste treatment to change to levels that
fail to achieve the applicable conditions specified in &sect;265.1083(c)(2) of this subpart. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) When the hazardous waste is treated by a batch process that is performed repeatedly but not necessarily continuously,
the owner or operator shall: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Perform an initial waste determination for the treated hazardous waste in one or more representative batches
treated by the process, and thereafter update the information used for the waste determination at least once every
12 months following the date of the initial waste determination; and

demonstrated within the preceding 12 months to be organic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vapor tight when all container openings are in a closed, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sealed position (e.g., the container hatches or lids are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gasketed and latched). For the purpose of meeting the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of this paragraph, a container is organic vapor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tight if the container sustains a pressure change of not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more than 750 pascals within 5 minutes after it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pressurized to a minimum of 4,500 pascals. This condition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is to be demonstrated using the pressure test specified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Method 27 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, and a pressure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurement device which has a precision of

(2) An owner or operator treating hazardous waste in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
container by either a waste stabilization process, any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process that requires the addition of heat to the waste, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any process that produces an exothermic reaction shall meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the following requirements: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Whenever it is necessary for the container to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
open during the treatment process, the container shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
located inside an enclosure that is vented through a closed-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vent system to a control device. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The enclosure shall be a structure that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designed and operated in accordance with the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The enclosure shall be a structure that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designed and operated with sufficient airflow into the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
structure to capture the organic vapors emitted from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazardous waste in the container and vent the vapors through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the closed-vent system to the control device. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The enclosure may have permanent or temporary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
openings to allow worker access; passage of containers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through the enclosure by conveyor or other mechanical means; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entry of permanent mechanical or electrical equipment; or to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
direct airflow into the enclosure. The pressure drop across 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each opening in the enclosure shall be maintained at a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pressure below atmospheric pressure such that whenever an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
open container is placed inside the enclosure no organic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vapors released from the container exit the enclosure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through the opening. The owner or operator shall determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that an enclosure achieves this condition by measuring the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pressure drop across each opening in the enclosure. If the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pressure within the enclosure is equal to or greater than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
atmospheric pressure then the enclosure does not meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of this section.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
passes through a cover opening, if the monitoring instrument 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicates a concentration reading greater than 10,000 ppmv, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
then a leak is detected. Each detected leak shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repaired in accordance with paragraph (f)(7) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) An owner or operator may designate a cover as an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unsafe to inspect and monitor cover if all of the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions are met: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The owner or operator determines that inspection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or monitoring of the cover would expose a worker to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dangerous, hazardous, or other unsafe conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The owner or operator develops and implements a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
written plan and schedule to inspect the cover using the

shall provide a projection below the waste surface. Except 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for automatic bleeder vents, rim space vents, roof drains, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and leg sleeves, each opening in the roof is to be equipped 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with a gasketed cover, seal, or lid that is to be maintained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a closed position at all times (i.e., no visible gap) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
except when the device is in actual use. Automatic bleeder 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vents are to be closed at all times when the roof is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
floating except when the roof is being floated off or is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being landed on the roof leg supports. Rim vents are to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
set to open when the roof is being floated off the roof leg 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supports or at the manufacturer's recommended setting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Automatic bleeder vents and rim space vents are to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gasketed. Each emergency roof drain is to be provided with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a slotted membrane fabric cover that covers at least 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
90 percent of the area of the opening. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The roof shall be floating on the waste at all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
times (i.e., off the roof leg supports) except during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initial fill until the roof is lifted off leg supports and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when the tank is completely emptied and subsequently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refilled. The process of filling, emptying, or refilling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when the roof is resting on the leg supports shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuous and shall be accomplished as rapidly as possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(b) Monitoring and inspection of the control equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described in paragraph (a) of this section shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducted as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) After installation, owners and operators of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
internal floating roofs shall: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Visually inspect the internal floating roof, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
primary seal, and the secondary seal (if one is in service), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior to filling the tank with waste. If there are holes, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tears, or other openings in the primary seal, the secondary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seal, or the seal fabric, or defects in the internal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
floating roof, or both, the owner or operator shall repair 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the items before filling the tank. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) For tanks equipped with a liquid-mounted or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mechanical shoe primary seal, visually inspect the internal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
floating roof and the primary seal or the secondary seal (if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one is in service) through manholes and roof hatches on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fixed roof at least once every 12 months after initial fill. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the internal floating roof is not resting on the surface 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the waste inside the tank, or there is liquid accumulated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the roof, or the seal is detached, or there are holes or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tears in the seal fabric, the owner or operator shall repair 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the items or empty and remove the tank from service within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
45 days. If a failure that is detected during inspections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required in this paragraph cannot be repaired within 45 days 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and if the tank cannot be emptied within 45 days, a 30-day 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extension may be requested from the Regional Administrator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Such a request for an extension shall document that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternate capacity is unavailable and specify a schedule of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions the owner or operator will take that will assure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the control equipment will be repaired or the tank will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be emptied as soon as possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) For tanks equipped with a double-seal system as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this section:

(2) After installation, the owner or operator of an external floating roof shall: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Determine the gap areas and maximum gap widths between the primary seal and the wall of the tank and between the secondary
seal and the wall of the tank according to the following frequency: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Measurements of gaps between the tank wall and the primary seal (seal gaps) shall be performed during the hydrostatic
testing of the tank or within 60 days of the initial fill with waste and at least once every 5 years thereafter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Measurements of gaps between the tank wall and the secondary seal shall be performed within 60 days of the initial
fill with waste and at least once per year thereafter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) If any tank ceases to hold waste for a period of 1 year or more, subsequent introduction of waste into the tank shall
be considered an initial fill for the purposes of paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(A) and (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Determine the gap widths and areas in the primary and secondary seals individually by the following procedures:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Measure seal gaps, if any, at one or more floating roof levels when the roof is floating off the roof leg supports.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Measure seal gaps around the entire circumference of the tank in each place where a 0.32-cm diameter uniform probe
passes freely (without forcing or binding against the seal) between the seal and the wall of the tank and measure the
circumferential distance of each such location. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Determine the total surface area of each gap described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section by using probes
of various widths to measure accurately the actual distance from the tank wall to the seal and multiplying each such
width by its respective circumferential distance.

 In this interim rule, the Bureau of Prisons is amending its regulations on Birth Control, Pregnancy, Child Placement,

abortion. Removing these references is necessary to conform to changes in legislative authority. This amendment
also makes various editorial or organizational changes for the sake of clarity.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Bureau of Prisons is amending its regulations in 28 CFR part 551, subpart C, on Birth Control, Pregnancy, Child
Placement, and Abortion. A final rule on this subject was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 June 29, 1979 (44 FR 38252) and was amended December 30, 1986 (51 FR 47179).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each year since 1987, Congress has included restrictions in the Department of Justice appropriations legislation
on the funding of elective abortions. Section 551.23 had been revised to reflect the imposition of these restrictions.
The appropriations bill for FY 1994 did not include such restrictions, and the Bureau of Prisons is adjusting its regulations
accordingly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a) of &sect;551.23, which states that it is the responsibility of the inmate to decide whether to have an
abortion or to bear the child, is unchanged. The provisions formerly in paragraph (b) pertaining to the financing
of an abortion have been removed. The provisions formerly contained in paragraph (c) pertaining to counseling have
been retained in new paragraph (b). New paragraph (b) also contains requirements for written documentation previously
required by former paragraph (d). The provisions in former paragraph (e) have been restated in new paragraph (c).
New paragraph (c) has been further revised for the sake of clarity and to remove references to where an elective abortion
was to take place.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional editorial or organizational amendments to the provisions for pregnancy and child placement include
use of the word ``ensure'' in &sect;551.22(b), and the consolidation of the provisions formerly in &sect;551.24(b)
and (c), along with the consequent redesignation of &sect;551.24(d).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because this amendment, in response to Congressional action, essentially restores the regulations to the wording
which was originally promulgated, the Bureau finds good cause for exempting the provisions of the Administrative
Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, and delay in effective date, and is implementing
this change as an interim rule. Members of the public may submit comments concerning this rule by writing to the previously
cited address. These comments will be considered before the rule is finalized.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bureau of Prisons has determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action for the purpose of E.O. 12866,
and accordingly this rule was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. After review of the law and regulations,
the Director, Bureau of Prisons has certified that this rule, for the purpose of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub.
L. 96&hyph;354), does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.
