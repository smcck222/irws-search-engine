SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is proposing to amend the Federal poultry products inspection regulations
to prescribe a definition and standard of identity and composition for the finely comminuted poultry product that
results from the mechanical separation and removal of most of the bone from poultry carcasses and parts of carcasses
(``Mechanically Separated (Kind) (MS(K))'' including requirements for bone solids content (measured as calcium
content) and bone particle size; specify certain limitations for the use of MS(K); establish recordkeeping requirements
for bone solids content and bone particle size; and establish labeling requirements for MS(K), and for poultry products
and meat food products containing MS(K) as an ingredient. This proposed action is intended to establish the Agency's
requirements with respect to poultry products produced by mechanical separation, including the requirement that
they be labeled as, in the case of MS(K) derived from chicken carcasses, ``mechanically separated chicken.'' Such
action would help ensure that meat and poultry products distributed to consumers are not labeled in a false or misleading
manner and are not misbranded.

Purpose of the Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal would amend the regulatory requirements for the finely comminuted poultry product resulting from
the mechanical separation and removal of most of the bone from poultry carcasses and parts of carcasses and for the
finished poultry products and meat food products in which this product is used as an ingredient. The Department first
conducted a rulemaking regarding this product in 1969. Over the years, the amount of such product being manufactured
and the number and range of poultry products and meat food products in which it is used as an ingredient, has increased
significantly. Moreover, the Department has gained a great deal of knowledge from its rulemakings regarding the
livestock product resulting from the mechanical separation and removal process which is called Mechanically Separated
(Species) (MS(S)). More recently, in a lawsuit,

several red meat sausage manufacturers alleged that, without a regulatory definition and standard for poultry products
produced by mechanical separation, a disparate situation exists between labeling mechanically separated poultry
and the livestock product resulting from the mechanical separation and removal process for which a regulatory definition
and standard exist. The red meat sausage manufacturers have alleged that the disparate labeling situation poses
an unfair advantage for the manufacturers of mechanically separated poultry products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In view of these developments, and taking into account the information and experience acquired since 1969 and current
regulatory policies, the Agency reviewed and reevaluated the existing regulations, particularly in light of the
labeling issues. As a result of its review and reevaluation, the Agency believes that further regulatory action is
necessary pursuant to its statutory responsibilities to protect the public and prevent the preparation and distribution
in commerce of poultry products and meat food products which are misbranded or not properly marked, labeled, or packaged.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The method of deriving poultry products by the mechanical separation and removal of most of the bone from the meat
and other tissues of poultry carcasses and parts of carcasses results in a product whose physical form and texture
differ materially from those of other boneless poultry products produced by traditional deboning techniques. Mechanically
separated poultry is derived using a machine that operates on the differing resistance of bone and tissue to passage
through small openings, whether it employs sieves, screens, or other devices. Such machines mechanically separate
and remove most of the bone from poultry carcasses and parts of carcasses resulting in a finely comminuted, paste-like
product. The starting materials, which may have undergone an initial bone breaking process, are pushed under high
pressure through equipment with apertures that allow a small amount of powdered bone to pass through with the soft
tissue. This is different than boneless poultry derived by traditional means, i.e., hand-deboning, and such differences
have potential consequences for consumer expectations. FSIS has statutory responsibilities under the PPIA and
FMIA to assure that consumers receive poultry and meat food products that are not adulterated and that bear labeling
that is not false or misleading. Despite this, the regulations do not distinguish between poultry products produced
by mechanical separation and poultry products produced by traditional deboning techniques, i.e., hand-deboning,
in terms of product identity and composition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Mechanically separated poultry is produced by essentially the same technology and has characteristics (i.e.,
physical form and texture) similar to those of the livestock product, MS(S). Yet, the regulatory requirements for
labeling these two products currently are inconsistent with one another. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Department is proposing to amend the poultry products inspection regulations (9 CFR Part 381) to revise
and supplement the requirements for the manufacture, characteristics, and labeling of poultry products produced
by mechanical separation and the labeling of products in which they are used as ingredients. Under this proposal,
mechanically separated product derived from chicken or turkey would be labeled as ``mechanically separated chicken''
or ``mechanically separated turkey,'' as the case may be.

I. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Poultry products produced by mechanical separation, also referred to as mechanical deboning, are characteristically
finely comminuted (i.e., finely ground) in form and result from the mechanical separation and removal of most of the
bone from attached skeletal muscle and other tissue of poultry carcasses and parts of carcasses. The products are
prepared from various materials, including necks, backs, and whole carcasses. These starting materials may be raw
or cooked, may contain varying amounts of muscle and/or skin, and may contain kidneys, except when product is made
from mature chickens or mature turkeys. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Kidneys of mature chickens or turkeys may not be used as human food (9 CFR 381.65(d)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The technology to mechanically separate and remove most of the bone from attached skeletal muscle and other tissue
of poultry carcasses and parts of carcasses began in the late 1950's or early 1960's. The Agency's initial reaction
was to consider the resulting product adulterated because of the amount of bone present and the physical size of the
bone particles. By the mid-1960's, the industry had modified and improved the equipment used to produce poultry product
by mechanical separation such that the product contained 1 percent or less bone solids with an extremely small bone
particle size. This prompted the Agency to reevaluate its position. Widespread commercial production of products
containing mechanically separated poultry began in the early 1970's. By 1975, poultry product produced by mechanical
separation was being used as an ingredient in poultry and meat food products such as franks, bologna, salami, and rolls.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today, poultry products made with poultry produced by mechanical separation include cooked poultry sausages (such
as chicken frankfurters, turkey salami, and turkey bologna), poultry patties and nuggets (such as chicken patties
and nuggets), and poultry baby foods. The level at which it is used has depended in part on technological capabilities
and has reached 100 percent of the poultry product portion of a number of cooked poultry sausage products. Poultry
product produced by mechanical means is also used at up to 49 percent of the formulations of certain meat food products,
e.g., beef and turkey chili, provided that it is identified in the product name as ``turkey'' or ``chicken,'' and used
in meat food products including cooked sausages, such as frankfurters and bologna, at a level of up to 15 percent of
the total ingredients, excluding water (9 CFR 319.180) without being identified in the product name.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Over the years, the poultry and meat food industries have also referred to poultry products produced by mechanical
means as ``comminuted (i.e., ground) poultry.'' Terminology such as ``finely comminuted,'' ``finely ground,''
and ``mechanically deboned'' have been used on poultry product labels to describe the form (i.e., physical appearance)
and composition of the product according to 9 CFR 381.117(d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Poultry products produced by mechanical means are currently subject to 9 CFR 381.117(d) relating to boneless poultry
products. This regulation requires boneless poultry products to be labeled in a manner that accurately describes
their actual form and composition. The product name must indicate the form of the product, e.g., emulsified or finely
chopped, and the kind name of the poultry from which it is derived. If the product does not consist of natural proportions
of skin and fat, as they occur in the whole carcass, the product name must also include terminology that describes the
actual composition. If the product is cooked, it must be so labeled. Section 381.117(d) also limits the bone solids
content of boneless poultry products to 1 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Existing regulations do not distinguish between boneless poultry products produced by mechanical separation and
poultry products produced by traditional methods, e.g., hand-deboning. Poultry product produced by mechanical
separation is declared in the ingredients statement of a product in which it is used, along with any other boneless
poultry product used, as ``chicken'' or ``turkey'' where skin and fat are included but not in excess of their natural
proportions, or as ``chicken meat'' or ``turkey meat'' when skin with attached fat is not included.

II. Report on Health and Safety of Mechanically Deboned Poultry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1976, the Department initiated an analytical program to obtain data on a number of nutrients and substances of potential
health concern in poultry products produced by mechanical separation. Data were also gathered from scientific literature,
industry, other government agencies, and university scientists. Details of the analytical program and a resulting
evaluation were published in a June 1979 report entitled ``Health and Safety Aspects of the Use of Mechanically Deboned
Poultry'' (hereafter referred to as the 1979 Report). An errata supplement correcting certain items in the report
was prepared and published on August 14, 1979 (44 FR 47576). (The 1979 Report and the errata supplement are available
for public inspection in the FSIS Docket Clerk's office.) On June 29, 1979, the Agency announced the availability
of this report and encouraged interested members of the public to comment on its content. The Department also notified
the public that it was particularly interested in receiving comments regarding the proper labeling of products containing
poultry product produced by mechanical separation and what means, if any, should be taken to implement the labeling
recommendations in the report (44 FR 37965). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department received 221 comments, most of which were general reactions to the labeling issues raised in the notice,
and health, safety, or economic concerns. Of the 187 commenters that expressed a general opinion on the adequacy of
the regulations concerning mechanically deboned poultry products, 175 were supportive. Some commenters stated
that the regulations have effectively controlled the use of product produced by mechanical separation over many
years with a wide base of consumer acceptance, that such product is not significantly different from product produced
by hand-deboning, that these regulations provide truthful labeling, and/or that the report and scientific literature
support the adequacy of current regulations. Other commenters indicated that mechanically deboned poultry should
be regulated the same as mechanically separated (species) (MS(S)) (then named mechanically processed (species)
product).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1983, the General Accounting Office (GAO) issued a report recommending that the Secretary of Agriculture direct
the Administrator of FSIS to establish specific standards on poultry products produced by mechanical separation
and labeling requirements on products made with such poultry products as had been done for MS(S) and products made
with MS(S). MS(S) is a finely comminuted product resulting from the mechanical separation and removal of most of the
bone from attached skeletal muscle of livestock carcasses and parts of carcasses that meets the provisions of 9 CFR
319.5.

IV. Improvements in Machinery for Poultry Products Produced by Mechanical Separation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency has monitored the advances in the technology for mechanically separating poultry, also referred to as
mechanical deboning, over the last decade. There have been improvements in the efficiency of the mechanical separation
and removal of most of the bone from attached skeletal muscle and tissue of poultry carcasses and parts of poultry carcasses.
Today, it has been estimated that roughly 1 billion pounds of raw poultry materials are used to manufacture 700 million
pounds of mechanically separated poultry, also referred to as mechanically deboned poultry (MDP), which is used,
in turn, to formulate approximately 400 million pounds of poultry sausages (including franks, bologna, and salami),
and 300 million pounds of poultry nuggets and poultry patties.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 There have been major advances in mechanical deboning machinery in terms of the effectiveness of bone removal from
skeletal muscle and other tissues of poultry carcasses and parts of carcasses. This has been accomplished through
enhancements and modifications of the bone-removal devices that are part of the mechanical deboning machines. There
have been continued refinements of certain operational parameters of the machinery, e.g., the ability for operators
to adjust the pressure needed to force ground poultry bones with adhering muscle and other tissues through screens
to separate muscle and other tissues from bone, and the size of the apertures (i.e., holes) in the screens and sieves
through which the ground bones, muscle, and other tissues are pushed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1969, the Agency amended the regulations for poultry and poultry products inspection to, among other things, provide
labeling requirements for boneless poultry products, as well as a prescribed bone solids content of not more than
1 percent (34 FR 13991). This limit was based on an evaluation conducted by the Department of the operating results
in a series of poultry establishments that used mechanical deboning equipment. Analyses were made of 485 samples
of raw, mechanically deboned product from nine commercial operations that used the three types of machines most often
used in the process. The analyses showed that the equipment, at that time, could be operated under commercial conditions
to produce boneless poultry that contained no more than 1 percent bone solids, on a raw weight basis, and the Department
concluded that it was demonstrated that it was practical to limit the bone content in deboned poultry to 1 percent.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of the improvements that have occurred with regard to the machinery used to mechanically separate and remove
most of the bone from the muscle and other tissues of poultry carcasses and parts of carcasses, FSIS recently conducted
a study of the bone solids content of mechanically separated poultry.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 The percentage of bone solids content (determined by calcium analysis) in boneless poultry products produced by
mechanical deboning was collected from approximately 50 establishments during August 1993, and represented a sampling
of over 2000 products. The data indicate that the mean bone solids content of the samples of these products was approximately
0.6 percent; generally, half of the samples were above 0.6 percent and half were below 0.6 percent.

V. RTI Study 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to complaints from industry, some of them longstanding, that the Agency is ``not regulating meat and poultry
equitably,'' FSIS contracted out to the Research Triangle Institute (RTI) a comparison of the meat and poultry inspection
regulations. RTI found many differences in the two sets of regulations and narrowed down to 12 the areas of the regulations
where significant differences exist.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 FSIS has studied these areas to determine whether, in the actual conduct of inspection, they result in an inequitable
application of the inspection laws, and, if so, what might be done to mitigate the inequities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Among the areas identified in the RTI study is mechanically separated product. It notes that regulations exist on
the use of MS(S), but not on the use of MDP. The RTI study concluded that, in general, ``the regulations covering meat
and poultry have been designed with the same intent_to protect `the health and welfare of consumers by assuring that
meat and meat food products [or poultry products] are wholesome, not adulterated, and properly marked, labeled,
and packaged' (21 U.S.C. 602 and 451). Although the intent of the regulations remains the same, the actual requirements
are quite different.'' The study further concludes that the bases for no comparable regulation for MDP are ``unfavorable
consumer perceptions and court decisions resulting in label and use restrictions for MS(S); poultry has no definitional
requirements for MS(S) (e.g., can be defined as `chicken' or `turkey').'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mechanically separated red meat food product became the subject of consumer criticism in the mid-1970's after USDA
proposed to allow its use in meat products and to allow it to be labeled as meat (i.e., beef or pork). USDA also issued
an interim rule that included standards for the use of mechanically separated red meat product. A lawsuit soon followed
in which the court found that this product is not ``meat'' as traditionally defined within the scope of the Federal
Meat Inspection Act. The court further found that USDA had not considered adequately the health and safety effects
of mechanically separated red meat food product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To respond to questions on health and safety raised by the court, a panel of government scientists was convened to examine
the questions. The panel found that scientific studies established no unique health risks associated with mechanically
separated red meat food product, but that the product is sufficiently different from muscle tissue meat in consistency
and composition to require separate labeling. The panel recommended, among other things, that usage limitations
be placed on this product.

The panel reports, among other things, led FSIS to issue final regulations on June 20, 1978, that established preparation,
composition, usage, and labeling requirements for mechanically separated red meat food product and required that
it be produced only under a quality control program approved by the Agency (43 FR 26416). This rule established a definition
and standard of identity for this product that necessitated it being listed separately from meat in the ingredients
statement of a product in which it was used. Additional rulemaking on June 29, 1982, reaffirmed the Agency's position
that the product, now called MS(S), is not ``meat'' as traditionally defined (47 FR 28214). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During this same period, MDP underwent product development separately from mechanically separated red meat food
product without similar FSIS regulation. Early distinctions in regulatory treatment were largely due to historical
differences in how the two industries used these products and the way in which they came to public attention. One significant
difference is that mechanically separated red meat food product was being considered for use in products that had
previously contained muscle meat. The use of MDP in poultry hotdogs created less controversy. Poultry hotdogs did
not exist before they were made with MDP. Thus, consumers had no prior expectations about the formulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Differences in regulatory treatment of the product, now called MS(S), and MDP have continued since that time. The
meat industry claims that the effect of those differences has been a reluctance on the part of processors to use MS(S),
while MDP use has expanded. In response to the early rulemakings on MS(S), the meat industry claimed that consumers
would not buy products if MS(S) is listed on the label. Similarly, in responding to the March 1994 advance notice of
proposed rulemaking (ANPR) on MDP (discussed later in this document), the poultry industry claimed that, if they
had to label MDP as a poultry ingredient, consumers would be misled into thinking that they are purchasing products
inferior to what they have historically purchased or that the product has changed. If the industry believes that consumers
will be misled into thinking the product has changed, it should find some way other than inaccurate labeling to assure
them it is the same product. The Agency believes that if the current labeling is misleading, it has no choice but to assure
that the ingredients statement accurately informs the consumer what is in the product. If consumers would behave
differently with different information, then that is itself evidence that the information is important to them.
It is the Agency's responsibility under its consumer protection mission to assure the information is accurate and
not misleading.

The Agency's regulation on the use of MS(S) and the absence of regulation on the use of MDP have raised two major policy
issues. The first is whether current regulations are adequately protecting consumers. The second is whether different
regulatory treatment for these similar products is justified. FSIS is not proposing this regulation because of the
current differences in the regulatory treatment of MDP and MS(S), but rather because its basic statutory mission
is to assure that products bear labeling that is truthful and not misleading. Accordingly, FSIS has determined that
providing this assurance requires the regulation of MDP.

V. Advance Notices of Proposed Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 15, 1993, FSIS published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) (58 FR 33040) soliciting comments,
information, scientific data, and recommendations regarding the consideration of the need for labeling of poultry
product produced by mechanical separation and products in which such poultry product is used. FSIS received 2744
comments in response to the ANPR, most of which were general reactions to labeling issues. The majority of commenters
responded to whether there was a need to identify mechanically separated poultry in the ingredients statement on
the labels of meat and poultry products in which it is used as an ingredient. One thousand four hundred eighty-seven
commenters supported identifying mechanically separated poultry in the ingredients statement because, the commenters
stated that, among other things, consumers have ``a right to know'' it is an ingredient. One thousand two hundred fifty-seven
commenters did not support identifying mechanically separated poultry in the ingredients statement, citing, in
part, that current policies are satisfactory and that labeling it would mislead consumers into thinking that they
are purchasing products that are inferior or different than the product they have historically purchased. FSIS concluded
that there is a ``truth-in-labeling'' issue that is founded in the mandate under which the Agency operates, viz.,
protecting consumers from misbranded poultry and meat products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequently, FSIS decided to obtain the information and data necessary to pursue the development of amendments
to the Federal poultry products inspection regulations to define and standardize, or establish other requirements
for poultry products produced by mechanical separation, including possible provisions for the composition, characteristics,
and use of such products, and requirements for manufacturing and labeling such products. On March 3, 1994, FSIS published
another ANPR (59 FR 10230) which solicited comments and information from the meat and poultry industries and industry-related
organizations, the scientific community, academia, consumers and consumer groups, and other interested parties
on its tentative positions regarding poultry products produced by mechanical separation and products in which such
poultry products are used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the March 1994 ANPR, FSIS considered, among other things, that certain poultry products produced by mechanical
separation, i.e., those with greater than 0.6 percent bone solids content, but no more than 1 percent bone solids content
be separately identified on the labels of products in which they are used as ingredients by a distinct name. However,
because of the improvements in separating the bone from muscle and other tissues of poultry carcasses and parts of
carcasses, FSIS considered that some poultry products derived from mechanical separation machinery, i.e., those
with 0.6 percent or less bone solids, be identified on the label of products in which they are used as poultry or poultry
meat, e.g., ``chicken'' and ``turkey meat.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS received 106 comments in response to the March 1994 ANPR. Fifty-one comments were submitted by food manufacturers/distributors,
44 comments by consumers, 7 by trade associations, 2 by academia, 1 by a law firm, and 1 by a developer of machinery. The
majority of the comments did not support the ANPR. The comments are summarized below.

Bone Solids Content and Labeling. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
According to the tentative positions presented in the March 1994 ANPR, the tentative provisions for poultry product
produced by mechanical separation would classify or ``categorize'' such product by bone solids content (as measured
by calcium content). Mechanically separated poultry with 0.6 percent or less bone solids content would be termed
``(Kind)'' or ``(Kind) meat,'' where ``kind'' refers to chicken or turkey. Mechanically separated poultry with
greater than 0.6 percent bone solids content (but not greater than 1 percent) would be termed ``Mechanically Separated
(Kind).''

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Eighty-one commenters addressed the issue regarding the classification of poultry products produced by mechanical
separation according to bone solids content. Of the 81 commenters, 78 disagreed with the requirements discussed
in the ANPR which tentatively considered that only product with 0.6 percent or less bone solids content could be labeled
``(kind)'' or ``(kind) meat,'' without the reference to ``mechanically separated.'' The commenters stated that
the establishment of a 0.6 percent bone solids content demarcation between what would be labeled as ``(kind)'' or
``(kind) meat,'' and ``mechanically separated (kind),'' based on data collected in August 1993 (data presented
by FSIS in the report entitled ``Determination of Acceptable Limits of Percent Bone Solids in Ground Poultry Products'')
would basically eliminate half of the currently produced product and reduce the available amount of this low cost
poultry ingredient for further processed poultry and meat food products by 60 to 70 percent. Moreover, commenters
further emphasized that, to operate within the current 1 percent bone solids content limit for boneless poultry,
most processors must target their operations at about 0.6 percent bone solids content. The commenters indicated
that achievement of the low levels of percent bone solids content that were reported by FSIS in the report of the August
1993 data occurred because it is necessary for producers to target well below the current 1 percent limit in order to
consistently meet and not exceed the 1 percent requirement. Thus, setting a requirement at 0.6 percent for what could
be called ``(kind)'' or ``(kind) meat'' would require producers to aim at significantly lower levels of bone solids
content which would present an unreasonable burden on the industry. Manufacturers would have to adjust their mechanical
deboning machines to adjust the pressure needed to force ground poultry bones with adhering muscle and other tissues
through screens in the mechanical deboning equipment to eliminate more bone from the finished product, thereby reducing
product yield. According to the commenters, in order to label a product as ``chicken'' or ``turkey meat,'' i.e., to
meet the ``upper control limit'' of 0.6 percent, a processor would have to target a 0.3 percent bone solids content
level to qualify for that product category because of the lack of precise controls in the operation of the deboning
equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter claimed that industry data submitted to the Agency ``shows, under the principles of statistical process
control, a controlled process that targets 0.6 percent bone solids will result in a product that meets the 1 percent
bone solids requirement 99.5 percent of the time.'' Another commenter claimed that the industry data presented indicate
that the average percent bone solids content is 0.57 percent with a standard deviation of 0.227 percent, so that ``at
the 99 percent confidence limit, evidence that a process may not be running efficiently is when an individual sample
analysis is greater than 1.15 percent.'' Therefore, according to the commenters, the Agency is wrong to advocate
an average bone solids content of 0.6 percent as the current measure of good manufacturing practices for poultry products
produced by mechanical separation. The same commenters criticized the FSIS report on bone solids content stating
that ``no statistical analysis, factorial or otherwise, was done to describe the two categories of mechanically
separated poultry based on bone solids content to determine if, in fact, they are different and/or whether members
of the populations were in fact similar.'' The commenters further asserted that the data presented by FSIS did not
actually demonstrate that two ``categories'' of mechanically separated poultry exist. The commenters asserted
that such an analysis may show that the only difference was due to the type of starting materials (e.g., necks versus
carcass frames versus backs) or that there are, in fact, no separable populations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, it was asserted by several commenters that the usual practice in quality control is to use 3 standard deviations
above a target criteria as a control limit, rather than the standard deviation of 2.33 (corresponding to a 99 percent
confidence that the process is not in control), as was suggested by FSIS in its report of the 1993 study. One commenter
provided an example of how the 3 standard deviations approach would be applied. It was explained that since the mean
percent bone solids content presented in the report of the 1993 study was 0.68 percent and that the average standard
deviation by establishment was 0.138, then 3 standard deviations above the mean control limit would be approximately
1.1 percent bone solids content.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a general response to the comments on bone solids content and labeling, FSIS first reiterates its reasons for having
considered in the March 1994 ANPR the defining of a product standard for poultry products produced by mechanical separation
based, in part, on percent bone solids content. In 1969, the Agency promulgated rules on deboned poultry products
specifying that no more than 1 percent bone solids content would be allowed for this product. As indicated previously,
this decision was based on the Agency's careful appraisal of the operating results in a series of poultry establishments
that used mechanical deboning equipment. Analyses were made of 485 samples of raw, mechanically deboned products
from nine commercial operations, representing three makes of machines most often used in this process. The analyses
demonstrated that it is practical and acceptable to limit the bone ``residue'' in mechanically deboned poultry and
that the equipment for manufacturing such product can be operated under commercial conditions to produce poultry
product that contains no more than 1 percent of bone. This provision of the 1969 amendments was promulgated to assure
that deboned poultry products are wholesome in accordance with the Poultry Products Inspection Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, it is important to note that at the time of the 1969 regulation, the mechanical separation process was new and
FSIS had limited information concerning the consequences of it. FSIS conducted extensive studies on mechanically
deboned poultry products during the 1970's and monitored the technology improvements during the 1980's. The results
of these studies and the information considered during rulemakings, or other documents considering the need for
rulemaking, regarding poultry and livestock products produced by mechanical separation over the past 2 decades
have shown that there are differences between the mechanically deboned product and traditionally deboned products
(i.e., hand-deboned). The principal characteristics that distinguish mechanically separated poultry product
and boneless poultry produced by traditional methods are bone solids content, and its physical form and consistency.
Informing consumers of such differences via the distinct labeling of the presence of poultry product produced by
mechanical means is supported by the statutory responsibility of FSIS to assure that all labels on poultry and meat
food products are not false or misleading. FSIS received comments that expressed this sentiment in response to its
solicitations for public input in the June 1993 ANPR and the March 1994 ANPR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the March 1994 ANPR, FSIS suggested that, because of the differences in percent bone solids content among mechanically
separated poultry products, which were shown in the data presented in the FSIS report ``Determination of Acceptable
Limits of Percent Bone Solids in Ground Poultry Products,'' the Agency would regulate poultry products produced
by mechanical separation so that producers of a product with a low percent bone solids content that met the established
limitation would be able to label such products without a reference to the mechanical means of processing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In review of the tentative approach presented in the March 1994 ANPR and the comments received in response to this ANPR
and the prior June 15, 1993, ANPR, FSIS now believes that the continuation of the present labeling policy, even for
those finished products with mechanically separated poultry that has a low bone solids contents, does not inform
the consumer that these products contain mechanically separated poultry as an ingredient and that this may result
in misleading labeling. The statutes under which FSIS operates provide the authority to protect the public and prevent
the distribution in commerce of products that are misbranded and are not properly marked, labeled, or packaged. FSIS
believes that the labeling of poultry and meat food products containing poultry product produced by mechanical separation
as an ingredient must inform the consumer of its contents, unless it is clearly demonstrated that any omitted information
would not mislead the consumer or otherwise render the product misbranded. This labeling position must be adhered
to consistently across all types of poultry and meat food products containing mechanically separated poultry as
an ingredient.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS's tentative consideration in the March 1994 ANPR was to define and standardize certain mechanically separated
poultry by concentrating on the product characteristics that the Agency believes distinguishes this product from
poultry produced by traditional deboning methods, i.e., hand-deboning. A different way of defining and standardizing
this product based on starting materials was suggested by one commenter. It was suggested that a certain type of statistical
analysis (factorial analysis) be performed in order to identify a relationship between percent bone solids content
and types of starting materials used to manufacture mechanically separated poultry. By suggesting this type of statistical
analysis, the commenter supported a procedure for establishing a standard that would account for the materials used,
and percent bone solids content limits would vary by the processing procedure employed by the processor. However,
it was never the intention of the March 1994 ANPR to suggest possibly defining and standardizing mechanically separated
poultry by starting materials used. The data collected by FSIS in 1993 and used in the report previously cited, came
from industry records. Information was collected on starting materials but not on the percentages of use nor on processing
parameters, e.g., pressures, settings, used during processing. Thus, data could not be used for establishing process
control parameters or for determining the relationship between bone solids content and other product characteristics,
the materials used, and processing parameters employed by establishments in the study. The purpose of collecting
the data was to examine the levels of bone solids in mechanically separated poultry produced today, and to get an idea
of the variability of the percentage of bone solids contents within an establishment. Information on starting materials
was collected to ensure that the sample of establishments represented the different types of materials used to manufacture
mechanically separated poultry. If in establishing standards for the product, the Agency had intended to use explicit
starting materials to manufacture poultry product produced by mechanical separation, then more data would need
to be collected under known or controlled conditions. FSIS believes that any standard established for mechanically
separated poultry should not preclude a manufacturer from using any type of starting materials so long as the requirements
of the standard are satisfied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, in response to comments about the application of an acceptable tolerance for meeting bone solids content
criteria based on statistical variation, FSIS agrees that the establishment of such a tolerance should be considered.
However, because this issue requires indepth technical review, FSIS will consider it for possible rulemaking in
the future.

The tentative position presented in the March 1994 ANPR indicated that FSIS was tentatively considering that starting
material to be processed into poultry product produced by mechanical separation be processed into this product within
2 hours from the time it is separated from the bones of poultry carcasses or parts of carcasses, except that such product
may be held for no more than 72 hours at 40

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Twenty-seven commenters addressed the issue of handling requirements for poultry products produced by mechanical
separation. All of the commenters disagreed with the need for handling requirements and, specifically, the need
for a time constraint by which the raw material used to manufacture poultry product produced by mechanical separation
has to be processed into such product. Commenters stated that chicken can be held for varying times and still be safe
depending on manufacturing practices, and that the raw materials used need to be organoleptically evaluated and
not set up on a time schedule, i.e., processed within 72 hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenters also stated that there are already adequate regulations on handling and storage, and any additional
handling requirements should be handled in a more inclusive way, e.g., as part of a Hazard Analysis Critical Control
Point (HACCP) effort. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS believes that handling requirements are necessary to produce a safe and wholesome product, and that potential
bacterial hazards are diminished as long as handling accords with good manufacturing practices. FSIS believes that
it is the manufacturer's responsibility, in concert with FSIS', to assure that wholesome materials are used in the
manufacture of its product within sound timeframes, and the safety of such product is not negatively affected.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the data reviewed in the 1979 Health and Safety Report indicate that poultry products produced by mechanical
separation generally are acceptable from a microbiological standpoint, the data also show that where bacterial
loads tend to be higher, it can be attributed to the starting material used. This is not unique to poultry products produced
by mechanical separation; it can be applied to other finely comminuted and comminuted products as well. Common starting
materials for mechanical separated and other comminuted products are products that remain after the removal of a
substantial portion of skeletal muscle or other tissue (e.g., skin) from poultry carcasses or parts of carcasses.
As a result, the resistance of the exposed surface area to microbial penetration has been reduced and the ratio of the
surface area to the volume of total product which is exposed to contaminating influences has been increased. Higher
microbial counts have been associated with the conditions of holding such starting materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Poultry products produced by mechanical separation are not unique; all finely comminuted and comminuted products
present opportunities for excessive microbiological growth because they consist of small particles which have
a greater surface area than most poultry products and because during its preparation any microorganisms that are
present are distributed throughout the product. Therefore, FSIS agrees with the commenters that there is a general
need to address the issue of handling requirements for all poultry products, including finely comminuted and comminuted
products. FSIS is currently developing a separate rulemaking that will deal with this issue more fully and that will
include handling requirements for poultry products produced by mechanical separation, and the materials from which
they are manufactured. Therefore, FSIS will not propose handling requirements for poultry products produced by
mechanical separation in this rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS believes that the promulgation of handling requirements for all comminuted poultry, including mechanically
separated poultry products, and the starting materials from which they are made, would eliminate the need to require
that the temperature of rooms or compartments in which equipment for mechanical deboning of raw poultry is operated
be maintained at 50
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; F or less (9 CFR 381.47(e)). When such requirements are promulgated, FSIS will address the need to rescind 9 CFR
381.47(e).

Protein Quality.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Twenty-five commenters addressed the issue of protein quality for boneless poultry products produced by mechanical
separation. Of the 25 comments, 24 disagreed with the need to have a protein quality requirement for any mechanically
separated poultry product with up to 1 percent bone solids. The commenters stated the following reasons for their
disagreement: (1) the typical U.S. diet provides for an adequate intake of sufficiently high quality protein, therefore,
protein quality is not a public health concern in the U.S.; (2) the U.S. is not a protein-deficient society which requires
every protein source to be the highest ``quality''; a typical diet consists of proteins from a variety of sources and
of varying quality; (3) the Nutrition Labeling Education Act (NLEA) of 1990 indicated that a daily value requirement
for protein quality is not necessary; (4) over a 20-plus year history of producing mechanically separated poultry,
there has never been a problem identified with the protein quality of products manufactured from this low cost ingredient;
(5) processors have no control over the amino acid content of the chicken parts used to manufacture mechanically separated
poultry_it is determined by genetics and not processing equipment; and (6) the protein quality testing requirements
suggested in the ANPR for mechanically separated poultry are expensive, burdensome, and unnecessary.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After careful review of the comments, FSIS is in agreement with commenters that oppose the tentative position that
poultry products produced by mechanical separation must meet a minimum protein quality requirement, i.e., a protein
digestibility corrected amino acid score of not less than 40 expressed as a percent or the alternative measurement
of essential amino acids being at least 33 percent of the total 17 amino acids present. The lack of the need for a protein
quality requirement is founded on scientific literature provided and cited by comments from academia and statements
made by other commenters regarding the status of the quality of protein in diets of individuals in the U.S. The literature
stated that the protein quality of mechanically deboned poultry is comparable to hand-deboned poultry.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Therefore, mechanically deboned poultry can be used in poultry and meat food products without sacrificing protein
quality. According to the literature, during the 20 to 30-year history of the use of MDP in many food products, there
has not been an indication of problems identified with protein quality. Furthermore, consumption of enough high-quality
protein by humans in the U.S. is not a problem. In the preamble of the final nutrition labeling regulations, both FSIS
and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) stated that current evidence suggests that the diet typically consumed
in the U.S. provides for an adequate protein intake of sufficiently high quality to meet the nutritional needs of adults
and children 4 or more years of age (58 FR 632 and 2079). Furthermore, since there are no outstanding health implications
requiring the establishment of protein quality criteria for food products, in general, it would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be unnecessary to require such criteria for a specific poultry product, viz., mechanically deboned poultry.

Nineteen of the 21 commenters did not believe that a mandatory quality control program was needed for the production
of such products. The commenters stated that (1) quality control programs, including partial quality control programs
(PQC), should remain voluntary programs, and (2) that FSIS should focus compliance program efforts on issues of health
and safety of products and allow manufacturers to determine quality parameters. The commenters also noted that they
operate under PQC programs for manufacturing mechanically deboned poultry that are approved by FSIS, and any additional
concerns for assuring their processes are in conformance with current regulations should be incorporated into their
present PQC programs rather than by issuance of a formal requirement through rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS believes that establishments manufacturing poultry products that are mechanically separated must have controls
in place to assure that such products comply with the Agency's proposed definition, standard, and other criteria.
However, after reviewing the comments and re-examining the Agency's current regulatory agenda, FSIS believes that
because there are efforts underway within the Agency to study and address ways of reducing the potential for situations
that would render any poultry or meat food product adulterated, unwholesome, and/or misbranded it is premature to
address the need for a mandatory quality control program for this one distinct category of poultry product. FSIS does,
however, believe that records of achieving compliance with parameters established for mechanically separated
poultry product, e.g., bone solids content and bone particle size criteria, should be maintained to substantiate
that boneless poultry criteria meets the proposed regulatory manufacturing practices.

Protein/Fat. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Nineteen commenters responded to the tentative position on establishing a minimum protein content and a maximum
fat content requirement for poultry product produced by mechanical separation with greater than 0.6 percent bone
solids content. All nineteen commenters disagreed with FSIS' position on establishing such a protein and fat content
requirement for this mechanically separated poultry. The commenters stated that poultry product produced by mechanical
separation is used as an ingredient in ready-to-consume products of which most have established protein and/or fat
standards. Furthermore, the commenters stated that most poultry and meat food products are now required to have nutrition
labeling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS does not agree that ``most ready-to-consume'' poultry and meat food products have established protein and fat
standards, as asserted by the commenters. Standards of identity and composition for poultry and meat food products
generally do not include minimum protein content requirements. Of the products for which standards stipulate a maximum
fat content, most are sausages composed of meat from livestock. There are no fat limitations associated with sausages
made from poultry, according to FSIS policies.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS does agree, however, with the comments regarding the benefits of fat and protein content information provided
by nutrition labeling. Since the products that typically contain mechanically separated poultry, e.g., poultry
sausages, are composed of this ingredient as the majority of their formulation, the nutrition labeling for such product
will primarily reflect the protein and fat contributed by the mechanically separated poultry component. For this
reason, a minimum protein content and a maximum fat content requirement for poultry products produced by mechanical
separation are not needed, given the implementation of the Department's nutrition labeling regulations on July
6, 1994 (58 FR 632). The nutrition labeling regulations require the declaration of protein and fat on the labeling
(i.e., the Nutrition Facts panel) of most multi-ingredient meat and poultry products. Nutrition labeling is now
required on most processed products purchased by consumers in retail stores, and this, together with the Department's
voluntary nutrition labeling program established for retail store information on single-ingredient raw products,
makes FSIS believe that consumers will have sufficient information on protein and fat for most products purchased
for consumption at home. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS further believes that the need to establish a fat and protein requirement is minimized because current regulatory
controls will limit the amount of skin or fat that may be used in formulating poultry products with mechanically separated
poultry. According to the poultry regulations, viz., 9 CFR 381.117, raw materials used to manufacture boneless poultry,
e.g., ``mechanically separated chicken'' and ``mechanically separated turkey,'' must be labeled to reflect the
presence of skin and attached fat when the proportions of skin and attached fat are in excess of that which occurs naturally
on a whole carcass. Therefore, products currently labeled as ``mechanically separated chicken'' or ``mechanically
separated turkey'' contain no more skin with attached fat than that which occurs naturally on a whole carcass, for
which there is no maximum fat content established. Furthermore, like all other animal products, poultry (e.g., whole
carcasses and parts of carcasses) is composed of water, fat, protein, and inorganic matter (i.e., ash). If the fat
content is controlled, the proportion of the other components, including protein, should remain the same as that
which occurs naturally.

Bone Particle Size
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Fourteen commenters addressed the issue of bone particle size in poultry product produced by mechanical separation.
Twelve of the 14 commenters disagreed with restricting the size of the bone particles present in poultry product produced
by mechanical separation to a maximum of less than 1.5 millimeter (mm) in the greatest dimension. Furthermore, commenters
sought clarification of the quantity of particles of acceptable dimension that would be permitted. The commenters
also stated that there is no justification for requiring standardized bone particle size limitations; such a criteria
will result in increased analytical costs to the processor without improving food safety. Other commenters cited
the 1979 report on ``Health and Safety Aspects of the Use of Mechanically Deboned Poultry'' which states that over
90 percent of the bone particles found in mechanically deboned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
poultry are less than 150 microns (0.15 mm) in size and only 1 percent were greater than 400 microns (0.4 mm). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS believes that a bone particle size limitation augments the bone solids content restriction, and is a meaningful
indication of a poultry deboning operation that effectively controls bone breakage. The 1979 health and safety report
recommended that bone particle size be controlled to ensure that equipment type or processing does not result in unacceptably
large bone fragments in mechanically deboned poultry. FSIS agrees with this recommendation and continues to support
its tentative position of restricting the bone particle size in poultry products produced by mechanical separation.
However, FSIS is in agreement with the comments that reflected a need to clarify the parameters for such a restriction.
In order to simplify such a requirement for mechanically separated poultry products, FSIS is proposing that at least
98 percent of the bone particles present in mechanically separated poultry should have a maximum size no greater than
1.5 mm and no bone particles should be greater than 2.0 mm in their greatest dimension. These parameters are similar
to the requirements for bone particle size for MS(S), a similar livestock product.

Limitations on Use.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the March 1994, ANPR, FSIS tentatively proposed that, in certain cases, poultry product produced by mechanical
separation should be restricted from use as an ingredient in other products. It was considered that imposing such
restrictions was necessary for mechanically separated poultry because of the potential fluoride contribution
of mechanically separated poultry made from fowl (i.e., mature female chickens). It was also tentatively suggested
that use restrictions for all poultry product produced by mechanical separation be considered (i.e., any product
with bone solids not greater than 1 percent) based on the characteristics of such product, including the kind of poultry
from which it is made, and its consistency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Thirteen commenters addressed the issue of limitation on use of poultry product produced by mechanical separation,
in general, as an ingredient in other products. Twelve of the commenters disagreed with the general premise of establishing
any use limitations on mechanically separated poultry products because there are no safety or health concerns regarding
poultry product produced by mechanical separation. The commenters also stated that the marketplace is a much better
judge of quality (i.e., use levels of poultry product produced by mechanical separation) than FSIS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 FSIS believes that poultry products that are mechanically separated should not be used in poultry products that are
represented as being composed of whole poultry muscle, other than where it is used as a binding agent (i.e., a substance
that holds muscle pieces together) at a level that is sufficient for this purpose. When used as a binder, it is FSIS'
belief that, without the declaration of mechanically separated poultry as an ingredient on the labels of the poultry
and meat food products that purport to be intact, whole muscle products, the labels of such products would be misbranded.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 It is poultry meat, particularly muscle(s), that characterizes parts and cuts of poultry. The physical and sensory
characteristics (i.e., mouthfeel, texture, color) associated with a part or cut of poultry can be retained when trimmings
removed during processing are reincorporated; and the characteristics associated with the cut remains when there
is chunking, chopping, or grinding of the muscle as in versions of turkey ham product (9 CFR 381.171). FSIS regards
these processes as different than using product made by the mechanical separation of bones with attached poultry
tissue. Poultry product produced by mechanical separation does not, in FSIS' view, retain the characteristics of
the cuts themselves. It appears inconsistent with the basic characteristics expected of products represented as
having been made from a particular part or cut of the poultry carcass, to include this finely comminuted ingredient,
especially when the muscle from that part is essentially intact or has been processed only to the extent of cutting
or grinding. Therefore, FSIS continues to support its tentative position stated in the March 1994 ANPR that poultry
product produced by mechanical separation not be permitted in products expected to be composed of whole muscle or
pieces of muscle, e.g., ``(Kind) steak or (Kind) fillet'' (9 CFR 381.162). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 FSIS agrees with commenters that, except for the potential health effects associated with the fluoride content of
mechanically separated chicken from fowl, there are no health and safety concerns regarding the use of poultry products
produced by mechanical separation. Issues raised in the past concerning cholesterol and calcium content are addressed
by the requirements of the new nutrition labeling. Calcium and cholesterol contents of most foods will be required
as part of the nutrition label. However, FSIS continues to support its consideration, as stated in the March 1994 ANPR,
that poultry product produced by mechanical separation, i.e., any such product with no greater than 1 percent bone
solids, made, in whole or in part, from fowl (i.e., mature female chickens, as defined in 9 CFR 381.170(a)(1)(vi))
not be permitted in baby, junior, or toddler foods. The basis for this is that the fluoride content associated with
mechanically separated chicken made from fowl has potential health implications. There were no data submitted in
response to the ANPR to support opposition to this aspect of use

limitations for mechanically separated poultry.

Product Name and Labeling.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The majority of the commenters (primarily food manufacturers) stated that FSIS should continue with its current
labeling policy regarding mechanically separated poultry that allows the declaration of mechanically separated
poultry as ``(Kind)'' or ``(Kind) meat'' when used as an ingredient in a poultry or meat food product. The commenters
suggested that any changes in the current policy will have a severe economic impact on both the poultry and meat industries.
Many of the commenters stated that, ``since there are no health or safety issues regarding the use of mechanically
separated poultry, nutrition labeling satisfies the remaining issue of the consumer's right to know'' that mechanically
separated poultry is in the foods they consume. Therefore, the majority of commenters supported continuance of the
current policy regarding the product name and labeling of mechanically separated poultry (e.g., as ``chicken''
or ``turkey meat''). On the other hand, a few commenters stated that meat and poultry products should be labeled the
same as Mechanically Separated (Species) (MS(S)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 FSIS must decide whether, under its statutory authorities, consumers would be protected from misbranded and improperly
labeled poultry and meat food products without the separate declaration of mechanically separated poultry by a regulated
term. The intent of nutrition labeling is to assist consumers in making sound choices in terms of nutrients in the diet.
FSIS believes that nutrition labeling provides some of the information about a food that is important to the consumer
in planning a healthful diet; however, it does fully inform the consumer about the ingredients used to formulate a
food product. Rather, it is the ingredients statement on the label of a product that is the labeling feature that informs
the consumer of the ingredients used to formulate a poultry or meat food product. Therefore, FSIS believes that nutrition
labeling, coupled with an ingredients statement that accurately reflects the ingredients that are used to formulate
a product, is necessary to protect the consumer from misbranded meat and poultry products, i.e., improperly labeled
meat and poultry products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 FSIS evaluated the comments that opposed the establishment of a labeling requirement for mechanically separated
poultry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on the ``adverse economic impact'' of identifying this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product by a specific product name in the ingredients statements of products in which it is used as an ingredient, i.e.,
as ``Mechanically Separated (Kind).'' The comments opposing the declaration of mechanically separated poultry
by a specific name associated with a standard did not fully elaborate why consumers would be concerned about its presence
in the products they consume. It was suggested by a few commenters that the name suggested in the tentative position
presented by FSIS was pejorative and that consumers would think that the product they had purchased previously was
now formulated with another ingredient, and would not purchase the product again because it was different or inferior.
However, FSIS believes that such a labeling requirement is necessary in order to fulfill its statutory responsibility
to protect consumers by assuring that the labels of poultry and meat food products are not false or misleading. FSIS
also believes that its continued support of the tentative position stated in the March 1994 ANPR to establish a standardized
name for mechanically separated poultry would be consistent with past Court decisions and regulatory actions regarding
MS(S), a similar product made from livestock, which was determined to be materially different than ``meat.'' Consumers
had the opportunity to provide views on the importance of knowing that MS(S) is an ingredient in their food during rulemaking

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions on MS(S). FSIS' 1982 final rulemaking on MS(S) (47 FR 28214) indicates that material differences in the consistency
and composition of MS(S) place it outside the scope of the product traditionally defined as meat (9 CFR 301.2 (rr)),
and that its differences are such that it should be defined as a distinctive standardized product. Thus, MS(S) must
be identified as a distinct meat food product, e.g., ``mechanically separated pork (or beef),'' and labeled as such
on the products in which it is used as an ingredient (9 CFR 317.2(c) and (f), 319.1, and 319.5) in order to assure that
the labeling of such products is accurate and not misleading. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Currently, products that contain mechanically separated poultry are marketed using trade names that identify any
poultry ingredient they are made up of only by the kind name of the poultry used (e.g., ``Chicken Nuggets'' and ``Turkey
Franks''). FSIS believes that it is appropriate to allow these products to continue to be marketed under such names.
These names have a long and uniform history of use. Revocation of these familiar trade names may be a disservice to consumers
if they are mislead to believe that the products they have been purchasing have changed. Although these products contain
tissues other than whole skeletal muscle tissue, FSIS does not believe that consumers will be mislead by trade names
which only include the name of the kind of poultry from which the poultry ingredients are mechanically separated since
any mechanically separated poultry ingredients will be clearly identified as ``mechanically separated (kind)''
in the ingredients statement. FSIS believes that the ingredients statement is the appropriate labeling feature
to inform consumers of the ingredients used to formulate a product. However, FSIS welcomes comments on the names under
which products containing mechanically separated poultry are marketed.

The Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS is proposing to amend the Federal meat and poultry products inspection regulations to define and standardize,
and establish other requirements for poultry products produced by mechanical separation, including provisions
for the composition and use of such products, and requirements for manufacturing and labeling such products. The
proposal would prescribe a definition and standard of identity for poultry products produced by mechanical separation
with 1 percent or less bone solids content, that requires compliance with certain criteria; e.g., bone solids content
(measured as calcium content) and bone particle size. The proposal also would provide recordkeeping and labeling
requirements, and limitations on use of poultry products produced by mechanical separation. Poultry product produced
by mechanical separation is hereafter referred to as ``MS(K).''

A. Product Definition and Standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FSIS is proposing to prescribe a definition and standard of identity and composition for the finely comminuted poultry
product resulting from the mechanical separation and removal of most of the bone from attached skeletal muscle and
other tissue of poultry carcasses and parts of carcasses which has a bone solids content of 1 percent or less. This product
is commonly known in the poultry industry as mechanically deboned poultry or MDP. While whole carcasses sometimes
are used, the starting materials for this type of processing frequently are parts of carcasses, such as frames, backs
and necks, which contain relatively low proportions of skeletal muscle, or parts, such as breast frames, from which
most of the skeletal muscle already has been removed by traditional deboning techniques. The starting materials,
which may have undergone an initial bone breaking process, are pushed under high pressure through equipment with
apertures that allow a small amount of powdered bone to pass through with the soft tissue. Such starting material is
in natural proportion with regard to skin and attached fat; if skin and fat is in excess of proportions found naturally
on a whole carcass, the product is labeled to reflect the presence of skin and fat according to 9 CFR 381.117(d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MS(K) differs from poultry products produced by traditional deboning techniques (e.g., hand-deboning) in its highly
comminuted and spread-like consistency and in its content of bone and associated tissue, as well as muscle, skin,
and fat. In view of the differences between MS(K) and boneless poultry derived by traditional methods (e.g., hand-deboning),
it appears inappropriate to continue to include MS(K) within the category of ``boneless poultry products'' (9 CFR
381.117(d)). Instead, FSIS is proposing to define it as a distinct poultry product ingredient and standardize its
characteristics under subpart P of the poultry products inspection regulations (9 CFR 381, subpart P). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS is proposing that the boneless poultry products regulation (9 CFR 381.117(d)) no longer apply to MS(K). Consequently,
the current restriction on bone solids content in this regulation, as enforced by limiting calcium content, will
be included with other compositional requirements in an MS(K) standard. Moreover, as a standardized product, MS(K)
would be differentiated from other poultry product ingredients and it would be designated in the ingredients statements
on finished product labels by the name specified in its definition and standard, in accordance with 9 CFR 317.2(c)(2)
and (f)(1) and 381.118(a). Product failing to meet the bone solids content or bone particle size restrictions of the
standard must be labeled as ``Mechanically Separated (Kind) For Further Processing'' and may only be used in producing
poultry extractives, including fats, stocks, and broths because the manufacturing process completely removes
the bone solids and bone particles.

1. Product name.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 FSIS is proposing to define the standardized product that is finely comminuted and results from the mechanical separation
and removal of most of the bone from poultry carcasses and parts of carcasses by a distinctive name. FSIS is proposing
that such product be called ``Mechanically Separated (Kind) (MS(K)).'' It appears to accurately and concisely describe
the product that materially differs in composition and consistency from traditional hand-deboned product, indicating
the nature of the process by which and the kind of poultry from which it is made. The proposed name includes ``(Kind)''
rather than ``poultry'' to make it clear that the kind of poultry (9 CFR 381.1(b)(40)) from which the product is made
is specified (e.g., ``Mechanically Separated Chicken''). By including ``(Kind)'' in the proposed name, FSIS is
acknowledging that skin and attached fat may be present such that the proportion is consistent with that which occurs
naturally on a whole poultry carcass. If skin and attached fat are present at levels exceeding natural proportions,
as defined for boneless poultry products (9 CFR 381.117(d)), it must be labeled.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As previously indicated, FSIS believes that MS(K) differs sufficiently from boneless poultry products produced
by traditional hand-deboning techniques that it should be regulated as separate, standardized ingredients. FSIS
is aware that other descriptions have been associated with poultry products produced by mechanically separation.
In addition to the use of terminology such as ``finely comminuted'' poultry to specify the form of the product and ``mechanically
deboned'' poultry, such product has been referred to as ``mechanically separated' poultry within the meat and poultry
industries. FSIS believes that where a distinguishing characteristic of a standardized product is, its bone solids
content, it would be inappropriate to define it by a name that includes the term ``deboned'' and use of this term in labeling
might mislead consumers by implying such product contains no bone. FSIS will, however, welcome comments on other
names that accurately reflect the process from which this product is derived, as well as its form and consistency.

Bone solids content.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 FSIS is proposing that the definition and standard for MS(K) incorporate the existing restriction on the bone solids
content of mechanically separated poultry products of not more than 1 percent (9 CFR 381.117(d)). Because this restriction
is enforced by measuring calcium content, FSIS believes the definition and standard for MS(K) should include maximum
calcium content levels of not more than 0.235 percent in product made from turkeys or mature chickens or 0.175 percent
in product made from other poultry, as a measure of bone solids content based on the weight of product that has not been
heat treated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As previously discussed, FSIS adopted the 1 percent bone solids restriction after appraising the operating results
in a series of poultry establishments using mechanical deboning equipment, analyzing 485 samples of raw product,
and concluding that existing equipment can be operated under commercial conditions to produce product which meets
this limit (34 FR 13991). When processors applied the mechanical deboning technology to poultry products such as
fowl frames that had been heat treated using various cooking methods, FSIS modified its procedures to take into account
weight loss that can occur with cooking. Thus, the practice has been to permit an allowance for weight loss in order
to reflect the bone solids content that would have been present if heat treatment had not occurred; and the adjusted
level may not exceed 1 percent. The ``Chemistry Laboratory Guidebook,'' U.S. Department of Agriculture (section
6.010F, page 6&hyph;33),
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

After evaluating data on substances of potential concern that may tend to concentrate in bone, the 1979 report on health
and safety aspects of the use of mechanically deboned poultry did not recommend any change in the existing bone solids
limit. Because enforcement is based on calcium content analyses; however, rather than direct measurements of bone
solids, FSIS believes that an amended poultry products inspection regulation should include the maximum amount
of calcium permitted in determining whether mechanically separated poultry is in compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS has developed two different calcium content levels for this purpose. Both of these levels account for the fact
that poultry tissues, other than bone, contain some calcium. The higher level_0.235 percent_reflects the greater
proportion of calcium in the bones of mature chickens and turkeys as compared with young chickens (i.e., the lower
ratio of bone solids to calcium). The lower level_0.175 percent_has been used by FSIS in enforcing the 1 percent restriction
on product made from young chickens. Both of these calcium levels are equivalent to 1 percent bone solids using the
conversion formulas for calculating bone solids from calcium on a weight basis.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since FSIS is proposing a definition and standard that includes potential types of mechanically separated product,
FSIS would allow 0.175 percent calcium as the maximum for all MS(K) that is made from poultry other than turkeys or mature
chickens. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The inclusion of these calcium content levels in the proposed definition and standard should not be misinterpreted
as indicating a concern about the amount of the essential nutrient calcium that is provided by poultry and meat food
products. FSIS agrees with the findings in the 1979 health and safety report that, even assuming all further processed
poultry were made with mechanically deboned poultry (i.e., a far greater level of production and use than actually
occurs), the projected calcium contribution of such products would represent only a negligible increase in per capita
daily intakes and cannot be considered hazardous, particularly since the dietary intake of a large sector of the population
may be below the recommended level of calcium consumption.

In addition, the ``Chemistry Laboratory Guidebook'' (section 6.010F, page 6&hyph;33) has been revised to include
a procedure that could be applied to mechanically separated product made in part from mature chickens. That procedure
involves a determination of the relative mature and young chicken proportions when product is made from a combination
of young and mature chickens.

Bone particle size. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS is proposing that at least 98 percent of the bone particles present in MS(K) be restricted to a maximum size no greater
than 1.5 millimeter (mm) in their greatest dimension and no bone particles shall be larger than 2.0 millimeter in their
greatest dimension. The need to limit the size of bone particles in MS(K) has been acknowledged since the poultry industry
began to use mechanical methods for manufacturing this product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS' objective is that the limitation imposed be adequate to prevent any digestibility problems while not restricting
the operation of equipment in accordance with good manufacturing practices more than is necessary for this purpose
or to protect finished product quality. In the 1979 health and safety report, it was recommended that bone particle
size be controlled to ensure that equipment type or processing does not result in unacceptably large fragments. The
report concluded that, provided this is done, the bone particles in the product will not present any health hazard
because of size or hardness.

FSIS is also proposing that establishments that manufacture MS(K) maintain records of bone solids content and bone
particle size as a measure of process control. These records must be made available to the inspector and any other duly
authorized representative of the Secretary upon request.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Limitations on Use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS is proposing certain limitations with respect to the use of MS(K) in the formulation of poultry and meat food products.
FSIS is proposing such restrictions based on the potential fluoride contribution of MS(K) made from fowl (i.e., mature
female chickens) and the characteristics of MS(K), including the kind of poultry from which it is made and its consistency.
FSIS believes that such requirements are necessary to prevent potential health and safety problems, and to maintain
the quality and integrity of the poultry and meat food product supply. FSIS is also proposing that MS(K) may be used,
except in certain cases, in any product defined by regulatory standards or Agency policies whereby ``(Kind)'' or
``(Kind) Meat'' are being used, provided that it is identified as ``Mechanically Separated (Kind).'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Kind of product limitation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS is proposing that when a poultry product is required to be prepared from a particular Kind or Kinds of poultry (e.g.,
chickens), use of MS(K) of any other kind (e.g., mechanically separated turkey) would not be permitted. This provision
would assure that MS(K) made from a different kind of poultry is not used in a poultry product represented as containing
ingredients from a particular kind or kinds of poultry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed definition and standard for MS(K) covers MS(K) prepared from any kind of poultry. FSIS would not permit
use of MS(K) as an ingredient in any given poultry product regardless of the kind of poultry from which it is made. Such
action would be inconsistent with existing regulatory requirements and could, among other things, result in false
or misleading labeling. For example, the definition and standard for ``(Kind) patties'' (9 CFR 381.160) requires
that poultry product ingredients be ``of the kind indicated'' (e.g., turkey products in turkey patties). FSIS believes
that proposing to provide for the use of MS(K) as a distinctive poultry product ingredient should not abrogate this
requirement (e.g., to not permit use of mechanically separated chicken in turkey patties).

Limitations on product made from fowl. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS is proposing that the use of mechanically separated chicken made, in whole or in part, from fowl (i.e., mature
female chickens, as defined in 9 CFR 381.170(a)(1)(vi)) not be permitted in baby, junior, or toddler foods. These
restrictions are based on the potential fluoride contribution of product made from fowl to dietary intakes. The 1979
health and safety report found only slight differences between the fluoride content of MS(K) made from poultry other
than fowl and that of poultry products produced by traditional deboning techniques, but considerably higher amounts
in MS(K) made from fowl.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS believes that conclusions reached in the 1979 health and safety report regarding fluoride content of MS(K) from
fowl and MS(K) from all other poultry sources have not changed significantly. FSIS believes that the data reported
in the 1979 health and safety report are currently the best available on this subject and the conclusions reached are
valid. However, FSIS is aware that the benefits of fluoride in the diet continues to be studied by the scientific community
and that more information is available today on the subject than in 1979 when the Agency published the health and safety
report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1993 National Academy of Sciences' Subcommittee on Health Effects of Ingested Fluoride report titled, ``Health
Effects of Ingested Fluoride'' (NAS Fluoride Report),

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 commissioned by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provides current information on the complexities of
assessing effects of fluoride in the diet and makes recommendations for further research. The NAS Fluoride Report
cites dental products containing fluoride (topical fluoride applications by dentists, fluoride supplementation,
and ingestion of fluoride dentifrices), beverages made with water containing fluoride (tea and coffee, as well as
manufactured drinks), and foods as being the major sources of ingested fluoride. The NAS Fluoride Report points out
that, while ingestion of fluoride from some sources may have gone up, some food sources of fluoride have gone down.
For example, ingestion of fluoride from infant formulas (a source of dietary fluoride considered in the 1979 health
and safety report) has gone down because of the agreement among the producers of infant formulas to use only water low
in fluoride for all their products. The changing sources of fluoride ingestion makes assessing intakes and effects
on populations inherently difficult. In the modern U.S. environment, people are exposed to fluoride from food, beverages,
toothpaste, and a variety of prescribed or over-the-counter dental products.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While the NAS Fluoride Report reiterates the positive effects of increased fluoride intake on reduction of dental
caries in the 1990's as compared to the 1950's, it also cites the side effect of dental fluorosis, e.g., too much fluoride
ingested in early childhood while teeth are forming. Dental fluorosis occurs when the enamel covering of the teeth
fails to crystallize properly, leading to defects that range from barely discernible to severe brown stain, surface
pitting, and brittleness. The report states that ``the most effective approach to controlling the prevalence of
severity of dental fluorosis, without jeopardizing the benefits of fluoride to oral health, is likely to come from
more judicious control of fluoride in foods, processed beverages, and dental products, especially those items used
by young children.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS agrees with this conclusion and maintains its concern for the potential effect of fluorosis in the susceptible
population of babies, infants, and toddlers. Therefore, FSIS believes that the tentative position set forth in its
March 1994 ANPR previously discussed, to restrict the use of MS(K) made from fowl in baby (i.e., strained), junior,
and toddler foods is prudent. However, FSIS is requesting that commenters provide to the Agency any information that
would either reaffirm or contradict the conclusions reached in the 1979 health and safety report. FSIS intends to
reassess and update the 1979 health and safety report regarding fluoride in light of information submitted in response
to this proposal.

Poultry product limitations. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS believes that the use of MS(K) should be limited in certain poultry products. FSIS is proposing that MS(K) should
not be allowed in poultry products that are composed of whole poultry muscle, and expected to be as such by consumers,
except that it may be used for binding purposes at a level that is sufficient for purpose. However, FSIS will allow MS(K)
in the sauce portion or any dressing of poultry products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MS(K) is a highly comminuted ingredient with a spread-like consistency and FSIS considers its use to be inconsistent
with the basic characteristics associated with poultry products that have been processed only to the extent of cutting
or grinding or that are made from poultry products so processed, such as chicken breasts, turkey fillets, and shredded
chicken. FSIS also considers their use to be inconsistent with the basic characteristics associated with poultry
products that are processed, convenience versions of ready-to-cook poultry or cuts or solid pieces of poultry or
poultry meat, such as roasted chicken, boned turkey with natural juices, chicken a la Kiev, and turkey ham. FSIS is
proposing that the use of MS(K) not be permitted in these products. FSIS recognizes, however, that these types of products
sometimes are prepared with components the characteristics of which are not inconsistent with those of MS(K).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is poultry meat, particularly muscle(s), that characterizes parts and cuts of poultry. The characteristics associated
with a cut can be retained when trimmings removed during processing are reincorporated; and the association with
the cut remains when there is chunking, chopping, or grinding of the muscle as in versions of turkey ham product (9 CFR
381.171). FSIS regards these processes as different than using product made by the mechanical separation of bones
with attached poultry tissue. MS(K) does not, in FSIS' view, retain the characteristics of the cuts themselves. It
appears inconsistent with the basic characteristics expected of products represented as having been made from a
particular part or cut of the poultry carcass, to include this finely comminuted ingredient, except as discussed
above, especially when the muscle from that part is essentially intact or has been processed only to the extent of cutting
or grinding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS is proposing no restrictions on the amount of MS(K) that can be used in poultry products, or meat food products,
in which it is a permitted ingredient. However, prevailing standards for particular products may contain quantitative
limits (e.g., the limit on the amount of poultry product ingredients permitted in cooked sausages such as frankfurters
and bologna (9 CFR 319.180)) or other restrictions on the quantity of various poultry product ingredients.

Labeling
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FSIS is proposing special provisions for the labels of MS(K). If adopted, these provisions would supplement other,
more general requirements for such labels (see 9 CFR Parts 317 and 381, Subpart N). The provisions are discussed below.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The product.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 FSIS is proposing the following labeling provisions for MS(K): (1) the name of the product (e.g., ``Mechanically
Separated (Kind)'' must be followed immediately by the phrase(s) ``made from fowl'' unless it is not made, in whole
or part, from mature female chickens, and ``with excess skin'' unless it is made from poultry product that does not
include skin in excess of the natural proportion present on the whole carcass; and (2) there must be appropriate descriptive
terminology in the labeling of MS(K) if heat treatment has been used in the preparation of such product, e.g., ``cooked.''
Because the characteristics described in (1) and (2) above are ones which would affect the use of MS(K), FSIS is proposing
that, in order to assure compliance with regulatory requirements and thereby prevent the adulteration and misbranding
of finished poultry products and meat food products, such characteristics must be clearly identified on the label
when MS(K) leaves the establishment at which it is manufactured. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated previously, the regulations already require that information on use, including deviations from the
natural whole carcass proportion of skin as well as the fact of cooking, appear on the label of boneless poultry products
produced by mechanical separation (9 CFR 381.117(d)). The presence of skin or its presence in excess of the natural
whole carcass proportion would, as discussed previously, continue to affect product use if the regulations are amended.
The use of heat treatment in the preparation of the product also would be of continuing relevance (9 CFR 381.157(a)).
In addition, since the presence of poultry kidneys or sex glands can affect use (9 CFR 319.180(b)), a number of manufacturers
of MS(K) not containing these parts currently choose to note this fact on the label. The other information that would
be required is identification of product made from fowl. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Finished poultry products and meat food products.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As indicated above in the discussion of FSIS' proposed definition and standard for MS(K), FSIS is proposing that in
view of the differences between MS(K) and poultry products produced by traditional hand-deboning techniques, MS(K)
should be regulated as a distinctive ingredient with standardized characteristics. Therefore, FSIS is proposing
to define such product by its own name, e.g., ``Mechanically Separated (Kind),'' that would be declared in the ingredients
statements on finished product labels by the name specified in its definition and standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS recognizes the importance of the identification of the calcium and cholesterol content of MS(K) to consumers
who, according to the comments received on the June 15, 1993, ANPR (58 FR 33040), indicated a desire to know of the presence
of calcium and cholesterol. The nutrition labeling regulations, effective July 6, 1994, require mandatory declaration
of calcium and cholesterol content on most processed meat and poultry products which addresses this particular labeling
concern. FSIS believes that nutrition labeling is the most appropriate vehicle for conveying a product's nutrient
content, which includes calcium and cholesterol, as well as other nutrient information.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule has been determined to be significant and has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget
under Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Total federally inspected broiler and turkey meat production in the U.S. in 1993 was about 27 billion pounds on a ready
to cook basis. (Broiler represents the majority of chickens grown and slaughtered in the U.S.) Broiler production
was 22.2 billion pounds and turkey 4.8 billion pounds. Continued growth in poultry production has resulted in large
increases in the volume of poultry meat going into further processed products, many of which use MS(K). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS has estimated that 1 billion pounds of poultry product is processed annually into MS(K), with a yield of 70%, or
700 million pounds of MS(K) product for human use. (Industry sources suggest that a larger amount of MS(K) product
is produced annually.) FSIS estimated that 400 million pounds is used in sausage products and 300 million pounds in
patties and nuggets. The estimated size of the market does not directly affect the cost estimates below because these
depend on the number of label changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Broiler Council estimates that broiler meat is produced in around 200 establishments, of which 50 are further
processing establishments. MS(K) is produced in around 108 establishments. About 25&hyph;30 of these establishments
with MS(K) equipment produce hot dogs. The product from the other 75&hyph;80 establishments is sold to poultry further
processors or to red meat processors. Industry sources indicate that some small firms specialize in MS(K) production,
buying carcasses from poultry slaughter establishments for further processing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on inspection task records, FSIS estimates that 108 establishments produced (or are capable of producing)
poultry MS(K). MS(K) production by establishment size is not available from FSIS. However, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
total
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 further processed product production by size of establishments shows 7 establishments with production less than
10,000 pounds of MS(K) annually. The average production of the 108 establishments is 51 million pounds of all further
processed products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed rule, products containing mechanically separated poultry would require that it be labeled as
``Mechanically Separated (Kind)'' in the list of ingredients. There is no precise information on the total number
of products that contain MS(K). FSIS indicated there are 602,000 approved labels for poultry and meat, not all of which
are necessarily in use. These include 529 labels for specific MS(K). There is also an unknown number of labels for products
containing MS(K) such as frankfurters, chili, bologna, poultry baby foods, chicken nuggets or patties. FSIS estimates
that in a total about 5,000 products would require relabeling. There is no currently available data on the size breakdown
of the establishments producing products containing MS(K).

A. Labeling  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the proposed rule, final products containing mechanically separated poultry would require ingredient statement
labeling of the mechanically separated poultry as ``Mechanically Separated (Kind).'' Estimates range from $200
to $3,000 per product for a simple product ingredient label change depending on the type of label. Comments in response
to the March 1994 ANPR indicate that most labels would fall in the lower end of this range (about $600). Assuming an average
cost of $1,000 per product, the cost of relabeling would be $5 million ($1,000 times 5,000 products). Doubling the
average cost per product to $2,000 increases the labeling cost to $10 million. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Labeling costs could be reduced to the extent mandated MS(K) label changes can be coordinated with other label changes
planned or required during the period of promulgation of the MS(K) rule and its enforcement. Many firms routinely
make label changes for existing products. For example, about 50% of the 180,000 labels submitted to FSIS each year
for approval are for label changes on existing products. Also, a FSIS policy directive effective July 25, 1994 requires
widespread changes in meat and poultry ingredient statement labeling by August 8, 1995. To the extent MS(K) label
changes could be worked in with these changes, less additional cost would be incurred.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some firms may discard non-compliant labels when the proposed rule goes into effect. A survey of meat and poultry companies
for the nutritional labeling rule indicated that firms carry an average label inventory of 5 to 6 months. Thus, inventory
losses would be minor under a 12 month or longer compliance period. Assuming an average inventory discard cost of $30
per product results in an estimated inventory transition cost of $150,000 ($30 times 5,000 products).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A new requirement limits maximum bone particle size. FSIS believes bone particle size will not have a significant
effect on actual production. For an establishment already performing bone content tests, FSIS believes an additional
5 minutes per test is sufficient to add the bone particle size test and record results. Good manufacturing practices
would require that such tests be conducted at least once per day per shift. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Annual costs to perform and record test results for the 108 establishments are estimated at $74,000. This assumes
an average of 1.75 shifts per day establishment, 260 operating days per year, 5 additional minutes per test, and a labor
cost of $18 per hour.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Information from industry indicates that many establishments currently maintain records for bone solids content
so minimal additional burden is added by the proposed recordkeeping requirement. New recordkeeping requirements
would apply to bone particle size testing. FSIS estimates that each establishment will average an additional 15 minutes
per day on records maintenance. Annual costs of additional records maintenance for the 108 establishments are estimated
at $84,000. This assumes 260 operating days per year and a labor cost of $12 per hour.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Benefits derived from the proposed regulation arise from consumers being assured that labeling for products containing
MS(K) would not be false or misleading. The description of ingredients will change, but the physical product itself
will remain unchanged. The Agency does not expect any market-wide effects. No estimates exist regarding how consumers
value such information. However, the Agency believes the value of avoiding false and misleading information exceeds
the cost of labeling. The Agency is seeking additional information and data from commenters on the impact this proposal
could have on markets and the value consumers place on this type of labeling information.

This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. States and local jurisdictions
are preempted under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) and the Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA) from imposing
with respect to the premises, facilities, and operations of federally inspected establishments any requirements
that are in addition to, or different than, those imposed under the FMIA or PPIA. States and local jurisdictions may,
however, impose recordkeeping and other requirements within the scope of section 202 of the FMIA and section 11 of
the PPIA, if consistent therewith, with respect to any such federally inspected establishment. States and local
jurisdictions are also preempted under the FMIA and the PPIA from imposing any marking, labeling, packaging, or ingredient
requirements on federally inspected meat and poultry products that are in addition to, or different than, those imposed
under the FMIA and PPIA. States and local jurisdictions may, however, exercise concurrent jurisdiction over meat
and poultry products that are outside official establishments for the purpose of preventing the distribution of
meat and poultry products that are misbranded or adulterated under the FMIA or PPIA, or, in the case of imported articles,
which are not at such an establishment, after their entry into the United States. Under the FMIA and PPIA, States that
maintain meat and poultry inspection programs must impose requirements that are at least equal to those required
under the FMIA and PPIA. The States may, however, impose more stringent requirements on such State inspected products
and establishments.

 No retroactive effect will be given to this proposed rule. The administrative procedures specified in 9 CFR 306.5
and 381.35 must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this proposed rule, if the challenge
involves any decision of a program official. The administrative procedures specified in 9 CFR parts 335 and 381, subpart
W, must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the application of the provisions of this proposed rule with
respect to labeling decisions.

Effect on Small Entities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The Administrator has determined that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities, as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601). It is likely that producers
with smaller lot sizes would have higher compliance costs per pound of product because some costs such as testing and
recordkeeping occur on a lot basis. Any relabeling costs also would be lower per pound for products with large annual
production. No data is available which gives the establishment size breakdown for establishments producing products
containing MS(K).

Paperwork Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
This proposed rule would require establishments to maintain records of bone solids content and bone particle size
as a measure of process control, and to make such records available to any duly authorized representative of the Secretary.
This proposed rule would also require labels of poultry products produced by mechanical separation (i.e., products
currently termed mechanically deboned poultry or MDP) or products containing this ingredient to be revised to include
in the ingredients statements the regulated term ``Mechanically Separated (Kind)'' and be submitted to FSIS for
approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The paperwork requirements contained in this proposed rule have been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget
for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) ``Mechanically Separated (Kind)'' is any finely comminuted product resulting from the mechanical separation
and removal of most of the bone from attached skeletal muscle and other tissue of poultry carcasses and parts of carcasses
that may or may not contain skin with attached fat and meeting the other provisions of this section. Examples of such
product are ``Mechanically Separated Chicken'' and ``Mechanically Separated Turkey.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) ``Mechanically Separated (Kind)'' shall not have a bone solids content of more than 1 percent. At least 98 percent
of the bone particles present in ``Mechanically Separated (Kind)'' shall have a maximum size no greater than 1.5 mm
(millimeter) in their greatest dimension and there shall be no bone particles larger than 2.0 mm in their greatest
dimension. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) ``Mechanically Separated (Kind)'' shall not have a calcium content exceeding 0.235 percent when made from mature
chickens or from turkeys as defined in &sect;381.170(a)(l) (vi) and (vii) and (a)(2), respectively, or 0.175 percent
when made from other poultry, based on the weight of product that has not been heat treated, as a measure of a bone solids
content of not more than 1 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) ``Mechanically Separated (Kind)'' may be used in the formulation of poultry products in accordance with &sect;381.174
and meat food products in accordance with subchapter A of this chapter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Product resulting from the mechanical separating process that fails to meet the bone particle size or calcium
content requirements for ``Mechanically Separated (Kind)'' shall be used only in producing poultry extractives,
including fats, stocks, and broths and labeled as ``Mechanically Separated (Kind) for Further Processing.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) The management of the establishment that produces ``Mechanically Separated (Kind)'' shall maintain records
to support the validity of bone solids content and bone particle size of ``Mechanically Separated (Kind).'' Such
records shall be made available to the inspector or any other duly authorized representative of the Secretary upon
request.

(a) A poultry product required to be prepared from a particular kind of poultry (e.g., chicken) shall not contain ``Mechanically
Separated (Kind)'' described in &sect;381.173, that is made from any other kind of poultry (e.g., Mechanically Separated
Turkey). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Mechanically Separated Chicken described in &sect;381.173, that is made, in whole or in part, from fowl as defined
in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;381.170(a)(l)(vi), shall not be used in baby, junior, or toddler foods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) ``Mechanically Separated (Kind)'' described in &sect;381.173 shall not be used in poultry products that are
composed of whole or intact poultry muscle and expected to be as such by consumers (e.g., chicken steaks, chicken fillets,
and cured turkey thighs), except that it may be used for binding purposes (i.e., to hold poultry muscle together) at
a level that is sufficient for that purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) ``Mechanically Separated (Kind)'' or ``Mechanically Separated (Kind) Meat'' described in &sect;381.173 shall
not be used in the formulation of a poultry product or meat food product, unless such use conforms with any applicable
requirements of the definitions and standards of identity or composition in this subchapter or part 319 of this chapter.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Other than ``Mechanically Separated (Kind)'' made from fowl, Mechanically Separated (Kind)'' may be used in
any product defined by regulatory standards of identity and composition, except those products identified in paragraph
(c) of this section, whereby ``Kind'' or ``Kind Meat'' is being used, provided that it is identified as ``Mechanically

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing that it is withdrawing an advance notice of proposed rulemaking
(ANPRM) on the regulation of dietary supplements that it published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In the June 18, 1993, ANPRM, FDA requested public comment on approaches, consistent with the requirements of the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, for assuring the safety of products offered for sale as dietary supplements. In particular,
the ANPRM requested information on the safety and use of amino acids, or combinations of amino acids, as ingredients
in dietary supplements. Additionally, FDA announced the availability of a report entitled ``Task Force on Dietary
Supplements Final Report'' and requested comments on the recommendations made in the report. FDA received over 6,000
comments to the ANPRM. While some of these comments expressed concern about the safety of dietary supplement products,
most strongly objected to many of the possible courses of action that the agency outlined in the ANPRM.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 25, 1994, President Clinton signed into law the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (Pub.
L. 103&hyph;417). Section 11 of this act declares the June 18, 1993, ANPRM to be null and void and of no force and effect.
It also directs the Secretary (and by delegation, FDA) to publish notice to this effect in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of the comments received, and in light of section 11 of the new law, FDA has decided to withdraw
the June 18, 1993, ANPRM. Therefore, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the agency hereby withdraws the ANPRM that it published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

It has been determined that this notice of proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EO 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Internal Revenue Code, this notice of proposed rulemaking will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

II. Proposed Amendment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated November 8, 1994, Wyoming submitted a proposed amendment to its program pursuant to SMCRA (Wildlife
Monitoring, administrative record No. WY&hyph;28&hyph;01). Wyoming submitted the proposed amendment in response
to the required program amendments at 30 CFR 950.16(aa). The provisions of Land Quality Rules that Wyoming proposed
to reside were: Appendix B, Wildlife Monitoring Requirements For Surface Coal Mining Operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, Wyoming proposes to revise section E, by removing the language ``except migrating and wintering bald
eagles or migrating peregrine falcons.'' After numerous meetings with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Wyoming
Game and Fish Department, representatives of the mining industry, and Land Quality Division biologist, the introductory
sentence of section E is now acceptable to all participants.

Section C: Raptor Production, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of Appendix B was modified to satisfy concerns expressed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and Wyoming Game and
Fish Department. These agencies recommended that the required dates for conducting raptor surveys be changed to:
``on or before mid February.''

 Executive Order 12778
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA
(30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed State regulatory programs and program amendments
submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and
its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other requirements of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been
met.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).

The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The State submittal that is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an economic
analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic effect
upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements previously
promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have
a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart Federal regulations.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The EPA proposes to approve a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of New Jersey for the
purpose of establishing an Employee Commute Options Program. This SIP revision was submitted by the State of New Jersey
to satisfy the statutory mandate that an Employee Commute Options Program be established for employers with 100 or
more employees. Under the New Jersey program, compliance plans must be developed by these employers. These plans
are to be designed to convincingly demonstrate an increase in the average passenger occupancy (APO) of their employees
who commute to work during the peak period of no less than 25 percent above the average vehicle occupancy (AVO) of the
nonattainment area. AVO is defined as the number of employees reporting to all worksites in the program area from 6
a.m. to 10 a.m., divided by the number of vehicles driven by these employees during a typical work week. APO is defined
as the number of employees reporting to a specific site from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m., divided by the number of vehicles driven
by these employees.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 requires employers with 100 or more employees in severe and extreme ozone nonattainment
areas to participate in a trip reduction program. This includes 18 of the 21 counties in New Jersey, excluding the counties
of Warren, Atlantic, and Cape May. EPA issued guidance on December 17, 1992 interpreting various aspects of the statutory
requirements (Employee Commute Options Guidance, December 1992). Although the federal program has been named ``Employee
Commute Options,'' or ``ECO'', the State of New Jersey has opted for the name ``Employer Trip Reduction,'' or ``ETR''.
The program shall be referred to as ``ETR'' for the remainder of this document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The concern that led to the inclusion of the ETR provision in the amended Clean Air Act is that people are driving more
than ever before. In addition, the distances driven per trip have increased considerably. This has resulted in a rapid
increase in the number of vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and has offset a large part of the emissions reductions achieved
through the production and sale of vehicles that operate more cleanly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 It is widely accepted that within a decade, the increased emissions caused by increased VMT and congestion will outweigh
the benefits derived from new less polluting vehicles. Unless this increase in VMT is mitigated, there will be an overall
increase in emissions from motor vehicles. The ETR provision is designed to decrease the use of single occupancy vehicles
and to reduce emissions_beyond what can be and will be obtained via stricter tailpipe and fuel standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Section 182(d)(1)(B) of the amended Clean Air Act requires that employers submit their compliance plans to a state
within two years of the date the State submits its trip reduction plan to EPA. The compliance plans should be designed
to ``convincingly demonstrate'' an increase in the APO for their employees who commute to work during the peak period
by no less than 25 percent above the AVO of the area. New Jersey has established different zones within its nonattainment
areas for the purpose of calculating the AVO. The compliance plans must ``convincingly demonstrate'' that the employers
will meet the target within two years of submitting a compliance plan, or by November 15, 1996 for New Jersey. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 In order to gain approval, a state's submittal must contain each of the following program elements: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The AVO for each zone if the area is divided into zones; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) the target APO(s) which is(are) no less than 25 percent above the AVO(s); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) an ETR program that includes a process for compliance demonstration; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) enforcement procedures to ensure submission and implementation of compliance plans by employers. The acceptability
of these elements as submitted by New Jersey is discussed below.

State Submissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final State regulation, containing AVO zones, was due to be submitted to EPA on November 15, 1992. New Jersey submitted
an incomplete program on this date. On January 15, 1993, EPA notified the Governor of New Jersey that the ETR program
was incomplete and sanctions would be implemented under Clean Air Act section 179 if a complete program was not submitted
within 18 months. On November 15, 1993, New Jersey submitted a SIP revision request containing the required aspects
of the program, including APO/AVO zones and measures to enforce the program. EPA found the submittal complete on December
29, 1993, and thereby stopped the section 179(a)(1) sanction process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following items are the basis for proposed approval of the SIP revision. The State has met the requirements of section
182(d)(1)(B) by submitting a SIP revision that implements all required program elements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Average Vehicle Occupancy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 182(d)(1)(B) requires that the State determine the AVO at the time the SIP revision is submitted. The State
has met this requirement. In 1992, AVO was established by a telephone survey, and based on demographic characteristics,
the State has been divided into two distinct AVO zones. The urban area zone includes the counties of Bergen, Essex,
Hudson, Union, and part of Passaic (municipalities of Clifton, Paterson, and Passaic), and has an established AVO
of 1.22. The AVO of the suburban zone is 1.10 and includes the counties of Burlington, Camden, Cumberland, Gloucester,
Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex, Morris, Ocean, Somerset, Salem, Sussex, and the remainder of Passaic county. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. The Target APO 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 182(d)(1)(B) requires that the target APO must be not less than 25 percent above the AVO for the nonattainment
area. An approvable SIP revision for this program must include the target APO. The State has fulfilled this requirement
by computing target APOs that meet the 25 percent mandate. The suburban zone maintains a single area AVO and APO, but
the single urbanized zone has been divided into three distinct target areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Urban area zones: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Sub-area 1: Urban Core including the Newark central business district, Jersey City central business district,
and Hoboken: Target APO = 1.97 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Sub-area 2: Remainder of Hudson County: Target APO = 1.73 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Sub-area 3: The counties of Bergen, Union, the remainder of Essex and the urbanized area of Passaic (municipalities
of Clifton, Paterson, Passaic): Target APO = 1.46 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These three target zones averaged together produce an increase of 25 percent of the AVO as required by the Clean Air
Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Suburban area zone (area described above): Target APO = 1.38 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Based on the requirements of the Clean Air Act, state or local law must establish ETR requirements for employers with
100 or more employees at a worksite within severe and extreme ozone nonattainment areas. In the ETR Guidance issued
December 1992, EPA states that automatic coverage of employers of 100 or more should be included in the provision.
In addition, states should develop procedures for notifying employers of the ETR requirements. The State of New Jersey
has fulfilled these requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA will allow New Jersey to provide additional time to employers that request an extension. The rule requires employers
to comply by 1996 but allows an extension for the penalties for noncompliance until 1997. This is allowed because the
Clean Air Act states that employers must comply within four years of program submittal by the State. Since the program
was submitted on November 15, 1993, the State may allow employers until November 15, 1997 to comply with the program.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule specifies that a contract employee is defined as working at a location for a least six months over the course
of a year. Employees that work less that six months are not incorporated into the program. The State believes that this
is appropriate since an employee that works less than six months at one location is likely to work more than six months
at another location. Although in concurrence, EPA is not comfortable with a six month period and would prefer a period
of shorter duration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State and/or local laws must require that initial compliance plans ``convincingly demonstrate'' prospective compliance.
Approval of the SIP revision depends on the ability of the regulations to ensure that the Clean Air Act requirement
to ``convincingly demonstrate'' compliance will be met. This demonstration can take on any of four forms or any combination
of these. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One option is for a state to include in the SIP evidence that agency resources are available for a plan-by-plan review
of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employer selected measures to ensure the high quality of compliance plans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A second option is for the regulations in the SIP to contain a convincing minimum set of measures that all employers
must implement. These measures will be subject to review and approval by EPA as adequate when the SIP is processed.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A third option is for the regulations in the SIP to provide that failure of the employer to meet the target APO will result
in implementation of a regulation-specified, multi-measure contingency plan. This plan will be reviewed by EPA
for adequacy when the SIP is processed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A fourth option is for the regulations in the SIP to include financial penalties and/or compliance incentives for
non-compliant employers that are effective enough to result in a significant incentive for the employer to design
and implement an effective compliance plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The New Jersey program is essentially a combination of options 1 and 4, or plan review and penalty assessment. New Jersey
has instituted a certification procedure that utilizes a list of several State approved outside certification organizations.
This list of outside certifiers consists of several private firms and self-employed certifiers, and employers may
choose from this list. The certifiers will review employer plans to assure that they ``convincingly demonstrate''
compliance. Certifiers will look for completeness and other program attributes, but the New Jersey Department of
Transportation will ultimately have the rights to final approval of an employer plan. An employer plan is automatically
approved after 180 days if the certification process has not been completed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, a detailed schedule of financial penalties will be enforced on employers that do not register or comply.
Although the rule provides a means to assess fines which EPA believes are sufficient to deter non-compliance, waivers
are available if an employer shows a good faith effort towards compliance.

4. Enforcement Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
States and local jurisdictions must include enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions in their ETR regulations such as penalties and/or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance incentives for an employer who fails to submit a compliance plan or an employer who fails to meet the APO
targets. Penalties should be severe enough to provide an adequate incentive for employers to comply and be no less
than the expected cost of compliance. A state may meet this requirement by developing a procedure for tracking and
fining non-complying employers. New Jersey's penalties for noncompliance are as follows: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 -->
1_Maximum of $250 for the first two months and $500 for each month thereafter for each work location that fails to submit
a registration form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2_Maximum of $1000 per month for each work location that fails to file a plan or report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3_Maximum of $5000 per month for each work location that fails to achieve the APO target (actual assessment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this penalty for an employer may be waived if a good faith effort is shown). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The rule allows for extensions but does not limit the time period for which they could be granted. The State has indicated
that it has and will continue to limit extensions to six months in duration. EPA is proposing to approve the plan contingent
on the State limiting extensions in this manner. Should EPA find that New Jersey is issuing extension for longer periods,
the agency proposes to initiate the process to disapprove the SIP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule allows hardship waivers but does not limit the duration of the waiver. However, good faith waivers are limited
to one year. In addition, the rule indicates that hardship waivers are to be assessed through the procedures for assessing
good faith waivers. The State has indicated that it interprets the rule as requiring through this provision a one year
limit on hardship waivers also. EPA proposes to approve the program based on this understanding.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Other Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Shifting Commuters Out of the Peak Period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
New Jersey rule allows for shifting commuters out of the peak period while continuing to count the commuters (people
but not their vehicles) as if they arrived during the 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. peak period, which is the most critical
time for emissions which lead to ground level ozone formation. This raises the vehicle occupancy rate because the
number of employees remains stable while the number of vehicles arriving at the workplace is decreased by the number
which arrive outside of the peak period. EPA's policy has been to require employers to calculate their vehicle occupancy
rate by reducing both the number of employees and the number of vehicles so that only those arriving during the peak
period are included in the calculation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that most employers will not be able to take advantage of this to any significant degree because most will
not be able to have employees start outside of the peak period. For those that do take advantage of this provision, the
trips will have at least been shifted out of the most congested periods of the day and the emissions from these trips
will have been shifted out of the key 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. period. Therefore, EPA proposes to accept this approach
by New Jersey. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Trading Credits Between Nonattainment Areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
New Jersey's rule allows trading of credits between employers in the two different severe nonattainment areas in
the State. However, EPA's ECO guidance only allows for trades within the same nonattainment area. EPA's guidance
is based on ECO applying specifically to discrete nonattainment areas; therefore, the trading of APO credits across
nonattainment area boundaries should not be accepted based on an interpretation that the term, ``area,'' in section
182(d)(1)(B) should only be construed to mean ``nonattainment area.''

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under this interpretation, facilities located within two miles from one another, but in different contiguous nonattainment
areas, could not trade credits with one another, but could trade credits with a facility located 100 miles away in the
same nonattainment area. This is not consistent with the policy relating to stationary sources, which can trade offsets
between one nonattainment area and another in the northeast ozone transport region. This policy was established
in a March 31, 1993 letter from John Seitz, the Director of the Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards to Bruce
S. Carhart, the Executive Director of the Ozone Transport Commission. Furthermore, EPA has no reason to believe that
trading would not be equitable across the two nonattainment areas. Therefore, the Region's position is that since
the New Jersey program exists in two contiguous severe nonattainment areas within the State, trading should be allowed
across the nonattainment area boundaries in the New Jersey program, and EPA proposes to accept this provision of the
New Jersey rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Giving Full Credit for Alternative Fuel Vehicles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State's rule allows for not including alternatively fueled vehicles as a vehicle in the calculation of occupancy
rates. EPA's policy has been that alternatively fueled vehicles may be exempted from counting as a full vehicle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that this provision of the New Jersey rule will have a minor impact on the program's effectiveness since
it is unlikely that many employees will have access to alternative fueled passenger cars. It is more likely that some
multi-passenger vans or buses will be alternatively fueled and these will be excluded from the count of vehicles because
of their capacity even without the exclusion for alternative fuels. Therefore, EPA proposes to accept this provision
of the New Jersey Rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Giving Full Credit for Seven and Eight Passenger Vehicles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State's rule counts vanpools arriving at the worksite with seven or eight employees as ``zero vehicles arriving.''
EPA's policy allows only nine passenger and greater vehicles not to be counted as a vehicle arriving at a worksite.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that although this provision in the rule will allow some smaller vans and larger station wagons carrying
seven or eight employees to be excluded from the count of vehicles arriving at a worksite, that this will not be a significant
number of vehicles beyond those already excluded by EPA's policy and will allow employers the flexibility to arrange
for vehicles of a size which best fits their needs. Therefore, EPA proposes to accept this provision of the New Jersey
Rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Conclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this proposal, EPA is proposing to approve the SIP revision submitted by the State of New Jersey which contains the
ETR program. This submittal addresses and implements each of the program elements required by section 182(d)(1)(B)
of the Clean Air Act. As a result, EPA is proposing to approve this submittal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this proposed rule should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future
request for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan
shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation
to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act do not create any new requirements, but
simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the federal SIP-approval does
not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected.
Moreover, due to the nature of the federal-state relationship under the Clean Air Act, preparation of a regulatory
flexibility analysis would constitute federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Clean
Air Act forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

 The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) proposes to approve a request for a State Implementation
Plan (SIP) revision, addressing the Chicago, Illinois ozone nonattainment area, submitted by the State of Illinois
for the purpose of offsetting any growth in emissions from growth in vehicle miles traveled (VMT) or number of vehicle
trips, and to attain reduction in motor vehicle emissions, in combination with other emission reduction requirements,
as necessary to comply with Reasonable Further Progress (RFP) milestone requirements of the Clean Air Act (Act).
The rationale for this proposed approval is set forth below; additional information is available at the address indicated

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION:

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 182(d)(1)(A) of the Act, as amended in 1990 (Act), requires States containing ozone nonattainment areas
classified as ``severe'' pursuant to section 181(a) of the Act to adopt transportation control measures (TCMs) and
transportation control strategies to offset any growth in emissions from growth in VMT or number of vehicle trips,
and to attain reductions in motor vehicle emissions (in combination with other emission reduction requirements)
as necessary to comply with the Act's RFP milestones and attainment requirements. The requirements for establishing
a VMT Offset program are discussed in the April 16, 1992, General Preamble to Title I of the Act (57 FR 13498), in addition
to section 182(d)(1)(A) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For certain programs required under the Act (including VMT-Offset), USEPA had earlier adopted a policy pursuant
to section 110(k)(4) of the Act to conditionally approve SIPs that committed to provide the USEPA with specific enforceable
measures by a date certain. That interpretation was challenged in

, consolidated lawsuits brought in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. In a full
opinion, dated May 6, 1994 (and in a March 8, 1994 Order and April 22, 1994 Amended Order issued earlier) the Court found
that USEPA's conditional approval interpretation exceeded USEPA's statutory authority. While the court did not
specifically address the VMT Offset program in it's orders or opinions, USEPA believes that the court's general conclusion
that the Agency's construction of the conditional approval provision was unlawful precludes USEPA from taking action
to approve any submitted VMT Offset committal SIPs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 26, 1993, the USEPA published a proposed rule (58 FR 62309) to conditionally approve Illinois's commitment
for the VMT-Offset requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of the decision reached in

, USEPA has decided not to go forward with conditional approvals of VMT committal SIPs, but that it would be appropriate
to interpret the VMT Offset provision of the Act to account for how States can practicably comply with each of the provision's
elements. The VMT Offset provision requires that States submit by November 15, 1992, specific enforceable TCMs and
strategies to offset any growth in emissions from growth in VMT or number of vehicle trips, sufficient to allow total
area emissions to comply with the RFP and attainment requirements of the Act.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The USEPA has observed that these three elements (i.e., offsetting growth in mobile source emissions, attainment
of the RFP reduction, and attainment of the ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) create a timing problem
of which Congress was perhaps not fully aware. As discussed in USEPA's April 16, 1992, General Preamble to Title I (57
FR 13498), ozone nonattainment areas affected by this provision were not otherwise required to submit SIPs that show
attainment of the 1996 15% RFP milestone until November 15, 1993, and likewise are not required to demonstrate post-1996
RFP and attainment of the NAAQS until November 15, 1994. The SIP demonstrations due on November 15, 1993, and on November
15, 1994, are broader in scope than growth in VMT or trips in that they necessarily address emission trends and control
measures for non motor vehicle emission sources and, in the case of attainment demonstrations, complex photochemical
modeling studies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The USEPA does not believe that Congress intended the VMT Offset provision to advance the dates for these broader submissions.
Further, USEPA believes that the November 15, 1992, date would not allow sufficient time for States to have fully developed
specific sets of measures that would comply with all of the elements of the VMT Offset requirements of Section 182(d)(1)(A)
over the long term. Consequently, USEPA believes it would be appropriate to interpret the Act to provide the following
alternative set of staged deadlines for submittal of elements of the VMT Offset SIP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this interpretation, the three required elements of Section 182(d)(1)(A) are separable, and can be divided
into three separate submissions that could be submitted on different dates. Section 179(a) of the Act, in establishing
how USEPA would be required to apply mandatory sanctions if a State fails to submit a full SIP also provides that the
sanctions clock starts if a State fails to submit one or more SIP elements, as determined by the Administrator. The
USEPA believes that this language provides the Agency the authority to determine that the different elements of a
SIP submission are separable. Moreover, given the continued timing problems addressed above, USEPA believes it
is appropriate to allow states to separate the VMT Offset SIP into three elements, each to be submitted at different
times: (1) The initial requirement to submit TCMs that offset growth in emissions; (2) the requirement to comply with
the 15% periodic reduction requirement of the Act; and, (3) the requirement to comply with the post-1996 periodic
reduction and attainment requirements of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this approach, the first element, the emissions offset element, was due on November 15, 1992. The USEPA believes
this element is not necessarily dependent on the development of the other elements. The State could submit the emissions
growth offset element independent of an analysis of that element's consistency with the periodic reduction and attainment
requirements of the Act. Emissions trends from other sources need not be considered to show compliance with this offset
requirement. As submitting this element in isolation does not implicate the timing problem of advancing deadlines
for RFP and attainment demonstrations, USEPA does not believe it is necessary to extend the statutory deadline for
submittal of the emissions growth offset element.

The second element, which requires the VMT Offset SIP to comply with the 15% RFP requirement of the Act, was due on November
15, 1993, which is the same date on which the 15% RFP SIP itself was due under section 182(b)(1) of the Act. The USEPA believes
it is reasonable to extend the deadline for this element to the date on which the entire 15% SIP was due, as this allows
States to develop the comprehensive strategy to address the 15% reduction requirement and assure that the TCM elements
required under section 182(d)(1)(A) are consistent with the remainder of the 15% demonstration. Indeed, USEPA believes
that only upon submittal of the broader 15% plan can a State have had the necessary opportunity to coordinate it's VMT
strategy with it's 15% plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third element, which requires the VMT Offset SIP to comply with the post-1996 RFP and attainment requirements
of the Act, will be due on November 15, 1994, the statutory deadline for those broader submissions. The USEPA believes
it is reasonable to extend the deadline for this element to the date on which the post-1996 RFP and attainment SIPs are
due for the same reasons it is reasonable to extend the deadline for the second element. First, it is arguably impossible
for a State to make the showing required by Section 182(d)(1)(A) for the third element until the broader demonstrations
have been developed by the State. Moreover, allowing States to develop the comprehensive strategy to address post-1996
RFP and attainment by providing a fuller opportunity to assure that the TCM elements comply with the broader RFP and
attainment demonstrations, will result in a better program for reducing emissions in the long term. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 14, 1994, Illinois submitted to USEPA a SIP submittal to fulfill the first portion of the VMT-Offset SIP. A public
hearing had been held on the submittal on June 22, 1994. The SIP submittal was found to be complete in a letter dated August
4, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Illinois submitted a 15 percent plan SIP on November 15, 1993. In the 15 percent plan Illinois uses TCMs amounting to
2 tons per day for credit toward the 15 percent reduction. The Illinois 15 percent plan SIP revision request is not yet
complete. The USEPA is proposing to approve the second portion of the VMT Offset submittal after final TCM commitments
are submitted and USEPA makes a favorable finding of completeness on the Illinois 15 percent plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Illinois will submit TCMs as necessary to meet post-1996 RFP and attainment at the same time as the post-1996 RFP and
attainment demonstration SIPs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 182(d)(1)(A) of the Act requires the State to offset any growth in emissions from growth in VMT. As discussed
in the General Preamble, the purpose is to prevent growth in motor vehicle emissions from canceling out the emission
reduction benefits of the federally mandated programs in the Act. The USEPA interprets this provision to require
that sufficient measures be adopted so that projected motor vehicle volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions will
never be higher during the ozone season in one year than during the ozone season in the year before. When growth in VMT
and vehicle trips would otherwise cause a motor vehicle emissions upturn, this upturn must be prevented. The emissions
level at the point of upturn becomes a ceiling on motor vehicle emissions. This requirement applies to projected emissions
in the years between the submission of the SIP revision and the attainment deadline and is above and beyond the separate
requirements for the RFP and the attainment demonstrations. The ceiling level is defined therefore, up to the point
of upturn, as motor vehicle emissions that would occur in the ozone season of that year, with VMT growth, if all measures
for that area in that year were implemented as required by the Act. When this curve begins to turn up due to growth in VMT
or vehicle trips, the ceiling becomes a fixed value. The ceiling line would include the effects of Federal measures
such as new motor vehicle standards, phase II RVP controls, and reformulated gasoline, as well as the Act mandated
SIP requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of Illinois has demonstrated in its submittal of July 14, 1994, that the predicted growth in VMT in the Chicago,
Illinois nonattainment area is not expected to result in a growth in motor vehicle emissions that will negate the effects
of the reductions mandated by the Act. Further, Illinois has projected motor vehicle emissions to the year 2007 and
has not predicted an upturn in motor vehicle emissions. The nonattainment area includes the counties of Cook, DuPage,
Kane, Lake, McHenry, Will and the townships of Aux Sable and Goose Lake in Grundy County and Oswego in Kendall County.
The MOBILE5a model was used to calculate fleetwide on-highway motor vehicle emission factors for future years. The
average summer weekday VMT for 1990 has been estimated to be 140.35 million miles for the baseline inventory. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the years 1990 to 1996, Illinois used a VMT growth rate of 2.7 percent per year for the Chicago nonattainment area.
There are indications that VMT growth may be slowing. Since the future VMT growth can be difficult to predict, Illinois
used three different possible VMT growth rates to project mobile source emissions and demonstrate compliance. Illinois
estimated mobile source emissions at a VMT growth rate of 1 percent, 2 percent and 2.7 percent per year for 1996 to 2007.
The July 14, 1994, submittal lists the predicted average summer weekday VMT for the years 1990, 1996, 1999, 2004 and
2007 at each of the three VMT growth rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The MOBILE5a model was used to estimate motor vehicle emission rates for the specified years as mandatory control
measures become effective. The control measures whose effects were modeled were: The Federal motor vehicle control
program; volatility controls for gasoline and reformulated gasoline; and the inspection and maintenance program
(both the current program to 1996 and the enhanced program from 1996 to 2007). There were no benefits taken for the employee
commute options program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even at the 2.7 percent per year VMT growth rate, no upturn in mobile source emissions is predicted. The July 14, 1994,
submittal demonstrates that emissions will continue to decline through the year 2010. This demonstration meets
the first requirement of the 3 part submittal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 15, 1993, Illinois submitted the 15 percent reasonable further progress plan. This submittal relies
on a 2 ton per day credit from transportation control measures (TCMs) to meet the 15 percent reduction. A listing of
TCMs was submitted with the SIP submittal. On December 9, 1993, the Chicago Area Transportation Study's policy committee
officially adopted this package of TCMs as a component of the Illinois 15 percent plan. Many of the TCMs have already
been implemented and all of the TCMs have been included in the Chicago area's transportation improvement program.
The USEPA requires further documentation on these TCMs before the second element can be fully approved. The further
requirements for Illinois' TCM package are discussed in a May 20, 1994, letter from the USEPA Regional Administrator
to the Director of the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency. At 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this time, Illinois has met the VMT Offset requirement by using TCMs as necessary in the 15 percent plan. The USEPA is
proposing to approve the second element when a favorable finding of completeness on the 15 percent plan is made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The attainment demonstration and the post-1996 RFP SIPs are due on November 15, 1994. Illinois will address any necessary
TCMs to reach attainment and meet the post-1996 RFP in those SIP submittals.

Summary of Findings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the requested SIP revision submittal, Illinois has projected motor vehicle emissions until the statutory attainment
year of 2007 using the most recent population and economic growth projections. These projections went through public
hearing and comment on June 22, 1994. Using a VMT forecast of 2.7 percent per year, these projections show that motor
vehicle emissions are not expected to rise above the ceiling level through the year 2010. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, Illinois has identified and evaluated a number of specific TCMs to reduce single occupancy vehicle usage.
Several of these identified TCMs are currently being implemented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Illinois has met the first requirement of the VMT offset plan. Illinois has demonstrated in the July 14, 1994, submittal
that projected growth in VMT is not expected to result in an increase in emissions from motor vehicles and is not expected
to negate the progress in emissions reductions required to meet attainment of the standard by 2007. In addition, Illinois
has used TCMs as necessary to meet the 15% RFP requirements by 1996. The third requirement is for Illinois to use TCMs
as necessary to meet the post - 1996 RFP and attainment of the standard. This third requirement will be submitted with
the post - 1996 RFP and attainment demonstration SIPs and will be addressed in a future rule.

III. Proposed Rulemaking Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the submittal accompanying the State's SIP revision request, USEPA is proposing to approve the SIP revision
submitted by the State of Illinois as satisfying the first and second elements of the three VMT offset plan requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future notice will inform the general public of these tables. On
January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from
the requirements of Section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for 2 years. The USEPA has submitted a request for a permanent
waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the temporary waiver until such time as it
rules on USEPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive
Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. The OMB has exempted this regulatory action from Executive Order 12866 review.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to any SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq., USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis
assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, USEPA may
certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities
include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations
of less than 50,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on small entities affected. Moreover, due to
the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would
constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Act forbids USEPA to base its actions
concerning SIPs on such grounds. See

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed standards would limit emissions of hazardous air pollutants (HAP) from existing and new wood furniture
manufacturing operations located at major sources. The proposed standards implement section 112(d) of the Clean
Air Act as amended, which require the Administrator to regulate emissions of HAP listed in section 112(b) of the Act.
The intent of the standards is to protect the public by requiring new and existing major sources to control emissions
to the level attainable by implementing the maximum achievable control technology (MACT), taking into consideration
the cost of achieving such emission reductions, any nonair quality and other air quality-related health and environmental
impacts, and energy requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA is also proposing Method 311 with the standards. Method 311 will be used to assist in demonstrating compliance
with the proposed emission limitations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule represents the EPA's first comprehensive regulation of the wood furniture (surface coating) category.
No Federal rules, such as new source performance standards (NSPS), have previously been promulgated for this industry.
In 1990, the Clean Air Act was amended; two titles of the 1990 Amendments affect wood furniture manufacturers, prompting
regulation of this industry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title III of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 was enacted to help reduce the increasing levels of nationwide air
toxics emissions. Under Title III, section 112 of the Act was amended to give the EPA the authority to establish national
standards to reduce air toxics from sources that emit such pollutants. Section 112(b) contains a list of the HAP that
are the specific air toxics to be regulated by national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP).
Section 112(c) directs the EPA to use this pollutant list to develop and publish a list of source categories (industries)
for which NESHAP will be developed. This list of source categories was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 16, 1992 (57 FR 31576) and includes a category for major sources entitled wood furniture (surface coating).
Therefore, the proposed standards regulate emissions of HAP from new and existing wood furniture (surface coating)
operations located at major sources. A major source of HAP emissions is one that emits or has the potential to emit,
considering controls, greater than 9.1 megagrams per year (Mg/yr) (10 tons per year [tons/yr]) of any one HAP or 22.7
Mg/yr (25 tons/yr) of multiple HAP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The control of HAP is to be achieved through promulgation of emission standards under sections 112(d) and 112(f) and
design, equipment, work practice, or operational standards under section 112(h) for categories of sources that
emit HAP. The EPA began the wood furniture NESHAP development process (described in section V of this preamble) in
November 1990. During the information gathering stage, the EPA surveyed more than 850 facilities in the wood furniture
industry in order to assess the many differences in operations and potential control techniques across the industry.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another section of the amended Act that affects wood furniture manufacturers is section 183 of Title I. Section 183(a)
requires the EPA to issue control techniques guidelines (CTG's) for 11 categories of stationary sources of volatile
organic compound (VOC) emissions. The EPA is developing a CTG for the wood furniture manufacturing industry as part
of the requirements of section 183(a). The intent of the CTG is to provide guidance to States for regulating VOC emissions
from wood furniture finishing, cleaning, and washoff operations at wood furniture manufacturing facilities located
in areas of ozone nonattainment. The CTG identifies reasonably available control technology (RACT), which is generally
the minimum stringency that States apply to such sources. The Agency began developing the CTG in the Fall 1989, prior
to initiating the NESHAP. The status of the CTG and the basis for selecting the regulatory alternatives were presented
to the National Air Pollution Control Techniques Advisory Committee (NAPCTAC) in November 1991 at a public meeting
attended by industry and regulatory agency representatives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CTG and the proposed NESHAP are concerned with two different situations. The CTG provides guidance on regulating
emissions of VOC from wood furniture finishing, cleaning, and washoff operations and will likely affect only facilities
located in ozone nonattainment areas only, while the proposed NESHAP will regulate emissions of HAP from all wood
furniture (surface coating) operations nationwide. Although the two situations are different, a source may well
be affected by both. For example, if a wood furniture manufacturer is: (1) Located in an ozone nonattainment area;
(2) uses VOC's that are on the HAP list; and (3) is a major source of HAP emissions and the source's VOC emissions are greater
than the applicability level for the CTG, the source would be subject to both the standards proposed herein and to the
RACT requirements for VOC's imposed by the State regulatory agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due to the potential overlap of this rule and the RACT requirements for VOC's, the EPA developed them concurrently
so that the requirements of the two would be consistent. After the bulk of the information gathering phase of the CTG
and the NESHAP was complete, both the proposed rule and the CTG were developed within the framework of a regulatory
negotiation, described below. Today's rulemaking proposes the NESHAP and identifies the rationale the regulatory
negotiation Committee followed in developing it. The EPA plans to subsequently publish the CTG, including the recommended
RACT, in a guidance document that will be available to all interested parties.

B. Regulatory Negotiation Approach 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA recognizes that there are many issues and challenges in developing, proposing, and promulgating a NESHAP
for this source category. During the winter of 1992/1993, the EPA met with representatives of the industry (including
small and large manufacturers), trade associations, finishing material suppliers, resin suppliers, States, and
environmental groups at public meetings to discuss issues, share information, and assess whether a regulatory negotiation
would be appropriate for this industry. Two exploratory meetings were held for these purposes. After the exploratory
meetings, three public meetings were held in spring and early summer of 1993 to continue to discuss issues associated
with regulatory development. After publishing in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on June 23, 1993, a notice of establishment of the regulatory negotiation committee (58 FR 34011), the first official
regulatory negotiation meeting was held in July 1993. Formal meetings and informal workshops were held over the next
several months to identify and resolve the many issues associated with the regulation of HAP emissions from wood furniture
manufacturing operations. The Committee members are listed in Table 1.

Using various forums, the Committee discussed many challenging issues such as subcategorizing the source category,
the emission data to be used to select the standards, potential regulatory formats, emission limits, work practice
standards, compliance determination techniques, enforcement, and reporting and recordkeeping. Other issues
such as the impacts of the rule on small businesses, the relationship between the proposed rule and the Title V operating
permit program, and the effects of foreign competition were also considered. Given the potential for compliance
with the rule by substituting non-HAP compounds for HAP contained in the coatings (e.g., ethanol for methanol), the
issue of substitution of non-HAP VOC's for HAP was discussed at great length. Another major concern was the possibility
of substituting a more toxic HAP for another HAP. This concern prompted a discussion on the relative toxicity of compounds
used in wood furniture manufacturing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the final negotiating session of the full Committee, many of the major issues were resolved conceptually. Thereafter,
the Committee reviewed drafts of the regulatory language and the preamble and held conference calls and informal
working group meetings to resolve the remaining issues. Some Committee members feel that because the proposed standards
were developed solely for this source category and many of the provisions were developed through a regulatory negotiation
process, which often requires concessions from some parties in exchange for concessions from other parties in other
areas, these proposed standards should not be used as a basis for the development of standards for other source categories.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The emission limitations for adhesives were developed by the EPA outside of the regulatory negotiation process,
because adhesive suppliers were not represented on the Committee. While a Glue Work Group was formed to address gluing
operations, the Committee members decided to suspend the work so they could focus their efforts on finishing, cleaning,
and washoff operations.

II. Description of the Source Category 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The following paragraphs briefly describe the operations covered by the proposed standards for the wood furniture
(surface coating) source category. The EPA has produced a draft of Chapters 1 through 4 of the CTG. These chapters provide
a detailed process description for the many types of wood furniture operations in this source category. Interested
parties can refer to the draft chapters, which may be found in the docket of materials supporting this proposed rule,
for a more detailed description than that provided here. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The wood furniture industry encompasses the manufacture of many diverse products. For the purposes of the proposed
rule, the wood furniture (surface coating) category includes production of the following products and their components:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Wood kitchen cabinets; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Wood residential furniture; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Upholstered residential and office furniture; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Wood television, radio, phonograph, and sewing machine cabinets; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Wood office furniture and fixtures; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Partitions, shelving, and lockers; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Other wood furniture not described by one of the above categories. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Despite the broad range of products manufactured by this source category, some manufacturing operations are common.
There are four basic wood furniture manufacturing operations that are included in the affected emission source subject
to the proposed rule. These are finishing, gluing, cleaning, and washoff. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wood furniture finishing operations include those operations in which a finishing material is applied to a substrate.
Finishing processes differ within the industry, but typically they consist of application of finishing materials,
evaporation of volatiles, and curing of the piece in an oven. Facilities may finish the furniture in components and
then assemble it, but more commonly, the piece of furniture is assembled and then finished. The furniture or furniture
components may be moved manually from one finishing application station to the next, or may be on tow lines that automatically
move through the finishing lines.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The types of finishing materials include stains, basecoats, washcoats, glazes, fillers, sealers, highlights,
enamels, and topcoats that all serve different functions. The number, sequence, and type of finishing materials
varies by the type and quality of the furniture being finished. All of the finishing materials may contain HAP that
are emitted during application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After the finishing material is applied, the wood substrate typically enters a flashoff area where the more volatile
solvents evaporate and the finishing material begins to cure, and then enters an oven where curing of the finishing
material and evaporation of the volatile solvents continues. The evaporation of volatile compounds that are HAP
are the source of HAP emissions from the drying operation. In this preamble, the process of finishing and drying a piece
of furniture or furniture component is referred to as the finishing operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Gluing operations occur at most, but not all, wood furniture facilities. Gluing operations vary from plant to plant
and include the manufacture of composite pressed wood products such as hardwood plywood, and applying laminates
to wood products, veneers to solid wood (or composite wood products), edges to tables or desks, and foam to fabric.
Four major types of adhesives are used in the industry: hot melts, polyvinyl acetates (PVA), urea-formaldehyde (UF)
resins, and contact adhesives. Hot melts are not a source of HAP emissions. Polyvinyl acetate adhesives contain very
small amounts (less than 0.3 percent) of vinyl acetate monomer (a HAP). The UF resins are used primarily in the kitchen
cabinet and residential furniture segments. These resins are a source of formaldehyde (a HAP) emissions, both from
the free formaldehyde in the adhesive and as a reaction byproduct during the cure. Formaldehyde emissions in furniture
manufacturing occur during the use of these resins in the plant and also during storage, use, and cutting of composite
pressed wood products that are used in furniture manufacturing and that contain these resins. (For reasons that are
discussed later, the proposed rule does not address formaldehyde emissions associated with formaldehyde-based
adhesive resins or composite wood products containing these resins.) Contact adhesives contain varying quantities
of HAP as solvent. These adhesives are used for laminating countertops and office furniture and for upholstery operations
such as gluing foam to fabric and fabric to wood. Contact adhesives used for upholstery operations are also known as
foam adhesives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cleaning activities are also common throughout the wood furniture industry. The resins typical of wood furniture
coatings require a high-solvency-rated solvent to dissolve them into the coating mix. Similarly, dried coatings
that must be removed in cleaning operations require such solvents. These industrial solvents sometimes contain
HAP that evaporate when the solvent is exposed to the air and is subsequently discharged to the atmosphere via ventilation
air. Equipment that must be cleaned within a wood furniture plant is typically that which comes in close contact with
the coating material; e.g., application equipment and spray booths. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finished furniture that does not meet specification may need to be refinished; the cured coating is removed by washing
off the old coating using solvent. This process is called washoff.

III. Summary of the Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The proposed standards are summarized below. The rationale for the regulatory decisions made in their development
is provided in section VI. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 -->
A. Applicability of the Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The provisions of the proposed rule apply to new and existing wood furniture manufacturing operations that are located
at plant sites that are major sources of HAP. A major source is defined in the General Provisions to part 63 as ``any stationary
source or group of stationary sources located within a contiguous area and under common control that emits or has the
potential to emit, considering controls, in the aggregate, 10 tons/yr of any hazardous air pollutant or 25 tons/yr
or more of any combination of hazardous air pollutants. *&blank;*&blank;*''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted in &sect;63.800(a) of the proposed rule, the proposed wood furniture rule would apply only to facilities
that are major sources as defined in 40 CFR part 63.2. An important consideration in the definition of ``major source''
is a given plant site's ``potential to emit.'' The ``potential to emit'' is defined in 40 CFR part 63.2 as follows: ```Potential
to emit' means the maximum capacity of a stationary source to emit a pollutant under its physical and operational design.
Any physical or operational limitation on the capacity of the stationary source to emit a pollutant, including air
pollution control equipment and restrictions on hours of operation or on the type or amount of material combusted,
stored, or processed, shall be treated as part of its design if the limitation or the effect it would have on emissions
is Federally enforceable.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A key aspect of the potential to emit definition is that restrictions must be Federally enforceable. Examples of restrictions
that would be considered Federally enforceable are listed in a definition in 40 CFR 63.2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA believes that there are a substantial number of wood furniture facilities whose actual emissions of HAP are
substantially less than ``major'' amounts (i.e., more than 10 tons per year of any single HAP, or more than 25 tons per
year from the sum of all HAP emitted). Many of these facilities, however, would be considered ``major sources'' that
are subject to the proposed rule because there is no Federally enforceable restriction in place that limits their
potential to emit HAP. The EPA believes that the wood furniture rule should provide a mechanism for such facilities
to accept and document such restrictions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The EPA proposes, in &sect;63.800(b) of the proposed rule, that if owners or operators commit to using no more than
250 gallons per month, or 3,000 gallons per rolling 12-month period, of coating, gluing, cleaning, and washoff materials
at the plant site, and if the plant site does not contain other sources of HAP emissions, then the plant site can be considered
an area source to which the rule does not apply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 250 gallon level was selected based upon worst-case assumptions regarding the levels of HAP in the various materials.
The proposed rule would require a commitment to this level, accompanied by monthly records of materials. The EPA requests
comment on: (1) whether an alternative to the 250/3,000 gallon level would be appropriate, (2) the level and type of
reporting needed to document the owner's commitment, and (3) the frequency and nature of the recordkeeping requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA believes that there are sources using more than 250 gallons per month that may emit less than ``major'' amounts,
and for which the owner or operator may be willing to accept case-by-case operating restrictions that would ensure
that the potential to emit does not exceed the major source threshold. The EPA is considering adding language to the
final rule that would provide a mechanism for such sources. The EPA requests comment on (1) whether such language should
be added, (2) the type of reporting and process required to establish the case-by-case commitment, (in particular,
how to establish throughput and content limitations that could ensure area source status), and (3) the types of records
that should be maintained to document compliance with the restrictions. In addition, the EPA requests comment on
whether the level of recordkeeping and reporting should vary, depending on the level of emissions (as reflected by
the throughput and content of the materials used).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA requests comment on the appropriate timing of a wood furniture facility's applicability determination,
and on whether all facilities, regardless of their past emissions or HAP usage, should be eligible to qualify as area
sources under the HAP usage limits. The Agency also seeks comment on whether a facility that is initially determined
to be subject to the rule should be able subsequently to escape applicability, and if so, under what circumstances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated in section II, the wood furniture manufacturing industry encompasses the manufacture of many different
products including cabinets, office furniture, store fixtures, and residential furniture. The specific operations
to which the proposed rule would apply include those that fall under the standard industrial classification (SIC)
codes listed in Table 2.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the purposes of the proposed rule, the affected emission source includes the finishing, gluing, cleaning, and
washoff operations at each wood furniture plant.

The proposed rule includes emission limits and work practice standards; the emission limits are summarized in Table
3. As indicated in this table, the proposed rule would limit HAP emissions from finishing operations at existing sources
to 1.0 kilogram of volatile HAP (VHAP) per kilogram of solids used (1.0 pound of VHAP/pound of solids).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An owner or operator of an existing affected source can comply with this limit by:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Limiting the average HAP content across all finishing operations to 1.0 kilogram of volatile HAP per kilogram of
solids (kg VHAP/kg solids) (1.0 lb VHAP/lb solids), as applied;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Limiting the HAP content of (i) each stain, each sealer, and each topcoat, to 1.0 kg VHAP/kg solids (1.0 lb VHAP/lb
solids), as applied; (ii) limiting the HAP content of thinners used for stains, sealers, and topcoats to no more than
10.0 percent HAP by weight; and (iii) using washcoats, basecoats, and enamels that are formulated at the facility
with coatings containing no more than 1.0 kg VHAP/kg solids (1.0 lb VHAP/lb solids) and thinners containing no more
than 3.0 percent HAP by weight or using washcoats, basecoats, and enamels that have a HAP content of no more than 1.0
kg VHAP/kg solids (1.0 lb VHAP/lb solids), as applied, and thinners that have a HAP content of no more than 10.0 percent
by weight;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Using a control device to limit emissions from finishing operations to 1.0 kg VHAP/kg solids (1.0 lb VHAP/lb solids);
or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. A combination of (2) and (3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated in Table 3, the proposed standards would limit HAP emissions from finishing operations at new sources
to 0.8 kg VHAP/kg solids (0.8 lb VHAP/lb solids), as applied. Owners or operators of new sources can comply with the
proposed standards by:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Limiting the average HAP content across all finishing operations to no more than 0.8 kg VHAP/kg solids (0.8 lb VHAP/lb
solids), as applied; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Limiting the HAP content of (1) each stain to no more than 1.0 kg VHAP/kg solids (1.0 lb VHAP/lb solids), as applied;
(2) each sealer and topcoat to no more than 0.8 kg VHAP/kg solids (0.8 lb VHAP/lb solids), as applied; (3) each thinner
used for stains, sealers, and topcoats to no more than 10.0 percent HAP by weight; and (4) using washcoats, basecoats,
and enamels that are formulated at the facility with coatings containing no more than 0.8 kg VHAP/kg solids (0.8 lb
VHAP/lb solids) and thinners containing no more than 3.0 percent HAP by weight or using washcoats, basecoats, and
enamels that have a HAP content of no more than 0.8 kg VHAP/kg solids (0.8 lb VHAP/lb solids), as applied, and thinners
that have a HAP content of no more than 10.0 percent by weight;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Using a control device to limit emissions from finishing operations to 0.8 kg VHAP/kg solids (0.8 lb VHAP/lb solids);
or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. A combination of (2) and (3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If owners or operators comply with the proposed standards through the use of a control device, the overall control
efficiency that is equivalent to the proposed standards for existing sources is that which results in 1.0 kilogram
of VHAP being emitted per kilogram of solids used. For new sources, the control efficiency that is equivalent to the
proposed standards is that which results in 0.8 kilogram of VHAP being emitted per kilogram of solids used. This control
efficiency will be source-specific, depending on the HAP content and percent solids of the finishing materials used
at baseline conditions. Baseline conditions are those conditions that exist at a plant prior to installing and operating
the control device.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The HAP emissions from cleaning operations are controlled by limiting the VOC content of the strippable booth coating
that is applied to spray booths; this material is used to reduce the need to clean spray booth walls with organic solvent.
Gluing operations are controlled through the proposed rule by limiting the HAP content of contact adhesives to the
levels identified in Table 3. The HAP emissions from contact adhesives can also be controlled through the use of a control
device.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to numerical emission limits, the proposed rule limits HAP emissions from existing and new sources through
the work practices identified in Table 4. These work practices cover finishing, gluing, cleaning, and washoff operations.
The owner or operator subject to this rule is also required to develop a Work Practice Implementation Plan that demonstrates
how the work practice standards will be executed.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At a minimum, the Work Practice Implementation Plan should specifically identify procedures (e.g., checklists)
for confirming: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. That all storage containers are normally closed, that is, closed unless an operator is actively engaged in activities
such as emptying or filling the container; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. That organic solvents are not used for spray booth cleaning, except as allowed by the proposed rule; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. That conventional air spray guns are not in use at any finishing application station, except as allowed by the proposed
rule; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. That cleaning solvent from gun cleaning and line flushing is collected in a normally closed container; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. That the washoff tank is normally closed; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. That dripping from the washoff tank is minimized by tilting and rotating the part to drain as much solvent as possible.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other programs to be incorporated into the Work Practice Implementation Plan include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. An inspection and maintenance (I&amp;M) plan to address equipment leaks from transfer operations; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. An operator training program; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. An accounting system for washoff and cleaning solvents; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. A formulation assessment plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The I&amp;M plan for equipment leaks must require, at a minimum, inspection of all equipment (e.g., pumps, valves,
and flanges) used to transfer or apply finishing materials, adhesives, and solvents. The inspection may be a visual
inspection only, but must be conducted at a minimum frequency of once per month, with repairs to leaking equipment
made within 15 calendar days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The operator training program must require that all new and existing personnel involved in finishing, gluing, cleaning,
and washoff operations be trained. All new personnel, those hired after the effective date of the standard, shall
be trained upon hiring. All existing personnel, those hired before the effective date of the standard, shall be trained
within 6 months of the effective date of the standard. All personnel shall be given refresher training annually. The
training must include, at a minimum, appropriate application techniques, appropriate cleaning and washoff procedures,
appropriate equipment setup, and appropriate management of cleaning wastes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The solvent accounting system must require, at a minimum, that the facility record the quantity and type of solvent
used for washoff and cleaning, the number of pieces washed off and the reasons why, and the quantity of spent solvent
generated from each site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The work practice standards also must require the owner or operator of the affected source to develop a formulation
assessment plan (FAP). The plan requires the facility to track usage of those volatile HAP that are listed in the proposed
rulemaking pursuant to section 112(g) as ``nonthreshold,'' ``high concern,'' or ``unrankable'' (collectively
these are called ``VHAP of potential concern''). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the FAP, each facility would identify a baseline level of usage for each VHAP of potential concern presented
in Table 4 of the proposed rule. The baseline usage level would be the highest annual usage from 1994, 1995, or 1996.
If, after November 1998, the annual usage of the VHAP exceeds its baseline level, the owner or operator of the affected
source must provide a written notification to the permitting authority that describes the amount of increase and
explains the reasons for exceedance of the baseline level. The following explanation would relieve the owner or operator
from further action, unless the affected source is not in compliance with any State regulations or requirements for
that VHAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The increase is de minimis (no more than 15.0 percent above the established baseline); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The facility complies with any State air toxics regulations or guidelines for that VHAP; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. It results from the adoption of low VOC coatings, that is, coatings with a VOC content of no more than 1.0 lb VOC/lb
solids, as applied (the potential increase in HAP being deemed acceptable because it is offset by a decrease in VOC);
or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The usage is below the de minimis values presented in Table 4 of &sect;63.803 of the proposed rule.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the exceedance cannot be attributed to any of the above explanations, the owner or operator must confer with the
permitting authority to discuss the reasons for the increase in usage and to determine if there are practical and reasonable
technology-based solutions for reducing the usage. If there are solutions, the owner or operator shall develop a
plan to reduce usage of the pollutant to the extent feasible. If it is determined that there are no practical and reasonable
solutions, the facility would take no further action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If, after November 1998, a facility uses a VHAP of potential concern for which a baseline level of usage has not been
previously established, than the baseline level would be equivalent to the de minimus level, based on 70 year exposure
levels and data provided in the proposed rulemaking pursuant to section 112(g) of the Clean Air Act, for that pollutant.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As described in Table 4, the Work Practice Implementation Plan, including the I&amp;M program, operator training
program, solvent accounting system, and formulation assessment plan, must be written by the owner or operator and
maintained onsite.

C. Compliance and Monitoring Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Compliance Dates
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The compliance date for existing sources subject to this rule that emit 45.4 Mg (50 tons) or more of HAP per year is November
21, 1997. The compliance date for existing sources subject to this rule that emit less than 45.4 Mg (50 tons) of HAP per
year is 3 years after the effective date of the rule. Existing area sources that become major sources are required to
comply within 1 year after becoming a major source. Once an area source becomes a major source and thus subject to the
regulation, a subsequent decrease in emissions does not allow the source to be exempt from the standards (even if emissions
are decreased to below the major source criteria cutoff). New area sources that become major sources are subject to
new source MACT immediately upon becoming a major source. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Owners or operators of new sources that commence construction after the standards are proposed but before the standards
are promulgated will have to comply immediately upon startup, unless the promulgated regulation is more stringent
than the proposed regulation. In accordance with section 112(i)(2) of the Act, if the promulgated standards are more
stringent than the proposed standards, the compliance date for sources that commence construction after proposal
but before promulgation will be 3 years after the promulgation date, provided the owner or operator complies with
the standards as proposed until the compliance date. All other new sources will have to comply with the proposed standards
immediately upon startup. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Compliance Methods
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sources must demonstrate compliance with the emission limits identified in Table 3 and the work practice standards
in Table 4. A source must first demonstrate initial compliance and then continuous compliance with the standards.
A summary of both the initial and continuous compliance methods is provided in Table 5. Compliance provisions are
specified for the emission limits and for the work practice standards. For all sources, the results of the initial
compliance are reported with the initial compliance report required by &sect;63.9(h) and &sect;63.807(b). Sources
using compliant materials to comply with the proposed rule document their continuous compliance status through
semiannual reports required by &sect;63.807(c). Sources using control devices to comply with the proposed rule
document their continuous compliance status through semiannual reports required by &sect;63.10(e). Other reporting
and recordkeeping requirements are summarized in section III.D. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 114(a)(3) of the amended CAA requires enhanced monitoring and compliance certifications of all major stationary
sources. The annual compliance certifications certify whether compliance has been continuous or intermittent.
Enhanced monitoring shall be capable of detecting deviations from each applicable emission limitation or standard
with sufficient representativeness, accuracy, precision, reliability, frequency and timeliness to determine
if compliance is continuous during a reporting period. The monitoring in this regulation satisfies the requirements
of enhanced monitoring.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Emission Limits for Finishing Operations.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 There are four methods of complying with the finishing material emission limits in the proposed rule as outlined in
Tables 3 and 5. These include an averaging approach, the use of specific compliant materials, the use of a control device,
or some combination of compliant materials and a control device. There are also special compliance provisions for
sources using a compliant coatings approach that apply coatings using continuous coaters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An owner or operator that chooses the averaging approach can demonstrate initial compliance by recording the HAP
and solids content, as reported on the certified product data sheet (CPDS), for each finishing material and solvent
used by the facility in finishing operations and the quantity of each solvent and finishing material that is used.
A CPDS is documentation furnished by coating suppliers or an outside laboratory that provides the HAP and solids content
of the finishing material (or adhesives or solvent), as determined using the EPA Methods 311 and 24, respectively.
The EPA Method 311, which is used to determine the HAP content of a coating or solvent, is being proposed with this rule.
Currently, the method is only applicable for volatile HAP's. A modified version of the test method is being developed
for determining the HAP content of coatings in which the HAP is used as a reactive diluent or the HAP is formed and emitted
during the curing process. After it is completed, the modified version of the method should be used for these coatings.
The owner or operator must then calculate the average kg VHAP/kg solids (lb VHAP/lb solids) for all finishing materials,
as applied, used at the facility using Equation 1 of &sect;63.804(a)(1) of the proposed rule. Initial compliance
is demonstrated if, over the first month after the compliance date, E (the average emission limitation achieved by
the emission points participating in the averaging approach) is less than or equal to 1.0 kg VHAP/kg solids (1.0 lb
VHAP/lb solids) for existing sources or 0.8 kg VHAP/kg solids (0.8 lb VHAP/lb solids) for new sources. Continuous
compliance is demonstrated by performing the same averaging calculation over each and every subsequent monthly
period. A violation of the monthly average would be considered a violation for each operating day of the month, unless
the affected source can demonstrate that the violation of the monthly average can be attributed to a particular day
or days during the month. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An owner or operator that uses compliant finishing materials can demonstrate initial and on-going compliance with
the limits for affected stains, washcoats, sealers, topcoats, basecoats, and enamels by recording the HAP and solids
content, as reported in the CPDS, for each affected stain, washcoat, sealer, topcoat, basecoat, and enamel used by
the facility. The owner or operator must then calculate the kg VHAP/kg solids (lb VHAP/lb solids), as applied, for
each of these materials.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a finishing material is thinned with solvent after purchase, the HAP and solids content reported on the CPDS must
be adjusted to account for HAP from the thinner and the lower solids content of the thinned material. The HAP content
of the thinner must be no more than 10.0 percent by weight. Washcoats, basecoats, and enamels will be deemed compliant
if they are formulated at the wood furniture facility with a compliant coating and thinners containing no more than
3.0 percent HAP by weight. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The owner or operator of an existing source is in initial and continuous compliance with the proposed standards if
the HAP content of each affected stain, sealer, and topcoat is no greater than 1.0 kg VHAP/kg solids (1.0 lb VHAP/lb
solids), as applied; each thinner used for stains, sealers, topcoats, and premade washcoats, basecoats, and enamels
is less than or equal to 10.0 percent HAP by weight; and each washcoat, basecoat, and enamel that is formulated at the
facility is formulated with a coating containing no more than 1.0 kg VHAP/kg solids (1.0 lb VHAP/lb solids) and a thinner
containing no more than 3.0 percent HAP by weight, or each washcoat, basecoat, and enamel that is purchased premade
has a HAP content of no more than 1.0 kg VHAP/kg solids (1.0 lb VHAP/lb solids), as applied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The owner or operator of a new source is in initial and continuous compliance with the proposed standards if the HAP
content of each stain is no greater than 1.0 kg VHAP/kg solids (1.0 lb VHAP/lb solids), as applied; the HAP content of
each sealer and topcoat is no greater than 0.8 kg VHAP/kg solids (0.8 lb VHAP/lb solids), as applied, each thinner used
for stains, sealers, and topcoats, and washcoats, basecoats, and enamels that are purchased premade is less than
or equal to 10.0 percent HAP by weight; and each washcoat, basecoat, and enamel that is formulated at the facility is
formulated with a coating containing no more than 0.8 kg VHAP/kg solids (0.8 lb VHAP/lb solids) and a thinner containing
no more than 3.0 percent HAP by weight, or each one that is purchased premade has a HAP content of no more than 0.8 kg VHAP/kg
solids (0.8 lb VHAP/lb solids), as applied. The use of any finishing material or thinner that does not meet the HAP limits
specified in the proposed rule during any day constitutes a separate violation of the proposed rule for that day. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed standards include special compliance provisions for sources using a compliant coatings approach for
meeting the proposed standards and that are applying those coatings using continuous coaters. With continuous coaters,
any coating that is not applied to the parts to be finished is recycled to the coating reservoir. Solvent is added to
the coating reservoir to ensure the proper mixture of solids and solvent is maintained. In this case, the records may
show that the VHAP content of the coating in the reservoir is above the emission limit and a sample of the coating in the
reservoir may indicate the coating is compliant. While the records are the more accurate measure of the VHAP content
of the coating, they do not reflect that there will be some evaporation of the VHAP from the coating being recycled to
the reservoir. In order to account for this evaporation, the EPA examined special compliance provisions for facilities
using continuous coaters. Affected sources that are applying coatings using continuous coaters have two options
for demonstrating compliance. These are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Using compliant coatings, as determined by the VHAP content of the coating in the reservoir and the VHAP content
of the coating as calculated from records; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Using compliant coatings, as determined by the VHAP content of the coating in the reservoir, and maintaining a viscosity
of the coating in the reservoir that is no less than the viscosity of the initial coating. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency recognizes that records may show the VHAP content of a coating is higher than the emission limitation when
the coating is applied with a continuous coater. However, the Agency also recognizes that continuous coaters are
potentially more efficient than spray application systems. In order to use option (2), the affected source must demonstrate
that there is a relationship between the viscosity of the material and the HAP content of the material. Affected sources
may monitor the viscosity of the coating with a viscosity meter or they may measure the viscosity each time solvent
is added to the reservoir. If an affected source does not wish to monitor the viscosity then records must demonstrate
that the coating is compliant.

In determining compliance, sources using compliant materials (finishing materials, thinners, adhesives) should
include periods of startup and shutdown because startups and shutdowns should not affect compliance with the rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Owners or operators can also comply with the proposed rule by using a control device. Initial compliance is demonstrated
by conducting performance testing in accordance with &sect;63.805 of the proposed standards and the General Provisions
to subpart A of part 63. The overall control efficiency (R) that is required by the standards is that which corresponds
to E
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

ac
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in Equation 2 of &sect;63.804(a)(3) being less than or equal to 1.0 kg VHAP/kg solids (1.0 lb VHAP/lb solids) for existing
sources or 0.8 kg VHAP/kg solids (0.8 lb VHAP/lb solids) for new sources. Owners or operators using this approach can
demonstrate continuous compliance with the regulation by continuously measuring and recording site-specific
operating parameters, the values of which are established by the owner or operator during the initial compliance
test. The operating parameter value is defined as the minimum or maximum value established for a control device or
process parameter that, independently, or in combination with one or more other operating parameter values, determines
that an owner or operator is complying with the applicable emission limitation or standards. The parameters that
would be monitored under the control system scenarios expected in this industry are discussed in section VI.G. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Owners or operators that choose to use a combination of techniques to demonstrate compliance must follow each applicable
compliance technique. For example, if a source uses a control device to control emissions from one emission point
(e.g., one finishing step) and compliant finishing materials for the other finishing steps, the compliance provisions
associated with both control devices and compliant finishing materials apply. To determine the overall control
efficiency (R) that is required to comply at the affected emission points, Equation 2 must be used. However, E
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 will only include those finishing materials and solvents being directed to the control device rather than all finishing
materials and solvents as shown in Equation 1.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Emission limits for Gluing Operations. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule also identifies emission limits for gluing operations. The proposed rule would limit the HAP content
of contact adhesives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are two methods of complying with the emission limits for contact adhesives in the proposed rule as outlined
in Tables 3 and 5. These are the use of compliant materials or the use of a control device. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An owner or operator that uses compliant contact adhesives can demonstrate initial and on-going compliance with
the contact adhesive limits (kg VHAP/kg solids) by recording the HAP and solids content, as reported on the CPDS, for
each contact adhesive used by the facility. The owner or operator must then calculate the kg VHAP/kg solids (lb VHAP/lb
solids), as applied, for each of the contact adhesives. If a contact adhesive is thinned with solvent after purchase,
the HAP and solids content reported on the CPDS must be adjusted accordingly to show compliance with the standards.
The owner or operator is in initial and continuous compliance with the proposed standards if the HAP content of each
contact adhesive is no greater than 1.0 kg VHAP/kg solids (1.0 lb VHAP/lb solids), as applied, for existing sources
or 0.2 kg VHAP/kg solids (0.2 lb VHAP/lb solids), as applied, for new sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The owner or operator of an affected source using foam adhesives (contact adhesives used for upholstery operations),
to manufacture products that meet the upholstered seating flammability testing requirements of California Technical
Bulletin 116, 117, or 133, the Business and Institutional Furniture Manufacturers Association's (BIFMA)&times;5.7,
UFAC Flammability Testing, or any similar requirements from local, State, or Federal fire regulatory agencies is
in initial and continuous compliance with the proposed standards if the HAP content of each foam adhesive is no greater
than 1.8 kg VHAP/kg solids (1.8 lb VHAP/lb solids), as applied, for existing sources or 0.2 kg VHAP/kg solids (0.2 lb
VHAP/lb solids), as applied, for new sources. The use of any contact adhesive that does not meet the HAP limits specified
in the proposed rule during any day is a violation of the proposed rule for that day. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Owners or operators may also comply with the proposed rule for contact adhesives by using a control device. Initial
compliance is demonstrated by conducting performance testing in accordance with &sect;63.805 of the proposed standards
and the General Provisions to subpart A of part 63. The overall control efficiency (R) that is required by the standards
is that which corresponds to G

 in Equation 3 of &sect;63.804(c)(2) being less than or equal to 1.0 kg VHAP/kg solids (1.0 lb VHAP/lb solids) for existing
sources or 0.2 kg VHAP/kg solids (0.2 lb VHAP/lb solids) for new sources. Owners or operators using this approach can

Compliance with the emission limits for the strippable spray booth material can be demonstrated through a CPDS. Owners
or operators would demonstrate on-going compliance by submitting a compliance certification with the semiannual
reports required by &sect;63.807(c) of the proposed rule stating that compliant spray booth coatings continue to
be used. The owner or operator is in initial and continuous compliance with the proposed rule if the VOC content of each
strippable spray booth coating is no greater than 0.8 kg VOC/kg solids (0.8 lb VOC/lb solids), as applied. The application
of any strippable spray booth coating that does not meet the VOC limit specified in the proposed rule during any day
is a violation of the proposed rule for that day.

Plan was being followed. Failure to implement any of the provisions of the Work Practice Implementation Plan during

Most of the reporting and recordkeeping provisions of the General Provisions to this subpart apply to all sources
subject to the proposed standards. A summary of these requirements and the additional reporting and recordkeeping
requirements that are specific to this source category is presented in Table 6. The General Provisions are applicable
to all sources subject to the proposed rule that are using control devices for compliance. However, as indicated in
Table 6, some requirements of the General Provisions apply only to control devices, continuous monitors, etc. and
are not pertinent to sources complying through the use of compliant materials (finishing materials, adhesives,
strippable spray booth coatings). Table 1 of the proposed rule specifically cites which sections of the General Provisions
do not apply to sources using compliant materials.

A. Environmental Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section will discuss the incremental increase or decrease in air pollution, water pollution and solid waste
generation that would result from implementing the proposed standards. Nationwide impacts are provided for existing
sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Air Pollution Impacts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The HAP emissions from finishing and gluing operations are controlled through emission limits on the finishing materials
and contact adhesives used by the industry and through work practice standards. Emissions from cleaning operations
will be reduced through work practice standards and an emission limit for strippable spray booth coatings. Emissions
of VOC that are both HAP and non-HAP may be controlled in the process of meeting the requirements for HAP reduction.
The quantity of those non-HAP VOC's that will be removed, however, has not been quantified. The estimated primary
and secondary air pollution impacts that would result from implementing the proposed standards are summarized below.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Primary Air Pollution Impacts. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The immediate air pollution impacts resulting from the proposed standards would be a reduction in the emission of
HAP by the source category. At baseline conditions (i.e., the conditions that exist in the absence of NESHAP), total
estimated HAP emissions from existing sources are 50,584 Mg/yr (55,744 tons/yr). If the proposed standards were
enacted, these emissions would drop to approximately 20,825 Mg/yr (22,949 tons/yr). This is a total estimated HAP
emission reduction of 29,759 Mg/yr (32,795 tons/yr). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The actual reduction in emissions may be larger than that estimated here because the estimate did not account for the
reduction of HAP from a number of the work practice standards. While most of the work practice standards are expected
to reduce emissions, it is difficult to quantify the actual reduction. Emission reductions resulting from the restrictions
on the use of conventional air spray guns and the operator training program were estimated, but no emission reduction
was assigned to the other work practice standards. Therefore, the emission reduction presented here does not reflect
the total reductions that may be achieved through the work practice standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed standards could also potentially result in a decline in VOC emissions and a reduction in ozone or photochemical
smog. While the HAP limits do not require the use of lower-VOC materials, the work practice standards should reduce
the use of VOC containing materials and, therefore, VOC emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Secondary Air Pollution Impacts. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed standards are not expected to result in any secondary air pollution impacts. Secondary emissions of
air pollutants typically result from generation of the energy needed to operate control devices. If some facilities
choose to meet the proposed standards through the use of control devices there could be some secondary air pollution
impacts resulting from the use of these devices. These have not been quantified here because it is anticipated that
most facilities will meet the limits through the use of reformulated materials.

2. Water Pollution Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed standards are expected to have no impact on water pollution because waterborne coatings are not required
to meet the proposed emission limitations. However, the Agency requests comment on whether this assessment is correct
and whether or not an expansion of the use of waterborne finishes and associated cleanup operations, in response to
the NESHAP, would impact water discharge from wood furniture manufacturing plants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Solid Waste Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The only impact of the proposed standards on solid waste is a potential decrease resulting from the limitation on conventional
air spray guns. Conventional air spray guns have a lower transfer efficiency, resulting in more overspray than other
types of spray application equipment. With the use of more efficient application equipment, overspray, and the amount
of waste solids generated from this overspray, is reduced. Due to the uncertainties in trying to quantify this reduction,
no estimate of the reduction in solid waste has been made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Energy Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed standards are not expected to impact energy usage by the industry. As with the secondary air pollution
impacts, there may be some impact on energy usage if some facilities choose to use control devices to meet the proposed
standards. However, these impacts have not been estimated because facilities are likely to meet the proposed standards
through the use of reformulated material. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Economic Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA performed an economic impact analysis of the requirements imposed on the wood furniture industry by this proposed
rule. Since the economic impact analysis was completed, the proposed standards have changed. The cost impacts presented
in IV.D reflect the changes in the proposed standards, but the economic impacts presented here are based on different
cost impacts. The economic impact analysis is based on a total industry-wide capital investment of $13,335,900,
an annual cost of $16,801,200, and a cost effectiveness of $578/Mg ($525/ton). Because the cost impact of the proposed
standards is lower than those used for the economic impact analysis, the economic impacts presented here are expected
to be greater than the actual economic impact. In performing the economic impact analysis potential price, output,
employment, closure, and secondary effects on affected segments of the wood furniture industry were assessed using
a market model of supply and demand for this industry. Potential small business impacts were also examined. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The economic impact analysis assessed the economic impacts of the proposed rule on the household, cabinet, and commercial
segments of the wood furniture industry. Estimated market price increases from the proposed rule are small, 0.07
percent or less in each of the three segments. Estimated reductions in market output are also relatively small ranging
from 0.03 percent in the commercial segment to 0.20 percent in the household segment. Total employment losses were
estimated at 720 or approximately 0.22 percent of total industry employment. Most of these estimated losses (570)
occur in the household furniture sector. Of the more than 700 operations expected to be directly impacted, three were
predicted to close due to implementation of this rule. The dollar value of total wood furniture imports was estimated
to increase by 0.43 percent, reflecting both increased volume and higher prices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Potential small business impacts were predicted to be minimal. Results from the economic impact and regulatory flexibility
analyses indicate that smaller plants will not be systematically impacted more severely than larger operations.
Moreover, the vast majority of small operations, which will not be subject to the requirements of the proposed rule,
may benefit, to some extent, from slightly increased wood furniture prices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Cost Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For existing major sources, the proposed standards are estimated to result in a total industry-wide capital investment
of $7,046,600. This cost includes the capital cost of equipment required to achieve compliance with the proposed
standards. The annual cost associated with the proposed standards is $15,279,600. This cost includes the capital
cost of control (annualized, assuming a 7-percent interest rate and a 10-year equipment life), annual operating
cost including the additional cost of using reformulated materials, worker training, increased labor, and annual
compliance, recordkeeping, and reporting costs. The annual control cost is approximately $10,779,600 and the annual
compliance, recordkeeping and reporting cost is approximately $4,500,000. The associated cost effectiveness
of the proposed standards is $513/Mg ($466/ton).

V. Decision Process for NESHAP Development 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Source of Authority for NESHAP Development 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 112 of the Clean Air Act gives the Environmental Protection Agency the authority to establish national standards
to reduce air emissions from sources that emit one or more HAP. Section 112(b) contains a list of HAP to be regulated
by NESHAP. Section 112(c) directs the Agency to use this pollutant list to develop and publish a list of source categories
for which NESHAP will be developed; this list was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 16, 1992 (57 FR 31576). The Agency must list all known categories and subcategories of ``major sources'' that
emit one or more of the listed HAP. A major source is defined in section 112(a) as any stationary source or group of stationary
sources located within a contiguous area and under common control that emits or has the potential to emit in the aggregate,
considering controls, 10 tons/yr or more of any one HAP or 25 tons/yr or more of any combination of HAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Criteria for Development of NESHAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NESHAP are to be developed to control HAP emissions from both new and existing sources according to the statutory
directives set out in section 112(d) of the Act. The statute requires the standards to reflect the maximum degree of
reduction in emissions of HAP that is achievable for new and existing sources. This control level is referred to as
the ``maximum achievable control technology'' (MACT). The selection of MACT must reflect consideration of the cost
of achieving the emission reduction, any nonair quality health and environmental impacts, and energy requirements
for control levels more stringent than the MACT floors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The MACT floor is the least stringent level for MACT standards. For new sources, the standards for a source category
or subcategory ``shall not be less stringent than the emission control that is achieved in practice by the best controlled
similar source, as determined by the Administrator'' [section 112(d)(3)]. Existing source standards should be
no less stringent than the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 12 percent of the existing
sources for categories and subcategories with 30 or more sources or the best performing 5 sources for categories or
subcategories with fewer than 30 sources [section 112(d)(3)]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although NESHAP are normally structured in terms of numerical emission limits, alternative approaches are sometimes
necessary. In some cases, physically measuring emissions from a source may be impossible or at least impracticable
because of technological and economic limitations. Section 112(h) authorizes the Administrator to promulgate
a design, equipment, work practice, or operational standard, or combination thereof, in those cases where it is not
feasible to prescribe or enforce an emissions standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VI. Rationale 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following sections explain the rationale used in selecting the proposed standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Selection of Pollutants and Source Category 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Selection of Pollutants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The specific pollutants regulated by the proposed standards are those compounds that are listed as HAP in section
112(b) of the Act. In the wood furniture (surface coating) source category, HAP are emitted from finishing, gluing,
cleaning, and washoff operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The HAP most commonly used by the wood furniture industry are VOC's used as solvents in the finishing materials and
include toluene, xylenes, methanol, methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), and methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK). Another material
used in finishing operations in this industry is thinner, which is used to dilute finishing materials purchased from
an outside source. Thinners contain one or several of the HAP previously noted and, therefore, are a source of HAP emissions.
Nonvolatile HAP that are contained in the finishing materials used by wood furniture manufacturers are typically
in the pigments and include chromium, cobalt, and manganese.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Gluing operations are also sources of HAP emissions. Formaldehyde is contained in urea-formaldehyde resins and
is emitted during gluing operations, as well as during the storage, use, and cutting of composite wood products that
contain these cured resins. Contact adhesives contain volatile solvents such as 1,1,1-trichloroethane, methylene
chloride, toluene, and n-hexane that are HAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The solvents contained in cleaning and washoff materials are typically the same solvents that are found in the coating
formulations. Those that are HAP (identified above) are regulated by the proposed standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Selection of the Source Category 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The source category regulated by the proposed standards is wood furniture (surface coating). Specifically, major
sources of HAP emissions are covered by the proposed rule; i.e., sources that have the potential to emit, considering
controls, 9.1 Mg/yr (10 tons/yr) of any one HAP or 22.7 Mg/yr (25 tons/yr) of multiple HAP. Table 2 lists the many products
that are manufactured by the source category and illustrates the diversity of the industry. As indicated in Table
2, the proposed rule applies to facilities included in at least nine SIC codes because some or all of the facilities
that are included in these SIC codes produce wood furniture. The SIC codes listed in Table 2 are estimated to include
greater than 11,000 facilities. Of these, it is estimated that 750 sources are major. This estimate is based on data
collected from EPA's survey of the industry. The remaining sources are thought to be area sources, or synthetic area
sources, and as such would not be subject to the proposed rule (see related discussion in section VI.A.2.b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Subcategorization. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 112(d) of the Clean Air Act gives the Environmental Protection Agency the authority to distinguish among
classes, types, and sizes of sources within a source category in establishing standards. There are many reasons for
subcategorizing a source category. A primary reason for subcategorizing a source category is that different types
of control techniques may be appropriate depending on the type of product manufactured, the manufacturing process,
and the size of the plant. Due to the diversity of this source category, the Committee considered subcategorizing
the source category by industry market segment (e.g., kitchen cabinet manufacturers, residential furniture, upholstered
furniture, etc.) and by manufacturing process (e.g., finishing a piece before it is assembled, finishing a piece
after assembly). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Discussions of subcategorization occurred through several regulatory negotiation meetings. A recurring issue
during the discussions was the difficulty in assigning a facility to one subcategory. Some wood furniture facilities
manufacture products for different market segments and some use multiple manufacturing processes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As the data were evaluated and the recommended format of the standards was developed, it became apparent that the proposed
standards were most likely going to be a limit on the pounds of HAP emitted per pound of solids used at a source (see section
VI.D). The Committee's review of the data revealed that the HAP limit of facilities in the source category did not vary
significantly according to the industry market segment, the size of the facility, or the manufacturing process.
In addition, subcategorization by market segment could not address the diversity of the industry as there was as much
variation in the types of control techniques used within each market segment as between the market segments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another aspect that the Committee discussed was the potential for subcategorization to limit the flexibility of
sources in complying with the standards. One compliance method under consideration (and ultimately included in
the proposal) was one that allowed averaging across various finishing steps within a facility. In this industry,
however, the finishing steps could be within different subcategories and the EPA interprets the Act as not allowing
averaging across subcategories for compliance determinations. This made subcategorization less attractive to
the Committee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee decided that the disadvantages of subcategorizing this industry outweighed any benefits to either
the affected sources or to regulators. Instead, the Committee worked to allow multiple compliance techniques that
could address the operational differences among the various segments within the source category.

Area Source Evaluation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Of the estimated 11,000 sources in this source category, over 10,000 are thought to be area sources. The Agency also
expects that some sources (known as ``synthetic area'' sources) will apply for a Federally enforceable limit on their
potential to emit through the Title V permitting program or some other Federally enforceable program so that they
are no longer considered major. A ``synthetic area'' source is a source that has obtained a Federally enforceable
limit that will preclude the source's HAP emissions from exceeding 10 tons per year of any one HAP or 25 tons per year
of any combination of HAP; without this limit the source is considered major. The proposed standards do not apply to
area sources (including synthetic area sources). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Selection of Emission Points 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The specific emission points regulated by the proposed standards are finishing, gluing, cleaning, and washoff operations,
all of which are described in section II. At some wood furniture facilities, only finishing and cleaning operations
will occur. At others, all four operations will take place. Finishing operations may be a small part of some plant operations
(e.g., upholstered furniture), or may comprise the majority of plant operations (e.g., residential furniture).
Nonetheless, finishing, gluing, cleaning, and washoff operations are the primary HAP emission sources at wood furniture
facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed standards for finishing and cleaning operations were developed within the framework of the regulatory
negotiation described in section I.B. The proposed standards for gluing operations were developed by the Agency
because adhesive suppliers were not represented on the Committee. However, the Agency did consult with adhesive
suppliers and operators that perform gluing operations in developing the proposed standards. The EPA survey of the
industry also included questions concerning gluing operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA analysis indicates that there are four primary types of adhesives used by the wood furniture industry: hot
melts, polyvinyl acetate (PVA) adhesives, urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins, and contact adhesives. The proposed
standards do not regulate UF resins, hot melts, or PVA adhesives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA has explored the issue of UF resins in developing the NESHAP and has decided not to control formaldehyde emissions
from UF resins in the proposed standards. Urea-formaldehyde resins were removed from consideration during the regulatory
negotiation because the Committee members did not represent parties that would be significantly affected by these
provisions. The EPA investigated UF resins outside of the negotiation using survey data, studies, and in meetings
with the manufacturers and users. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The major use of UF resins in the furniture industry is the manufacture of plywood. A furniture facility may make plywood
for later use or glue decorative wood veneers to a wood substrate as part of the manufacturing process. Both of these
processes, however, are considered to be plywood manufacturing. Thus, it makes sense to control formaldehyde emissions
from UF resins in a broader, more comprehensive format through the NESHAP for Plywood and Particleboard Manufacturing
that is scheduled to be promulgated in 2000. Accordingly, the EPA has decided to defer controlling emissions from
UF resins in the proposed standards. In the interim, some members of the UF resins industry have expressed a willingness
to work together with the EPA to explore scientific approaches to measure emissions and evaluate control technologies
that limit emissions from UF resins and wood products containing these resins. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hot melts are also not covered by the proposed standards because they are not sources of HAP emissions. Hot melts are
solid, ethylene vinyl acetate-based products that are used primarily for edgebanding, which is the process of applying
a laminate to the edge of a countertop, desktop, table, or other piece of furniture. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PVA adhesives are waterbased emulsions that have the potential to emit small amounts of vinyl acetate monomer,
a HAP. Typically, PVA adhesives contain less than 0.3 percent vinyl acetate monomer and are among the lowest emitting
adhesives used by the industry. The EPA is not aware of lower emitting alternatives that can be used for all applications
for which PVA adhesives are used. For this reason, the EPA is proposing that the use of PVA adhesives not be regulated
by the proposed standards.

C. Selection of Proposed Emission Limits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed emission limits include a HAP emission limit for finishing operations, a limit on the HAP content of contact
adhesives, and a limit on the VOC content of strippable spray booth materials. For a description of the rationale for
selecting the proposed format for these emission limits, refer to section VI.D.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 112 requires the EPA to set standards for existing and new sources of HAP emissions that represent the maximum
degree of reduction achievable, taking into consideration the cost of achieving such emission reductions, any nonair
quality health and environmental impacts, and energy requirements. For determining the proposed emission limits
for finishing and gluing operations, a MACT floor approach was used. As was discussed in section V.B, for existing
sources in source categories with 30 or more sources, the MACT floor is the average level of control that is achieved
in practice by the best performing 12 percent of sources in the source category. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Work practice standards are also proposed to limit HAP emissions from finishing, gluing, cleaning, and washoff operations.
The selection of the work practice standards is discussed in section VI.E.

In order to determine the MACT floor for the wood furniture industry, the EPA surveyed more than 850 wood furniture
manufacturing operations. Facilities of all sizes operating under each of the SIC codes of interest were surveyed
in order to get a representative sampling of the industry. Responses were received from more than 300 sources, 91 of
which were determined to be major sources. Information provided by plants included the material safety data sheet
(MSDS) for each finishing material, cleaning material, and adhesive containing HAP that was used at the plant, as
well as information on HAP usage, HAP emissions, finishing material usage, cleaning solvent usage, adhesive usage,
and control techniques used (if any).

 Existing sources.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As discussed in section VI.D., in evaluating the data collected from industry on finishing operations, the format
that seemed technically feasible and most flexible for the entire source category was an emission limit expressed
in terms of pounds of volatile HAP (VHAP) emitted per pound of solids used (lb VHAP/lb solids [kg VHAP/kg solids]).
Thus, the MACT floor for finishing operations at existing sources was calculated as the average HAP emission level
(lb HAP/lb solids) achieved by the best performing 12 percent of sources, that is, those sources with the lowest HAP
emission level. The HAP emission level for each facility was calculated by dividing the facility's total HAP usage
by the total quantity of solids in the finishing materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency had collected sufficient data on the HAP usage at major sources from the survey of the industry, but did not
have data on the solids content of each finishing material used by a facility. Therefore, the coating supplier for
each major source calculated the emission level for that source. The Committee agreed that data provided by coating
suppliers were more accurate than an emission level calculated using only the EPA's data base; because of the lack
of data on the solids content, the Agency would have needed to make assumptions to calculate the emission level for
each major source. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because information was available on 91 major sources, the MACT floor was calculated as the average emission limitation
achieved by the best performing 11 existing sources (i.e., the best performing 12 percent). The Committee agreed
that the 11 sources should comprise every type of wood furniture operation covered by the proposed rule. If the MACT
floor was calculated by looking only at the emission limit of the top 11 sources, without regard to industry segment,
one industry segment could be ``over-represented.'' The Committee was especially concerned that one of the smaller
industry segments could comprise the majority of sources in the MACT floor. Therefore, each industry segment was
represented in the MACT floor proportional to its representation in the industry. The Committee agreed that the quantity
of finishing material used was a reasonable method for assessing the percentage of the entire industry represented
by each industry segment. Based on the finishing material usage data collected by the EPA through its survey of the
industry, it was determined that the total finishing material usage by the source category was approximately distributed
as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_kitchen cabinets (SIC 2434): 34 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_office furniture (2521): 7 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_radio/TV cabinets (2517): 6 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_upholstered furniture (2512): 3.5 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_public building furniture (2531): 3 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_store fixtures (2541): 2 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the above distribution, the Committee agreed that the 11 plants comprising the MACT floor should include
the best performing 4 kitchen cabinet plants (34 percent of 11), 5 residential furniture plants (44 percent), 1 office
furniture plant (7 percent), and 1 plant manufacturing radio/TV cabinets (6 percent). The other industry segments
comprised such a small percentage of the source category, the Committee believed that it was not necessary to represent
them in the MACT floor analysis. The Committee also believed that the industry segments not included in the MACT floor
were similar in many respects to those that were included and would therefore be able to achieve the same MACT floor
emission limit.

In reviewing the data collected by the EPA from industry, industry representatives expressed concern that control
devices were ``over-represented'' in the EPA's data base, which indicated approximately 5 percent of major sources
were equipped with control devices. Industry felt that they knew of each control device used by the industry and based
on their knowledge, they believed no more than 1 percent of major sources were equipped with control devices. The Committee
agreed that approximately 1 percent of the major sources are equipped with control devices. While the Act states that
the MACT floor analysis shall be based on sources for which the Administrator has emissions information, this does
not mean EPA should not use the information it has appropriately. Given that the Committee believed that control devices
were over-represented in EPA's data base, the EPA concluded that the MACT floor should be calculated from a population
of facilities that includes only 1 (instead of 4) control device (equivalent to 1 percent of the major sources in the
data base). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency specifically requests comments on this decision. Any supporting data that would justify additional sources
or fewer sources with control devices being included in the MACT floor analysis would be welcomed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Using the approaches described above, the average HAP emission level achieved by the best performing 12 percent of
existing sources was determined to be 1.0 lb HAP/lb solids (1.0 kg HAP/kg solids), as applied. As discussed in IV.D,
the format of the emission limitation was later changed to kilograms of volatile HAP per kilogram of solids, as applied,
(kg VHAP/kg solids [lb VHAP/lb solids] as applied). Therefore, the MACT floor for existing sources is 1.0 kg VHAP/kg
solids (1.0 lb VHAP/lb solids), as applied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA is considering two possible meanings for the word ``average'' as the term is used above in relation to determining
the MACT floor. First, ``average'' could be interpreted as the arithmetic mean. The arithmetic mean of a set of measurements
is the sum of the measurements divided by the number of measurements in the set. The EPA has determined that the arithmetic
mean of the emissions limitations achieved by the best performing 12 percent of existing sources would yield, in some
cases, an emission limitation that fails to correspond to the limitation achieved by any particular technology.
In such cases, the EPA would not select this approach. The word ``average'' could also be interpreted as the median
emission limitation value. The median is the value in a set of measurements arranged in order of magnitude below and
above which there are an equal number of values (i.e., it is the middle value). This approach identifies the emission
limitation achieved by those sources within the top 12 percent, arranges those emission limitations by magnitude,
and takes the control level achieved by the median source. This is mathematically equivalent to identifying the emission
limitation achieved by the source at the 94th percentile level of emission control. Either of these two approaches
could be used in developing standards for different source categories. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In determining the MACT floor for this source category, the Committee used the approach that interprets the average
as the arithmetic mean. The median approach is not feasible for the proposed standards because it would defeat the
purpose of having proportional representation of each industry segment. The median approach would select the level
of control achieved by one facility, the one at the 94th percentile, and would only represent one industry segment.
In addition, the arithmetic mean represents a technically achievable emission limitation for this industry. Of
the 11 facilities in the floor, two have an emission limit of 1.0 lb VHAP/lb solids. A range of options can be used to meet
the 1.0 lb VHAP/lb solids limit; the limit does not require the use of either a specific technology or a limited set of
technologies. The EPA specifically solicits comments on its interpretation of average in general, and the use of
an arithmetic mean for this rule specifically.

ii. New sources. Section 112 of the Act specifies that the MACT floor for new sources shall be no less stringent than
the level of control that is achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source. The Committee determined
the MACT floor for new sources using an approach similar to that for existing sources; that is, one that represents
the multiple industry segments within the source category. For new sources, the MACT floor was calculated by determining
the HAP limit of the best performing source in each industry segment that comprised the existing source MACT floor
(kitchen cabinets, residential furniture, radio/TV cabinets, office furniture). Then, a weighted average (weighted
by the relative coating usage of each industry segment) was calculated to determine the HAP limit for new sources.
This HAP limit was calculated to be 0.8 lb VHAP/lb solids (0.8 kg VHAP/kg solids), as applied, and is the MACT floor for
new sources for all industry segments.

MACT Floor for Gluing Operations. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed standards would only regulate the HAP content of contact adhesives. Hot melts are not sources of HAP emissions,
there are no lower emitting alternatives for PVA adhesives, and regulation of formaldehyde based adhesives is being
deferred to later rulemaking. As discussed in section II, contact adhesives are used primarily for laminating and
for upholstery operations. Contact adhesives used for upholstery operations are also referred to as foam adhesives.
The emission limit for contact adhesives is expressed as a HAP limit, in pounds of VHAP per pound of solids, as applied.
The MACT floor for contact adhesives was determined as an average (equivalent to the mean) of the HAP limit achieved
by the best performing 12 percent of contact adhesives used by major sources in quantities greater than 200 gallons
per year; this limit was calculated as 1.0 lb VHAP/lb solids (1.0 kg VHAP/kg solids), as applied. The HAP limit for each
contact adhesive was determined from data provided by the adhesive supplier for each major source in the EPA's data
base using contact adhesives. The HAP limit for the lowest emitting contact adhesive is 0.2 lb VHAP/lb solids, as applied.
Thus, the MACT floor for contact adhesives used by new sources is a HAP content of no more than 0.2 lb HAP/lb solids (0.2
kg VHAP/kg solids), as applied.

2. Selection of MACT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Committee proposed that MACT for finishing operations should be set at the same level as the MACT floor. This proposal
was supported by review of the data on which the MACT floor is based. The Committee determined that HAP emission limits
substantially lower than the MACT floor were not being met, nor could they be met by most facilities in the industry
segments comprising the MACT floor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is expected that most sources will comply with the proposed standards by reformulating existing coatings. Control
devices are not widely used by sources covered by the proposed rule to control emissions from finishing operations.
In addition, State rules do not require this level of control, and the Committee did not favor a proposal that would
mandate the use of control devices. Thus, more stringent control could only be achieved in most cases by the exclusive
use of coatings with a very low- or zero-HAP content. Currently, finishing materials with a very low or zero-HAP content
have not been demonstrated to be feasible for all industry segments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another factor that the Committee evaluated in selecting MACT was the impact of the proposed rule when the work practice
standards are considered. These standards will result in additional reduction in HAP emissions. Because numerical
limits are not assigned to all work practice standards, the total reduction in emissions that results from implementing
such standards is not quantified. Given that an emission limit more stringent than the MACT floor could not be achieved
by all segments of the industry and the fact that work practices will further reduce HAP emissions, the Committee favored
setting the finishing material emission limits based on the MACT floor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In selecting MACT, the industry members of the Committee raised the possibility that EPA might, at some future time,
conduct rulemaking activities to expand or reduce the current HAP list. The emission limits calculated for the wood
furniture NESHAP were based on the list of 189 hazardous air pollutants published in the 1990 Clean Air Act and were
not intended to apply to any changes that may be made to the list in the future. In the event the list is changed, either
by the addition or deletion of VHAP, the Committee recommended that EPA re-examine the wood furniture emission limits
and determine whether it should be adjusted to account for the change.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency proposes that MACT for contact adhesives should also be set at the same level as the MACT floor. (The Committee
was not involved in selecting MACT for gluing operations.) Based upon discussions with industry, the Agency decided
that an emission limitation more stringent than the MACT floor was not feasible for contact adhesives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency proposes that MACT for contact adhesives used for upholstery operations (referred to here as foam adhesives)
be set at a different level if the product manufactured with the foam adhesive meets flammability testing requirements
of California Technical Bulletin 116, 117, or 133, BIFMA X 5.7, UFAC Flammability Testing, or any similar requirements
from local, State, or Federal fire regulatory agencies. The limit of 1.0 lb VHAP/lb solids may require the use of waterborne
foam adhesives. Many of the products manufactured with foam adhesives must meet standards for flammability. However,
industry, including furniture manufacturers and adhesive suppliers, have stated that products manufactured with
waterborne foam adhesives may fail these flammability tests. Therefore, the EPA has decided that foam adhesives
used in products manufactured by existing sources that meet the flammability standards do not have to meet the limit
of 1.0 lb VHAP/lb solids. For foam adhesives used in products manufactured by existing sources that do not meet the
flammability standards, the EPA is proposing that MACT for existing sources be set at the MACT floor, that is, 1.0 lb
VHAP/lb solids (1.0 kg VHAP/kg solids), as applied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency believes that HAP emissions from foam adhesives used in products manufactured by existing sources can
be reduced. In order to establish a limit for these adhesives, the EPA elected to set a limit equivalent to that of the
lowest emitting solventborne foam adhesive used in quantities greater than 200 gallons per year. This adhesive has
a HAP content of 1.8 lb VHAP/lb solids (1.8 kg VHAP/kg solids), as applied. Therefore, the EPA is proposing that MACT
for existing sources for foam adhesives used in products that meet flammability standards be set at 1.8 lb VHAP/lb
solids (1.8 kg VHAP/kg solids), as applied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some manufacturers of contact adhesives have requested an exemption from the emission limitation for existing and
new sources (1.0 kg VHAP/kg solids and 0.2 kg VHAP/kg solids, respectively), for problem applications involving
nonporous substrates such as rigid plastic, metal, and rubber. According to the manufacturers, these operations
require solvent-dispersed adhesives. Low VOC and HAP alternatives are not expected to be available for several more
years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers have also requested an exemption for aerosol adhesives. These adhesives are typically used by small
businesses and by larger businesses for touch-up and repair. According to manufacturers, they are highly specialized
systems and reformulation involves complex problems that affect not only the adhesive but the delivery system as
well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rather than allow the exemptions at this time, the Agency has decided to request comment on whether the exemptions
should be allowed and any data that would support or refute the need for these exemptions. Additionally, the Agency
specifically requests comments on the approach used for establishing MACT for contact adhesives for existing sources
including comment on the following issues: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The appropriateness of excluding adhesives used in amounts less than 200 gallons per year, which the industry felt
represented a de minimis usage, from calculation of the MACT floor; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Calculating the MACT floor based on the average of the best performing 12 percent of adhesives for a data set that
is limited, 22 data points, but which the EPA believes is representative of the industry; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The appropriateness of setting MACT for foam adhesives for existing sources based on a special quality required
for the product (i.e., flammability).

1. The format must accommodate multiple compliance techniques for the various industry segments; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Given the large number of small businesses in this source category, the format must ensure that the cost of compliance
is not excessive; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The format must ensure that an equivalent level of control is achieved by all affected sources; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The format must facilitate enforcement by regulatory agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the negotiation meetings, the Committee considered several formats for the finishing operations standards
in addition to the selected format of pounds of VHAP emitted per pound of solids used. These included: (1) a percent
efficiency format, (2) a limit on emissions of HAP per gallon of coating, and (3) a limit on emissions of HAP per gallon
of solids. For all HAP-limit formats, including the one selected for the proposed standards, the quantity of HAP used
annually is calculated as applied (the total emissions from a coating after any thinning by the furniture manufacturer).
Therefore, if prepurchased coatings were diluted with thinner at a facility, this dilution was accounted for. A Measurement
Work Group comprised of some of the Committee members was established by the Committee to investigate these potential
regulatory formats. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Measurement Work Group determined that a percent reduction format was not appropriate for this source category.
In debating a percent reduction format, the Measurement Work Group considered the fact that conventional control
devices were not likely to be the compliance method of choice for this source category. Therefore, a straightforward
measurement of capture and control device efficiency would not be sufficient to demonstrate compliance with a specific
percent reduction. Instead, to implement a percent reduction format, baseline conditions at each affected source
would have to be assessed. At an uncontrolled facility this would not be a problem; baseline conditions would be the
current HAP emission rate. The percent reduction would be applied to this uncontrolled rate to calculate the controlled
HAP emission rate required by the standards. Problems with the percent reduction format arise, however, if a facility
has implemented control strategies prior to proposal of the MACT standards. If the same baseline year is selected
for both the uncontrolled and controlled facility, the controlled facility would be required to control a greater
quantity of HAP emissions than the uncontrolled facility. Thus, a percent reduction format was perceived as penalizing
sources that initiated control strategies prior to proposal of the MACT standards. The Committee agreed with the
Measurement Work Group's recommendation that a percent reduction format not be selected for this source category.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Initially, the Measurement Work Group considered a limit on the pounds of HAP contained in a gallon of finishing material
(lb HAP/gal), either for each finishing material or as an average across all finishing materials. In analyzing the
data, however, the Measurement Work Group discovered that the pounds of HAP per gallon of finishing material format
would not credit sources that switch to lower-emitting, higher-solids finishing materials. For example, a facility
using a finishing material with a solids content of 40 percent and a HAP content of 3 lb/gal will emit fewer pounds of
HAP than a facility using a finishing material with a solids content of 20 percent and a HAP content of 2 lb/gal because
the first facility will use 50 percent less finishing material than the second. Because the HAP content of a finishing
material is not directly related to the solids content, a comparison of the emission potential of two finishing materials
using a lb/gal format cannot be made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As an alternative to the lb HAP/gal format, the Measurement Work Group considered a format of lb HAP/gal of solids.
It was believed that this format would adequately credit sources that converted some or all of their conventional
finishing materials to higher-solids coatings. A problem with the lb HAP/gal solids format, however, is that no EPA
test method is currently available for accurately measuring the volume of solids in a finishing material.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In an effort to develop standards that did not require measuring the volume of solids, the Measurement Work Group decided
to explore a format based on the weight of solids used, rather than the volume of finishing material or volume of solids.
In evaluating a format of lb HAP emitted per lb solids used, the Measurement Work Group first concluded that this format
predicted actual emission reductions better than any other format when extremes in finishing materials were tested.
For example, if a source were to increase the solids content of its finishing material and decrease its usage of finishing
materials, the format of lb HAP/lb solids properly credited the source's emission reduction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three potential drawbacks to the format of lb HAP/lb solids were identified by the Measurement Work Group. The first
drawback concerned higher solids stains. Unlike the film building finishing materials, stain usage is not directly
related to the solids content. A source could use a higher solids stain to reduce its lb HAP/lb solids level without
decreasing stain usage or HAP emissions. The second drawback was that a source could double its film thickness to reduce
the lb HAP/lb solids value while increasing emissions. The third drawback with using a lb HAP/lb solids format is related
to pigmented finishing materials such as basecoats and enamels. Some of the pigments used in these finishing materials
have a higher density than the solids used in conventional finishing materials. While these finishing materials
typically have a lower HAP content than the conventional finishing materials used by the industry, the lb HAP/lb solids
format for these finishing materials will overestimate the actual decrease in emissions because of the higher density
of the solids. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Work Group presented its findings to the Committee along with a recommendation that, despite the drawbacks, the
lb HAP/lb solids format was the most reasonable. Regarding the first drawback (the problem with higher solids stains),
the Work Group agreed that this issue did not pose a significant problem with the lb HAP/lb solids format. An analysis
of an extreme case, that is, a stain with a solids content at the upper end of the normal range, indicated that the error
would be less than 5 percent, which the Committee agreed was an acceptable margin of error. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, another issue associated with the relationship between a lb HAP/lb solids format and stains was raised by
industry when the Committee was developing the compliant coatings approach for meeting the emission limitation.
As discussed, stains are low-solids finishing materials so formulating a stain to meet a limitation based on solids
is difficult. The industry indicated that a compliant stain could be formulated, but only if the emission limitation
applied only to the volatile HAP in the coating. Stains may contain small amounts of nonvolatile HAP such as chromium
and manganese compounds for which there are no readily acceptable non-HAP substitutions. The industry pointed out
that a significant percentage of these nonvolatile HAP are captured and controlled by filters in the spray booths.
A small percentage may be emitted from overspray that is not captured by the filters, but industry indicated that these
emissions will be reduced by the equipment requirements of the proposed standards, which will reduce finishing material
usage and overspray (see discussion of work practices in section VI.E.). The Committee agreed that these nonvolatile
HAP will be reduced both by filters and by the application equipment requirements so that the emission limitation
for the finishing materials would apply only to the volatile HAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the second drawback (the coating thickness issue), industry pointed out that economics would preclude
a source from meeting standards expressed as a lb HAP/lb solids by doubling the coating thickness. According to industry
representatives, finishing lines are designed to run at a certain speed. To increase coating thickness, the line
would have to be slowed down to apply more finishing material. This practice would lower the overall production rate.
The cost of the additional finishing material and the lost production would deter a source from this approach. Industry
representatives also pointed out that, in most situations, the product quality would suffer if the coating thickness
were doubled. Given the unlikely situation of a source doubling its coating thickness, the Committee agreed that
this was not a significant drawback to the lb HAP/lb solids format.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Regarding the third drawback cited above (fully pigmented finishing materials), although the lb HAP/lb solids format
overestimates the actual emissions reductions from pigmented finishing materials, the Work Group agreed that this
was not a significant problem because these materials represent a small amount of total finishing material usage.
Industry estimated that these finishing materials account for less than 5 percent of total usage, and data collected
by the EPA support this estimate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of the above discussions, the format of today's proposed rule for coating operations is a lb VHAP/lb solids
emission limit (kg VHAP/kg solids). While this format has been evaluated and is considered appropriate for this source
category due to the similarities in the densities of the solids used in the coatings, the Agency recommends that before
using this format for setting emission limits for other source categories a thorough evaluation of its appropriateness
for that source category be conducted.

2. Gluing Operations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency and the Glue Work Group, which was involved in the initial discussions concerning the development of emission
standards for adhesives, considered several formats in developing the proposed standards for gluing operations.
The potential formats for contact adhesives evaluated by the EPA included a limit on the HAP content of the adhesive
expressed as a pound of HAP per gal and a HAP content based on a lb HAP/lb solids. For the reasons cited for finishing operations,
a format expressed as a lb HAP/gal is not adequate for determining emission reduction. Likewise, for the same reasons
discussed for finishing, a HAP limit in terms of lb VHAP/lb solids (kg VHAP/kg solids) was selected as the format for
the proposed standards. This format was agreed upon by the Agency and the Glue Work Group.

E. Selection of Work Practice Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule contains many work practices that the Committee believed are pollution prevention approaches
that limit emissions from finishing, gluing, cleaning, and washoff operations. Section 112(h) of the Act gives the
EPA the authority to promulgate design, equipment, work practice, or operational standards, or a combination thereof.
Such standards are necessary in cases where physically measuring emissions from a source is impossible or at least
impracticable. The work practices that were selected as part of the proposed standards are practices that the Committee
agreed are feasible but for which emission limits could not be assigned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For this source category, work practices were also considered necessary for another reason. Whereas the emission
limits required by the standards will control only HAP emissions from wood furniture manufacturing operations,
the work practices will limit both HAP and VOC emissions. Several Committee members were concerned that to comply
with the proposed rule, sources would replace HAP compounds in finishing materials with equally hazardous non-HAP
VOC's. By implementing work practices, all pollutants will be controlled to some extent.

Finishing, Gluing, Cleaning, and Washoff Operations. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Committee recognized that by implementing work practice standards, HAP emissions from finishing and gluing
operations could be further reduced. To determine the work practices that would be technically feasible for the source
category, the Committee established a Work Practice Work Group. The Work Practice Work Group comprised the EPA and
State regulators, a State office involved with waste reduction, finishing material suppliers, manufacturers,
and an environmental group representative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Work Practice Work Group identified two areas in which HAP emissions from finishing, gluing, cleaning, and washoff
operations could be reduced through work practices: HAP storage and HAP transfer; and two more areas in which HAP emissions
could be reduced from finishing operations: finishing material application and selection of finishing materials.
The work practices proposed by the Work Practice Work Group were discussed with the Committee, and a consensus was
reached that the recommended work practices should be included in the proposed rule.

HAP storage.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Materials containing HAP are often stored in containers that are left open, allowing the volatile HAP to evaporate
and be emitted through room ventilation to the atmosphere. The Work Practice Work Group agreed that a straightforward,
inexpensive method of reducing emissions from HAP storage would be to cover all containers storing finishing, gluing,
cleaning, and washoff materials when not in use. In addition to reducing HAP emissions to the atmosphere, this work
practice has the added benefit of reducing worker exposure to volatile HAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HAP transfer.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In wood furniture finishing, gluing, and cleaning operations, solvent, finishing material, and adhesives are pumped
from storage containers to the spray gun through piping. In wood furniture operations, leaks can occur in equipment
used to transfer or apply finishing materials, solvents, and adhesives. Therefore, the Work Group agreed that requiring
sources to check this equipment for leaks was reasonable. To implement the leak inspection program, sources will
be required to develop an I&amp;M plan that requires the inspection of each piece of equipment used to transfer or apply
finishing materials, solvents, and adhesives; a schedule for inspection; reporting of the results of the inspection,
any repairs that were made to the equipment, and the timeframe between identifying the leak and performing repairs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Work Practice Work Group agreed upon the concept of an I&amp;M plan, but never discussed whether the proposed rule
should require a specific inspection frequency and, if so, what the frequency should be. In establishing the regulatory
framework for the negotiated rule, the Agency decided that a monthly inspection frequency is appropriate to accomplish
the goal of reducing leaks from transfer and application equipment. More frequent monitoring was considered burdensome
because smaller shops would not have the personnel to perform the inspections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure that action would be taken if leaks were detected, the proposed rule requires that repairs be made within
15 calendar days, with a first attempt at repair made within 5 calendar days. The Agency's decision is supported by
previous regulatory action; the hazardous organic NESHAP (HON) and the NESHAP for coke oven batteries both require
this same repair timeframe. As stated above, the Agency used the Committee's conceptual agreement for an I&amp;M
plan to address equipment leaks as a foundation for the more specific provisions in the proposed rule. The Agency requests
comment on the specific requirements of the proposed rule, and data to suggest that more or less frequent monitoring
or shorter or longer repair times may be appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Finishing material application.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Another aspect of wood furniture finishing operations that the Committee evaluated was the type of finishing material
application equipment used. There have been numerous studies comparing the transfer efficiency of one type of application
equipment with that of another type. Transfer efficiency is the ratio of the amount of coating solids deposited onto
the surface of the coated part to the total amount of coating solids used. The higher the transfer efficiency, the less
finishing material that is used and the less that is lost as overspray (sprayed finishing materials that miss the piece).
Overspray eventually dries, releasing volatile HAP, and becomes a solid waste source for the facility. Thus, by increasing
transfer efficiency, both air emissions and solid waste are reduced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee agreed that highly efficient transfer methods are desirable. Traditionally, however, the Agency's
position on transfer efficiency has been one that advocates the use of more efficient transfer methods, but contends
that emission reductions resulting from these methods can not be quantified. For the purposes of the proposed rule,
the Committee reached a consensus that an equipment standard rather than a standard that identified transfer efficiencies
for specific application methods would be most appropriate. The Committee also agreed that data supporting one type
of application equipment over another were conflicting except in one instance; almost all data suggest that conventional
air guns are the least efficient transfer method. Therefore, the Committee proposed that the rule prohibit the use
of conventional air spray guns.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several Committee members believed that in certain instances the use of conventional air guns should be allowed.
For example, if a source is using low-VOC coatings (less than 1.0 lb VOC/lb solids) or a control device, transfer efficiency
is not as critical. Also, some Committee members pointed out that limited use of air guns for specialty operations
would have minimal environmental impact as long as more efficient application methods were used for the majority
of finishing. The Committee believed that these were valid claims and therefore proposes that conventional air spray
guns only be used to apply finishing materials under the following circumstances: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. To apply finishing materials that have a VOC content no greater than 1.0 kg VOC/kg solids (1.0 lb VOC/lb solids),
as applied; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. For touchup and repair under the following conditions; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The touchup and repair occurs after completion of the finishing operation; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The touchup and repair occurs after the application of stain and before the application of any other type of finishing
material, and the materials used for touchup and repair are applied from a container that has a volume of no more than
2.0 gallons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. If spray is automated, that is, the spray gun is aimed and triggered automatically, not manually; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. If emissions from the finishing application station are directed to a control device; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The conventional air gun is used to apply finishing materials and the cumulative total of that finishing material
is less than 5 percent of the total gallons of finishing material applied during that semiannual period; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The conventional air gun is used to apply stain on a part for which it is technically or economically infeasible to
use any other spray application technology. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule provides guidance on factors to be considered in making the determination of technical or economic
infeasibility required for (6). These factors include: (1) The production speed is too high or the part shape is too
complex for one operator to coat the part and the application station is not large enough to accommodate an additional
operator; or (2) the excessively large vertical spray area of the part makes it difficult to avoid sagging or runs in
the stain. To demonstrate technical or economic infeasibility, the facility must submit a videotape, technical
report, or other documentation supporting the claim of economic or technical infeasibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency specifically solicits comments on this approach including: (1) Does the proposed rule provide sufficient
guidance for the permitting agency to make a determination of economic or technical infeasibility; and (2) are the
options for documenting the claim of economic or technical infeasibility reasonable and sufficient?

Selection of finishing materials.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As previously stated, several Committee members were concerned that the emission limits proposed for the finishing
operations did not prohibit the use of those VHAP of potential concern. These are VHAP that have been classified as
high concern, unrankable, and nonthreshold under the proposed rulemaking pursuant to section 112(g). The emission
limit for finishing materials allows sources to continue using these materials as long as the overall HAP limit does
not exceed 1.0 kg VHAP/kg solids (1.0 lb VHAP/lb solids), as applied (existing sources) or 0.8 kg VHAP/kg solids (0.8
lb VHAP/lb solids), as applied (new sources). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee discussed prohibiting the use of certain HAP, but ultimately they agreed that to determine which HAP
were necessary for which finishing materials would be difficult because it would depend on the specific application
and/or product. The Committee also discussed capping the emissions of certain HAP. Industry argued that a cap could
limit their production by limiting their use of some finishing materials.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After much discussion, the Committee agreed upon an approach that satisfied all members. Under this approach, all
affected sources must prepare a Formulation Assessment Plan. The Formulation Assessment Plan will help ensure that
the averaging approach allowed under the proposed rule does not circumvent the goals of State air toxics programs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The plan must identify all VHAP of potential concern being used by the affected source for finishing operations that
are on the list of 10 compounds identified by industry. The list, presented in Table 4, &sect;63.803(1), of the proposed
standards, includes those VHAP of potential concern that industry indicated were currently in use by the wood furniture
manufacturing industry. The plan must establish a baseline level of usage, based on the highest annual usage from
1994, 1995, or 1996, for each VHAP of potential concern used by the affected source. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For sources using formaldehyde, the baseline level of usage would be based on the free formaldehyde content of the
finishing material. For styrene, the baseline level of usage would be based on an estimate of unreacted styrene, which
would be calculated by multiplying the amount of styrene monomer in the coating by a factor of 0.16. The free formaldehyde
content of the finishing material was chosen as a method for tracking formaldehyde usage because it is a readily available
quantity based on known and agreed upon industry test procedures. However, there is no data available that directly
links the free formaldehyde content of a coating to formaldehyde emissions. Therefore, the Committee recommended
that if data become available that indicated that formaldehyde emissions were either more or less than those estimated
using the free formaldehyde content, the calculation procedure in the formulation assessment plan should be re-examined.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both ultraviolet (UV) and polyester coatings used by the wood furniture industry contain styrene monomer. During
curing, styrene monomer reacts to form the dried coating. However, some of the styrene monomer is emitted during the
application of the coating and as the coating cures. While EPA has not developed an emission factor for styrene for
these coatings, they have developed emission factors for the fabrication of products from polyester resins. These
emission factors are presented in Chapter 4 of EPA's ``Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors.'' The industry
felt that the emission factors developed for vapor-suppressed gelcoats were appropriate for use in estimating unreacted
styrene monomer emissions from UV and polyester coatings. The emission factor for vapor-suppressed gelcoats ranges
from 8 to 25. The industry and EPA agreed to use a midpoint value of 16. While a constant emission factor may not be a true
measure of actual emissions, it would not adversely affect the facility using these coatings because both baseline
emissions and emissions from later years would be estimated on the same basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The source must track usage of each VHAP of potential concern. If, after November 1998, usage of the VHAP of potential
concern exceeds the established baseline levels then the source must provide a written notification to the permitting
authority that describes the amount of increase and explains the reasons for exceedance of the baseline level. As
long as the source is complying with its State Air Toxics Program or any other State rules or requirements affecting
that VHAP of potential concern, any of the following explanations would relieve the facility from further action:
(1) The usage level is below the de minimis level, based on 70 year exposure levels, that is specified through EPA's
rulemaking pursuant to section 112(g) of the Clean Air Act for that VHAP (for sources using control devices to reduce
emissions the usage level can be adjusted to account for the overall control efficiency of the control system); (2)
the increase is no more than 15.0 percent above the baseline level; (3) the source is in compliance with its State air
toxics regulations or guidelines for that VHAP of potential concern; or (4) the VHAP is used in a finishing material
that has a VOC content of no more than 1.0 kg VOC/kg solids (1.0 lb VOC/lb solids), as applied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the explanation for the exceedance of the baseline level is not one of the four discussed above, the owner or operator
must confer with the permitting authority to discuss the reasons for the increase and to determine if these are practical
and reasonable technology-based solutions for reducing usage of the VHAP. The evaluation of whether a technology
is reasonable and practical would be based on cost, quality, and marketability of the product; the successful use
of the technology by other wood furniture manufacturing operations, or other criteria agreed upon by the permitting
authority and owner or operator. If the permitting authority and owner or operator agree there are no practical and
reasonable solutions, the facility would take no further action.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the permitting authority and owner or operator agree that there are solutions, the owner or operator must develop
a plan to reduce usage of the pollutant to the extent feasible. The plan must address the approach to be used to reduce
usage, provide a timetable for implementing the plan, and include a schedule for submitting notifications of progress.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If, after November 1998, the affected source uses a VHAP of potential concern for which a baseline level has not been
established, then the baseline level will be equivalent to the de minimis level, based on 70 year exposure levels and
data provided in the proposed rulemaking pursuant to section 112(g), for that pollutant. Table 5 of the proposed rule,
&sect;63.803(d), includes a list of all VHAP of potential concern. If the affected source's use of the VHAP of potential
concern exceeds the de minimis level, then the affected source must record the reasons for the exceedance and follow
the same procedures as those used when an exceedance of the baseline level occurs for those VHAP listed in Table 4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The de minimis rates for the HAP of potential concern are based on the principles involved and some of the supporting
data used for the proposed rule pursuant to section 112(g). These principles are given in detail in Documentation
of De Minimis Emission Rates_Proposed 40 CFR Part 63, Subpart B Background Document, EPA&hyph;453/R&hyph;93&hyph;035
(this document is available on EPA's Technology Transfer Network) and are briefly described here. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the proposed section 112(g) rulemaking, the basis for the de minimis levels is the use of information that is available
to determine (1) an exposure level which results in a one-per-million cancer risk level, or (2) an exposure level which
constitutes an ``ample margin of safety'' level for noncancer effects. The risk management decisions to use these
two criteria to determine de minimis emission rates are fundamental assumptions in the determination of de minimis
levels for the section 112(g) rulemaking. Note that the de minimis levels do not take into account any additive effects
which may result from exposure to multiple pollutants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For pollutants where insufficient dose-response information is available to determine the exposure level associated
with either a one-per-million cancer risk or an ``ample margin of safety'' for noncancer effects, the proposed rule
contains default values which reflect risk management decisions for establishing the de minimis rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An important risk management decision for establishing de minimis levels under section 112(g) was to ``cap'' de minimis
emission rates at 10.0 tons per year. For example, if an exposure level associated with a one-per-million cancer risk
results in a de minimis level greater than 10.0 tons, the de minimis level, by virtue of the cap, is 10.0 tons. The EPA
believes that it would be difficult to support the designation of a ``trivial'' level of emissions of an air pollutant
that is considered ``major'' by the guiding legislation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The risk management process for establishing de minimis values for the proposed rule for section 112(g) gave consideration
to the interim nature of section 112(g) requirements. For carcinogens with available unit risk estimates, the duration
of exposure used to set de minimis emission rates of such pollutants is the same as the estimated period the section
112(g) rulemaking will be in effect before those provisions are augmented by the section 112(j) provision. At that
time, sources will be subject to case-by-case MACT determinations or the national MACT standards will have been promulgated
for those sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the wood furniture MACT standard was not intended to be interim in nature, it is important to note that the specific
de minimis rates listed in section 112(g) are not intended to be used directly by the wood furniture MACT standard.
Consequently, the rates need to be adjusted to take into account a lifetime duration of exposure. This adjustment
would affect the de minimis levels for pollutants identified as nonthreshold for which unit risk estimates are available.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some industry members of the committee recommended that EPA request comments on the adjustment of the proposed section
112(g) de minimis values from 7-year exposure to 70-year exposure values. Therefore, the EPA is requesting comment
on this issue.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the rule pursuant to section 112(g) is still in the proposal stage, any changes made to the proposed rule upon
its becoming final that affect the wood furniture NESHAP will be made before the wood furniture NESHAP is promulgated.
For example, if any VHAP of potential concern changes in its hazard ranking categorization (e.g., a VHAP is recategorized
from the high concern list to the threshold list) or if information used to determine the exposure level associated
with either a one-per-million cancer risk or an ``ample margin of safety'' for noncancer effects changes the de minimis
value, these changes will also be made to the formulation assessment plan in the wood
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 furniture NESHAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The formulation assessment plan is beneficial to the industry in that its inclusion in the MACT standard and potential
impact on emissions of VHAP of potential concern may reduce health risk to the extent that it would alleviate the need
for additional risk-based Federal air toxics standards to be promulgated for this industry. Section 112(f) of the
Clean Air Act specifies that additional standards may be required for a source category even after a MACT standard
is promulgated. In particular, under section 112(f), EPA is required to promulgate an additional emission standard
for a source category within 8 years after promulgation of the MACT standard depending on the risk remaining to the
most exposed individual or to prevent an adverse environmental effect. An additional standard would be required
if the MACT standard for a source category that emits a pollutant classified as a known, probable, or possible human
carcinogen does not reduce lifetime excess cancer risks to the individual most exposed to emissions from a source
in the category to less than one-in-a-million. Because the formulation assessment plan of the MACT standard deals
with the volatile HAP which likely cause such a risk or other adverse environmental effects upfront and in the MACT
standard, it provides a possibility that the industry would not be subject to future Federal risk-based standards
under section 112(f).

Cleaning and Washoff Operations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As discussed in section II, cleaning operations that occur at wood furniture manufacturing operations include cleaning
of spray guns, lines conveying solvent, finishing materials and adhesives from storage to the spray guns, and spray
booths. In evaluating work practices that could be implemented to reduce emissions from cleaning and washoff operations,
the Committee considered work practices already in use by some facilities in the source category. In addition, the
Work Practice Work Group explored options used by other industries, in particular, the use of alternate cleaning
materials with lower vapor pressure or HAP content. This option was rejected because it limited the source's ability
to reuse the cleaning materials elsewhere, such as for thinning finishing materials.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Work Practice Work Group explored the methods currently being used by facilities in the source category to control
HAP emissions from cleaning and washoff. They used the survey responses collected by the EPA and the industry group,
the experience of personnel from a State Office of Waste Reduction on the Work Group that had worked with wood furniture
manufacturers, and the experience of those involved in the manufacture of products in one or more of the industry segments.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Work Practice Work Group concluded (and the Committee concurred) that there were work practices in use by existing
facilities in the source category to limit emissions from washoff operations and each major cleaning activity: gun/line
cleaning, spray booth cleaning, and general cleaning activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Gun/line cleaning.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The cleaning of spray guns and of lines that carry finishing material, solvent, and adhesives from storage to the spray
guns is a common practice in wood furniture operations. Cleaning is necessary so that dried resins or other materials
do not build up in the lines or spray equipment. The frequency of cleaning varies by plant depending on the different
types of material sprayed with a given gun, the extent to which a gun is used, and other plant-specific factors. Typically,
a gun is cleaned each time it is used to spray a different material. If a gun is dedicated to one type of finishing material
(e.g., topcoat), cleaning frequency may be reduced. The practice of dedicating a gun to a particular coating type
is not common, however, especially at smaller shops that have fewer spray stations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One work practice that the Work Practice Work Group agreed could be universally applied was the collection of solvent
used for cleaning in a container that can be closed. For example, if a line is flushed, the cleaning solvent could be
collected into a normally closed container. Another work practice that the Work Practice Work Group agreed could
be easily implemented is the covering of cleaning solvent containers when not in use. As discussed for storage containers
associated with finishing and gluing operations, such a practice is straightforward and inexpensive.

Spray booth cleaning.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In addition to the emission limits identified for strippable spray booth coatings in Table 3, the Work Practice Work
Group believed that the proposed rule should prohibit the use of organic solvents for spray booth cleaning except
in limited circumstances. Sources subject to this rule could comply by using strippable spray booth coatings that
meet the VOC limits identified in Table 3, thereby reducing the use of organic solvents for this purpose. The Work Practice
Work Group acknowledged that there were instances in which solvent was necessary. Specifically, it was agreed that
conveyors carrying furniture or furniture components through the spray booth and continuous coaters and their enclosures
could continue to be cleaned with solvent. Likewise, organic solvent can continue to be used to clean the metal filters
located in the spray booth. Neither the Work Practice Work Group members nor the rest of the Committee members were
aware of substitute materials that could be used for cleaning this equipment, or of any strippable coating such as
the coating that is available for the spray booth walls. Additionally, industry representatives pointed out that
small tears and holes may be generated in the strippable booth coating during the manufacturing process. In these
cases, some staining of the spray booth walls may occur. The Committee agreed that sources could use small quantities
of solvent, no more than 1.0 gallon per booth, to clean these areas when the strippable booth coating was being replaced.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Furniture washoff. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another area of concern that the Work Practice Work Group focused on was a practice known in the industry as washoff.
Washoff is the practice of removing coating from a piece of furniture or a furniture component. The main reason for
washoff is that the finish does not meet company specifications. By washing off the coatings, the substrate can be
refinished. Washoff is typically accomplished by dipping the furniture into a tank containing organic solvent;
the same solvents used for cleaning are usually used for washoff. The Work Practice Work Group agreed that there were
some measures that sources could implement at almost no cost that could limit emissions from washoff. As with finishing
and other cleaning operations, the Work Practice Work Group agreed that covering washoff tanks when they are not in
use would limit emissions. Also, sources could minimize dripping by tilting and/or rotating the piece to drain as
much solvent as possible back into the tank. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General cleaning/washoff activities. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the Work Practice Work Group discussions, it was apparent that cleaning and washoff practices are not well
documented by sources. For example, most sources do not know the quantity of solvent used for cleaning and washoff
operations, how many pieces are washed off, and the fate of spent solvent from cleaning and washoff operations. The
Work Practice Work Group agreed that one of the first steps in reducing emissions is to know the quantity of solvent
used for the various operations onsite. Only then can a source identify operations that are wasteful or inefficient.
Therefore, the Work Practice Work Group proposed that the work practices in the proposed rule require a cleaning and
washoff solvent accounting system. Under this system, sources would have to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Maintain a log of the quantity and type of solvent used for washoff and cleaning, the number of pieces washed off,
and the reason for the washoff; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Record the quantity of spent solvent generated from each activity, and its ultimate fate either onsite or offsite;

, are not present in cleaning or washoff solvents in concentrations subject to MSDS reporting as required by OSHA.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The net cleaning and washoff solvent usage quantities, accounting for disposal and recycling of spent solvent, shall
be calculated monthly. Actual copies of the logs should be made available to the Administrator or permitting authority
upon request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee agreed with the Work Practice Work Group's recommendation that an accounting system be implemented
by affected sources. The Committee believed that once the accounting system was in place, the burden of maintaining
it would not be too great. The Committee also believed that the accounting system would be an important first step for
facilities to develop a broad-based, multimedia pollution prevention plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some Agency officials have expressed concern that the proposed rule only restricts the use of EPA type A and type B
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 carcinogens in cleaning and washoff solvents. They are concerned that restricting the use of only these chemicals
implies that they are worse than other HAP. They are also concerned that the rule draws a clear line between type B and
C carcinogens, although the scientific evidence does not suggest such a clear distinction. For example, some pollutants
on the HAP list are designated type B/C because the data cannot clearly support a designation of type B or C. The proposed
rule does not address these pollutants. Finally, the Agency is planning to update their risk assessment guidelines.
Under these revised guidelines, the terms type A and type B carcinogens are likely to be meaningless. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee agreed to restrict the use of type A and type B

 carcinogens only, so the EPA is proposing the rule using this approach. However, to address the concerns of some Agency
officials, the EPA is specifically requesting comment on this issue including: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Should additional HAP, for example, all VHAP of potential concern, be restricted from use in cleaning and washoff
solvents; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. If the approach proposed in the rule is used, how should chemicals designated as type B/C carcinogens be addressed;
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. If the approach proposed in the rule is used and the risk assessment guidelines are revised so that the terms type
A and type B become obsolete, how could the rule be revised to maintain the intent of the proposed rule?

General Work Practice Requirements. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After reviewing the work practices to be included, the Committee concluded that in order for the proposed work practices
to be successfully implemented, employees that would actually have to carry them out should be involved in their implementation.
Therefore, an operator training program is included as a proposed work practice. The Committee believed that operator
training was especially important for new employees and therefore proposed that new employees be trained upon hiring.
The Committee agreed that the proposed rule should be flexible and allow sources to develop programs that work best
for their facility or that could be coordinated with existing training programs. The proposed rule does require that,
at a minimum, the employee training program address coating application, cleaning, and washoff techniques that
minimize emissions; appropriate equipment operation; methods to reduce solvent usage; and proper management of
cleanup wastes. The Committee also proposed that the rule require retraining of all employees on an annual basis.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Members of the Work Practice Work Group proposed to the Committee that the standards should require affected sources
to develop an Implementation Plan that describes how sources plan to comply with the work practice requirements on
an on-going basis. Based on the proposed work practices, the Committee believed that any Implementation Plan should
include, at a minimum, the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

2. Other Work Practices Considered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In developing the work practices for the proposed rule, the Work Practices Work Group as well as other Committee members
identified additional measures that were considered for inclusion in the proposed rule. This section identifies
those other measures and discusses why the Committee did not include these measures in the proposed rule. Individual
sources and regulators are encouraged to consider this list to determine if some measures may be appropriate, or at
least applicable to some sources within the source category. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following measures were identified as possible work practices but were not included in the proposed rule: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Facilities should develop a multimedia pollution prevention plan that addresses hazardous waste generation,
solid waste generation, water pollution releases, air emissions, and worker exposure; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Position workpiece to minimize overspray, and position the piece to facilitate good spraying techniques by operators;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Whenever practical, use heat instead of solvent to reduce coating viscosity; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Optimize spray pattern and technique to the work piece size, shape, and orientation; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Use self-contained recycling gun washers; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Whenever practical, schedule colors light to dark to minimize extent of cleaning needed, and try to schedule long
runs to minimize material changeover and associated cleaning; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Reduce the need for cleaning by using dedicated equipment for high-volume coatings; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Use the shortest possible lines to reduce solvent needed for line cleaning; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Drain lines prior to solvent cleaning and use air pressure, pigs/squeegees, or solvent pulse cleaning; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Reuse dirty cleaning and washoff solvents for noncritical uses wherever possible, and recycle the solvents once
they are too contaminated for reuse; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Review the EPA's Alternative Control Techniques Document_Industrial Cleaning Solvents (EPA No. 453/R&hyph;94&hyph;015)
and incorporate reduction techniques identified therein. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several of the above practices were not proposed by the Committee because the Committee believed that by requiring
them, the proposed rule would be dictating specific manufacturing techniques that may not be appropriate for all
situations. Specifically, the Committee believed that this eliminated options 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Also, options
such as 2, 4, 8, 9, and 10 are cost savings techniques that would likely be implemented by a facility if they were technically
feasible. The Committee decided that, for the most part, options 6 and 7 were not feasible for this industry because
the manufacturing schedule is highly dependent on the furniture order that is received in a given week, month, etc.
Manufacturers that consistently produce the same item are most likely using these more efficient techniques. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Options 1 and 11 would require sources to develop more broad-based plans and accounting systems to track not only cleaning
solvent usage but, specifically in the case of option 1, a plan to address wastes from other media. The Committee considered
that the proposed rule required tracking finishing material usage (to demonstrate compliance with the emission
limits), cleaning solvent usage, and washoff solvent usage; the Committee believed that these requirements were
good foundations to any multimedia, pollution prevention plan. Therefore, the Committee did not recommend that
additional plans be required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Option 3 was not considered necessary by the Committee because the emission limits address the addition of thinner
to coatings. Finally, option 5, the use of recycling gun washers, was not proposed because the Work Practice Work Group
did not have data on these systems that indicated they were more efficient than other methods of spray gun cleaning.
Because there are no data on the effectiveness of these units, the Committee concluded that industry should not be
required to purchase them, especially because the proposed work practices already require flushing solvent used
for gun cleaning into normally closed containers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee recognized that many work practices are proposed for this rule and implementation and compliance could
become complicated. However, looking at other control techniques feasible for this industry, the Committee concluded
that work practices would be the most technically feasible and least costly. The EPA specifically requests comments
on the work practice standards: (1) do the work practices (in conjunction with the emission limits) adequately reduce
HAP emissions; and (2) are the work practices overly burdensome to implement or should additional work practices
be considered? The EPA requests data to support or refute a proposed work practice or, for additional work practices
that are suggested, evidence of its effectiveness in reducing emissions.

F. Pollution Prevention Considerations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 establishes the following environmental management hierarchy as national
policy: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Pollution should be prevented or reduced at the source wherever feasible; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Pollution that cannot be prevented should be recycled in an environmentally safe manner wherever feasible; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Pollution that cannot be prevented or recycled should be treated in an environmentally safe manner wherever feasible;
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Disposal or other release into the environment should be employed only as a last resort and should be conducted in
an environmentally safe manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Pollution Prevention Act considers ``source reduction'' a fundamental aspect of pollution prevention. Source
reduction is any practice that reduces the amount of any hazardous substance entering the waste stream or otherwise
released into the environment prior to recycling, treatment, or disposal. Practices such as recycling, energy recovery,
treatment, and disposal are not considered pollution prevention measures under the Pollution Prevention Act. As
noted above, however, recycling conducted in an environmentally safe manner is still desirable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule not only encourages pollution prevention, but even requires certain pollution prevention measures.
By expressing the proposed emission limit for finishing operations in terms of kg VHAP/kg solids (lb VHAP/lb solids),
sources are encouraged to reduce the quantity of HAP through reformulation measures. Likewise, the emission limits
for cleaning and gluing operations limit VOC or HAP content and sources will likely comply by using reformulated materials.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule allows sources to comply with emission limits through other means such as control devices, which
would not be pollution prevention. The proposed work practices, however, ensure that pollution prevention measures
will be implemented at all major sources using HAP for finishing, gluing, cleaning, or washoff operations. Source
reduction of HAP from finishing operations is achieved by prohibiting the use of conventional air spray guns except
in limited situations. As previously described, application equipment with a higher transfer efficiency than conventional
air guns will result in lower air emissions and reduced solid waste. Training operators in proper application techniques,
cleaning and washoff procedures, and waste management will reduce emissions from finishing, cleaning, gluing,
and washoff operations. Source reduction of HAP from cleaning operations is achieved by prohibiting the use of solvent
for spray booth cleaning except in limited situations. Finally, although it cannot be assumed that it will actually
result in source reduction, the cleaning and washoff solvent accounting system may prompt facilities to eliminate
inefficient uses of solvent.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

G. Selection of Compliance and Monitoring Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the regulatory negotiation, the Committee discussed general compliance measures; e.g., that compliance
would be achieved through recordkeeping and reporting, the frequency of reporting, and the averaging time for compliance
for a source choosing to use an averaging approach to meet the finishing material emission limits. After the regulatory
negotiation, the Agency included the general concepts agreed to by the Committee into a regulatory framework that
would also fulfill the requirements of the amended Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For a rule to be effective, an owner or operator of an affected source must demonstrate both initial and continuous
compliance. The initial and continuous compliance measures included in the proposed rule account for situations
in which either a control device or compliant finishing materials, adhesives, and cleaning materials are used. (See
Table 5 for a summary of the proposed compliance and monitoring requirements.) In this industry, it is likely that
the majority of sources will use compliant materials to comply with the proposed emission limits; control devices
are likely to be used in limited situations.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The initial and continuous compliance methods for sources using control devices are identified in &sect;&sect;63.804(f)(4)
and (f)(6) and (g)(4) and (g)(6) of the proposed rule and are generally consistent with previous regulations developed
by the Agency. Therefore, the rationale for selection of these requirements is not discussed in great detail here.
For example, the proposed rule requires the same type of monitoring parameters for a source using a thermal incinerator
as those required by &sect;63.114 of the HON (57 FR 62608). A source must determine the HAP emission rate using EPA Reference
Method 18, and during the test set the minimum combustion temperature that corresponds to compliance with the standards.
Subsequent operation at a combustion temperature lower than this value constitutes a violation of the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Special compliance provisions have been included for catalytic incinerators equipped with a fluidized bed and for
carbon adsorbers. The compliance provisions for catalytic incinerators equipped with a fluidized bed are consistent
with those currently in use by the only facility in the source category equipped with such a device. These provisions
have proven successful in demonstrating compliance for this facility, so EPA has agreed to adopt these provisions
for this category. However, they should not be adopted as compliance measures by other source categories without
a thorough evaluation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this proposed rule, compliance monitoring is identified only for incinerators and carbon adsorbers because other
types of control devices are not likely to be used for compliance. If an alternate control device is used by an affected
source, the rule includes provisions for proposing appropriate compliance monitoring to the Administrator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule also recognizes that the overall control efficiency of a control system does not depend only on the
destruction efficiency of the device but on the capture efficiency as well. The capture efficiency is the ratio of
the quantity of pollutants entering the control device to the quantity of pollutants emitted from the emission source.
The overall control efficiency is the product of the capture and control efficiency. The proposed rule identifies
the methods to be used to determine the capture efficiency initially, and the monitoring required to demonstrate
that this efficiency is continuously maintained. The provisions contained in the proposed rule are the same as those
in the NESHAP for the magnetic tape industry (59 FR 11662), which was proposed on March 11, 1994. Owners or operators
of a source to which the capture efficiency provisions apply are encouraged to review the magnetic tape preamble and
rule to understand the rationale for selecting the capture efficiency provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As previously stated, most affected sources are expected to comply with the proposed rule by using compliant materials.
Initial and on-going compliance for these sources are demonstrated through reporting and recordkeeping requirements.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The records and reports that the EPA considers necessary for demonstrating initial and continuous compliance for
this source category are summarized in Table 5. (The selection of reporting and recordkeeping requirements is further
discussed in section VI.H.) Reports identified under initial compliance methods in Table 5 are required to be submitted
in accordance with the requirements of &sect;63.9(h) of subpart A, the General Provisions to part 63. Information
that should be included in the initial compliance report is identified in Table 5. In order to perform the emission
calculations, a source must by necessity keep records of the quantity of finishing material used over each month,
and the VHAP and solids content of these finishing materials (see Table 6). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An affected source demonstrates continuous compliance if finishing materials, thinners, adhesives, and spray
booth materials meeting the limits in the proposed rule are used. If a source at any time uses a material that does not
meet these limits (unless the source is using an averaging approach or is subject to the special compliance provisions
for coatings applied with continuous coaters), the source is out of compliance with the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A source that complies with emission limits for finishing operations by achieving an average HAP limit across all
finishing steps is in compliance if, over each month, the HAP limit required by the proposed rule is met. The Committee
agreed that a monthly averaging period was appropriate for this source category because, at many facilities, manufacturing
operations change from week-to-week or even day-to-day. The compliance timeframe of a month that is identified in
the proposed rule accounts for this variation, and allows a source flexibility in performing manufacturing operations.
The Committee did not think that there would be any adverse environmental impact by choosing a monthly compliance
period. It was agreed that throughout the month, a source would not be likely to exceed the HAP limit by a considerable
amount. If it did, they would have difficulty in meeting the monthly limit. If a source does not meet the HAP limit over
any monthly period, it is out of compliance with the rule for each operating day of the month unless the source can demonstrate
through records that the violation of the monthly average can be attributed to a particular day or days of operation.
Further, periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction should be included when determining compliance when methods
other than control devices are used to meet the emission limits. Startup, shutdown, and malfunction periods are included
because the use of compliant coatings should not be affected during these periods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Semiannual reporting, in addition to recordkeeping, is necessary to document the compliance status of the affected
source. A source using compliant finishing materials, thinners, adhesives, or strippable spray booth coatings
must submit a semiannual compliance certification that states compliant materials are being used. A source using
an averaging approach must provide copies of each month's emission calculation and submit a semiannual compliance
certification that states that the value of (E), as calculated by Equation 1 of &sect;63.804, is no greater than 1.0
for existing sources or 0.8 for new sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has identified semiannual reporting for this source category, except for sources that experience excess
emissions and are using a control device to comply with the proposed rule. For these sources, continuous monitoring
system data are used directly for determining compliance. Sources with a control device that experience excess emissions
must follow a quarterly reporting format for at least 1 year after the excess emissions occur and until a request to
reduce reporting frequency is approved. This is consistent with guidance provided in the General Provisions, subpart
A, 63.10(e)(3). In addition, if the Administrator finds significant industry-wide noncompliance with the rule,
the Administrator may require that semiannual reporting be changed to quarterly reporting. The Agency considered
small business impacts when developing the compliance and monitoring provisions and decided that more frequent
reporting for those sources that are routinely complying with the rule would not be necessary for small businesses.

The Agency also believed it necessary to identify compliance provisions for the work practice standards because
significant emission reductions will be achieved through the work practice standards. Obviously, direct measurement
of emissions is not appropriate because emission points being controlled by work practices are not point sources
that emit through a stack. All of the recordkeeping associated with work practices is required by the proposed rule
to be included in the Work Practice Implementation Plan. The Agency believed that the least complicated way to ensure
continuous compliance would be to require a semiannual compliance certification that states that the Work Practice
Implementation Plan is being followed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compliance certifications submitted on a semiannual basis are required for a source that uses compliant materials
or an averaging approach, and for a source demonstrating compliance with the Work Practice Implementation Plan.
These compliance certifications are analogous to the compliance certification required by the parts 70 and 71 operating
permit programs. Therefore, the compliance certification required by these proposed standards are consistent
with other regulatory actions that may also apply to the affected source.

H. Selection of Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In discussing the reporting and recordkeeping requirements, the Committee agreed on the types of records required
and the reporting frequency it considered appropriate for this source category. As with the compliance and monitoring
requirements, the Committee focused solely on the general information that should form the basis of the reporting
and recordkeeping requirements. The Agency has developed a specific regulatory framework identifying reporting
and recordkeeping requirements that builds on the general principles agreed to by the Committee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The General Provisions (subpart A) to part 63 include general reporting and recordkeeping requirements that apply
to sources for which a NESHAP has been developed, or will be developed, pursuant to section 112 of the Act. The requirements
of the General Provisions, in conjunction with the Committee's decisions, form the basis for the reporting and recordkeeping
provisions of the proposed rule. A summary of these provisions is provided in Table 6. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For sources using control devices, all of the reporting and recordkeeping requirements of the General Provisions
apply. The General Provisions are particularly directed to sources that are using a control device, and that will
therefore be conducting an initial performance test and performing traditional emission or process parameter monitoring.
As such, for sources that are using compliant coatings or an averaging approach to demonstrate compliance with the
proposed rule, some sections of the General Provisions do not apply. Table 6 summarizes those sections of the General
Provisions requiring reporting or recordkeeping and identifies whether all sources are subject to the section or
just sources using control devices. (For a discussion of the relationship between the proposed rule and the General
Provisions in their entirety, see section VI.K.) Sources using compliant materials or an averaging approach to comply
with the proposed standards must keep records of finishing material usage, the VHAP content, in kg 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
VHAP/kg solids (lb VHAP/lb solids), as applied, of each finishing material, thinner, and adhesive subject to the
emission limits in &sect;63.802; the VOC content, in kg VOC/kg solids (lb VOC/lb solids), as applied, of each strippable
booth coating; and the CPDS for finishing materials, cleaning materials, adhesives, thinners, and strippable booth
coatings subject to regulation.

I. Small Business Considerations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because of the large number of small businesses that could potentially be impacted by regulation of the wood furniture
industry, the Committee considered carefully the impact of each aspect of the proposed standards on small businesses.
The Committee included two small wood furniture manufacturers and a representative of a trade association consisting
primarily of small businesses. A Small Business Work Group was formed to specifically address small business issues.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In evaluating options that the industry could use to comply with the proposed standards, the Committee tried to ensure
that the compliance options would impose a minimum burden on small businesses. For example, the proposed standards
do not require the use of control devices that require a significant capital investment and impose an unfair burden
on small businesses that typically have trouble raising capital. Small businesses can meet the emission limits for
finishing materials and adhesives through the use of compliant materials. The Committee tried to ensure that the
recordkeeping and reporting requirements of the proposed standards were not beyond the resources of small businesses.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee also evaluated whether the proposed work practice standards presented any particular problems to
small businesses. Some members felt that developing an operator training program might pose some problems to small
businesses. Rather than exempt small businesses from what the Committee feels is a key work practice, the Committee
decided to recommend that small businesses work together to develop a training program. The Committee also suggested
that large businesses that already have training programs in place could share the key components of those programs
with small businesses. Finally, the Committee recommended that State small businesses assistance programs assist
small businesses in developing their training program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Small Business Work Group made several recommendations to the Committee, including a recommendation that the
EPA draft a document that would provide guidance to small businesses on how to obtain a Federally-enforceable limit
on their potential to emit and recordkeeping requirements that might be associated with the limit. In addition, small
business representatives proposed that the EPA draft a memorandum responding to questions developed by the Small
Business Work Group pertaining to area sources that become major sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Small Business Work Group also recommended that the EPA discuss in the preamble the benefits of general permits
for small businesses and encourage their use where appropriate. The Agency agreed and a discussion of general permits
is included in section VI.L. The Small Business Work Group also recommended that the EPA, in conjunction with the State
of North Carolina Small Business Ombudsman Office, develop an information outreach program to serve as a resource
for small wood furniture manufacturers. The Agency has agreed to work with the North Carolina Small Business Ombudsman
Office to develop this program.

J. Selection of Definition of Source 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The choice of an affected source influences possible reconstruction and modification impacts of the proposed standards.
It also determines the point at which the addition or replacement of individual emission sources (i.e., a spray booth,
or a finishing line) results in a new source. Section 112(a)(3) of the Act defines ``stationary source'' as having
the same meaning as that given in section 111(a) of the Act, where ``stationary source'' is defined as ``any building,
structure, facility, or installation which emits or may emit any air pollutant.'' Most industrial plants consist
of numerous pieces or groups of equipment that emit HAP and that may be viewed as ``sources.'' The EPA, therefore, uses
the term ``affected source'' to designate the equipment within a particular facility that is chosen as the source
covered by a given rule. The definition of source may be broad and include all emission points within a facility, or
may be narrow and include only an individual piece of equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Reconstruction Considerations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Reconstruction is defined by &sect;63.5 as the replacement of the components of a stationary source to such an extent
that: (1) the fixed capital cost of the new components exceeds 50 percent of the fixed capital cost that would be required
to construct a comparable new source, and (2) it is technologically and economically feasible for the reconstructed
source to meet the promulgated emission standards established by the Administrator pursuant to section 112 of the
Act. Upon reconstruction, a stationary source is subject to relevant standards for new sources, including compliance
dates, irrespective of any change in emissions of HAP from that source. Major affected sources constructed or reconstructed
after the effective date of a rule promulgated under this part are also subject to the preconstruction and review requirements
in &sect;63.5 (d) and (e).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If, for example, an entire plant is designated as the affected source, the new source MACT would cover no part of the
plant unless replacement of equipment or a group of equipment causes the entire plant to be reconstructed. On the other
hand, if each individual piece of equipment (e.g., each spray booth) is designated as an affected source, then that
individual piece of equipment can be subject to the reconstruction provisions. A narrow definition of source, such
as this one, results in new source MACT applying to each piece of new equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Modification Considerations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
According to section 112(a)(5), modification means any physical change in, or change in the method of operation of,
a major source that increases the actual emissions of any HAP emitted by such source by more than a de minimis amount
or that results in the emission of any HAP not previously emitted by more than a de minimis amount. Subpart B of part 63
addresses modifications and identifies the de minimis quantities for each HAP that would trigger the modification
provisions. Subpart B requires modified major sources to implement the MACT emission limit for existing sources
established pursuant to section 112(d). If a MACT rule for an affected major source has not been promulgated, existing
source MACT is established on a case-by-case basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For this source category, the modification provisions are not a primary consideration in selecting the affected
source designation. Modifications of existing sources would mean that the existing source MACT standards continue
to apply. The only modification that would occur in this industry that would affect a source's control requirements
would be one that causes an area source to become a major source. If an area source becomes major due to a modification,
it is subject to existing source MACT. If an area source becomes major due to a reconstruction, it is subject to new source
MACT. The affected source definition, however, has no effect on the major source designation because that designation
is based on emissions from all emission points located in a contiguous area under common control, even if the affected
source is narrowly defined. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Affected Source Definitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Committee did not discuss the affected source definition for the proposed rule. The Agency, therefore, is proposing
the affected source definition that it believes is consistent with the Committee's other decisions. To determine
the appropriate affected source definition, the Agency focused on the proposed standards for finishing operations
as the driving force for choosing an affected source definition. The Agency did this because the finishing operation
is the primary emission source at the majority of sources, and the proposed MACT standards differ depending on whether
the source is existing or new. The Agency concluded that there are three possible affected source definitions for
finishing operations: each finishing step, each finishing line, or each facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency first considered the implications of defining the source as each finishing step. With this affected source
definition, if a new application station (e.g., a spray booth) was added to a finishing line, the finishing material
used in this step would have to meet the MACT standards for new sources. The Agency agreed that this was not feasible
because the proposed rule allows for averaging within and across finishing steps. If a source is subject to new source
MACT for one step and not for others, this step could not be incorporated into the averaging and the facility's flexibility
would be limited. This runs counter to the Committee's previous decision to allow sources the maximum flexibility
possible in complying with the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second possible affected source definition would be to define a finishing line as the affected source. New source
MACT would apply if a facility installed a new finishing line, or if an existing line was reconstructed, as reconstruction
is defined in &sect;63.5. With this affected source definition, new source MACT is considered technically feasible
by the Agency because all of the finishing materials applied would have to meet the same HAP limit. The same problems
with averaging arise, however, as arise if a finishing step is the affected source. For example, if a facility operates
multiple finishing lines, including one that is subject to new source MACT, the new line could not be included in the
averaging calculation because the HAP limit that applies to it is different than the limit that applies to the other
lines. Because this limits a facility's flexibility, the Agency did not select the finishing line as the affected
source. Also, it is sometimes difficult to define the finishing line within a plant. For example, an owner or operator
may add or remove pieces to or from a finishing line at any stage of the finishing. For all of these reasons, the Agency,
by default, chose the entire facility to be the affected source.

K. Relationship Between General Provisions and Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Provisions (subpart A) to part 63 apply to any source that emits or has the potential to emit any HAP and is
subject to any rule promulgated under part 63. Thus, all major sources performing wood furniture manufacturing are
subject to subpart A. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Major sources subject to the proposed standards are subject to subpart A. However, some of the provisions of subpart
A are applicable only to sources using control devices to comply with a rule established under part 63. As such, sources
complying with this proposed rule by using compliant finishing materials, adhesives, thinners, and spray booth
coatings are not subject to the following sections of subpart A. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Section 63.6(e)(3) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section requires the submittal of a startup, shutdown, malfunction plan. For sources complying with the proposed
rule through the use of compliant materials or an averaging approach at all times, periods of startup and shutdown
have no relevance and should be included in the compliance determination. Likewise, a malfunction would not cause
an increase in emissions because emission reduction is achieved through source reduction. Even if equipment malfunctions,
the reformulated materials would still be in use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Section 63.7 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section specifies procedures for conducting a performance test and therefore would not apply. The performance
demonstration for sources complying using compliant materials or an averaging approach involves submitting the
information required by &sect;63.804(f)(1), (2), (3), (5), (7), and (8) of the proposed rule. This information must
be submitted within 60 days because the compliance status information report is required by &sect;63.807(b) to be
submitted within 60 days after the compliance date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Section 63.8 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section specifies monitoring requirements. The compliance provisions of &sect;63.804(g)(1), (2), (3), (5),
(7), and (8) of the proposed rule supersede &sect;63.8 for sources using compliant materials or an averaging approach.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Section 63.9(e), (g), and (h)(2)(ii) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 63.9(e) and 63.9(g) do not apply to sources using compliant materials or an averaging approach because they
pertain to sources conducting performance tests and using continuous monitoring systems, respectively.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 63.9(h)(2)(ii) specifies that the compliance status information report be submitted within 60 days after
the performance test. This requirement is relevant to sources using compliant materials, but is clarified by &sect;63.807(b)
of the proposed rule, which requires that the compliance status information report be submitted within 60 days after
the compliance date, not 60 days after the compliance determination, for sources using compliant materials. As written,
&sect;63.9(h)(2)(ii) is not applicable for sources using compliant materials because no performance test is being
required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Section 63.10(b)(2)(i&hyph;vi, viii&hyph;xi, xiii) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These sections do not apply to sources using compliant materials because they specifically pertain to the startup,
shutdown, and malfunction plan; performance tests; or continuous monitoring systems. Sections 63.10(b)(2)(vii,
xii, and xiv) apply because they are more generic. Paragraph (2)(vii) requires that a source maintain records of all
required measurements needed to demonstrate compliance. Paragraph (2)(xii) is related to the request for a waiver
of reporting and recordkeeping requirements, which some sources subject to the proposed standards may pursue. Paragraph
(2)(xiv) requires that a source maintain records to support initial notifications and notification of compliance
status. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These sections do not apply to sources using compliant materials or an averaging approach because they pertain to
continuous monitoring systems, performance testing, or startup, shutdown, malfunction reports.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Provisions do not specify the reporting requirements for sources not operating continuous monitoring
systems. Therefore, the reporting requirements in &sect;63.807(c) of the proposed rule apply. In lieu of the above
monitoring requirements, the proposed rule contains continuous compliance provisions in &sect;63.804(g) for
sources complying through the use of reformulated materials.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

L. Relationship Between Operating Permit Program and Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the operating permit regulations codified at 40 CFR part 70, any source that is a major source under the Act, or
any nonmajor source subject to standards under sections 111 or 112 of the Act, must obtain an operating permit (see
&sect;70.3(a)(1).). Therefore, all major sources subject to these proposed standards must obtain an operating
permit. Area sources in this source category are not regulated by the proposed standards and would therefore not be
required to obtain an operating permit, unless a State with an approved operating permit program chooses to permit
all nonmajor sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are many major sources in this source category that are major based solely on their potential to emit. Such sources
may choose to obtain a Federally enforceable limit on their potential to emit such that they are no longer considered
major sources and not subject to the proposed rule. Sources that opt to limit their potential to emit are referred to
by the EPA as ``synthetic area'' sources. The limiting of a source's potential to emit is identified as Federally enforceable
by &sect;70.6(b) of part 70. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee agreed that this source category was one that could benefit from the development of a general permit.
Under part 70, State permitting authorities are allowed to develop general permits for categories of sources containing
numerous similar sources. In deciding which source should be covered by general permits, State regulators must consider
three primary criteria: (1) source categories covered by general permits should contain similar operations and
emit pollutants with similar characteristics; (2) sources should not be subject to case-by-case standards; and
(3) sources should be subject to the same or substantially similar requirements governing operation, emissions,
monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping. General permits were developed primarily to alleviate some of the permitting
burden to area sources that are subject to section 112 standards and therefore required to obtain a title V permit.
However, the preamble to part 70 states that general permits may be issued to cover any category of numerous similar
sources, including major sources. Therefore, the Committee recommends that State permitting agencies pursue a
general permit for wood furniture operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are several benefits to a general permit. If a general permit developed by a permitting authority has been approved
after public participation, and the EPA and affected State review, the permitting authority may then grant or deny
a general permit to a source without further public participation or the EPA and affected State review. The action
of granting or denying a general permit is also not subject to judicial review. Another benefit of a general permit
that would be particularly advantageous for the wood furniture industry is that sources may use general permits strictly
for the purposes of becoming synthetic area sources; i.e., limiting the potential to emit. Finally, for owners and
operators with sources in multiple source categories located in a contiguous area, a general permit can be issued
to a discrete affected source at an industrial complex.

VII. Other Considerations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to establishing emission limits and work practice standards for the industry, several members of the
Committee were also interested in establishing a mechanism for tracking the impact of the standards on emissions
of HAP and other pollutants, collecting information on technologies being used to meet the standards, and providing
a forum for dissemination of information on evolving technologies. The Committee members felt that it was important
to verify the proposed standards were achieving the reductions in emissions and hazards that were expected and to
provide information on the technologies and substances being used to achieve those reductions. Because the emission
limits for finishing materials can be met through substitution of non-HAP VOC's for HAP, and some non-HAP's can be
as hazardous as the listed HAP's, they felt it was important to track emissions of other pollutants from the industry
to ensure that materials of equal or greater toxicity were not being substituted for HAP, and that appropriate action
would be taken if this should occur. Throughout the regulatory negotiation, there was discussion of new, lower emitting
(both VOC and HAP) technologies that are reportedly on the threshold of demonstration. The Committee members felt
that as these technologies are demonstrated, the information should be made available to the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After some discussion among Committee members concerning the logistics of collecting and disseminating the information,
the Committee decided that the preamble to the NESHAP should call for a trends report. The report would be developed
by the industry. The report would be made available to the EPA, who would disseminate it to all interested parties.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In compiling a trends report, the Committee agreed that industry will survey a sample of the industry that is determined
to be representative of the entire industry. This industry-collected data will initially establish a baseline for
this report and will, in subsequent years, be used to determine whether there have been increases and/or decreases
in overall industry use of VHAP's and VOC's, and will include data on increases and/or decreases in the use of individual
VHAP's or VOC's. Individual facility or company data would be collected and assembled by industry sources. As the
individual data submissions will reflect confidential business practices and/or trade secrets, such individual
submissions are prohibited from public disclosure except pursuant to court order or other legal requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This agreement to compile a trends report begins with the report submitted for the baseline year, 1994, which industry
will compile and submit to the Agency in 1995. Reports thereafter will be compiled every 2 years, beginning with a trends
report for 1996. This agreement to submit a trends report will terminate 1 year after EPA is required to complete the
review of this standard prescribed by 42 U.S.C. section 7412(f)(2), which mandates EPA to review NESHAP for residual
risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the above data, the Committee agreed that the trends report would include a brief discussion of technologies
being used by the industry to reduce emissions, and a discussion of evolving technologies including new finishing
materials, adhesives, and improved application equipment. This discussion would not be an attempt to explain the
emission trends, but rather it would be an independent review from industry experts on new technologies that are coming
into increased use or that may be developing. The Committee also recommended a working group be formed from interested
Committee members to provide further input on the details of the scope of the report.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Docket 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The docket is an organized and complete file of all the information submitted to or otherwise considered by the EPA
in the development of this proposed rulemaking. The principal purposes of the docket are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. To allow interested parties to identify and locate documents readily so that they can participate intelligently
and effectively in the rulemaking process; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. To serve as the record in case of judicial review (except for interagency review material [section 307(d)(7)(a)
of the Clean Air Act]). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 [58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)], the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines
``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal
governments or communities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order 12866, the EPA has determined that this rule is not a ``significant regulatory
action.'' Therefore, the EPA has determined that it will not be sent to OMB for review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Paperwork Reduction Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The information collection requirements in this proposed rule have been submitted for approval to the office of Management
and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. An Information Collection Request document
has been prepared by the EPA (ICR No. 1716.01), and a copy may be obtained from Sandy Farmer, Information Policy Branch,
EPA, 401 M Street, SW. (2136), Washington, DC 20460, or by calling (202) 260&hyph;2740. The public burden for this
collection of information is estimated to average 187 hours per respondent annually for recordkeeping and reporting.
This includes time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, conducting performance tests,
gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions
for reducing this burden, to Chief, Information Policy Branch, 2136, U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401
M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460, and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management
and Budget, Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for the EPA.'' The final rule will respond to any
OMB or public comments on the information collection requirements contained in this proposal.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) requires the EPA to consider potential impacts of proposed regulations
on small entities. It is currently the EPA policy to perform a regulatory flexibility analysis of the potential impacts
of proposed regulations on small entities whenever it is anticipated that any small entities may be adversely impacted.
Because it was anticipated that some small wood furniture manufacturers could be adversely impacted from implementation
of the proposed standards, a regulatory flexibility analysis was performed. A copy of the Economic Impact Regulatory
Flexibility Analysis is included in the docket.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While the majority of the approximately 11,000 wood furniture operations are small businesses, the vast majority
of the smaller operations would not be directly affected by this proposed standard. Only approximately 7 percent
of the 11,000 manufacturers are expected to be directly impacted. The estimate of 7 percent is based on EPA's estimate
of the number of sources that are major based on actual emissions. It is anticipated that the remainder of the industry
will take a Federally enforceable limit on their emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed under the summary of impacts (section IV.C of the preamble), the economic analysis predicted a slight
increase in wood furniture prices. Therefore, the vast majority of small manufacturers, which will not be subject
to the proposed rule may benefit from these slightly increased prices. If these costs are not offset by newer, less
expensive technologies in the future, this benefit may be sustained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the smaller facilities that would be directly impacted by implementation of the proposed standards, an analysis
of the potential impact of this proposed standard by plant size was performed. The results from this analysis indicate
that implementation of this proposed rule would generally have a small impact on the net revenues of facilities of
all size groups and that smaller plants would not be systematically impacted more severely than larger operations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this proposed rule, if promulgated, will not have
a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small business entities.

F. Miscellaneous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with section 117 of the Act, publication of this proposal was preceded by consultation with appropriate
advisory committees, independent experts, and Federal departments and agencies within the framework of a regulatory
negotiation. The Administrator will welcome comments on all aspects of the proposed regulation, including health,
economic and technological issues, and on the proposed test methods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This regulation will be reviewed 8 years from the date of promulgation. This review will include an assessment of such
factors as evaluation of the residual health risks, any overlap with other programs, the existence of alternative
methods, enforceability, improvements in emission control technology and health data, and the recordkeeping and
reporting requirements.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed standards would limit emissions of hazardous air pollutants (HAP) from surface coating operations
from any new or existing shipbuilding and ship repair facilities at a major source (defined in part V, A). The proposed
standards implement section 112(d) of the Clean Air Act (Act), which requires the Administrator to regulate emissions
of those chemicals designated as HAP in section 112(b). The intent of the proposed standards is to protect the public
health by requiring new and existing major sources to limit HAP emissions to levels attainable by use of maximum achievable
control technology (MACT).

I. Description of the Source Category 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 112 of the Act requires the EPA to evaluate and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control emissions of HAP. The control of HAP is to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieved through promulgation of emission standards under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sections 112(d) and (f) for major source categories and such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minor sources as deemed appropriate that emit HAP. Pursuant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to section 112(c) of the Act, the EPA published in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the initial list of source categories that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emit HAP on July 16, 1992 (57 FR 31576). This list includes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both ``major'' and ``area'' sources (as defined by the Act) that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the EPA intends to regulate before November of the year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2000. The initial list of source categories includes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Shipbuilding and Ship Repair (Surface Coating),'' the major 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources only, as a source category. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the purpose of the proposed rule, shipbuilding and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ship repair refers to all facilities that build, repair, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paint, repaint, convert, or alter ships. (Hereafter, this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry will be referred to as ``shipbuilding.'') A ship is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defined as any marine or fresh-water vessel used for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
military or commercial operations, including self-propelled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessels, those towed by other craft (barges), and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
navigational aids (buoys). This definition includes, but is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not limited to, all military vessels, commercial cargo and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
passenger (cruise) ships, ferries, barges, tankers, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
container ships, patrol and pilot boats, and dredges. It 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not include offshore oil and gas drilling platforms, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
although it is believed that identical coating systems would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be appropriate for them also. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule represents the EPA's first extensive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation of air pollutants from the shipbuilding and ship 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repair industry. Essentially all volatile organic hazardous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
air pollutants (VOHAP) are a subset of a category of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pollutants referred to as volatile organic compounds (VOC). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The VOC is a class of pollutants that are photochemically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactive precursors of ozone. Emissions of VOC (and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consequently VOHAP as well) from ``marine coating operations'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been regulated by some State and local district rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
California and Louisiana have defined VOC limits for a wide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
range of marine coating categories. The California limits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being generally more stringent than those of Louisiana. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other States have limited VOC emissions from the industry's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spray booths as one of many ``miscellaneous metal coating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations,'' using guidance presented in the EPA's control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
techniques guidelines (CTG) document ``Control of Volatile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Organic Emissions from Existing Stationary Sources, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Volume VI: Surface Coating of Miscellaneous Metal Parts and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Products'' (June 1978) EPA 450/2&hyph;78&hyph;015. Outdoor painting of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ships' hulls was specifically exempt from this guidance, but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some States have rules that limit shipyard painting done 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inside buildings and on the interior of ships based on the guidance.

Control Techniques Guidelines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 183(b)(4) of the Act, as amended in 1990 (1990 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendments), requires the Administrator to issue CTG's for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
VOC and particulate emissions from coatings (paints) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solvents used in shipbuilding and ship repair facilities, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such level as the Administrator determines may be achieved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through the adoption of BACM. Volatile organic compounds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
react in the atmosphere to form ozone, a criteria air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pollutant for which primary and secondary ambient air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality standards have been established. The EPA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to take into account the applicable requirements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 112 in developing the guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The organic HAP emissions described in the remainder of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this document are, with only one exception, a subset of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
VOC emissions from coatings and solvents used in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shipbuilding and ship repair facilities. Thus the control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
techniques evaluated for the MACT standard are also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable to VOC emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA has traditionally issued draft CTG's containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended control levels for public comment. Rather than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issue a separate draft CTG in this case, the EPA is using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this document to request public comment on a draft 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended by BACM. The recommended BACM is identical to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed MACT for coatings and solvents, stated in terms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of VOC units rather than VOHAP units (where a VOHAP means 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any compound of carbon, excluding metallic carbides and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carbonates, that is listed in or pursuant to section 112(b) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Act; this includes both VOC and exempt compounds that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are listed as HAP). For those options using VOC as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surrogate for VOHAP for the MACT standard, compliance would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be based on the Agency's reference Method 24. For any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance option involving measurement of actual VOHAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
content, the test method used by the source must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documented and approved by the Administrator. Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received on the proposed MACT rule will also be considered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in formulating a final recommended BACM and vice-versa. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Meanwhile, States are in the process of developing VOC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rules for these sources to meet other Act requirements. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA published an alternative control techniques (ACT) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
document in February 1994 to provide guidance to the States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for these efforts. The recommended BACM described here is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with information in the ACT. Also, as explained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the ACT, although control technologies for particulate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions at shipyards are in development, none are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficiently demonstrated at this time to recommend as BACM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Agency has no recommendation for BACM for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particulate emissions at this time.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 -->
1. Description of the Source Category 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The proposed rule would apply to each shipbuilding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility whose total activities emit or have the potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to emit, considering controls, 9.1 megagrams per year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Mg/yr) (10 tons per year [tons/yr]) or more of any HAP or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
22.7 Mg/yr (25 tons/yr) or more of any combination of HAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, the shipbuilding industry covered by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule is represented by SIC Code 3731, ``Shipbuilding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Repairing.'' This industry consists of establishments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that build, repair, repaint, convert, and alter ships. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, SIC Code 3731 includes the manufacture of both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offshore oil and gas well drilling and production platforms; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
marine coatings used on such platforms will not be subject 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to this rule, but rather to limitations imposed by the EPA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal rule on Architectural and Industrial Maintenance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Coatings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on information obtained through the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U. S. Maritime Directory Listings (June 1992), there are an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimated 437 facilities of varying capabilities involved in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the construction and repair of ships in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the 437 facilities, an estimated 25 qualify as major 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources of HAP emissions and would be subject to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule. The total VOHAP emissions from surface 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coating operations at the 25 facilities that would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to the proposed rule are estimated at 1,155 Mg/yr 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1,272 tons/yr).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The EPA requests comment on the appropriate timing of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the shipbuilding and ship repair facility's applicability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination, and on whether all facilities, regardless of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their past emissions or HAP usage, should be eligible to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualify as area sources under the HAP usage limits. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency also seeks comment on whether a facility that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initially determined to be subject to the rule should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
able subsequently to escape applicability, and if so, under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
what circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 -->
2. Affected Sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
For purposes of this rulemaking, the affected source 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be considered the aggregate of all operations at a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shipbuilding facility. A new operation at a shipbuilding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility would not be considered a new source. Instead, it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may qualify as a modification of the existing source. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The proposed standards would limit VOHAP emissions from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indoor and outdoor coating operations. The VOHAP emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result largely from solvent evaporation from the coatings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These emissions occur during application and drying/curing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due to the size of ships and their components, most coatings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are applied outdoors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The proposed standards would also reduce VOHAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions from handling, transfer, use, and storage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
VOHAP-containing materials through work practice measures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These emissions also occur as a result of solvent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaporation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->
B. Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The proposed standards would be the same for new and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing facilities. (See section VII.B. for discussion on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the basis for the standards.) The proposed standards would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impose limits on the VOHAP content of 23 types of coatings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used at shipbuilding facilities. (See section VII.C. for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
list of the proposed limits.) The limits would be stated in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terms of mass of VOHAP per volume of coating less water and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less negligibly photochemically reactive (exempt) compounds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compliance with the VOHAP limits must be demonstrated on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monthly basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The proposed standards would allow for an alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
means of compliance other than using compliant coatings, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approved by the Administrator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The proposed standards would also require that all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handling and transfer of VOHAP containing materials to and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from containers, tanks, vats, vessels, and piping systems be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducted in a manner that minimizes spills and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors leading to emissions. In addition, containers of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thinning solvent or waste that hold any VOHAP must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
normally closed (to minimize evaporation) unless materials 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are being added to or removed from them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->
C. Compliance Dates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The proposed rule would require compliance for existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected sources within 1 year after the effective date of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the rule. An existing unaffected area source that increases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its HAP emissions (or potential to emit) such that it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
becomes a major source would be required to comply within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1 year after becoming a major source. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Any new or reconstructed sources would be required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adhere to the compliance schedule in the General Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;63.6(b) of subpart A without any modification. For new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or reconstructed affected sources whose startup date is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before the effective date of the rule, the compliance date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is the effective date of the rule. For new or reconstructed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected sources whose startup date is after the effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date of the rule, the compliance date is the startup date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new unaffected area source that increases its emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(or potential to emit) such that it becomes a major source 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be required to comply immediately upon becoming a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
major source. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->
D. Compliance Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The proposed rule would allow affected sources to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
choose among five options for demonstrating compliance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the VOHAP standards. Their choice will be influenced by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
perceived need to add ``thinning'' solvent (thinner) to alter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the viscosity of the coating in order to spray effectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(For the purposes of this proposed regulation, thinner is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defined as any liquid material added to a coating.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regardless of the option(s) chosen, affected sources would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first be required to determine the coating category 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e.g., general use, air flask, antenna, etc.), the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable VOHAP limit, and the VOC content for each batch 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of coating received from the manufacturer.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
A source may demonstrate compliance either by showing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the VOC content is less than the VOHAP limit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(options 1&hyph;4) or by the use of option 5 (discussed below) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which would measure the actual VOHAP content. If the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shipyard is subject to regulatory limits on the VOC content 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of its coatings, the primary compliance method for this rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be to certify the VOC content of each container of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coating, as applied. (That information would then be used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to determine compliance with the applicable VOHAP limit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using any of the options 1&hyph;4.) Certification of VOC content 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is done by: (1) using Method 24 of 40 CFR part 60, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appendix A; (2) using forms similar to those included in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification procedure published in EPA&hyph;450/3&hyph;84&hyph;019 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(revised 6/86), ``Procedures for Certifying Quantity of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Coatings''; or (3) an alternative method approved by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator. Option 5 may be used for demonstrating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance when a shipyard is not subject to VOC limits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Affected sources would be allowed to use the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methods to demonstrate compliance to avoid testing every 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
container of coating; however, any analysis of an individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
container of coating using the Agency's Method 24 would take 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
precedence to determine or to verify a violation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraphs (i) through (iii) are summaries of options 1, 2, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 3. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (i) Shipyards can demonstrate compliance of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as-supplied VOC content as certified by the manufacturer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the as-supplied coating is used without adding thinning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solvent, shipyards can certify that the as-applied VOC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
content of the batch of coating is identical to the as-supplied VOC content, if it were certified by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer. If the certified VOC content is less than the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
VOHAP limit, compliance is demonstrated. (``As applied'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
means after any thinning by the user or just prior to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application to the substrate. ``As supplied'' means as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplied by the coating manufacturer.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (ii) Shipyards can demonstrate compliance if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actual volume of thinner used is less than the maximum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowable volume of thinner on a coating-by-coating basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (iii) Shipyards can demonstrate compliance by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comparing the actual volume of thinner used to the maximum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowable volume on a ``group'' basis. A group of coatings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be defined as those which use the same thinner. (See 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section VII.E. for more explanation.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Compliance with options 1 through 4 is based on the VOC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
content of each container of coating, as applied. If the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as-applied VOC content is less than or equal to the VOHAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limit, then compliance would be demonstrated (See 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part III.E. for how ``exempt'' compounds which are HAP are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered in compliance determinations and other details). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Shipyards can also demonstrate compliance by measuring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the actual VOHAP content of a coating. If the as-applied 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
VOHAP content is less than or equal to the alternate VOHAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limit, then compliance would be demonstrated. (See II.E., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Option 5, for how alternate VOHAP limits are determined). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Concurrently with this rule, the Agency is preparing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for sample preparation and the performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifications required of an acceptable analytical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedure.)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
An affected source may choose to use only one of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
options for all coatings at the facility or a combination of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
options. Each option is discussed in more detail below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->
E. Test Methods and Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The proposed rule would require Method 24 be used as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the reference method to determine compliance if the VOC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
content is used as a surrogate for VOHAP. Manufacturers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whose coatings do not release reaction by-products may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request an alternative or equivalent method to be approved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the Administrator. If it is demonstrated to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfaction of the Administrator that a specific coating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not release VOC by-products from the cure reaction (all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
VOC emissions are evaporated solvent), then she may approve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of batch solvent formulation data to certify the as-supplied VOC content of that paint. In the event of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inconsistency between the VOC content as measured by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Method 24 and formulation data, however, the Method 24 test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall govern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 A few coatings may contain HAP which are (or through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsequent formal action may become) excluded from EPA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of VOC because these HAP have negligible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
photochemical reactivity and do not contribute to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tropospheric ozone formation. These non-VOC HAP are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonetheless of regulatory concern as toxic chemicals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, for the purposes of this rule the mass of VOHAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined by Method 24 would be the mass of VOC plus exempt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compounds; hence, unlike for a VOC determination, the total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mass loss of these organic volatiles must be used in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsequent calculations. However, the volume of exempt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compounds should be subtracted (from the total coating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
volume) just as water, as indicated by the units for VOHAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presented in Method 24. Manufacturers and affected sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be required to certify the VOHAP of paints using a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
form similar to that published in the EPA's ``Procedures for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certifying Quantity of Volatile Organic Compounds Emitted by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paint, Ink, and Other Coatings'' (Revised June 1986) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA&hyph;450/3&hyph;84&hyph;019 [Docket A&hyph;92&hyph;11, II&hyph;B&hyph;27]. If the shipyard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chooses to demonstrate compliance using the VOHAP content of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the coating(s), the manufacturer or affected source would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
need to provide details on how the VOHAP values were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 114(a)(3) of the amended CAA requires enhanced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring and compliance certifications of all major 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stationary sources. The annual compliance certifications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certify whether compliance has been continuous or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intermittent. Enhanced monitoring shall be capable of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detecting deviations from each applicable emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limitation or standard with sufficient representativeness, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accuracy, precision, reliability, frequency and timeliness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to determine if compliance is continuous during a reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period. The monitoring in this regulation satisfies the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of enhanced monitoring.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The test methods and procedures described in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previous section will be used to determine compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Failure to meet the emission limits as measured by these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures would be an enforceable violation of the emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limits of the standard. When add-on controls are used, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring shall be capable of detecting deviations from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each applicable emission limitation or other standard with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient reliability and timeliness to determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuous compliance over the applicable reporting period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Although the term ``continuous'' generally means at all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
times, the Agency has determined that less frequent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurements or determinations of compliance can ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuous compliance. The potential variability of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions or parameters is a primary factor in establishing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the frequency of measurements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->
G. Notification Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The proposed rule would require affected sources to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
follow the notification requirements in &sect;&sect;63.9(a)-(d) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h)-(j) of subpart A of the general provisions. In addition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the initial notification requirements in &sect;&sect;63.9(b)(2) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and (3) of subpart A, sources would be required to include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the initial notification: (1) the compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedure(s) that they intend to use; (2) procedures for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensuring compliance with the handling, transfer, and storage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard; and (3) procedures for maintaining records. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are subject to the approval of the Administrator. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, they would be required to submit a notification of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance status on a quarterly basis, with any exceedances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reported on a quarterly basis. Following the first year, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the owner or operator of a source that has had no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceedances for a full year (can be any year after the first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year), may request Administrator approval to reduce the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequency of notification to semiannual. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->
H. Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The proposed rule would require affected sources to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
follow the general recordkeeping and reporting requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in &sect;&sect;63.10(a)-(b) and (f) of subpart A of the general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions. Sections 63.10(c)-(e) of subpart A do not apply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unless a source uses a control device to comply with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards except for the excess emission report required by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;63.10(e)(3) which applies regardless of how emissions are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controlled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 In addition, each owner or operator of an affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
source would be required to certify annually that all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personnel involved with coatings, thinning of coatings, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
keeping coating records, or handling/transferring VOHAP-containing materials have received the training required
by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the regulation. A record of the certification is required, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but no report is required. The purpose of the certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is to ensure that the training does occur at least once per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year, and that documentation does exit for an enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
official to review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Affected sources would be required to keep all records 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needed to demonstrate compliance with the standards, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including calculations and records of any Method 24 or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternate VOHAP tests. All records would be compiled each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calendar month and compliance status determined every month. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, a source is required to report on a quarterly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis any exceedances to the EPA and to provide in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excess emissions report the data needed to confirm and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quantify the reported exceedance. All records must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintained for a minimum of 5 years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The quarterly report should include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 1. A summary of the number and duration of deviations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the reporting period classified by reason, including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
known causes for which a Federally-approved or promulgated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exemption from an emission limitation or standard may apply; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 2. Identification of the data availability achieved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the reporting period, including a summary of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number and total duration of incidents during which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring protocol failed to operate in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design or produced data that did not meet minimum data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accuracy and precision requirements (classified by reason); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 3. Identification of the compliance status as of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
last day of the reporting period and whether compliance was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuous or intermittent during the reporting period; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 4. If, pursuant to (2) of this section, the owner or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator identifies any deviation as resulting from a known 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cause for which no Federally-approved or promulgated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exemption from an emission limitation or standard applies, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the monitoring report shall also include all records that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the source is required to maintain that pertain to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
periods during which such deviation occurred and: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 a. The magnitude of each deviation; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 b. The reason for each deviation; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 c. A description of the corrective action taken for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each deviation, including action taken to both minimize it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and prevent recurrence; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 d. All quality assurance activities performed on any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
element of the monitoring protocol. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

IV. Summary of Estimated Environmental, Energy, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Economic Impacts of the Proposed Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The nationwide impacts presented below are the impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed standards would have on existing facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of downsizing of military forces, no new major 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources are expected to be built in the next five years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, impacts on new sources are expected to be zero. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->
A. Number and Type of Affected Facilities

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Approximately 437 facilities (shipyards) are involved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the construction and repair of ships nationwide. Based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on industry information and data reported in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S. Department of Commerce's ``U.S. Industrial Outlook 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
'92_Shipbuilding and Repair'' (January 1992) and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S. Maritime Directory Listings (June 1992). It is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimated that only 25 qualify as major sources of HAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions and would be affected by the proposed rule.

B. Air Emission Reductions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The nationwide baseline VOHAP emissions for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately 25 major shipbuilding facilities from surface 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coating operations are estimated to be 1,155 Mg/yr 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1,272 tons/yr). Implementation of the proposed standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would reduce these emissions by approximately 24 percent to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
883 Mg/yr (972 tons/yr). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->
C. Secondary Environmental Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
No environmental impacts to water, solid waste, noise, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or secondary air impacts are associated with implementation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the proposed standards, as explained below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 -->
1. Water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
There are no negative water pollution impacts resulting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from transition to compliant coatings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 -->
2. Solid Waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
There are no negative solid waste impacts associated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the proposed standards. No additional or new types of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solid or hazardous waste will be generated. Because the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliant (higher solid) coatings are more concentrated, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fewer containers will require disposal when the same volume 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of solids is applied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 -->
3. Noise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
There is no additional noise associated with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed standards. Pumps and compressors, the source of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the majority of the noise in paint operations, is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected to change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 -->
4. Secondary Air Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
There are no significant secondary air pollution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impacts. Use of compliant coatings avoids use of any type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of control device or equipment that would consume large 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amounts of energy. Furthermore, any reduction in VOC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

D. Energy Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paint heaters are now used in some shipyards. Some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources may use paint heaters in lieu of solvent to reduce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paint viscosity. Although some secondary air impacts would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result from the power requirements of the electrical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heaters, the amount of electricity that they draw is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insignificant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Cost Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The incremental nationwide annual costs associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed standards (MACT cost minus baseline cost) is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately $1.7 million per year. The use of compliant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coatings will not require different equipment. Because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lower-VOC (and presumably lower-VOHAP) coatings are more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentrated, less coating volume is required to cover the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same surface area to the same dry film thickness. Some of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these compliant coatings, however, may be more expensive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both on a dollar-per-gallon basis, but also in cost-per- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
volume solids (nonvolatiles). Therefore, the annual costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with the proposed standards reflect the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difference between the costs of higher-priced coatings and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the savings associated with the decreased volume of coatings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(because of the higher solids content) and labor to apply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Minor costs would be incurred by any source that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purchases paint heaters or other minor equipment necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to comply with the handling, transfer, and storage standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These costs are expected to be insignificant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
F. Economic Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Economic impacts were calculated on a facility-specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis as well as on a market segment basis (i.e., military 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
construction, commercial repair, etc.). Economic impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicators examined included price, output, and employment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impacts. The economic impact analysis calculated economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impacts for six market segments within the shipbuilding and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repair industry. Two methods were used to calculate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential price impacts; therefore, these impacts will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided in terms of ranges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Twenty major-source yards were identified as first-tier 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shipyards (facilities that have the capability to construct, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drydock, and/or topside repair vessels with a minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overall length of 400 feet). Two market segments in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first tier, facilities engaging in construction of military 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ships and privately owned facilities engaging in repair of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
military ships, are each estimated to increase their prices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
0.1 percent or less to recover increased costs of the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The cost for the third market segment, government-owned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shipyards engaging in repairing military ships, will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negligible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The remaining five major-source shipyards are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categorized into the ``second tier'' (facilities building and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repairing ships less than 400 feet in length). Within this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tier, the market segment consisting of facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constructing ships for the military is estimated to require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a price increase between 0.1 and 0.2 percent. The market 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
segment consisting of facilities engaging in construction of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ships for the commercial sector is estimated to require a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
price increase of 0.3 percent or less. Lastly, the market 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
segment consisting of facilities performing repair on ships 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the commercial sector is expected to require little or no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
price increase. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The facility-specific impact calculations estimate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximum price increase necessary for a regulated facility to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fully recoup its annualized control costs. For the purposes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the analysis, a facility's price increase was considered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant if greater than 1 percent and deviated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considerably from its corresponding market segment price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The facility-specific price increase calculations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicated that 23 of the 25 major-source shipyards are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected to experience price increases of 0.1 percent or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less. Of the two remaining, one is expected to experience a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
0.2 percent price increase and the other, 0.3 percent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The above data indicate that none of the regulated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities are expected to experience price increases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greater than 1 percent. In addition, a comparison of each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility's price increase to its corresponding market 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
segment price increase reveals that the results of each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis are not significantly different. Therefore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation of the NESHAP is not expected to have a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant impact on the 25 major-source facilities in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shipbuilding and repair industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The economic analysis also examined the impact of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NESHAP on industry output and employment. The industry is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected to experience a negligible reduction in output as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result of implementing the regulation. Assuming a one-to-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one relationship between output and employment, the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conclusion can be applied to the NESHAP impact on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry's employment level.

V. National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pollutants (NESHAP) Decision Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Source of Authority for NESHAP Development 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 112 of the Act gives the EPA the authority to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establish national standards to reduce HAP emissions from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources that emit one or more HAP. Section 112(b) contains 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a list of the specific HAP to be regulated by NESHAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 112(c) directs the EPA to use this pollutant list to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
develop and publish a list of source categories for which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NESHAP will be developed. The Act defines major sources as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those that emit or have the potential to emit considering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controls, in the aggregate, 9.1 Mg/yr (10 tons/yr) or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greater of individual HAP or 22.7 Mg/yr (25 tons/yr) or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greater of any combination of HAP. The initial list of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
source categories was published on July 16, 1992 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(57 FR 31576). Shipyards (major sources only) appear on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Area sources are those sources that are not major 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources. Area source categories selected by the EPA for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NESHAP development will be based on the Administrator's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
judgment that the sources in a category, individually or in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the aggregate, pose a ``threat of adverse effects to health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the environment.'' The EPA will continue to evaluate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether area source shipyards should be added to the list of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area source categories. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Criteria for Development of NESHAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NESHAP are to be developed to control HAP emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from both new and existing sources according section 112(d) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Act. The standards are to reflect the maximum degree 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of reduction that is achievable for new or existing sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NESHAP must reflect consideration of the cost of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieving the emission reduction, nonair quality health and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental impacts, and energy requirements for control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels more stringent than the MACT floor (described below). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act specifies that emission reduction may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplished through application of measures, processes, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methods, systems or techniques, including, but not limited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to, measures which:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Reduce the volume of, or eliminate emissions of, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such pollutants through process changes, substitution of

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 3. Collect, capture, or treat such pollutants when

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 4. Are design, equipment, work practice, or

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 5. Any combination of the above [section 112(d)(2)]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 To develop NESHAP, the EPA collects information about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the industry, including information on emission source 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characteristics, control technologies, data from HAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission tests at well-controlled facilities, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information on the cost, energy, and other environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impacts of emission control techniques. The EPA uses this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information to analyze possible regulatory approaches. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Although NESHAP are normally structured in terms of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
numerical emission limits, alternative approaches are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sometimes necessary. In some cases, physically measuring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions from a source may be impossible or at least 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impracticable due to technological and economic limitations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 112(h) authorizes the Administrator to promulgate a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design, equipment, work practice, or operational standard or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combination thereof, in those cases where it is not feasible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to prescribe or enforce an emissions standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 If any sources in the source category are considered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
major (based on their emissions), then a MACT standard is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required. To establish a MACT standard, the level of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control corresponding to the MACT floor needs to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined as a starting point for developing the regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternatives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

C. Categorization/Subcategorization: Determining MACT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Floors'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 112 of the Act provides certain very specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directives to guide the EPA in the process for establishing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MACT standards. It states that the EPA shall establish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards that require ``the maximum degree of reduction in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions of the hazardous air pollutants *
<!-- PJG 0060 hspace -->
&blank;9*
<!-- PJG 0060 hspace -->
&blank;9* that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator, taking into consideration the cost of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieving such emission reduction, and any nonair quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health and environmental impacts and energy requirements, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determines is achievable *
<!-- PJG 0060 hspace -->
&blank;9*
<!-- PJG 0060 hspace -->
&blank;9*'' [section 112(d)(2)]. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, a minimum baseline or ``floor'' for a standard is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified. For new sources, the standard for a source 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
category or subcategory ``shall not be less stringent than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the emission control that is achieved in practice by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
best controlled similar source, as determined by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator'' [section 112(d)(3)]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Further, standards for existing sources shall be no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less stringent than: (1) the average emission limitation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieved by the best performing 12 percent of the existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources in the category or subcategory for categories and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subcategories with 30 or more sources; or (2) the best 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performing five sources for categories or subcategories with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fewer than 30 sources [section 112(d)(3)]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Once the floor has been determined for new or existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources for a category or subcategory, the Administrator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must set MACT standards no less stringent. Such standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must then be met by all sources within the category or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subcategory. However, in establishing standards, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator may distinguish among classes, types, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sizes of sources within a category or subcategory and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establish a different emission standard for each class, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided all standards are at least as stringent as the MACT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
floor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The EPA has determined that there are less than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30 major shipbuilding sources. Consequently, the MACT floor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for existing categories or subcategories was calculated to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be the arithmetic average (the mean) of the emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limitation achieved by the best performing five sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

D. Regulatory Approach and Regulatory Alternatives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The next step in establishing standards is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigation of regulatory alternatives. With MACT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards, only alternatives at least as stringent as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
floor may be considered. Information about the industry is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyzed to develop model plant populations for projecting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
national impacts, including HAP emission reduction levels, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs, energy, and secondary impacts. Several regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative levels (which may be different levels of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions control or different levels of applicability or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both) are then evaluated to determine the most appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory alternative to serve as the basis for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The regulatory alternatives for new versus existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources may be different, and separate regulatory decisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be made for new and existing sources. For both source 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
types, the selected alternative may be more stringent than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the MACT floor. However, the control level selected as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
name maximum achievable control technology indicates, must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be available, i.e., technically achievable. In selecting a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory alternative, the Agency considers the achievable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction in emissions of HAP (and possibly other pollutants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are co-controlled), the cost and economic impacts, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
energy requirements, and other environmental impacts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The selected regulatory alternative is then translated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into a proposed regulation. The regulation implementing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision typically includes the following sections: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicability, standards, test methods, compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstration, monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The preamble to the proposed regulation provides an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
explanation of the rationale for the decisions embodied in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the rule. The public is invited to comment on the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation. Based on an evaluation of these comments, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA promulgates the final standard.

 at the beginning of this Preamble). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Over 99 percent of HAP emissions at shipyards are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Marine coatings are applied to the surface of ship 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
components to form a protective, functional or decorative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
films. The basic components of a coating are the vehicle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(resin or binder), solvent, pigment (except in clear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coatings), and a variety of additives. Different coatings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are used for different purposes; depending on where it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applied, the intended use of the ship, ship activity, travel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
routes, desired time between coatings (service life), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aesthetic desires of the ship owner or commanding officer, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and fuel costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Marine coatings are vital for protecting the ship from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrosive and biotic attacks from the water environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many marine coatings serve specific functions, such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrosion protection, heat/fire resistance, or antifouling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(to prevent the settlement and growth of marine organisms on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the ship's underwater hull). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The most popular techniques for applying coatings to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
marine vessels are brushing, rolling, air-atomizing, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airless spraying. Brushing and rolling are primarily used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for touchup and recessed surfaces where spraying is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practical. Spraying is used for all other surfaces because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of its high application speed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Thinning solvent is sometimes added to coatings before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application even though paint manufacturers state that it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unnecessary. Temperature, reportedly can play a big part in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the decision to thin; cold increases paint viscosity. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such cases, the appropriate solvent to use for each coating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is specified by the manufacturer. Typically these paints 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and thinning solvents contain one or more of the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HAP: xylene, toluene, and/or methyl ethyl ketone.

Emissions of VOHAP result primarily from solvent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaporation_both solvent in the paint ``as supplied'' by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer and any solvent used by the shipyard to thin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the paint. Reaction by-products released during the cure of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some coatings may also contain HAP. Essentially, all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organic solvents, including those which are HAP, are emitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either as the paint is applied or when it dries/cures. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shipyard may limit emissions of HAP from, ``as supplied'' or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``as applied,'' coatings as discussed below.

1. Paints As-Supplied by the Manufacturer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the Agency began its program to reduce emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of volatile organics in the late 1970's, the coating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry has made significant progress in research of new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products with increased solids: organic solvent ratios. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These liquid paints are of two primary types: waterborne 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and higher solids. Although many new waterborne products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been developed, manufacturers of marine coatings have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduced solvent primarily by increasing the solids 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(nonvolatile) content of their products. Use of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentrated or ``higher solids'' coatings reduce solvent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions per surface area painted (at same film thickness). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because most hazardous air pollutants are also volatile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organics, the VOC program has tended to also reduce HAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 In addition, some coating manufacturers have reportedly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been able to reduce the HAP content of certain paints by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
merely substituting a solvent not on the HAP list yielding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paints that contain little or no HAP solvents. A coating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reformulated in this manner may have the same or even higher 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
VOC content than the one it replaces. In some cases, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HAP to VOC ratio may even increase when a company develops a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new reformulation with lower VOC. (Note, the absolute HAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions are likely to go down.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

2. Paints As-Applied by the Shipyard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are several alternatives a shipyard may follow to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimize HAP emissions from as-applied paints. One is to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
avoid diluting the paint and apply it as-supplied. Another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is to only use thinners that contain little or no HAP. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third is to reduce paint viscosity by heating the paint to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
avoid or minimize the need for thinning. (Paint heaters are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heating elements placed in the paint delivery line upstream 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the spray gun. Depending on the length of the delivery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
line, the coating characteristics, and ambient temperature, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
multiple paint heaters may be required at intervals along 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the line. These decrease the ease of portability and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flexibility of the application system.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 ``Add-on'' pollution control systems are often used to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control emissions from spray booths when coatings are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applied in factory operations. Such systems are not now a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practical alternative for many shipyard operations because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the size of ship components is too large to enable capturing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the emissions with an enclosure. (There is currently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under development a mobile enclosure that, if successful, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will offer shipyards a method of capturing both particulate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and volatile organics. Metro Machine shipyard in Norfolk, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Virginia has developed a prototype portable enclosure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mounts adjacent to the ship and supports an omni-directional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elevator platform used by the operator to abrasive blast and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paint ship's hulls. The method shows promise of containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particulate and volatile organics of concentrations great 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enough to make recovery available at reasonable cost. It 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also provides weather protection thereby allowing work to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continued in inclement weather. Final evaluation will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
likely be completed in 1996.)

HAP Containing Materials 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Volatile organic emissions (including HAP) result from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage, handling, and transfer of solvents and paint wastes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that contain VOHAP. These solvents, typically stored in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
55-gallon drums, are frequently transferred by pump or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spigot into small buckets or 1 gallon containers for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transport to the painting site. Waste solvent and HAP also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaporate from solvent-laden rags and spent solvent used in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cleaning activities and coating operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 These HAP emissions may be minimized with appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
work practices including managed chemical (paint and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solvent) distribution systems designed to curb the volume of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
material exposed to the atmosphere and the length of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure. For example, solvent-soaked cleaning rags should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be kept in impervious bags or containers that are normally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
closed when not in use.

The proposed standards would limit VOHAP emissions from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surface coating operations at shipbuilding facilities that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are major sources in accordance with the EPA's list of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
source categories published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
July 16, 1992 (57 FR 31576). Standards are being proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to limit the VOHAP content of 23 categories of coatings used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in shipyards. In addition, the proposed standards would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require work practice measures for handling, transfer, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage of solvent and paint wastes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Welding, gas freeing (tank degassing), metal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fabrication, fuel combustion, flame cutting, cooling towers, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asbestos removal, and cleaning would not be regulated under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed rule, although their emissions must be included 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in determining if a facility qualifies as a major source. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Asbestos removal is covered in 40 CFR part 61, subpart M; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooling towers are treated in the industrial process cooling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The general methodology for selecting the basis for

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No emission control measures are known to have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously been implemented specifically to reduce HAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions from this industry. Regulations that reduce VOC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions will limit HAP emissions since almost all organic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HAP are VOC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 At shipyards, the only VOC control measure that has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been fully demonstrated for outdoor coating operations is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the use of coatings with inherently lower emissions. Such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coatings have and are being developed by an enlightened 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry to reduce its environmental impact. The new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products are used for compliance with VOC regulations in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Louisiana and some California jurisdictions. There are as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
yet no known cases where add-on pollution control systems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been used to control VOC emissions from outdoor coating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations at shipyards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The California and Louisiana regulations limit the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowable quantity of VOC in each of several categories of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coatings, as applied. Because VOHAP are VOC (with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exception noted above), such regulations also reduce, or at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a minimum, put a ceiling on the allowable HAP content of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these coatings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The California regulations (VOC limits) are more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stringent than those in Louisiana. Thus, the major sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to those California rules represent the ``best 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controlled sources.'' Because three major source facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are located in California, the single best controlled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility and the median facility of the best performing five 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources are both subject to the stringent California 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. Therefore, the Agency has determined that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MACT floor for both new and existing sources is identical to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the current California VOC limits on marine coatings, except 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for one additional paint category [weld-through (shop) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
primer].

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A variety of more stringent alternatives were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered, including more restrictive limits based on HAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
content (rather than VOC content), more stringent VOC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limits, and requiring use of pollution control equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These alternatives are discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 To evaluate other potential limits, the EPA gathered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing data on HAP content from marine coating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers and shipyards. Information compiled from a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
material safety data sheet (MSDS) was used to determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(estimate) the HAP content of each paint. Most of the data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
came from MSDSs and product data sheets. Based on these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data, the percentage of VOC in marine coatings that are HAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
varies from zero to 100 percent and averaged 30 percent by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weight for all paints in the project data base. (The HAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
content could exceed the VOC content in coatings containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-VOC HAP.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Industry subsequently informed EPA that the quality of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HAP-specific data on MSDSs is poor. The MSDSs are prepared 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
primarily to meet Occupational Health and Safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administration (OSHA) requirements. Although one section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addresses hazardous constituents, the industry indicated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that information and format required for OSHA purposes are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not as detailed or accurate as would be desired for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development of a regulation. Further, the list of hazardous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials that OSHA regulations require must be addressed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MSDSs is different from the HAP list in section 112(b) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Act. In addition, it is acceptable to give a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration range on the MSDS, rather than a specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
value. Finally, many entries on the MSDS are generic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petroleum solvents, such as mineral spirits, which are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mixtures of many organics (some of which may be HAP) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vary in composition from lot to lot. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Because of these drawbacks in MSDS data, the EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered it not accurate enough to be used in setting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limits for VOHAP. The Agency believes, however, that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resulting data base is sufficiently accurate for use in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimating broad parameters, such as the potential reduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with limitations on VOC content. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Enforcement of a limit on HAP content would require an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA reference test method. Although one is under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development by the Agency, it has not yet been published. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the quality of the HAP content data on the MSDSs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the lack of an approved test method for speciating and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quantifying HAP, the EPA has determined that VOC will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used as a surrogate to limit HAP emissions. Consequently, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed rule would establish the VOHAP limit at the VOC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limit of the California rules using VOC as a surrogate for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HAP and the Agency's VOC test method, Method 24, for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The EPA considered requiring limits more stringent than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the existing California limits. The data base indicates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that within each category of coatings there are coatings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with VOC contents below the California limit. (Some may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been developed in response to the technology-forcing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions of the California regulations that provide for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more stringent limits to come into effect in September 1994 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for some coating categories.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Although coatings with lower VOC contents than the rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires are marketed in each category, they reportedly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not perform for the full range of potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications within a coating category. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 An important consideration in examining control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for this industry is U.S. Navy military 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifications or ``milspecs.'' Because of the need for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coatings for specialized applications and the demand for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
predictable performance, the Navy oversees exhaustive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance testing procedures. Naval personnel indicate an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ongoing program to qualify lower VOC coatings. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
California rules were developed with considerable input from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Navy, and according to a Naval representative, reflect

the ``state of the art'' for lower-VOC shipbuilding coatings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Volatile organic compound limits more stringent than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed would require that the Navy use paints for which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they have not yet completed long term testing, hence are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
milspec approved. Given these considerations, the EPA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing MACT emission levels based on the 1992 California 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations that limit the total VOC as-applied paint.

The EPA also evaluated the potential of add-on VOC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control devices (i.e., carbon adsorbers and incinerators). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although no cases are known where add-on controls are used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for outdoor painting at shipyards, they have been used to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduce spraybooth emissions by many other industries. Most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coating operations at shipyards take place outdoors, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
primarily because of the size of parts painted. This makes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capture of emissions difficult and expensive. Use of add-on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controls for outdoor painting was not selected as the basis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for MACT for these reasons. It should be noted, however, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a portable enclosure that will contain particulate and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
VOC during abrasive blasting and coating of ships' hulls is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under commercial development. Should these enclosures prove 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technically and economically feasible, their performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be considered by any State or the Federal Government 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in developing future rules for this industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Two types of coating operations at shipyards where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions are more available to capture were examined more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
closely for the feasibility of add-on controls: indoor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coating operations and painting inside of ship's tanks or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other internal enclosed spaces. Based on a brief screening 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyses, using the limited available data that assumes all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spray areas are continually drafted to the control device 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(whether painting operations are underway in all areas or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not), add-on control was estimated to be on the order of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$150,000/Mg of VOHAP removed. The EPA believes that this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost is not reasonable for this source category. As a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result, add-on controls were not investigated further nor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selected as the basis for MACT. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 In reality, the amount of VOC and HAP controlled at a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
site is dependent on the rate of paint application, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration of these compounds in the exhaust air stream 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the painting operation, the flow rate of the air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stream flowing into the add-on control unit and a host of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other factors. The suitability of add-on controls can only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be determined on a case-by-case basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 After review of alternatives more stringent than the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MACT floor, the EPA is proposing to set the MACT standard at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the floor based on the California marine coatings rule which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is for both new and existing sources. The costs of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control option for new and existing sources is expected to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be the same. The Agency solicits comments on this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 ``Models'' of shipyards were developed to help determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the need to differentiate among classes of shipyards in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identifying the MACT.'' Models were developed for classes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
yards based on market segment (yards that construct ships 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
versus those that only repair) and size (large versus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
medium). The EPA concluded there is no basis for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
differentiating among classes of major source shipyards, but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifically solicits comments on whether this category 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be subcategorized; and if so, how.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on information received from industry, a variety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of ``work practice'' measures are used to reduce evaporative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
losses of VOC from transfer, handling, and storage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solvent and paint wastes. These include spill minimization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
techniques (use of spouts, funnels, or catch basins during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transfer of liquids from one container to another), the use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of normally closed containers or piping to transport 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liquids, and the use of close-fitting or tight covers on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containers for solvent, wet rags, and waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Many more than five facilities employ some type of work 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practice measures. Facilities in California are subject to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations to minimize evaporative emissions; other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities employ such measures to decrease solvent usage or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to minimize exposure of workers. However, data to quantify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accurately the emission reductions achievable by different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
work practice measures is unavailable. The beneficial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect of a specific change is largely a function of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previous plant practice being remedied. As a result, even 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
though such activities obviously reduce emissions, there is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no way to distinguish between the ``best controlled source'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the ``best performing five existing sources.'' Therefore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the EPA has designated the same select work practice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measures as the MACT floor for control of emissions from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handling and transfer of VOHAP containing material at both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new and existing facilities. For emissions from storage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containers, the MACT floor is use of tight-fitting covers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that must be normally closed; that is, in place except when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials are being added to or withdrawn. The Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that this is a reasonable approach. Because work 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practice measures typically entail negligible cost, any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission reduction that is achieved is believed to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
worthwhile. The EPA specifically solicits comments on this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No other more effective control options for these VOHAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions from cleaning activities were found. Use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lower-HAP or lower-vapor-pressure substitutes to minimize 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaporative losses may be feasible, although this option 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
depends on the availability of a suitable replacement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cleaning material. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Capture and control of fugitive emissions from the many 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transfer, handling, and storage of solvents (and operation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastes) although conceivable, is impractical, making it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difficult to invoke any quantifiable standard other than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
work practice requirements. Associated monitoring and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recordkeeping are included for determining compliance. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an attempt to ensure that employees understand and comply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the requirements, the proposed standards also require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each source to implement a training program for all involved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personnel.

Selection of the Format of the Proposed Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 -->
1. Coating Operations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Most HAP emissions from coating operations in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry occur outdoors where the technology for their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capture has not been demonstrated. As a result the only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available technology for reducing emissions is to require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of coatings with lower volatile content. Virtually all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the HAP and VOC contained in marine coatings are emitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the atmosphere during the course of application and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drying. Thus, an emission standard based on limiting both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HAP and VOC content of the coatings, as applied, is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate for these operations, particularly because any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional HAP and VOC that may be formed and emitted during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the curing process are detected and measured by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reference measurement methodology. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result, the types of coatings used by the industry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were identified and maximum, never-to-be-exceeded HAP limits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were selected for each of the several coating categories. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To allow additional flexibility, the ability to average 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limits across categories was also considered. Under an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
averaging approach, any coating regardless of volatile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organic content, can be used as long as the volume weighted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average as applied VOHAP content, i.e., as measured by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reference method, of all coatings does not exceed the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average calculated from their individual limits. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developing the limits, the Agency considered two types of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
averages: (1) Separate averages for coating within each of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the coating categories and (2) a single average for all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coatings used by a facility. The option of establishing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limits based on weighted averages of various coatings of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different pollution content was abandoned when the industry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicated that time and effort to plan, track, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrate compliance would be too burdensome. As a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result, the limits are based on never-to-be-exceeded VOHAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contents for 23 categories of coatings and permits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``averaging'' for purposes of compliance under certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions. The proposed coating categories and associated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HAP limits are presented in Table 1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 -->
2. Handling, Transfer, and Storage of VOHAP Containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Material 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The proposed work practice standards require that these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations be carried out in such a manner that minimizes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spills. For storage and transport, the proposed standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require use of containers that are normally closed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To provide a measure of enforceability to these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards, each source will be required to indicate how it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intends to comply with the standards as part of the initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notification that is required of all sources under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part 63 general provisions. After the Administrator or her 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designee negotiates and approves these compliance measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as part of the operating permit program, each source will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have a specific set of requirements for which compliance can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be determined by monitoring, observation and/or inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->
D. Selection of Compliance Dates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The proposed rule would require that existing sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comply within 1 year after the effective date of the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This provides time for shipyards and coating manufacturers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to deplete most existing inventories of contemporary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coatings. An existing unaffected area source that increases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its emissions (or potential to emit) such that it becomes a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
major source would be required to comply within 1 year after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
becoming a major source.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Any new or reconstructed sources would be required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adhere to the compliance schedule in &sect;63.6(b) of subpart A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the general provisions. For new or reconstructed sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whose startup date is before the effective date of the rule, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the compliance date would be the effective date of the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For new or reconstructed sources whose startup date is after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the effective date of the rule, the compliance date would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the startup date. A new unaffected area source that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increases its emissions (or potential to emit) such that it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
becomes a major source would be required to comply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediately upon becoming a major source. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many shipyards in California have been complying with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
VOC limits equal to those in the proposed BACM since 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
September 1991. Hence, coatings that meet the limits should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be readily available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Selection of Compliance Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would allow affected sources to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
choose from five options for demonstrating compliance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the VOHAP standards. Regardless of the option(s) chosen, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for each coating, affected sources would be required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first determine: (1) its coating category in Table 1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e.g., general use, air flask, antenna, etc.), (2) the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable VOHAP limit, and (3) the VOC (or VOHAP) content 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for each manufactured batch of coating. The VOC (or VOHAP) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
content of the batch would be determined through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification as explained in part III.D. (It is in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
best interest of affected sources to use manufacturers that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certify their coatings.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For options 1 through 4 involving VOC content 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determinations, the compliance method is the Agency's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Method 24. Affected sources would be allowed any of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methods described below to avoid testing every container. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ultimate referee method, however, is Method 24. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Option 5 involves VOHAP content determinations; the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance method has to be approved by the Administrator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and comply with EPA requirements for sample preparation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule does not specify compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures for the handling, transfer, and storage standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each affected source would be required to develop and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include specific compliance procedures for their facility in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the initial notification to the Administrator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An affected source would be allowed to select any of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the following methods for compliance and may choose to use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only one of the options for all coatings at the facility or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use a combination of options. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Option 1. Certification of Each Container or Coating, As-Applied 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Procedures for certifying the quantity of VOC emitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by paints, ink, and other coatings are combined in the EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
publication 450/3&hyph;84&hyph;019 (revised 6/86). Compliance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the VOHAP content limits would be achieved by sampling, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing, and certifying the VOC content of each container of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coating, as applied. If the as-applied VOC content is less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than or equal to the VOHAP limit in Table 1, the coating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Option 2. Coatings To Which Thinning Solvent Will Not Be Added 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If thinning solvents will not be added to the coating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under any circumstances, the affected source may demonstrate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with the VOHAP content limit by certifying the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as-applied VOC content by manufacturer's batch. The as- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applied certification may be based on a coating that has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been certified by the manufacturer as to the as-supplied 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
content and simply requires documentation that no thinning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solvent was added to the coating. No additional testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All painters would have to be notified that no thinning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solvent may be added to the coating before application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notification may be accomplished through a label 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affixed to each container in the batch or through another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
means of notification specified in the source's initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notification that is required in &sect;63.9(b) of subpart A of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the general provisions. Other means of notifying painters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may include use of a bar coding system or posting of a list 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of coatings that should not have thinning solvents added. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This option is the least burdensome to affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources, but it may only be used for coatings that will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be thinned. However, any Method 24 tests on individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containers of coating, as applied, that show noncompliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the standards would take precedence and indicate a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violation.

Option 3. Coatings to Which Thinning Solvent Is Added_Coating-by-Coating Compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If thinning solvents are added to the coating, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected source could determine the allowed level of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dilution for purpose of demonstrating compliance on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coating-by-coating basis. The source would determine the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as-supplied VOC content of each type of thinning solvent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Then, using the as-supplied certification for the coating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the maximum allowable limit from Table 1, the source 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would calculate the maximum allowable thinning ratio that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not violate the VOHAP content limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The persons responsible for applying each coating shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be notified of the designated thinner and maximum allowable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dilution ratio for that coating by affixing a label to each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
container of coating in the batch or through another means 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as discussed in the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) For coatings and thinning solvents that do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contain water or exempt compounds, use Equation 1 as

If the actual thinner volume used for a coating is less

than or equal to the total allowable thinner volume for that

coating then compliance is presumed for that coating for the

month, unless a violation is revealed using Method 24. (If

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applied, that shows noncompliance with the standards would

Option 4. A Group of Coatings To Which the Same Thinning Solvent Is Added_Group Compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Inasmuch as shipyards may use the same solvent to reduce more than one category of coating, this option was created
to minimize recordkeeping in such cases. The group compliance option is similar to the coating-by-coating compliance
option, except the source does not need to maintain thinner usage by individual paint category; it would be allowed
to calculate the total allowable volume of thinner used for a group of coatings. A group would be constituted based
on use of common thinner. A group could consist of two or more different batches of the same coating or different coatings.
For example, a group may consist of a certain batch of antenna coating combined with all batches of general use coatings.
However, a group may not contain any coating to which thinning solvent will not be added. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Affected sources would calculate the maximum allowable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dilution ratio for each coating using equation 1 or 2. All 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
painters would have to be notified of the maximum allowable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dilution ratio for each coating. Beginning with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recorded amount of coating used during the previous month, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the facility would calculate the net allowable volume of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thinner that could have been used by each coating in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
group. If the actual usage was less than or equal to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
net allowable volume for the group, the source is in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance. However, any Method 24 test on individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containers of coating, as applied, that shows noncompliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the standards would take precedence and indicate a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violation. Equations 1 through 3 were derived from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Organic Compounds Emitted by Paint, Ink, and Other Coatings''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In those facilities located in areas without required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
VOC limits for marine coatings (i.e., ozone attainment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas; all 25 of the existing major source facilities are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
located in current ozone nonattainment areas), the affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
source may measure the HAP content using the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
techniques and using alternate limits derived from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limits in the regulation to demonstrate compliance on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coating-by-coating basis. The VOHAP
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
alt
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 limits were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculated using the maximum allowable VOHAP limits (see 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Table 1) and an assumed average density for all solvents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To demonstrate compliance, the source would determine (using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formulation data from the coating manufacturer) the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as-supplied VOC content and volume solids (V
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) of each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coating. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Then, using the measured (via any approved test method) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
VOHAP content divided by the volume solids, compliance can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
then be determined with the calculated VOHAP
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

F. Selection of Test Methods and Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the EPA does not yet have a published reference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
method for analyzing for the amount of VOHAP in a coating, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the measure of total VOC is to be used as a surrogate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Method 24 is the Agency's reference method for determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the total volatile organic content (the total amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
VOHAP and other volatile organics). The proposed rule would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use the VOC content of as-applied coatings to determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with the VOHAP content limits (see 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section VII.B.1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most, if not all, major shipbuilding facilities are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believed to be located in ozone nonattainment areas. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities are likely to be required to meet State VOC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations requiring BACM. As explained earlier in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice, the EPA's draft recommended BACM for the draft CTG 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contains VOC limits equivalent to the VOHAP limits being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed. Thus, using Method 24 to measure compliance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both the VOC and HAP rules (i.e., one test to satisfy two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerns) should be the least burdensome route of any source 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
having to meet VOC rules in addition to HAP rules. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in case there are any sources which are not required to meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
VOC rules and have a desire to determine compliance through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measuring VOHAP instead of VOC, an approach as outlined in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
option 5 is being proposed. (Comments are requested.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would require that affected sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use forms and procedures comparable to those in the EPA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Procedures for Certifying Quantity of Volatile Organic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compounds Emitted by Paint, Ink and Other Coatings,'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Revised June 1986) EPA&hyph;450/3&hyph;84&hyph;019 for all certifications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needed for compliance demonstrations. Consistent use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these forms and procedures will provide uniform and complete 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records that will allow determination of ``continuous'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with the standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Procedures other than test methods would be required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrate compliance with the handling, transfer, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage standard. Each source is required to submit an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation plan that will include specific procedures to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure compliance.

Reporting Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Notification Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would require affected sources to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submit an initial notification and subsequent quarterly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notifications of compliance status. Exceedances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(violations) should be reported on a quarterly basis. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notification requirements in &sect;&sect;63.9 (a)&hyph;(d) and (h)&hyph;(j) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subpart A would apply to all affected sources in addition to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the source category-specific requirements in the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule. Sections 63.9 (e)&hyph;(g) of subpart A would not apply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unless an affected source installs an add-on control device. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 63.9(b) of subpart A contains the initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notification requirements. The initial notification would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alert the Administrator of: (1) The applicability for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing facilities or of construction for new facilities, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) how the source plans to comply with the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards, and (3) if any delays in compliance are expected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notification would be due no later than 120 calendar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
days after the effective date of the rule for existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources; for new or reconstructed sources, the due date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be within 120 days after initial startup if approval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of construction or reconstruction is not required under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;63.5(d) of subpart A. In addition to the items listed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;63.9(b) of subpart A, sources would be required to include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the initial notification: (1) The compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedure(s) that they intend to use for the coating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation standards; (2) procedures for ensuring compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the handling, transfer, and storage standard; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) procedures for maintaining records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 63.9(h) of subpart A contains the requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for notification of compliance status. These would notify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Administrator of whether compliance has been achieved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
over the past 3 months. These notifications would be due 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before the 60th day following completion of each 3-month 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period. If there are no violations within the first year, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliant sources may request permission from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator to go to 6-month notifications. Because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records would be compiled on a monthly basis, 60 days should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide sufficient time to prepare these notifications. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition to the items listed in &sect;63.9(h) of subpart A, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected sources would be required to include in these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notifications all other records that the source is required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to maintain and compile on a monthly basis according to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would require affected sources to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintain adequate records to verify the compliance status of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the source on a monthly basis. The recordkeeping and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting requirements of the general provisions in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;&sect;63.10 (a)&hyph;(b) and (f) of subpart A would apply to all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected sources. The source category-specific requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the proposed rule also apply. Sections 63.10 (c)&hyph;(e) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subpart A would not apply unless an affected source installs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an add-on control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Affected sources would be required to keep records for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5 years of all VOC content certifications, VOHAP content 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certifications, maximum allowable dilution ratios, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quantities of coatings and thinner consumed, and compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculations needed to determine compliance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards. These records would vary slightly depending on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the method(s) of determining compliance under &sect;63.784 that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the source chooses to use. Records of any Method 24 tests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(or VOHAP tests) conducted on individual coatings, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applied, would also be maintained. These records are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required in case the results of any such test conflicts with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the results of any compliance determination conducted in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with the other allowable methods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Administrator believes that the records required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the proposed rule are necessary for a regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency to determine the compliance status of an affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
source efficiently and effectively. All records would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compiled each calendar month and maintained for a minimum of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5 years.

H. Operating Permit Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the operating permit regulations codified at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 CFR part 70, any source that is considered major under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Act or any nonmajor source subject to a standard under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sections 111 or 112 of the Act must obtain an operating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permit [see &sect;70.3(a)(1)]. Often, emission limits, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring, and reporting and recordkeeping requirements are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scattered among numerous provisions of State implementation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plans or Federal regulations. As discussed in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promulgated regulation for the operating permit program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published on July 21, 1992 (57 FR 32250), this new permit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program includes all of the air pollution control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements that pertain to a single major stationary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
source in a single document. Sources subject to the program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are required to submit complete permit applications within a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year after a State operating permit program is approved by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the EPA; if a State program is not approved, sources will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submit applications to the EPA within a year after the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal program is promulgated.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administrator solicits comments on all aspects of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this proposal. However, the Administrator is specifically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requesting comment on the topics discussed in this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters should provide available data and rationale to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
support their comments on each topic.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administrator specifically requests comments on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MACT floor determination, subcategorization, and claims by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some shipyards on the need for thinning solvents beyond 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels indicated by the manufacturer because of viscosity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
problems attributable to extremely cold weather. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, comments are requested on: (1) Are such needs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compulsory or more convenience, (2) why in-line heaters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not provide sufficient viscosity control, (3) what 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extreme climatic conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
etc.) would justify excess thinning, (4) how such additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solvent could be linked in quantity (e.g., dilution to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preapproved viscosity setpoint), and (5) any other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information that would help the Agency in this matter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The Administrator also requests comments on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
timeframe for submitting items in the initial notification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are not required under the General Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;&sect;63.9(b) (2) and (3) of subpart A. These items are the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance procedure(s) that the source intends to use to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrate compliance; procedures for ensuring compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the handling, storage, and transfer standards; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures for maintaining records. Specifically, comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are requested on whether 120 days is sufficient time to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepare and submit these items.

C. Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1993)), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
likely to result in a rule that may: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 1. Have an annual effect on the economy of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 2. Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 3. Materially alter the budgetary impact of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 4. Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principles set forth in the Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule for coating operations at shipbuilding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities does not meet any of the criteria in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Executive Order and is therefore not subject to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement for a regulatory impact analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 It has been determined that this rule is not a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``significant regulatory action'' under the terms of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E.O. 12866 and is therefore not subject to OMB review.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The information collection requirements in the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule have been submitted for approval to OMB under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 An 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information Collection Request document has been prepared by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the EPA (ICR No. 1712.01), and a copy may be obtained from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ms. Sandy Farmer, Information Policy Branch, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street SW. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Mail Code 2136), Washington, DC 20460 or by calling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(202) 260&hyph;2740. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The public reporting burden for this collection of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information is estimated to average 845 hours per source for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the first year after the date of promulgation of the rule, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including time for reviewing instructions, searching 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information. The cost for this additional burden per source 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is estimated to be $27,158 during the first year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other aspect of this collection of information, including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggestions for reducing his burden, to Chief, Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Policy Branch, 2136, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Budget, Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Officer for the EPA.'' The final rule will respond to any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OMB or public comments on the information collection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements contained in this proposal.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires the EPA to consider potential impacts of proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations on small business ``entities.'' If a preliminary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis indicates that a proposed regulation would have a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant economic impact on 20 percent or more of small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities, then a regulatory flexibility analysis must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepared. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certifies that this rule will not have a significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Using the Small Business Administration's definition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small business for SIC Code 3731 of less than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1,000 employees, and examining the result of the economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact analysis it has been determined that no small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities will be affected by the proposed rule. Therefore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a preliminary assessment of the impact of today's proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule on small entities indicated that a regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flexibility analysis is not required.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice proposes to amend selected Federal Information Resources Management Regulation (FIRMR) provisions
to ensure the currency and relevancy of the FIRMR. It is issued in accordance with Executive Order 12866 of September
30, 1993, which requires agencies to periodically review their significant regulations to determine whether they
should be modified or eliminated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule will make a number of changes to the FIRMR. Among the more significant changes, are the following: add, change,
or remove FIRMR definitions and acronyms including redefining ``outdated equipment'' to mean FIP equipment over
six years old that is no longer in current production; revise provisions pertaining to accessibility by individuals
with disabilities to implement the new focus in Pub. L. 102&hyph;569 on information rather than equipment; permit
agency heads to grant exceptions to the mandatory use of a Federal Standard (FED&hyph;STD) after notification to
GSA; clarify the intent of the FIRMR requirement for agencies to conduct requirements analyses ``commensurate with
the size and complexity of the need''; allow agencies to substitute similar documentation prepared in response to
programmatic needs for requirements analyses; establish a threshold below which agencies do not have to prepare
a requirements analysis or analysis of alternatives; clarify that agencies should only perform an analysis of alternatives
for those alternatives most feasible to implement; raise the threshold from $50,000 to $1,000,000 for doing an analysis
of alternatives limited to demonstrating that the benefits of the acquisition will outweigh the costs; require agencies
that conduct telephone monitoring to use some form of oral notice or a beep tone at the beginning of a call; remove the
reporting requirements to GSA for listening-in to or recording telephone conversations and toll-free telephone
service; clarify procedures for economical capability and performance validation; revise the scope of obsolescence
reviews to include equipment that may be obsolescing; expand the exception from $300,000 to $1,000,000 for award
based on lowest offered purchase price; clarify that agencies must submit post delegation information to GSA for
specific acquisition delegations; clarify procedures for evaluating outdated and obsolete information technology;
and remove an antiquated clause concerning warranty exclusion and limitation of damages.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Explanation of changes being made by this issuance are shown below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Sections 201&hyph;1.003(a), 201&hyph;3.000, 201&hyph;3,001(a), 201&hyph;3.101, 201&hyph;3.201(d), 201&hyph;3.3
and the title to part 201&hyph;3 are amended by deleting references to the FIRMR system. The FIRMR system was established
to permit agencies to issue regulations that implement or supplement the FIRMR as part of the CODE of Federal Regulations
(CFR). GSA has determined that agencies have not issued such regulations in the CFR since the establishment of the
FIRMR, and that a FIRMR system is therefore, unnecessary. Removal of this provision does not mean that agencies may
not issue internal agency directives or orders to implement or supplement FIRMR provisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Section 201&hyph;1.003 paragraph (d) is amended by deleting responsibilities of the Archivist of the United
States. It is the intent of the FIRMR to only implement GSA's authorities and responsibilities. Including the Archivist's
responsibilities in the FIRMR is, therefore, unnecessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Section 201&hyph;2.001 paragraphs (a) (1) through (6) are removed. The original text was taken from the Paperwork
Reduction Act. However, not all provisions were excerpted. This resulted in some confusion. Accordingly, the text
is being removed so that agencies will refer to the Paperwork Reduction Act to learn the specific responsibilities
of the designated senior official.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Section 201&hyph;2.001 paragraph (b) is amended by removing the last sentence which pertained to agencies not
subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act. This information is adequately covered in &sect;201&hyph;2.002.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Section 201&hyph;2.002 is amended by changing the sequence of paragraphs (a) through (c). The revised sequence
more accurately aligns the responsibilities of the agency designated senior official (DSO).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Section 201&hyph;3 discuss the organization of the FIRMR, how it is supplemented with other guidance issuances,
and its relationship to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). Section 201&hyph;3.001 is amended to remove unnecessary
details which pertain to circumstances giving rise to interim rules. This information is more appropriately discussed
in &sect;201&hyph;3.203. Section 201&hyph;3.203 paragraph (c) replaces the term ``termporary change'' with the
words ``interim rule'' to standardize terminology pertaining to revising the FIRMR. Also removed for brevity is
a redundant sentence that lists the various types of guidance material already described. For consistency, the enumeration
of the types of guidance issuances contained in the FIRMR (&sect;201&hyph;3.001(b) (1) through (3)) is changed to
small roman numerals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Section 201&hyph;3.001 paragraph (b)(1) is amended to reflect the current availability of the FIRMR on CD&hyph;ROM.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(h) Section 201&hyph;3.204 paragraph (a) is amended to update the phone number for the Government Printing Office
(GPO) Bookstore. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) In &sect;&sect;201&hyph;4.001 and 201&hyph;39.201, the definition for outdated FIP equipment is revised to
shorten the period for determining when FIP equipment is outdated. The FIRMR defines outdated FIP equipment as any
FIP equipment over eight years old, based on the initial commercial installation date of that model of equipment,
and that is no longer in current production. This definition has been in existence since 1986 when the product cycle
of computer equipment was four years. Since that time, the product life cycle has decreased to about three years, and
industry spokesmen state that this figure is decreasing even more. When microcomputers are upgraded, the product
cycle may be even less since typically they are upgraded by replacing internal computer equipment has little or no
market value. In recognition of these faces, the definition for outdated equipment is being revised to shorten the
time interval from eight to six years after the first commercial installation at which point equipment no longer produced
is considered to be outdated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) Section 201&hyph;4.001 is amended by adding a new definition for ``Records management. The FIRMR discusses records
management in subpart 201&hyph;9.1, but has never included a definition. The definition added is the same as contained
in OMB Circular A&hyph;130. Also, the existing definitions of ``application software'' and ``common-use software''
are designated (a) and (b) respectively of the larger term, ``Software'' for consistency of format. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(k) Section 201&hyph;4.002 is revised to include the following new acronyms: CBD, FED-STD, FSTS, GAO, GSBCA, IRPMR,
MIL, OAC, and POTS. These acronyms were used in the FIRMR index, but previously were not defined. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(l) Section 201&hyph;4.003, Applicable OMB Circulars, is being added. In order to avoid future changes to FIRMR text
caused by revisions of OMB Circular titles, this new section is added to include the current titles of all OMB Circulars
referenced in the FIRMR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(m) Section 201&hyph;6.001 is revised to add a new item (a)(5) to more closely reflect the provisions of the Paperwork
Reduction Act, as well as address matters raised in OMB Circular A&hyph;130. These include improving service delivery,
dissemination of information, increasing productivity, improving quality of decision making, reducing fraud
and waste, and reducing the information processing burden. Section 201&hyph;6.001 is also revised to redesignate
the previous item (5) as new item (6). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(n) A series of revisions are being made due to Pub. L. 102&hyph;569 October 29, 1992), which amended the Rehabilitation
Act of 1973 broadening the scope of accessibility for individuals with disabilities. These revisions capture more
thoroughly the intent of Pub. L. 102&hyph;569. The previous version of the Rehabilitation Act only required that
GSA ensure those with disabilities can access ``electric office equipment.'' The revised statute recognizes that
while equipment accessibility is important, that alone is not sufficient because an agency's applications software
and user interfaces can impede the functional use of a computer if they do not have features permitting use by individuals
with disabilities. The revised statutory provision emphasizes that all individuals must be able to use technology
to accomplish the same end objectives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new &sect;201&hyph;6.002(g) is added to include as a predominant consideration in the management and use of information
and records, the importance of ensuring that individuals with disabilities can produce information and data, and
have access to information and data, comparable to the information and data, and access, respectively, of others.
Section 201&hyph;6.002 is also revised to redesignate the previous item (g) as new item (h). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the insertion of &sect;201&hyph;6.002(g), discussed above, other provisions of the FIRMR pertaining
to accessibility by individuals with disabilities are being revised to incorporate the statutory intent of Pub.
L. 102&hyph;569. These other FIRMR provisions are:

(o) Section 201&hyph;7.001 paragraph (b) is revised to delete a reference to canceled OMB Circular A&hyph;3. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(p) Section 201&hyph;7.002 paragraph (c) is revised to clarify when information needs are determined. The existing
text suggested that information needs were to be determined before conducting a requirements analysis. The revised
text reflects that determining information needs and analyzing requirements are frequently concurrent activities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(q) Section 201&hyph;9.202&hyph;1 paragraph (b)(9) is revised to update the current mailing address for the Supply

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(r) The existing text in &sect;201&hyph;20.001(d) referenced the specific subjects of requirements analysis and
analysis of alternatives in the GSA Acquisition Guide series. The reference to the guide series is unnecessary and
is being deleted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(s) Subpart 201&hyph;20.1 is revised to clarify GSA's intent regarding the preparation of requirements analyses.
Currently, the FIRMR requires agencies to document their requirements for FIP resources ``by conducting a requirements
analysis commensurate with the size and complexity of the need.'' Some agencies have questioned the necessity of
conducting a requirements analysis and preparing the required documentation when a similar document has already
been prepared in conformance with agency programmatic needs. The FIRMR is being revised to allow agencies to use such
similar documents if they address the basic information required in a requirements analysis. Other agencies have
misinterpreted the intent of the phrase ``commensurate with the size and complexity of the need,'' and, in some cases,
are over documenting requirements for small dollar acquisitions. These small dollar acquisitions are usually for
commercial items readily available in the competitive marketplace. FAR planning provisions and agencies' local
procurement practices provide sufficient information for requirements to justify small dollar value acquisitions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure more expeditious and efficient acquisitions, this rule establishes a threshold for when agencies must
conduct requirements analyses and analyses of alternatives. Sections 201&hyph;20.102 and 201&hyph;20.202 are
revised to eliminate the requirement to perform requirements analyses and analyses of alternatives for acquisitions
of FIP resources when the total estimated system life costs are less than $100,000. Additionally, &sect;201&hyph;20.103
is revised to require that agencies only consider the factors in this section if it is appropriate to do so. This allows
agencies to exercise discretion regarding whether or not to include the factors in their requirements analyses.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(t) Subpart 201&hyph;20.1 requires agencies to perform an analysis of alternatives based on the requirements analysis
to determine the most advantageous alternative that will meet their needs. Like the requirements analysis, the analysis
of alternatives must be ``commensurate with the size and complexity of the agency's need''. As indicated in &sect;201&hyph;20.203&hyph;1(a)(1),
GSA's intention was that agencies only include in the analysis of alternatives those alternatives that are truly
feasible to implement. It has come to our attention, however, that some agencies are analyzing all alternatives,
whether or not they are feasible in the specific circumstance. This unnecessarily complicates and lengthens the
acquisition process. Accordingly, &sect;201&hyph;20.202, which states the FIRMR policy on performing analyses
of alternatives, is being revised to emphasize that agencies should limit the number of alternatives analyzed to
those that are feasible to implement. Other changes are also being made to this subpart. Section 201&hyph;20.203&hyph;2
is being revised to increase from $50,000 to $1,000,000 the threshold for performing a more detailed analysis of alternatives.
Agencies will be given the option of performing either an analysis using the present value of money if the estimated
amount of their proposed acquisition is less than $1,000,000 or an analysis that demonstrates that the benefits of
the acquisition will outweigh the costs. This change will help to streamline the acquisition process by reducing
documentation requirements for a greater number of smaller acquisitions. Additionally, paragraph 201&hyph;20.203&hyph;2(c)
is being revised to delete the title of OMB Circular A&hyph;94 and to move it to the new &sect;201&hyph;4.003.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(u) Section 201&hyph;20.203 paragraph (d)(2) is revised to permit agency heads to grant exceptions to FED&hyph;STDS
provided GSA is notified at least 30 days prior to any use of the excepted FED&hyph;STD, e.g., in a solicitation. This
change empowers agencies to accomplish their missions more effectively.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Section 201&hyph;20.304 paragraphs (a) and b(1) deal with capability and performance validation. They are revised
to require use of validation techniques that are more economical to Government and industry than use of a benchmark
or an operational capability demonstration (OCD). In the early years of computing, comprehensive benchmarks, stress
tests, and OCDS were useful for validating reliability, performance and other requirements. In today's mature industry,
the reliability and stability of the marketplace offerings are much higher. Also, there is substantial empirical
data available from independent sources to assist agencies in assessing how a proposed system will perform in their
environment and with their workloads. As a result, the use of benchmarks or OCDs may not be the most advantageous approach
in many acquisitions. This is more likely to be the case for those acquisitions that do not require customized hardware
and/or software. Agencies will not be required to select the most economical technique available that will meet their
minimum needs. Additionally, &sect;201&hyph;20.304(b)(2) is revised to delete the adjective ``actual'' in front
of the word ``requirements''. The world ``actual'' caused some confusion about the meaning of ``When a benchmark
is used as part of performance validation, agencies shall ensure, that the FIP software selected for benchmarks is
representative of actual requirements *&blank;*&blank;*'' In fact, agencies acquire systems to accommodate a
workload over a life cycle of some years. Any agency's definition of its requirements at the time of acquisition is
its best estimate of workload that will ultimately occur over the ensuing years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(w) Section 201&hyph;20.305&hyph;3 is revised to emphasize the agency requirement for the submission of post delegation
information to GAS for specific delegations. With the increased emphasis on results oriented performance, GAS will
seek information demonstrating that agencies are obtaining the benefits cited in their agency procurement requests.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(x) Section 201&hyph;21.201 paragraph (b) is revised to reflect the current name and symbol of a GSA organization.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(y) Section 201&hyph;21.301 paragraphs (a) and (d) are revised to delete references to OMB Circular A&hyph;130,
Appendix III. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(z) Section 201&hyph;21.401 paragraph (c) is revised to remove references to OMB Circular A&hyph;130, Appendix
II, which is proposed for revision; and to remove the title of the Circular since it appears in the new &sect;201&hyph;4.003.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(aa) Section 201&hyph;21.43 is amended to change the annual report date from November 30 to October 20 for reporting
the dollar amount charged to users for the sharing of excess FIP resources. This earlier due date allows for more timely
submission of GSA's consolidated Governmentwide report to Congress.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(bb) Section 201&hyph;21.603 is amended to delete the agency reporting requirement and to add a requirement that
agencies that do public service monitoring provide an oral notice or beep tone at the beginning of a call. This section
currently prohibits agencies listening-in to or recording telephone conversations, on a GSA-provided telephone
system, any telephone system acquired under a delegation of GSA procurement authority, or any telecommunications
system approved in accordance with the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended, except
under certain circumstances. Agencies that listen-in or record conversations for public safety, public service
monitoring or to assist individuals with disabilities must notify GSA in writing at least 30 days before the operational
date. This notification provision is being removed because it places an unnecessary burden on agencies. GSA does
not have any affirmative enforcement or other function with regard to listening-in that would make this reporting
requirement necessary. Such responsibilities rest solely with the reporting agency. Accordingly, in line with
placing authority and responsibility at the appropriate level, this reporting requirement will be removed as will
the provision that GSA will periodically review agency listening-in activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 201&hyph;603 paragraph (d)(4)(ii) requires that agencies that perform public service monitoring provide
for continuous positive action to inform the public of that monitoring. Some agencies have interpreted this to mean
that including a statement in agency publications that calls to the agency may be monitored meets this requirements.
After careful review, GSA has determined that since all callers may not see such publications, additional notification
is required. Accordingly, we propose adding a provision that requires agencies to provide an upfront announcement
or beep tone at the beginning of a call to advise callers of potential monitoring. Since such an announcement may increase
communications costs, we request that agencies provide us detailed information about any negative impact implementation
of this provision may have on them. We will carefully review this information before reaching a decision on whether
to include this provision in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(cc) Section 201&hyph;21.604, requires agencies to forward to GSA copies of each order for toll free telephone service.
Documentation submitted is to include estimates of monthly costs and usage, and cite the relevant statute, Executive
Order, or other regulation directing the toll free service. This provision is being removed because the use of toll-free
telephone services are sufficiently routine that close supervision by GSA is no longer needed. Removal of this provision
reduces costly and burdensome over-regulation and places authority and responsibility with the agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(dd) Section 201&hyph;22.303 is revised to expand the scope of the subpart. Currently, this provision requires agencies
to review the use of equipment that is already outdated and to determine if continued use is economical. This provision
is revised also to expand the scope of the review to include equipment that may be obsolescent. This change is made to
encourage agencies to ensure that their FIP equipment always remains economical and efficient. Guidelines are provided
to assist agencies in identifying obsolescent equipment. Agencies are encouraged to replace their obsolescent
equipment if the cost of continued use exceeds the cost of acquiring and operating newer technology. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ee) Section 201&hyph;39.1001&hyph;1 is amended by removing the words ``OMB Bulletin 88&hyph;16'' in paragraph
(i) and adding in their place ``OMB Bulletin 90&hyph;08''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ff) Sections 201&hyph;39.1402&hyph;2 paragraph (c) and 201&hyph;39.1501&hyph;2 paragraph (c) are revised to
increase the thresholds below which certain factors need not be considered in determing the lowest bid or total proposed
cost, respectively. In determining the lowest bid in a sealed bidding acquisition, &sect;201&hyph;39.1402&hyph;1
requires agencies to factor in costs pertaining to life cycle support and conversion. In determing the total cost
of a proposal in a negotiated acquisition, &sect;201&hyph;39.1501&hyph;1 requires agencies to factor in costs
pertaining to life cycle support and conversion. These thresholds are increased from $300,000 to $1,000,000 in order
to give agencies greater discretion in managing their acquisitions.

(gg) Subpart 201&hyph;39.46 is amended to delete provisions that are more adequately addressed in FAR Subpart 46.
This subpart addresses quality assurance and provides guidance limiting contractor liability in contracts for
FIP resources. Unless circumstances warrant otherwise, contracting officers are instructed to insert a limitation
of liability clause found at &sect;201&hyph;39.5206. FAR Subpart 46 also provides guidance on limitation of contractor
liability. The FAR's guidance is more comprehensive and flexible than is the FIRMR's. The FAR provides multiple contractual
clauses from which a contracting officer must choose. One clause applies to contracts for the delivery of non-high
value end items, a second to the delivery of high-value end items, and a third to the provision of services. Contracting
officers are instructed to combine relevant parts of each clause for contracts involving more than one of these categories.
Accordingly, the FIRMR provision and clause found at &sect;201&hyph;39.5202&hyph;6 are removed so that the corresponding
FAR provision will apply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) GSA has determined that this rule is not a significant rule for the purposes of Executive Order 12866 of October
4, 1993, because it is not likely to result in any of the impacts noted in Executive Order 12866, affect the rights of
specified individuals, or raise issues arising from the policies of the Administration. GSA has based all administrative
decisions underlying this rule on adequate information concerning the need for and consequences of this rule; has
determined that the potential benefits to society from this rule outweigh the potential costs; has maximized the
net benefits; and has chosen the alternative approach involving the least net cost to society.

(a) The PRA requires that the head of each executive agency designate a senior official who shall report directly to
the agency head. The designated official is responsible for carrying out the IRM function assigned to the agency by
the PRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The PRA also assigns to the designated official the responsibility for the conduct of and accountability for acquisitions
of FIP resources made under a DPA from GSA. Therefore, when GSA delegates its procurements authority to executive
agencies, it grants those delegations to the designated officials when GSA determines that such officials are sufficiently
independent of program responsibility and have sufficient experience, resources, and ability to fairly and effectively
carry out procurements under GSA's authority as provided by 40 U.S.C. 759(b)(3).

(CFR) and includes interim rules which have the same effect as codified material.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

guidance and information:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) FIRMR bulletins contain guidance and information on various information resources management areas. FIRMR
bulletins do not constitute binding authority, but should be used as an aid in understanding GSA programs and the FIRMR.
FIRMR bulletins are published in Appendix B of the looseleaf edition of the FIRMR and are available along with the FIRMR
from GPO by subscription or on GSA's CD&hyph;ROM.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Handbooks and reports address specific program or technical areas where the audience generally will be defined
by the subject matter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(c) The Administrator of General Services may issue an interim rule to the FIRMR when solicitation of comments is impractical
due to urgent and compelling circumstances (e.g., when a new statute must be implemented in a relatively short period
of time). However, the interim rule will make provision for a public comment period of at least 30 days for consideration
in the formulation of the final change to the FIRMR.

This seventh notice of proposed rulemaking is one segment of the Sixth Order on Reconsideration, Fifth Report and
Order and Seventh Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in this proceeding. The final rules adopted in this decision may be
found elsewhere in this issue. In the Seventh Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the Commission sought comment on whether
cable operators electing to use the per channel adjustment under the Commission's new rules should be allowed to take
the 7.5% mark-up on programming cost increases for channels added to the system before May 15, 1994; and whether operators
electing to use the current going forward rules should be permitted to pass-through the 7.5% mark-up on new programming
cost increases after the initial mark-up on programming costs of new channels. The intended effect of this proposal
is to eliminate the pass-through to subscribers of unnecessary cost increases.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This is the proposed rules segment of the Commission's Sixth Order on Reconsideration, Fifth Report and Order and
Seventh Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in MM Docket No. 92&hyph;266 and MM Docket No. 93&hyph;215, FCC 94&hyph;286,

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A. The Commission's existing rate regulation rules permit operators to increase rates by a per channel amount when
channels are added to basic service tiers (BSTs) and cable programming service tiers (CPSTs), with the per channel
amount decreasing as the number of channels on a system increases. 47 CFR 76.922(e). These rules also permit operators
to pass through to subscribers the costs of obtaining programming plus a 7.5% mark-up on new programming costs. 47
CFR 76.922(d)(3)(xi). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. The revised regulations adopted pursuant to the Sixth Order on Reconsideration and Fifth Report and Order provide
that operators may adjust their rates after December 31, 1994, for channel additions occurring after May 14, 1994.
Operators electing to use the new rules will be allowed to take a per channel mark-up of up to 20 cents for each channel
added to cable programming service tiers (``CPSTs). Operators may make rate adjustments under this rule at any time
during the three-year period beginning on January 1, 1995. They may not make per channel adjustments to monthly rates
totalling more than $1.20 per subscriber over the first two years of the three-year period for new channels added on
CPSTs or by more than $1.40 over the full three-year period. Operators may use any portion of the Operator's Cap to recover
license fees associated with adding new channels to CPSTs. In addition, operators may recover an additional amount
of not more than 30 cents per subscriber per month for license fees associated with adding new channels during the first
and second years the Operator's Cap is in effect. In the third year, license fees will not be subject to special rules,
but will be subject to the general rate rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. In addition, the Commission determined that operators electing to use the 20 cent per channel adjustment may not
take the 7.5% mark-up on programming cost increases, including retransmission consent fees and copyright fees incurred
for carriage of broadcast signals, for channels added on or after May 15, 1994. The Commission made this determination
because its analysis indicates that the 20 cent per channel adjustment will provide full and fair compensation to
operators adding new channels to CPSTs.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
D. The Commission believes that for operators using the per channel adjustment of up to 20 cents, maintaining the 7.5%
mark-up on programming cost increases for channels offered before May 15, 1994, may no longer be necessary given the
total incentive structure provided in the revised going forward rules. In addition, the 7.5% mark-up on such channels
may create an artificial incentive for the operator to continue to offer programming that the operator would not otherwise
continue to offer. For these reasons, the Commission tentatively concludes that the 7.5% mark-up is unnecessary
for such operators with respect to increases in programming costs for channels offered before May 15, 1994. The Commission
solicits comment on whether operators electing to use the per channel adjustment of up to 20 cents under the new rules
should be allowed to take the 7.5% mark-up on increases in programming costs, including retransmission consent fees
and copyright fees incurred for carriage of broadcast signals, for channels added before May 15, 1994. If the Commission
decides that such operators may not take a 7.5% mark-up on increases in programming costs, it will not consider requiring
cable operators to prospectively remove from rates any 7.5% mark-up added prior to the effective date of a final rule
on this issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E. The Commission believes that the 7.5% mark-up on new programming costs when channels are initially added to a system
ought be preserved for systems that continue to use the existing going forward rules because the 7.5% mark-up is an
important part of the total package of incentives to add new programming under the existing rules. The Commission's
rules permitting operators to pass through external costs are generally intended to compensate for added costs outside
the operators' control and not to provide an additional mark-up without a clear policy purpose. In contrast to the
situation where the goal of providing incentives to add new programming services justifies a mark-up, there appears
to be no strong reason to allow a mark-up programming cost increases for a service already being offered. The Commission
therefore solicits comment on whether operators electing to use the current going forward rules should be permitted
to pass-through the 7.5% mark-up on programming cost increases after the initial mark-up on the programming cost
of new channels. The Commission will not, however, consider prospectively removing from rates any 7.5% mark-up that
was reflected in rates prior to our reaching a decision on this issue.

Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to Section 603 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Commission has prepared the following initial regulatory
flexibility analysis (IRFA) of the expected impact of these proposed policies and rules on small entities. Written
public comments are requested on the IRFA. These comments must be filed in accordance with the same filing deadlines
as comments on the rest of the Notice, but they must have a separate and distinct heading designating them as responses
to the regulatory flexibility analysis. The Secretary shall cause a copy of the Notice, including the initial regulatory
flexibility analysis, to be sent to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration in accordance
with Section 603(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, Pub. L. No. 96&hyph;354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. Section 601
et seq. (1981). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Reason for action. The Cable Television Consumer Protection and Completion Act of 1992 requires the Commission
to prescribe rules and regulations for determining reasonable rates for basic tier cable service and to establish
criteria for identifying unreasonable rates for cable programming services. The Commission's existing rate regulations
permit operators to pass through to subscribes the costs of obtaining programming plus a 7.5% mark-up on new programming
costs. The revised rules, adopted pursuant to the Sixth Order on Reconsideration and Fifth Report and Order, permit
operators to use a new per channel adjustment methodology for channels added on or after May 15, 1994, and to eliminate
the 7.5% mark-up on new programming costs for those channels. This Notice proposes to determine extent to which cable
operators electing to use either the existing or the new going forward rules, can continue to pass through to subscribers
a 7.5% mark-up on increases on new programming costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
II. Objectives. To propose rules to implement Section 3 of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition
Act of 1992. The Commission also desires to adopt rules that will be easily interpreted and readily applicable and,
whenever possible, minimize the regulatory burden on affected parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III. Legal Basis. Action as proposed for this rulemaking is contained in Sections 4(j), 303(r) and 623 of the Communications
Act of 1934, as amended. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IV. Description, potential impact and number of small entities affected. The Commission anticipates a possible
impact on small entities because the Notice addresses the extent to which cable operators, including small cable
operators, electing to use either the existing or the new going forward rules, can continue to pass through to subscribers
a 7.5% mark-up on increases on new programming costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
V. Reporting, record keeping and other compliance requirements. None. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
VI. Federal rules which overlap, duplicate or conflict with this rule. None. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
VII. Any significant alternatives minimizing impact on small entities and consistent with stated objectives. None.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
G. Paperwork reduction Act. The requirements adopted herein have been analyzed with respect to the Paperwork Reduction
Act of 1980 and found to impose no new or modified information collection requirements on the public.

A. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed DFARS rule supplements a proposed FAR rule concerning the allowability of personal services compensation
costs which was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for public comment on October 11, 1994 (59 FR 51399). The proposed DFARS rule would limit the FAR compensation system
review procedures to DoD prime contractors or subcontractors which have received awards totaling $50 million or
more in the previous fiscal year and for which cost or pricing data was submitted.

B. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within
the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 because most contracts awarded to small entities are awarded on a competitive, fixed-price basis and the cost principles
do not apply. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments from small
entities concerning the affected DFARS subpart will be considered in accordance with Section 610 of the Act. Such
comments must be submitted separately and cite DAR Case 91&hyph;085D in correspondence.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Paperwork Reduction Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;511) does not apply because the proposed rule does not impose any additional

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 We propose to modify our regulations to provide for the electronic filing of surety bonds, trust fund agreements,
certificates of insurance and cancellations. We currently receive approximately 102,000 such filings each year
on prescribed printed forms, most of which are filed by a relatively small number of insurers. As compared to the printed
forms and mailed filings, we believe that electronic filing will result in greater time and cost efficiencies for
both the ICC and insurers.

 (59 FR 51546, October 12, 1994), we requested comments on our proposal that would permit motor carrier applicants
to include proof of insurance in their applications. Currently the Commission only accepts proof of insurance from
the insurance company. Electronic filing of the initial insurance form will enhance the expedited compliance objectives
contemplated in that proceeding.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 We automated our receipt of insurance certificates and cancellation notices in 1983. Since that time, the Commission's
computer system has remained unchanged in the face of staff cuts and increased insurance filings. The current system
is maintained on a contracted time-sharing system (Interactive Services, Inc.) DEC 20/60 mainframe computer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Insurance filings are processed manually, with visual inspection of each item and keying in the data. If the insurance
filing is not complete or the computer rejects the entry, a rejection letter is generated and mailed to the insurance
company. An insurance master file is used to generate monthly billings to insurance companies. Because the Commission's
current insurance system is labor intensive, and thus vulnerable to human error, the potential exists for legal liability
due to incomplete or inaccurate insurance data on file at the Commission. Thus, it is crucial that we develop more efficient
ways to handle our insurance responsibilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 We expect a significant percentage of filings to be made electronically. For example, one insurer, which accounts
for a large number of the agency's monthly insurance filings, already has a compatible automated system, and must
reduce the filings to printed form for filing with the Commission. This proposal eventually will improve the accuracy
and timeliness of our processing and reduce the overall cost to the Commission and the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Accordingly, we propose to modify our regulations to permit the electronic filing of all surety bonds, trust fund
agreements, insurance certificates and cancellations. Electronic filing would be done through the transmission
of ASCII delimited files (i.e., all records must have the same number of fields separated by commas) by way of dial-up
access to a local telephone number in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area. We welcome comments on whether the
ability to file electronically should be extended to all of these forms and request comments specifically on electronic
filing of property broker security instruments (BMC 84 surety bond and BMC 85 trust fund agreement). In that regard,
we note that the BMC 84's and BMC 85's filed are the actual security, whereas the other forms certify that the underlying
policy or bond has been executed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 We currently maintain a data base of regulated carriers that includes insurance information and other data. The electronic
filing capability we propose will allow us to maintain electronically the insurance information on that data base,
rather than input it manually from the printed forms, without requiring a major rewrite of the entire system. While
a more sophisticated system could offer additional advantages, such as immediate, two-way electronic communication
of the status of individual insurance transactions, our limited financial resources do not permit the development
of such a system at this time. We believe the basic system we propose here will allow us to achieve the more important
advantages, while staying within our resource limitations. However, we invite public comment on how this limitation
might be overcome, perhaps by industry initiative, and invite comment on other alternative approaches. Commenters
should discuss whether such industry involvement would be ethical.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted, we believe electronic filing will promote efficiencies for both the Commission and insurers, resulting
in benefits to the public. To help gauge the full effect of our proposal, we seek comments on the number of insurers that
envision filing electronically and the extent to which they will avail themselves of the opportunity to file their
forms electronically. Given the potential for significant public benefits from electronic filing of insurance
and substantial voluntary use of such a system by insurers, we also seek comments on the alternative of making electronic
filing mandatory, either initially or at some point in the future. Such comments should include a discussion of the
impact of such a mandatory system on insurers and an assessment of the type of system that would be necessary to handle
the resulting volume of use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After receiving comments on the proposal, our Systems Services Branch will build and test the electronic filing system,
as well as prepare and maintain systems documentation and a User Manual. Each participating insurer will receive
a unique account and password for login purposes on the timesharing system. We also envision that the insurer could
register branch offices or other authorized filers under its account and password. We contemplate access being available
24 hours a day, 7 days a week (except scheduled maintenance) by way of dial-up at either 1200 or 2400 baud to a local telephone
number in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area (although we recognize that 9600 baud may be more desirable). Any
long distance telephone charges required to reach such number will be the responsibility of the filer, and even at
1200 baud should be minimal. Once connected, the insurance company will be presented with a variety of menu options.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After an authorized insurer logs in on the system and selects the menu option to upload insurance filings, the ICC computer
will initiate the communications protocol, KERMIT, to receive filings. Upon completion of the transmission of the
insurance filings, the ICC computer system will append the filings to a transaction file for subsequent batch processing.
The insurance company will be returned to the main menu. One of the menu options contemplated is the insurer's ability
to generate a report showing the number and type of transactions transmitted and received by the ICC. This transaction
report will not be available to the home office of the insurance company at the time the transactions are filed. The
home office will receive a comprehensive list of filings accepted at the time it receives its monthly billing statement.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, mere transmission of the filings does not guarantee acceptance by the Commission. Any record not containing
a valid field or containing fields with incomplete or invalid data will be flagged with an error code. Each of these
records will generate a rejection notice to be sent back to the insurance company. Records passing the initial validity
checks will then be edited field by field against the ICC carrier and insurance data base. When all transmitted fields
have been edited and verified, the filing will be applied against the insurance master file, either adding a new filing
or applying a cancellation against an existing filing. All records that do not pass the automated edits will be flagged
for manual processing. After manual review, those records accepted will be applied against the insurance master
file, and those rejected will generate a rejection letter. A follow-up ``hard copy'' of an accepted filing will not
be required. However, we do propose that insurers agree to furnish the Commission a duplicate original of any policy
(or policies) and all endorsements, surety bond, trust fund agreement, or other filing.

We will accept or reject individual filings, and assess filing fees, as we do for printed filings, except that, in lieu
of returning a copy of the printed form to the filer, we will provide a listing identifying each electronic filing with
the monthly billing statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In connection with the assessment and billing of fees for electronic filings, we are considering the option of allowing
insurers to establish large prepaid accounts from which the filing fees would automatically be deducted. This enhancement
would reduce costs to both insurers and the Commission. Once this system has been in place for a sufficient amount of
time, we will review the fees charged and the appropriateness of changing them to reflect the costs associated with
the new system.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is proposing amendments to its rules under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) for polychlorinated biphenyls
(PCBs). Changes are being proposed for the requirements for determining PCB concentration; marking, storage, and
disposal; decontamination levels and procedures; and the reporting and recordkeeping requirements for PCBs, PCB
Items, environmental media (e.g., soil, sediments, rivers, and lakes) contaminated with PCBs or PCBs in association
with radioactive materials. In addition, EPA proposes to insert additional definitions and references, include
new authorizations and exemptions, require the registration of certain electrical transformers, regulate combustion
in industrial furnaces, regulate the disposal of liquids in landfills, coordinate PCB disposal approvals with other
Federal and State programs, and revise the reportable quantity in the spill cleanup policy. EPA is also proposing
to coordinate strategies for the remediation of PCB spills and other disposal sites, including cleanup under the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Corrective Action provisions and the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund) remedial programs.

A. Purpose of this Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 10, 1991 (56 FR 26738), EPA published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) to solicit comments
on possible changes to the PCB disposal regulations promulgated under the authority of TSCA section 6(e) and codified
in 40 CFR part 761. Comments and supporting data on the issues outlined in the ANPRM, a number of other topics pertaining
to the PCB regulations, and the interface between those regulations and other Federal and State programs affecting
PCBs were received from more than 90 respondents. EPA has considered all of the comments. Based on these comments,
EPA is including in this proposal changes in a number of areas of the PCB regulations that were not addressed in the ANPRM.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters submitted information concerning the toxicity of PCBs and the methods used by EPA to determine
exposure to PCBs. EPA is currently conducting a review of the toxicity and mechanisms of action associated with PCBs
and several structurally related chemicals. This review may not be complete until after the promulgation of these
amendments. Since EPA cannot predict the outcome of the toxicity review and does not want to delay the promulgation
of these rules, it is proposing flexibility in certain disposal regulations to allow for changes in EPA's position
on PCB toxicity. In a similar fashion, EPA is proposing flexibility in certain disposal regulations to allow site-specific
exposure data and changes in EPA's risk assessment methods to serve as the basis for making a determination regarding
the selection of acceptable disposal technologies for certain PCB wastes.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 6, 1990, EPA issued a proposed rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (``Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Wet Weight/Dry Weight Clarification, 55 FR 12866) to amend a portion of the PCB regulations
codified at 40 CFR 761.1(b) that addresses the analysis of PCBs on a dry weight basis. The comment period for the April
6, 1990 proposal ended on May 7, 1990. Comments on that proposal were received from 16 respondents. In today's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA is issuing a reproposal of the wet weight/dry weight rule. All comments received on the April 6, 1990 proposal
were considered in the preparation of this proposed rule, and those comments are included in the rulemaking record
for this proposed rulemaking. The comments received for the April 6, 1990 proposal and any comments received on this
proposed rule will be considered in the final rule. Today's reproposal would clarify the requirements for determining
PCB concentrations in liquids, non-liquids, and multiphasic combinations of liquids and non-liquids (see unit
III. M. of this preamble).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On May 18, 1993, EPA announced a draft strategy to address waste minimization and combustion of hazardous waste under
RCRA. The strategy is designed to stimulate a broad national dialogue on how: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) To better integrate waste minimization into EPA's hazardous waste management program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (2) To determine the appropriate role of combustion in that program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (3) To ensure that hazardous waste combustion standards are fully protective of human health and the environment.
The draft strategy sets forth a series of short- and long-term activities that EPA would undertake in pursuing these
three areas, among which are rulemakings to address technical standards for hazardous waste combustion and public
participation in the RCRA permitting process. The draft strategy also sets forth EPA's intention to use RCRA's case-by-case
omnibus permitting authority where necessary to protect health and the environment, and to impose upgraded permit
conditions in newly issued permits. In addition to other potential areas, these permit conditions may address emissions
of dioxins, furans, and particulate matter. Finally, the draft strategy announced EPA's intentions over the succeeding
18 months to give permitting priority to existing, operating RCRA combustion units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PCB program under TSCA is different from RCRA in several aspects. The manufacture of PCBs is generally banned,
and the use of PCBs is heavily restricted. Therefore, any disposal issues are limited to a finite, although widely
dispersed, universe. The PCB program mandates the burning of certain high-risk wastes. It also allows wastes, such
as low concentration liquids and drained transformer carcasses, with a lower potential risk of exposure, to be disposed
of in other types of combustion units (e.g., industrial boilers) to provide disposal capacity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA proposes to make the following adjustments in the PCB disposal program under TSCA in response to issues raised
in the combustion strategy. For fixed-site incinerators, approval conditions (for new units or at the time of renewal)
would be adjusted to reflect new standards and procedural requirements adopted under RCRA. For mobile incinerators,
approval conditions (for new units or at the time of renewal) would be adjusted to reflect new standards and procedural
requirements adopted under RCRA where applicable. Unique to the PCB disposal program under TSCA is the concept of
mobile incinerators. A single multi-year approval, that imposes the same technical standards applicable to fixed-site
incinerators, is issued to these units. State and local governments receive prior notification and can impose additional
restrictions on the mobile units using their own authorities. The TSCA approval generally limits the operating time
at any one site unless additional assessment of risk and public notice are conducted. However, EPA has not adopted
site-specific risk assessments and public participation in the permit development process for mobile incinerators
because EPA and the public would lose the considerable benefits derived from mobile disposal units considering these
units allow only minimal exposure due to their high destruction efficiency and limited operating time at each site.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current industrial boiler rules at 40 CFR 761.60(a)(2)(iii) and 761.60(a)(3)(iii) and industrial furnace rules,
proposed at 761.60(a)(4), limit both the concentration and volume of PCBs which can be treated in these units. Industrial
boilers and furnaces are units that were built to perform other functions such as power generation or materials recycling,
with the combustion of PCBs and hazardous wastes as a secondary function. The primary function poses a separate risk
which should be considered when addressing the overall risk posed by the combustion of low concentration, low volume
PCBs in industrial boilers and furnaces. Therefore, EPA proposes to impose uniform technology-based standards,
instead of site-specific permit conditions, on industrial boilers and furnaces due to the low risk posed from the
combustion of low concentration, low volume PCBs and because these units are constructed and operated for other purposes.
EPA specifically requests comment on how best to implement the combustion strategy given the controls already imposed,
or proposed in this rulemaking on the quantities and concentrations of PCBs which can be disposed of in industrial
boilers and furnaces. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that the regulations that currently apply to PCBs, along with those proposed, are sufficient under TSCA
to protect the public and the environment from unreasonable risk of injury. Although EPA's May 18, 1993, draft strategy
on waste minimization and combustion of waste extends only to RCRA hazardous wastes, its overall objectives were
carefully considered in the development of this proposed rule. EPA requests comment on its overall plan for implementing
the Agency's combustion strategy for the PCB program under TSCA.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
PCBs are regulated under several statutes administered by EPA. In particular, PCBs are subject to the corrective
action provisions of RCRA. In an effort to harmonize standards for the cleanup of PCBs under both RCRA and TSCA, EPA
is today proposing cleanup programs under both statutes for comparison and comment. The Agency's goal is to harmonize
action levels for PCBs under RCRA with the target standards for approval of risk-based remediation actions under
proposed 761.61(c). (See Unit II.A.7. for the RCRA proposal.)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The TSCA portion of this proposed rule is issued pursuant to sections 6(e)(1), 6(e)(2)(B), 6(e)(3)(B) and 18(b) of
TSCA. Section 6(e)(1)(A) gives EPA the authority to promulgate rules prescribing the methods for the disposal of
PCBs (15 U.S.C. 2605(e)(1)(A)). TSCA section 6(e)(1)(B) provides broad authority for EPA to promulgate rules that
would require PCBs to be marked with clear and adequate warnings (15 U.S.C. 2605(e)(1)(B)). TSCA section 6(e)(2)(B)
gives EPA the authority to authorize the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, and use of PCBs in other
than a totally enclosed manner (15 U.S.C. 2605(e)(2)(B)). TSCA section 6(e)(3)(B) provides that any person may petition
EPA for an exemption from the prohibition on the manufacture, processing, and distribution in commerce of PCBs (15
U.S.C. 2605(e)(3)(B)). EPA may by rule grant an exemption if the Administrator finds that: ``(i) an unreasonable
risk of injury to health or the environment would not result, and (ii) good faith efforts have been made to develop a
chemical substance which does not present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment and which may
be substituted for such polychlorinated biphenyl.'' TSCA section 18(b) gives EPA the authority to exempt, by rule,
any State from subsection (a)(2) (15 U.S.C. 2617(b)). EPA may by rule grant a State the authority to, among other things,
regulate any aspect of PCBs in use, such as requiring a notification of that use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The RCRA portion of this rule (discussed in Unit II.A.7. of this preamble) is issued pursuant to sections 1006, 2002(a),
3004(u), 3004(v), 3005(c) and 3007 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery
Act, as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (42 U.S.C. 6924).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistent with these authorities described in Unit I.E., EPA is proposing a number of modifications to the PCB disposal
rules to provide flexibility in addressing the disposal of PCBs where specific conditions would allow for different
waste management activities than are currently available under the regulations, while still providing protection
from unreasonable risk of injury. EPA is also proposing modifications to the disposal regulations that would allow
for the recognition of PCB waste management activities undertaken under other Federal or State authorities. Furthermore,
EPA is proposing a number of changes to the regulations to delete out-of-date provisions, modify the regulations
to address problems in their applicability or implementation, make certain policies and provisions consistent
with the requirements of other Federal statutes, and reduce requirements for PCB disposal activities which present
a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 risk. Finally, EPA is proposing certain authorizations and exemptions which would address the need for the scientific
community to conduct research as well as health and environmental studies on PCBs and on media contaminated by PCBs
(to include processing and distribution in commerce of PCBs) for the development of innovative disposal technologies
which otherwise would require issuance of a disposal approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The topics to be addressed through this proposed rulemaking include the 16 issues identified in the ANPRM plus a number
of additional issues that have either come to the Agency's attention through the submission of comments or from experience
in implementing the PCB Notification and Manifesting Rule (40 CFR part 761 subparts A, D, J, and K) published in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of December 21, 1989 (54 FR 52716). Several changes to the PCB regulations proposed today are in support of EPA's effort
to significantly reduce the risk of release to the environment posed by PCBs still in use. The provisions affected
include the 1&hyph;year time limit for storage and disposal, State enhancement provisions, restrictions on storage
for reuse, decontamination, and the previously proposed changes to transformer reclassification procedures (58
FR 60970, November 18, 1993). EPA's efforts to promote the phase-out of PCBs still in use, especially those in electrical
equipment, go beyond changes in the PCB rules. They include contemplated changes to various compliance monitoring
and enforcement strategies and policies, a greater effort to inform the regulated community of the Agency's position
on PCBs still in use, and expanded cooperation with other Federal and State agencies and departments. EPA is also proposing
a definition at 761.3 of the term ``PCB-Contaminated'' that would apply across the PCB program. PCB-Contaminated
would mean anything that contains or contacts PCBs at concentrations of 50 parts per million (ppm) to less than 500
parts per million (ppm). In the event that no PCB liquids or non-liquids are present on surfaces for measurement, then
surfaces with PCB concentrations greater than 10 micrograms per 100 square centimeters (>10

) and less than 100 micrograms per 100 square centimeters (

), would be defined as PCB-Contaminated. EPA would also apply the term ``PCB-Contaminated'' to classes of PCBs or
PCB Items meeting the levels of contamination specified in the definition.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The current PCB regulations generally establish a concentration of 50 parts per million (ppm) as the regulatory threshold
for authorized PCBs in use (i.e., in service). This was based, in part, on the economic impact of the regulations on
electrical transformers, but 50 ppm has been extended to include all authorized PCBs and PCB Articles, as defined
in these proposed rules at 761.3, unless otherwise noted (e.g., PCB concentration of less than 50 ppm resulting from
dilution). Where liquid samples could not be collected, such as on contaminated surfaces, surface sampling and concentration
levels were developed (see part 761, subpart G, The PCB Spill Cleanup Policy). The surface concentrations, which
were based on dermal exposure, were equated to the existing PCB regulations which included economic considerations.
As a result, the regulations established for PCBs at concentrations of 50 to less than 500 ppm were applied to contaminated
surfaces at concentrations of greater than 10 to less than 100 micrograms per 100 square centimeters (>10 &hyph;

). The regulations that EPA is proposing, in several sections of this notice, codify the relationship between surface
contamination and the existing regulations based on milligrams of PCBs per liter of liquid on a dry weight basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the ANPRM, EPA requested comments on the effectiveness of the current PCB regulations in preventing an unreasonable
risk of injury to health and the environment from the disposal of ``large volume, non-liquid PCB wastes'' such as wastes
from the shredding of automobiles, white goods, and industrial scrap, and certain classes of soils, sludges, and
sediments. Currently, large volume wastes derived from an authorized original source containing 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
50 ppm PCBs may only be disposed of in an incinerator that complies with 40 CFR 761.70, in a chemical waste landfill that
complies with 40 CFR 761.75, or pursuant to an approved alternate method of destruction equivalent to incineration
at 40 CFR 761.60(e), regardless of their current PCB concentration or the risk of exposure they may pose. The Agency
believes that there are additional disposal methods and other waste management techniques for large volume wastes
that would not pose an unreasonable risk of injury to health and the environment. These additional disposal methods
and other waste management techniques are the subject of this section of today's proposed rule. For different kinds
of large volume waste, such as soils, liquids, and surfaces contaminated with PCBs, EPA is proposing several self-implementing
disposal options at 761.61, 761.62 and 761.79. If followed exactly as written, the self-implementing disposal options
would not require prior approval from EPA. These options are detailed and specific. The sampling portions of the self-implementing
procedures appear in Appendices I-III. Placement of the proposed sampling procedures in appendices is intended
to provide better continuity and should facilitate understanding of the overall self-implementing procedures
of which they are a part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``large volume'' is used to describe wastes that, in general, are generated or managed in greater volumes
than when they were originally placed in service. Large volume wastes would include dredged materials, contaminated
environmental media, municipal sewage treatment sludges, industrial waste water treatment sludges, auto shredder
waste, demolition wastes, and specifically listed materials containing PCBs that may not be authorized for use,
such as PCB impregnated insulation or gaskets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Large volume PCB wastes would not include wastes that are PCB Items, PCB Articles, and PCB liquids being removed from
service. PCB liquids include, but are not limited to, dielectric fluid and solvents used to flush PCB Transformers
prior to landfilling (GE Solvent Distillation Case [Docket No. TSCA-IV-890016]). Large volume PCB wastes would
not include the more traditional PCB wastes which are typically generated and managed in discrete, relatively small
volumes associated with individual pieces of electrical, mechanical, heat transfer, or other equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Large volume PCB wastes are frequently heterogenous in nature and contaminated with low (i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
&lt;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
50 ppm) or varying levels of PCBs and other constituents. Although these wastes may now pose little environmental
risk, under the current PCB regulations, they are usually required to be disposed of, based on their original PCB concentration,
in either a TSCA chemical waste landfill or TSCA incinerator. Second, as the name of the category implies, ``large
volume'' wastes may be generated each year in enormous amounts. However, the actual magnitude of the problem is not
well documented. EPA requested information about historic PCB disposal sites, including areas of major or longterm
spills (46 FR 22144, April 15, 1981) and included these data in its listing of sites known as the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act Information System or CERCLIS. While EPA does not have information characterizing
every site where PCBs were spilled or disposed of, the Agency does have estimates of the number of sites contaminated
with PCBs. In 1991, EPA's Office of Emergency and Remedial Response completed a characterization of 1,218 sites associated
with the National Priorities List (NPL) and 29,461 sites associated with CERCLIS. At approximately 20 percent of
the NPL sites and approximately 7 percent of the CERCLIS sites, PCBs were characterized as a ``predominant'' waste
type. The NPL sites alone contain approximately 34,070,000 cubic yards of material contaminated with PCBs and other
substances. Similarly, the weight of shredder waste produced annually by metal recyclers is approximately 3 million
tons. Commercial disposal costs of these types of large volume wastes at PCB incinerators or landfills have been as
high as $2,300 per cubic yard for incineration, and $550 per cubic yard for chemical waste landfilling. Based on this
information concerning large volume PCB waste generation, the number of old PCB disposal sites, and the cost of disposal,
EPA believes that it is appropriate to commence rulemaking to address the management and disposal of large volume
PCB wastes and propose alternatives to the current available disposal options. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, for PCB remediation wastes, EPA is proposing to allow alternatives to the regulatory mandate that PCB
wastes must be managed based on the requirements for disposal at the time the contaminating PCBs came out of service
(i.e., based on the original PCB concentration of the material (see unit II.A.4. of this preamble). The remediation
requirements proposed in 761.61(a) address indirect exposure issues by limiting the applicability of the section
to environmental settings which are less likely to allow migration and therefore should be easier to characterize
and remediate. All other environmental settings are addressed under the proposed ``risk-based'' option (761.61(c))
where EPA could require a site-specific indirect exposure as well as direct exposure risk assessment. As a point of
clarification, since spills result in an illegal release of PCBs to the environment, only those wastes cleaned up
and disposed of in accordance with the PCB Spill Cleanup Policy (40 CFR part 761, subpart G) will be entitled to the presumption
against enforcement of a disposal violation for that spill. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PCB non-remediation wastes (Unit II.A.6. of this preamble provides further discussion) are often found in large
volumes and in a physical state that tends to limit the mobility of the PCBs (e.g., PCBs used as a plasticizer). In this
instance, EPA is recognizing the reduced risk of direct or indirect exposure and the overall volume of this category
of waste when it considers additional options for disposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Elsewhere in today's notice, EPA is also reproposing a process for determining the concentration of PCBs in a multiphasic
media such as sludges or sediments (see Unit III. M. of this preamble). EPA would require that this process be followed
by those using the provisions established for the disposal of large volume wastes and, in general, for determining
the concentration of PCBs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Anti-dilution.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The current rule at 40 CFR 761.1(b), commonly known as the ``anti-dilution'' rule, prohibits the avoidance of specific
disposal requirements because a PCB concentration was reduced or shifted from one material or environmental medium
to another as the result of adding a diluent, or separating or concentrating the PCBs. This provision remains in effect.
EPA is not promoting intentional or fortuitous dilution in either its rules or enforcement policies. However, EPA
is proposing greater flexibility in choosing a disposal option for this category of large volume PCB wastes. EPA remains
committed to a policy of stringent regulation of the disposal of PCB wastes. EPA is simply recognizing that where PCBs
have already been released into the environment the critical disposal issue becomes one of mitigating the damage
from the release, especially those aspects of indirect exposure such as bioaccumulation.

 Status of pre-1978 disposal.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters asked for clarification of the rules under TSCA governing the regulatory status and remediation
of PCB spills and disposal sites in light of the ruling by EPA's Chief Judicial Officer in Re: Standard Scrap Metal Company,
TSCA-V-C-288, Appeal No. 87&hyph;4, August 2, 1990 (Standard Scrap). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Chief Judicial Officer (CJO) held that spilled PCBs found in soil are not necessarily in a ``disposal site'' for
purposes of the prefatory note exclusion to 761.60. ``Soil does not become a disposal site merely because PCBs are
spilled onto it'' (CJO's ruling page 13, paragraph 1). In this decision, the CJO limited the effect of the prefatory
note to pre-1978 landfills or dumps, i.e., only those PCBs disposed in landfills and dumps may be considered ``in-service''
and do not require proper disposal according to 40 CFR part 761, subpart D. EPA is proposing to delete the prefatory
note to 761.60, which states that PCBs disposed of prior to the effective date of the regulations were considered to
be ``in use'' and therefore did not need to be cleaned up under these rules, and substitute language on the disposition
of PCB waste disposed of before 1978 as introductory text to this section. Under the proposed rule, PCBs disposed of,
placed in a land disposal facility (such as a dump, landfill, waste pile, or land treatment unit) or PCBs spilled or
otherwise released to the environment, including areas contaminated by spills and releases such as sediments, prior
to April 18, 1978, would be presumed to be disposed of in a manner that does not present a risk of exposure, and would not
necessarily require further disposal action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed provision would allow the Regional Administrator, on a case-by-case basis, to make a finding that any
pre-1978 disposal site does present a risk of exposure, whether the site be a spill, dump, land treatment unit, waste
pile, stream, river, pond, lake, any sediment (or dredge material from a stream, river, pond, or lake), ground water,
surface water, landfill, or any other type of disposal site. In such a case, the Regional Administrator could then
require the submission of an application for approval of a risk-based disposal method under proposed 761.61(c) (see
Unit II.A.4. of this preamble). Failure to submit a complete application, in the timeframe stipulated in the Regional
Administrator's ``call-in'' letter, would be a violation, and the violations would accrue from that day forward.
EPA believes that pre-1978 PCB disposal units or areas of contamination should not be allowed to remain ``in-service''
and thus unaddressed, as the existing prefatory note currently allows, if there is a risk of exposure from these sites.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sites that could be considered an immediate exposure risk include, but are not limited to, school yards, food or feed
areas, residential areas, underground or surface waters, well head protection areas, and certain stream, river,
or lake sediments. In such cases where the Regional Administrator has made a determination that there is a risk of exposure,
the site would have to be cleaned up, based on the exposure risk finding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, in the introductory paragraph at 761.60, EPA is proposing to add language to instruct those whose waste is subject
to the disposal provisions of subpart D to refer back to both the authorizations section at 761.30 and the prohibitions
section at 761.20 and to coordinate their disposal activities with other agencies where appropriate for all PCB wastes.
It is important for members of the regulated community to be cognizant of the fact that the disposal options in subpart
D hinge on certain prohibitions as well as authorizations. For example, not all PCB Items would be required to be disposed
of. Some items, such as natural gas pipelines containing PCBs, if properly decontaminated, could be reused. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many other Federal, State, and local laws and regulations apply to the disposal of PCBs. Although EPA attempts to coordinate
with the various Federal, State, and local programs controlling PCBs, the ultimate responsibility for coordination
and compliance rests with the regulated community.

 On June 10, 1991, EPA also published a notice of availability of a draft guidance document outlining several alternative
methods of treatment for certain classes of media containing PCBs (56 FR 26745). That document is entitled ``Interim
Guidance on Non-Liquid PCB Disposal Methods to be Used as Alternatives to a 40 CFR 761.75 Chemical Waste Landfill (CWL).''
Generally, commenters to the ANPRM who addressed the issue of alternative methods of treatment and commenters to
the draft interim guidance, stated that a wider range of options would not only provide much needed disposal flexibility,
but would provide an incentive for developing alternative methods of PCB disposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to these comments, the proposed rule at 761.61(c) would authorize the Regional Administrator, based
on a site-specific risk assessment, to approve an application for different cleanup and disposal requirements provided
that they would not pose an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment. The wide range of different methods
of disposal that could be approved by the Regional Administrator upon application include thermal destruction such
as infrared thermal treatment or circulating bed combustor; physical separation such as thermal treatment (rotary
thermal desorber and fluidized bed) and solvent extraction (soil washing and liquified gas); solidification/stabilization
such as chemical fixation (encapsulation,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 vitrification; biological treatment; and chemical dechlorination. These are not the only treatment methods that
could be approved by the Regional Administrator upon application; but are the methods currently being used with varying
degrees of success. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters suggested several potentially viable alternatives for the disposal of large volume PCB wastes, some
of which were not listed in the draft alternative disposal document that accompanied the June 10, 1991, publication
of the ANPRM. As indicated in this proposed rule, upon application to the Regional Administrator, each proposed option
would be considered on a case-by-case basis. Some commenters suggested that the need to obtain a disposal permit was
an impediment to developing and utilizing alternative methods of destruction and containment. EPA's position is
that adequate controls must be imposed to ensure the safety of all disposal technologies, especially those being
operated on a commercial scale. EPA does, however, anticipate that as individual or combinations of technologies
are used repeatedly, the permitting process will become streamlined. Once out of the research and development (R&amp;D)
phase, new technologies will receive the same level of scrutiny as those already fully developed to ensure adequate
environmental controls of specific technologies. In certain instances, specific standards, technologies, or
procedures could also be promulgated in future rulemakings as additional decontamination activities at 761.79
or added to the self-implementing remediation techniques in 761.61(a) (see Unit II.A.3. of this preamble).

Proposed remediation strategy for PCBs, including cleanup under the RCRA corrective action and CERCLA remedial
programs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The 1987 TSCA PCB Spill Cleanup Policy, published on April 2, 1987 (52 FR 10688), codified at part 761, subpart G, applied
only to certain releases of PCBs occurring after May 4, 1987. Thus, other spills of PCBs (i.e., most notably those which
occurred prior to May 4, 1987), were not intended to be subject to the provisions of the Policy. The issue of whether
the Agency should develop a cleanup policy for historic PCB spills, and how such a policy might differ from the existing
policy for new spills, was addressed in the ANPRM. In response to this discussion, several commenters on the ANPRM
strongly supported the idea of developing an EPA policy on historic PCB spills. Those commenters suggested that such
a policy could achieve considerable benefits at historic PCB spill sites, similar to those that have been obtained
for new PCB spills under the 1987 policy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of these comments, and in consideration of the Agency's experience with implementing the 1987 cleanup policy
for new spills, EPA is today proposing a strategy under TSCA for cleanup of all PCBs in the environment. The following
preamble also discusses how PCBs would be addressed under the remedial authorities of RCRA and CERCLA. In addition,
EPA is today proposing to clarify the concentration level for soil contaminated with PCBs that was identified as an
``action level'' in the proposed RCRA Corrective Action Regulations (55 FR 30798, July 27, 1990).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Background.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As part of the development of the 1987 TSCA PCB Spill Cleanup Policy, EPA evaluated the frequency, amount, and nature
of PCB spills from electrical equipment, the different routes of exposure to PCBs (i.e., ingestion, dermal, and inhalation),
the risks posed by spills in different locations, and the costs of cleanup. After evaluating this information and
considering a spill cleanup proposal submitted to EPA by the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), the Natural Resources
Defense Council (NRDC), the Edison Electric Institute (EEI), the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA), and
the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA), EPA developed cleanup goals for PCBs in soil and on surfaces.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The TSCA PCB Spill Cleanup Policy requires cleanup of PCBs to different levels depending upon spill location, the
potential for exposure to residual PCBs remaining after cleanup, the concentration of PCBs initially spilled (high
concentration or low), and the nature and size of the population potentially at risk of exposure to residual PCBs.
Thus, the TSCA PCB Spill Cleanup Policy applies the most stringent requirements for PCB spill cleanup to non-restricted
access areas where there is a greater potential for human exposures to spilled PCBs. The TSCA PCB Spill Cleanup Policy
applies less stringent requirements for cleanup of PCB spills in restricted access areas where the nature and degree
of human contact present a lower potential for significant exposure. Finally, even less stringent requirements
apply to restricted access areas where there is little potential for human exposures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implementation of the 1987 TSCA PCB Spill Cleanup Policy has, in EPA's estimation, yielded highly favorable environmental
results. Large numbers of PCB spills have been cleaned up expeditiously and safely with minimum administrative burdens
to regulatory agencies or responsible parties. This success is in large part attributable to the self-implementing
nature of the policy; the clear, numeric cleanup goals specified in the policy; and the straightforward sampling
and notification procedures required of those responding to PCB spills. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the 1987 policy was intended to be applicable to ``new'' spills of PCBs, the policy has also been used in the
cleanup of historic spills, particularly in the context of CERCLA remediations. As discussed below, since 1990 the
Superfund program has adopted an approach to cleanup of PCBs that relies heavily on the 1987 TSCA policy. Although
the CERCLA (and RCRA) remedial process generates large volumes of site-specific information that can be used to ``fine
tune'' cleanup decisions for PCBs, as well as other hazardous substances, it has been the Agency's experience that
the essential features of the 1987 TSCA policy are workable and yield protective cleanup results for historic spills
of PCBs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following discussion summarizes the approach that the CERCLA program has taken in adapting the 1987 PCB Spill
Cleanup Policy to Superfund cleanups. It also outlines a similar proposed approach for the RCRA corrective action
program.

 CERCLA program policy for cleanup of PCBs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Because the TSCA PCB Spill Cleanup Policy is not a binding regulation, it is not a potentially applicable or relevant
and appropriate requirement (i.e., an ARAR) for Superfund response actions. However, as a codified policy reflecting
substantial scientific and technical evaluation, it has been considered as important guidance in developing cleanup
levels at Superfund sites. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In August 1990, EPA issued several CERCLA guidance documents regarding remediation of PCBs at Superfund sites. Among
other provisions, these guidance documents establish guidelines for the CERCLA Program to follow in setting preliminary
remediation goals for PCBs for soil, ground water, and sediment contaminated with PCBs at Superfund sites. (See ``A
Guide on Remedial Actions at Superfund Sites with PCB Contamination'', OSWER Directive No. 9355.4&hyph;01 FS (August
1990) [``PCB Guide''].) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Preliminary remediation goals (PRGs) in the Superfund program are specific statements of the desired endpoint concentrations
of contaminants, or risk levels for each exposure route, that are believed to provide adequate protection of health
and the environment based on preliminary site information. (See preamble to the National Contingency Plan (NCP),
55 FR 8666, 8712 and 8713 (March 8, 1992).) These goals are also used in setting parameters for the purpose of developing
remedial alternatives. Because PRGs are formulated early in the remedial evaluation process, they are typically
based on readily available information, such as environmental or health-based ARAR's other reliable guidance or
information, commonly referred to in the CERCLA program as To Be Considered or (TBCs), or the ``point of departure''
risk level of 10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
-6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. As additional information becomes available during the Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) process,
the PRGs may be modified due to consideration of exposure, technical, or other factors (55 FR 8713 and 8717). The use
of PRGs does not preclude development and consideration or selection for alternatives that attain risk levels other
than those represented by the PRG. Final selection of the appropriate level of risk is made based on the balancing of
criteria in the remedy selection step of the process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Along the same lines, the 1990 CERCLA PCB guidance documents explain that exceedance of a PRG for PCBs does not mean
that action is required. Rather, once the CERCLA program decides that action is necessary at a site, the PRGs for PCBs
should be used to identify areas at which response action should be considered. ``These goals may be refined throughout
the RI/FS process; final remediation goals are determined in the remedy selection.'' (PCB Guide, p.2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the CERCLA PCB guidance, the concentration of concern for PCBs in soil differs depending on the type of
exposure that is expected (e.g. residential or industrial) The guidance documents point out that site-specific
conditions may warrant departure from the basic framework outlined in the guidance, due to factors such as the potential
for PCBs to migrate to groundwater and to affect environmental receptors. The guidance recommends that in most cases,
the preliminary remediation goals (or ``analytical starting points'' for setting remedial levels) for PCBs in soil
under CERCLA are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The TSCA PCB Spill Policy at 761.120, recommends PCB spills be cleaned up to the following levels: For current and reasonably-expected
future residential and other non-restricted access areas: less than 1 ppm on the surface to a depth of 10 inches and
10 ppm at depths below 10 inches; for industrial and other restricted access areas: 25 ppm; and for outdoor electrical
substations: 25 ppm, or 50 ppm with labelling warning of presence of PCBs (not expected at CERCLA sites). In the case
of remediation for residential, unrestricted land use at CERCLA sites, 1 ppm soil PCBs at the surface is recommended
by the Superfund program as a PRG to address threats posed by direct contact. Where soil with concentrations greater
than 1 ppm PCBs is left in place for residential land use, the depth of soil cover is determined by site-specific conditions.
In such cases, appropriate deed restrictions or other institutional controls are generally implemented.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In the July 27, 1990, proposed RCRA Corrective Action Rule, 55 FR 30798, EPA introduced the concept of ``action levels''
as trigger levels for further study and subsequent remediation at RCRA facilities. In the RCRA Corrective Action
Program, a remedial investigation may indicate that levels of contamination from a past release are unlikely to present
a threat to health and the environment. EPA proposed that measured levels in the environment be compared to action
levels, and that in situations where measured levels are below action levels, EPA would not normally require either
further study (i.e., a Corrective Measures Study) or remediation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the proposed RCRA Corrective Action Rule, EPA proposed using maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) promulgated under
the Safe Drinking Water Act as action levels for ground water. For other media (including soils) and for constituents
in ground water that do not have established MCLs, the following criteria were proposed for establishing action levels.
First, the concentration for a hazardous constituent must be derived in a manner consistent with Agency guidelines
for risk assessment. Second, the studies used to derive action levels must be scientifically valid. Third, the concentrations
used as action levels would be (for carcinogens) associated with a 1

 risk level for Class C carcinogens. For systemic toxicants, the action level would be a concentration to which humans
could be exposed on a daily basis without appreciable risk of adverse effects during a lifetime. The exposure scenario
used for calculating the action levels was direct contact (i.e., ingestion), assuming residential land use. EPA's
proposal included in 264.521(d) a separate provision establishing criteria for establishing action levels for
soil, assuming exposure through consumption of the soil contaminated with a hazardous constituent. However, EPA
proposed to make an exception to this approach where EPA has already established standards for remediation of spilled
PCBs under the TSCA PCB Spill Cleanup Policy. In the preamble, EPA explained that the Agency had determined that the
standards in the TSCA PCB Spill Cleanup Policy should be used as action levels and cleanup standards for soil in RCRA
corrective actions (55 FR 30819). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed Appendix A, to part 264, subpart S, provided examples of concentration levels that meet the above criteria
for action levels for more than 150 hazardous constituents. However, EPA erred in setting out the concentration level
for PCBs in soil in Appendix A (55 FR 30867). EPA had intended to list 1 ppm, the cleanup goal recommended by the TSCA PCB
Spill Cleanup Policy for residential land use, as the action level for PCBs. Instead the action level listed in Appendix
A for PCBs in soil was 0.09 ppm. EPA is requesting comment on correcting this erroneous listing. EPA believes that adding
the following clarifying language to the end of 264.521(d): ``Action levels for PCBs in soils shall be defined as 1
ppm consistent with the TSCA PCB Spill Cleanup Policy at part 761 subpart G,'' would correct the error.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that it is appropriate to adopt the TSCA 1 ppm level for PCBs as the action level for use under the RCRA corrective
action program. As previously discussed, 1 ppm is the cleanup goal recommended by the PCB Spill Cleanup Policy for
residential land use. Thus, the TSCA spill cleanup level is approximately one order of magnitude greater than the
action level identified in the subpart S preamble. However, the Agency believes that adopting the 1 ppm level for RCRA
may be appropriate, for several reasons. For one thing, the 1 ppm TSCA level is based on the same residential land use
scenario and essentially the same exposure assumptions used in deriving the RCRA action levels. It also represents
the same general ``conservativeness'' as an action level, in that it equates to a 10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
-5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 excess lifetime cancer risk. In addition, the TSCA level was developed based on substantial studies conducted by
the Agency that focused specifically on the risks posed by PCBs, as well as other relevant factors relating to cleanup
of PCBs. Finally, 1 ppm is close to the analytical detection limit for soil, whereas the action level of 0.09 ppm identified
in the subpart S proposal may often be below detection limits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency recognizes that adopting the TSCA 1 ppm level as an action level under RCRA would depart somewhat from how
other soil action levels are set. It would be a level established under another regulatory program and, as such, may
reflect certain factors that were not otherwise considered in developing the action level concept under RCRA. On
the other hand, adopting the TSCA level for soils would be very much analogous to using MCLs as action levels for ground
water as discussed in the July 27, 1990 proposal (see 55 FR 30819 and 30853). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should also be noted that adopting the 1 ppm action level for PCBs requires certain explicit revisions to the proposed
subpart S regulations. Specifically, as discussed above, the proposed criteria for soil action levels that were
specified in proposed 264.521(d) would need to be revised to explicitly identify the 1 ppm level for PCBs. In addition,
Appendix A to part 264 subpart S would require an amendment to identify the new PCB action level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency solicits comment on today's proposal for adopting 1 ppm as the action level for PCBs in soil for the purpose
of implementing corrective actions at RCRA regulated facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the PCB Spill Cleanup Policy identifies other numbers that are generally appropriate for certain land use
settings, the Agency believes that these levels are inappropriate for use as action levels, because they may often
require substantial site-specific information and determinations by the Agency about current and future land use
and exposure potential. This is inconsistent with the action level concept, which requires identifying conservative,
presumptive levels that can be established without this type of site-specific information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the Agency believes that many of the provisions of the PCB Spill Cleanup Policy may be appropriate in making
decisions regarding cleanup levels in the context of RCRA corrective action. In the preamble to the proposed subpart
S regulations, EPA stated that the cleanup levels and practices in the PCB Spill Cleanup Policy would generally be
appropriate for use in addressing PCB releases under RCRA corrective actions. The Agency wishes to reaffirm its intention
to use the 1987 spill policy as guidance for cleanup of PCBs in the corrective action program in essentially the same
manner as has been identified in the Superfund guidance discussed above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should be noted that the Superfund guidance on PCBs focused primarily on the use of the PCB Spill Cleanup Policy in
establishing preliminary remediation goals, or PRGs. The subpart S proposal did not provide an explicit regulatory
framework for setting PRGs during the corrective action process; however, the preamble to the proposal did acknowledge
that establishing such preliminary cleanup goals may often be appropriate in a RCRA context. The Agency may address
this issue more thoroughly in subsequent RCRA rulemakings. In any case, EPA intends to use the general approach outlined
in the Superfund PCB guidance in establishing preliminary cleanup goals (when appropriate), as well as ``final''
cleanup levels for PCB contamination at RCRA facilities. As explained in the CERCLA guidance, the levels specified
in the TSCA PCB Spill Cleanup Policy would generally be examined in light of site-specific information, and that the
Agency would preserve the flexibility inherent in the subpart S provisions for establishing cleanup standards,
to select a cleanup level for PCBs that may depart from the TSCA PCB Spill Cleanup Policy, when appropriate. (See proposed
264.525(d), 55 FR 30877, July 27, 1990.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency solicits comment on the concept, as outlined above, of using the TSCA PCB Spill Cleanup Policy as general
guidance for establishing cleanup levels under RCRA corrective action authorities. The Agency also solicits comment
on specific provisions of the TSCA PCB Spill Cleanup Policy for which it may be appropriate to modify or supplement
for use in establishing cleanup levels under RCRA.

 Today's proposed remediation strategy for PCB spills under TSCA.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is today proposing a new strategy under TSCA for cleanup of all PCBs in the environment that is closely modeled after
the 1987 TSCA PCB Spill Cleanup Policy for new PCB spills from electrical equipment. The Agency believes that adopting
such a strategy is warranted, for several reasons. EPA's experience with PCB cleanups under CERCLA has shown that
the general approach and the specific cleanup goals expressed in the 1987 Policy are generally appropriate for cleanup
of PCBs not directly addressed under the policy, as long as flexibility is provided for factoring site-specific conditions
into final cleanup decisions. In addition, cleanup of PCBs not directly addressed currently under the policy must
be addressed under TSCA on a case-by-case basis, with oversight of the cleanup action by EPA Regions. This can require
considerable paperwork and lengthy negotiations between regulators and responsible parties over cleanup goals
and procedures at individual sites. Adopting a simpler, more uniform yet flexible strategy for cleanup of PCBs in
the environment under TSCA would thus serve to reduce administrative and other transactional costs and accelerate
the cleanup process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is not convinced that there is any compelling technical or environmental rationale for having several separate
and inconsistent methods for cleaning up PCB spills, based simply on when the spill occurred. Under TSCA, the new strategy
and administrative procedures propose to address the problem of PCBs in the environment through a flexible, tiered
approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing that PCBs disposed of, placed in a land disposal facility, spilled, or otherwise released into the
environment prior to April 18, 1978 would be presumed to be disposed of in a manner which does not present a risk of exposure
(i.e., the PCBs are presumed to be safely disposed of) unless EPA makes a finding that there is a risk of exposure (see
761.60 proposed revised introductory text in the codified portion of this document). EPA could then require that
an application be submitted for approval of remediation and proper disposal of those PCB remediation wastes under
the proposed 761.61(c). All other PCB remediation wastes would be addressed by one of several alternatives proposed
today. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In certain scenarios PCBs could be remediated to specified levels and treated under the self-implementing provisions
proposed at 761.61(a). This activity would be conducted with a minimum of interaction between EPA and the party conducting
the remediation, but it would require that the specified conditions be followed without variance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any PCB remediation waste could be cleaned up under the risk-based provisions proposed at 761.61(c). This new provision
would be harmonized with the RCRA and CERCLA programs. Any changes of the levels under RCRA and CERCLA would be reflected
in a change under TSCA in the target standards. While 761.61(c) would provide flexibility based on site-specific
assessment of the risks posed, it would also be the most resource intensive and time consuming to implement. All actions
addressing PCBs under Superfund would use 761.61(c) as the relevant requirement under TSCA thus providing the flexibility
necessary to implement site-specific remedial actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is also proposing to retain the traditional disposal options under proposed 761.61(b) for incineration, alternate
treatment technologies, and chemical waste landfilling. This section could be used where all PCB remediation waste
would be removed from the environment, or where remediation levels were established elsewhere in these rules. Section
761.61(b) could also be used where a mechanism such as a State established cleanup was recognized by EPA through a coordinated
approval under proposed 761.77, where a State had already established a site characterization and/or remediation
plan requiring off-site disposal in a facility with a TSCA disposal approval for PCBs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current TSCA PCB Spill Cleanup Policy would still be available to address recent spills from electrical equipment.
The party responsible for a spill which was eligible for cleanup under the spill policy would also have the option of
using one of the alternatives available under proposed 761.61 or 761.79 (Decontamination), where applicable. It
should be noted that, in accordance with the anti-dilution provisions of 761.1(b), if the contamination was from
an authorized use, then the PCB remediation waste is regulated based on the regulatory status of the PCBs at the time
of their release into the environment. The following illustrates this point. A transformer contains PCB dielectric
fluid at 1,000 ppm. The unit leaks its dielectric fluid, and all resulting PCB remediation waste is regulated, regardless
of concentration, because the original dielectric fluid was regulated at the time of the leak. However, if the same
PCB Transformer is first reclassified to non-PCB status (i.e., less than 50 ppm PCB in the dielectric fluid) and non-PCB
dielectric fluid leaks, none of the resulting remediation waste is regulated under TSCA (but not necessarily other
laws or regulations) because the dielectric fluid was unregulated at the time of the leak. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are two questions associated with any cleanup. The first question is to what level must contamination be cleaned
and the second question is what are the disposal requirements for the contaminated material. In general, the current
PCB rules address the disposal question by stating that PCBs diluted through acts such as spilling or processing for
disposal must be disposed of based on the disposal requirements for that PCB concentration at the time the PCBs came
out of service or were spilled. However, except for those scenarios addressed by the TSCA PCB Spill Cleanup Policy,
the current rules require complete removal of spilled or otherwise improperly disposed of PCBs. Most commenters
to the ANPRM were very supportive of the Agency's desire to amend the current rules to allow the management of remediation
wastes based on their current PCB concentrations and the site-specific risk from exposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters asked that EPA address the question of cleanup levels by establishing, in this rule, national
standards for specific exposure scenarios, with provisions for variances that would be binding, for remediation
of wastes containing PCBs for all Federal programs that would be preemptive of State and local requirements. These
commenters suggested that this approach could reduce the ``transactional'' costs associated with site-by-site
negotiations, promote voluntary remediation activities and, in general, speed the cleanup of sites. EPA has limited
authority under TSCA to preempt State or local requirements for the cleanup or disposal of PCB remediation wastes.
With regard to establishing uniform standards for specific exposure scenarios for the remediation of PCBs and other
hazardous substances or constituents, EPA has contemplated the following options: (a) Setting specific standards,
(b) using a uniform decision-making process with target standards, but allowing site-specific variances, or (c)
using a uniform decision-making process with a general goal and site-specific application. EPA believes that specific
standards are most appropriate when dealing with common disposal scenarios and limited disposal options. Favoring
site-specific approaches to remediate old spills is most appropriate when there is little commonality at the various
sites among the problems being addressed and the available disposal options. Except for the limited scenarios proposed
in 761.61(a), EPA does not believe that it has sufficient experience or information to establish additional self-implementing
cleanup and disposal options. EPA is seeking comments, supported by technical information from those engaged in
remedial actions; other Federal, State or local entities responsible for the implementation or oversight of remedial
actions; and the general public on all three approaches including the following proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several remedial approaches could be proposed for any given site which is contaminated with PCBs. In this section,
EPA is proposing three alternatives for the cleanup and disposal of PCB remediation waste under TSCA. The first alternative
would be self-implementing. The term self-implementing means that EPA approval under TSCA would not be necessary
as long as the entire remediation conformed to the procedures and standards of the first alternative at proposed 761.61(a).
The second alternative, performance-based disposal, is the use of ``traditional'' disposal technologies of incineration
and chemical waste landfilling, according to the approval process and standards as proposed at 761.61(b). The third
alternative, risk-based disposal, is a process and decision document not unlike the Superfund remedial action decision-making
process and record of decision (ROD). Each step would be approved by the Regional Administrator having jurisdiction
over the site which is contaminated with PCBs, including a risk assessment and any onsite treatment, or redisposition
of treated or untreated remediation waste at the site. Treatment levels would be based on a site-specific risk assessment
described at proposed 761.61(c). Those seeking a PCB disposal approval could also avail themselves of the ``Coordinated
Approval'' provision (see Unit III.K.1. of this preamble). This alternative would allow the recognition of a cleanup
action conducted under another authority such as a RCRA corrective action permit or in compliance with a CERCLA ROD
or enforcement decision document.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Self-implementing option.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The self-implementing alternative is patterned after the PCB Spill Cleanup Policy (40 CFR part 761, subpart G), which
sets standards for cleaning up spills shortly after they occur. Like the PCB Spill Cleanup Policy, this proposed alternative
requires that risk-based surface and soil levels be achieved. However, an important distinction between subpart
G and the proposed self-implementing alternative is that for non-recent spills, there may be limited information
concerning the concentration and amount of PCBs released to the environment and the time, nature, and extent of that
release and any subsequent migration. Subpart G established spill cleanup requirements addressing the concentration
and amount of spilled materials based on the location of the spill and potential exposure to the spilled PCBs. Spill
cleanup in this proposal is based on the current concentration in the material onto which a spill occurred. The extent
of migration of the spill is likely to be greater for an old spill than for a more recent or new spill. This difference
plus the requirement for rapid initiation and containment of the spill were partly responsible for the provision
at 40 CFR 761.135 which creates a presumption against an enforcement action for penalties for the act of illegal disposal.
While the self-implementing proposal allows disposal of remediation waste according to the waste's current existing
concentration, the proposal does not create a presumption against enforcement action for penalties for the act of
unauthorized disposal. Another significant difference from subpart G is that the self-implementing disposal requirements
would not apply to certain environmental and exposure scenarios having the potential for a high risk of exposure.
Subpart G allows certain residual levels to remain after cleanup based on the potential future use of the site, including
the imposition of physical or institutional restrictions limiting access, which could have been incorrectly assumed
to always directly correlate with exposure in those areas. Today's proposal addresses residual levels based not
only on access to areas, but also potential exposure to residual PCB levels within those areas. For example, a restricted
access commercial area might limit who could be exposed, but might not limit how much a person with access could be exposed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this proposal, concrete is not considered a non-porous surface as it is in subpart G (see the proposed definition
of ``non-porous surface'' at 761.3). Consequently, concrete containing PCBs would have to be removed rather than
just wiped off. The size of the remediation area is not an issue with today's self-implementing proposal as it is with
subpart G. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The self-implementing option differentiates between the cleanup of a site and the disposal of PCB remediation waste
from the site. Cleanup means the identification and reduction of the PCB concentrations, and/or removal of PCB remediation
waste to a specified residual PCB concentration at its existing location. The cleanup portion of this alternative
allows remediation waste with specified PCB levels to remain undisturbed at the site and not be disposed of. Cleanup
may be followed by either (or both) off-site disposal of a certain amount of PCB remediation waste, or treatment of
a certain amount of remediation waste at the site. Disposal means the movement of PCB remediation wastes from the site
of contamination to another location for destruction or containment (off-site disposal) or the destruction or containment
of PCB remediation waste at the cleanup site (on-site disposal). Section 761.61 would apply to the cleanup and disposal
of all PCB remediation wastes regardless of when the disposal, spill, or contamination occurred. Subpart G would
continue to apply to recent spills from electrical equipment; however, the party responsible for the spill and cleanup
could choose to follow 761.61. There are other conforming changes which could be made to 40 CFR part 761, subpart G,
resulting from this proposal. These changes have not been made because those who were a party to the negotiation of
subpart G have not been a direct party to the development of this proposal. Nevertheless, the conforming changes to
subpart G have been accounted for in this proposal and the proposal is consistent with the conforming changes, especially
with respect to references of ``old'' spills. Section 761.61 specifically applies to ``old'' spills. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The self-implementing remediation option proposes on-site disposal to specified cleanup levels of residual PCBs
in the PCB remediation waste. Cleanup levels would be more stringent for high exposure areas than for low exposure
areas, as these terms would be defined in 761.3. Three self-implementing on-site options are proposed: capping higher
residual levels (a definition of ``cap'' is proposed at 761.3), ``treating down'' from higher levels to lower levels
on-site using a non-chlorinated solvent washing process; and microencapsulation or vitrification (definitions
of these terms are proposed at 761.3). These last two immobilization technologies are being proposed because they
have been promulgated under RCRA for debris which is contaminated with both RCRA hazardous waste and TSCA PCB waste
(see 57 FR 37194 &hyph;37282, August 18, 1992). Based on EPA's experience with approving PCB disposal technologies,
the solvent washing process is the only currently available destruction or physical separation PCB disposal process
considered generally effective in a variety of situations, commercially feasible at ambient temperatures (i.e.,
no external heat source), and safe enough to be conducted without prior approval. EPA will consider these factors,
along with the general statutory requirement to prevent unreasonable risk of injury to health and the environment,
in considering the addition, under 761.61(c), of other processes, procedures, or technologies to 761.61(a). EPA
specifically requests comments on the best method to expeditiously include new universally acceptable risk-based
treatment technologies as self-implementing treatment options prior to amendment of 761.61(a) in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The kind of solvent washing process EPA proposes for treating PCBs removes PCBs from the waste, separates the PCBs
from the solvent, and reuses the solvent while disposing of the PCBs. Residual levels of solvent in the treated PCB
remediation waste must correspond to allowable levels under all other Federal and local regulations, including
requirements under RCRA and regulations of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). For other
techniques such as vitrification, EPA is concerned about additional issues such as the release of volatile products
of incomplete combustion (PICs) especially when the process is conducted 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in-situ
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. If EPA cannot devise a procedure or prescribe a technology for addressing the issue of volatile PICs, vitrification
will be deleted from option (a) and only considered under option (c) in a risk-based approval. EPA specifically requests
comment and supporting technical information on this issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RCRA uses the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP), (40 CFR part 261 Appendix II, Method 1311), its
model for co-disposal of potentially hazardous wastes with municipal solid waste in a landfill. Under RCRA regulations,
the assumption is that if a waste does not exhibit the toxicity characteristic (and is otherwise not hazardous), it
does not need to be disposed of as a hazardous waste; thus, it can be placed in a solid waste landfill (40 CFR 261.3). EPA
is drawing a parallel to the RCRA rules for disposal of certain treated remediation wastes under TSCA. EPA is proposing
to use the RCRA TCLP as a measure of effectiveness of microencapsulation or vitrification of PCB containing remediation
wastes. Using the RCRA model for establishing toxic contaminant levels, EPA is proposing 50 micrograms per liter
(i.e., approximately 50 parts per billion [ppb]) as the treatability level for extractable PCBs. (The Toxicity Characteristic
(TC) level for PCBs was proposed and subsequently withdrawn (see 57 FR 21520, May 20, 1992 and 57 FR 49280, October 30,
1992)). If adopted under TSCA, any PCB remediation waste that has been microencapsulated or vitrified and subsequently
shown to leach PCBs at less than 50 ppb, as measured by the TCLP, would be considered appropriate for disposal in a municipal
solid waste landfill, after written notice to the municipal solid waste landfill, or disposal could be at a TSCA approved
disposal facility. The treated PCB remediation waste would still be subject to all prohibitions in the PCB rules including,
but not limited to, use, reuse, export, or the proposed ban on open burning. One commenter to the ANPRM proposed that
EPA use the American National Standards Institute/American Nuclear Society leachability test (ANSI/ANS 16.1)
to determine the effectiveness of microencapsulation or vitrification technologies. The major technical differences
between the two leaching procedures are the amount of surface area exposed to the leaching medium and the neutral (versus
the TCLP's mildly acidic) nature of the leaching medium in the ANSI/ANS Standard. As stated in its introduction, the
ANSI/ANS standard serves only as a basis for indexing releases from the encapsulant and does not apply to any specific
environmental situation. The commenter noted that a variety of contaminant release tests and test conditions should
be developed to assess the potential for release of specific contaminants in given situations. Since this proposal
is focused on the release of a toxic constituent from a matrix when co-disposed with other solid waste in a municipal
solid waste landfill, EPA believes that the question of which test to use is more properly addressed in the solid and
hazardous waste regulations under RCRA than the PCB rules under TSCA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's proposed self-implementing option for disposal of PCB remediation waste includes a different way to evaluate
PCB concentrations during site remediation. Some field screening tests have been developed and approved for use
under EPA's ``Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste'' (SW&hyph;846) and have otherwise been widely used. Chemicals
other than PCBs at the remediation site may interfere with the tests and indicate that PCBs are not present when in fact
PCBs are present (a false negative). The correct application of the tests may still not inform or warn the user of the
presence of such interferences. This proposal includes the use of several kinds of PCB field screening tests during
remediation, so long as confirmatory sampling is used to guard against false negatives and to demonstrate the absence
of interferences which would render the analytical results invalid. The ability to obtain acceptable analytical
results in a very short time on-site and while remediation is under way can complete remediation goals more quickly
and at lower costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The self-implementing option for the disposal of PCB remediation waste would offer one new consideration for PCB
disposal at 761.61(a)(4)(v): allowing non-liquid wastes generated by the cleanup process (e.g., spent abrasives)
to be disposed of at their existing concentration (i.e, at a concentration less than the maximum concentration of
PCBs found at the remediation waste site). Solvents used in remediation activities could be reused according to provisions
proposed in 761.79(a)(1) and 761.61(a). During use of the solvents, secondary containment would have to be provided
to ensure no solvent releases to soil or water. A general requirement for protection for workers engaged in decontamination
activities is also proposed. Decontamination activities could not proceed until those workers conducting the decontamination
are protected from exposure to PCBs and the materials used to decontaminate. EPA requests comments on this proposal
and technical information on the performance and effectiveness of other treatment technologies the Agency could

 Performance-based option.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The performance-based disposal option proposed at 761.61(b) includes the traditional disposal technologies of
high-temperature incineration, high efficiency boilers, chemical waste landfills, and alternate destruction
methodologies that are currently approved by the Director of the EPA Chemical Management Division for mobile, transportable,
and non-unique fixed-site disposal units, and by the Regional Administrator for unique fixed-site disposal units.
These technologies are based on their performance as required in the existing PCB disposal regulations. No specific
changes are being proposed for these standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iii.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Risk-based option.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The risk-based remediation option proposed at 761.61(c) bases disposal requirements for PCB remediation waste
on the potential risks to health and the environment resulting from residual PCBs in the PCB-remediation waste. Performance
requirements could include destruction, containment, restriction of access to the disposal site, deed restrictions,
and other short- and long-term management controls. The risk-based disposal standard would continue to be one of
no unreasonable risk of injury to health and the environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The application and approval process for a risk-based remediation approval would be essentially the same as the current
process for application for a performance-based PCB disposal approval. New approvals would be classified as performance-risk
based approvals under proposed 761.61(c). Written applications would be required and the approving official (i.e.,
the Regional Administrator having jurisdiction over the site of remediation) would document in the approval: the
reasons for the approval, the approval conditions, and EPA's findings. The process, criteria, and standards for
decision-making would be similar to EPA's site remediation program under CERCLA. It is EPA's desire to limit the use
of this time consuming and resource intensive proposed option in favor of the self-implementing provisions proposed
in 761.61(a) or the decontamination procedures proposed as additions to 761.79. To assist the applicant in developing
an approach for the risk-based disposal application, EPA's general principles for reviewing a PCB remediation approval
application are stated here in the form of four preferences. The first preference would be to have a permanent remedy
that allows for the least restrictive access and land use restrictions at each site. The second preference would be
to impose greater protection of sensitive ecosystems such as water resources, croplands, grazing lands, and residential
areas than the target standards, expressed as cleanup levels in the self-implementing option (at proposed 761.61(a)),
would provide. The third preference would be for destruction or extraction instead of land disposal. The fourth preference
would be for using on-site or existing off-site disposal facilities versus developing new off-site land disposal
facilities. Microencapsulation or vitrification would not be a preferred technology for PCBs if it caused unacceptable
increases in the overall volume of wastes being sent off-site to chemical waste landfills, resulted in a liquid phase,
or allowed unacceptable levels of leaching of PCBs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The evaluation criteria for site-specific variances from the target standards would include: (1) Risk factors associated
with the waste (e.g., volume, concentration, physical state, toxicity, mobility), and (2) risk factors associated
with the proposed waste management option (e.g., safety, reliability, effectiveness, possibility of discharge
to surface or ground water, current and reasonably expected future site use, technical feasibility, resource value,
proposed institutional controls, permanence of remedy, potential for concentration of PCBs and waste minimization).
While this paragraph reflects some factors associated with each criterion, these unranked factors would only provide
notice and assistance in defining the criterion. EPA would not be limiting itself to the factors listed or require
that each factor listed be considered.

 Implementation of PCB remediation programs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Currently, based on the results of site sampling, historical, or other data, EPA may presume that PCBs are illegally
disposed of at a site and require remediation under TSCA. In that case, the burden is on the site owner or operator to
establish, through persuasive evidence, that the PCBs are not illegally disposed of under TSCA. Today, EPA proposes
to address all PCB remediation waste, regardless of concentration, physical state or date of disposal (see proposed
introductory text at 761.60) under 761.61, based on the risk of exposure or injury they now pose. EPA would apply the
current ``anti-dilution'' provision at 761.1(b) to retain regulatory authority over PCB remediation waste even
where the PCB concentration is now below 50 ppm, unless the dilution was authorized (e.g., as the result of a transformer
reclassification under 761.30(a)(2)(v)) and the authorized dilution occurred prior to disposal. Anti-dilution
would not mandate disposal requirements for PCB remediation waste under proposed 761.61 (or 761.62 for PCB non-remediation
waste). Again, the burden would be on the site owner or operator to establish, through persuasive evidence, that the
PCB remediation wastes, regardless of current concentration or date of disposal are legally disposed of under TSCA
and in the case of wastes disposed of before April 18, 1978, which are now 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
50 ppm PCBs, do not pose a risk of injury. PCBs at any concentration are subject to remediation under CERCLA or corrective
action under RCRA. This is not an inconsistency in application of the various statutes because the 50 ppm PCB level
under TSCA is based in part on the economic impacts of the PCB regulations and not solely on risk. EPA is not precluded
from taking action under any other statute it administers simply because it has chosen not to regulate use or disposal
or take remedial action under TSCA. For example, a party begins a cleanup of a historic pre-1978 spill. This site would
not fall under 40 CFR part 761, subpart G and would require Regional approval for cleanup levels for PCBs at 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
50 ppm. The soil at the site is found to vary in concentration between 10 ppm and 100 ppm PCBs. Upon application to the
Regional Administrator, under proposed 761.61(c), the site could be cleaned to a specified level, and the resulting
PCB remediation waste treated by chemical dechlorination. Or, under the proposal, the Regional Administrator could,
upon application and upon a site-specific evaluation, determine that an immobilizing procedure such as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in situ
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 vitrification was a viable alternative. A disposal application would then be judged by EPA on its overall ability
to protect health and the environment from unreasonable risk of injury from PCBs. PCBs at levels 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
&lt;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
50 ppm (at a pre-1978 disposal) would still be subject to cleanup under RCRA and CERCLA authorities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The disposal rule proposed today would be a potentially ``applicable or relevant and appropriate requirement''
for PCB cleanups under the CERCLA, both with respect to the disposal of PCB remediation wastes at CERCLA sites, and
with respect to the remediation approach utilized and the residual level of PCBs in soil. However, EPA does not anticipate
that the provisions relating to the remedial approach and residual levels permitted will significantly affect CERCLA
cleanups, because the rule would provide three options. Generally, EPA would be likely to select the risk-based option
at 761.61(c), which would give the Agency very broad discretion in selecting a remedy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that EPA should conduct a comparative risk analysis of all possible disposal techniques
and include other factors such as transportation and disposal of treatment residues before issuing a PCB disposal
approval under TSCA. EPA does not believe that TSCA authority should be used to accomplish exactly what CERCLA, an
all encompassing proactive remediation statute, was designed to do. Rather, the PCB disposal approval process under
TSCA is simply one of determining the effectiveness of an applicant's proposed cleanup and disposal options for PCBs
in achieving a specific standard.

 PCB remediation wastes.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One category of large volume PCB wastes includes all contaminated environmental media, dredged materials, municipal
sewage treatment sludges, commercial or industrial sludges in or from any pollution control device (contaminated
as the result of a spill of PCBs but not resulting from the incidental manufacture of PCBs); soil, rags, and other debris
generated as the result of a spill cleanup; and site removal, remediation, or corrective action waste at any concentration
of PCBs and in liquid or non-liquid form. This category of wastes would be referred to as ``PCB remediation wastes,''
and EPA is proposing this definition at 761.3. In response to comments and to simplify the application of these amendments,
EPA is proposing that PCB remediation wastes include both liquids and non-liquids at any concentration of PCBs, in
any quantity or volume, regardless of when the waste was generated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 PCB non-remediation wastes.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The other category of large volume PCB wastes would be referred to as ``PCB non-remediation wastes.'' PCB non-remediation
waste includes: non-liquid bulk wastes or debris from the demolition of buildings and other human created structures
where the construction materials were manufactured or coated (e.g., by using paint containing PCBs) with PCBs as
opposed to being contaminated with PCBs (e.g., through a spill from electrical equipment); wastes from the chopping
or shredding of automobiles, household and industrial appliances, or other white goods (i.e., shredder fluff);
PCB-impregnated electrical, sound-deadening, or other types of insulation and gaskets; and all other PCB Items
or PCBs for which disposal requirements are not otherwise specified in 761.60, regardless of concentration where
the concentration at the time of disposal was greater than or equal to 50 ppm PCBs. EPA is proposing a definition of ``PCB
non-remediation waste'' at 761.3. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Shredder wastes comprise small pieces of metal, rubber, plastic, fabric, foam, insulation, wire, cardboard, dirt,
and various other materials. Demolition wastes may contain any number of materials, including some of the same materials
found in shredder waste. The results of shredding or demolition processes may be that the sources of PCB contamination
in these large volume wastes may not easily be identified. In addition, some decommissioning projects and demolition
projects may produce large quantities of insulation containing PCBs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Shredder waste is also the ``end of the line'' for many items, not otherwise regulated for disposal, that find their
way into the scrap metal stream, and may result in subsequent contamination of shredder waste. EPA acknowledges the
need for responsibly operated metal recycling facilities. As such, EPA is reiterating that all wastes containing
50 ppm PCBs or greater, including shredder wastes, as well as demolition wastes and large volumes of other PCB non-remediation
wastes impregnated with PCBs (e.g., insulation), are regulated for disposal. However, EPA is proposing at 761.62
that where PCB non-remediation wastes are the result of processing PCBs regulated for disposal, the wastes resulting
from that processing are also regulated for disposal even when the resulting concentration of the processing wastes
is less than 50 ppm PCB, through action of the anti-dilution provision at 761.1(b). Where the waste is already shredded,
statistically valid sampling and analytical methods acceptable to EPA, such as those in proposed Appendix III to
part 761, may be used to characterize the contamination to support proposals for various disposal options. Under
the TSCA PCB program, EPA will not accept any sampling method that mathematically masks or dilutes areas of PCB contamination.
A generator or facility owner or operator may demonstrate that no PCBs greater than or equal to 50 ppm were in the wastestream
at the time of generation or that all wastes containing PCBs are exempt under the TSCA Household Waste Exemption (Unit
II.D.1. in this preamble). Conscientious operators of demolition activities and shredding facilities should be
aware of known sources of contamination that can readily be removed from the wastestream before processing and disposal.
These sources may include small capacitors, light ballasts, or PCB-Contaminated Articles such as hydraulic equipment.
Proposed 761.62 would allow for other disposal options for PCB non-remediation wastes based on site-specific criteria
by extending the risk-based philosophy of the disposal requirements for municipal sludges and dredged materials
under proposed 761.60(a)(5). Under this proposal, EPA could also require as a condition of any approval under this
section the implementation of a source identification and removal program to control the level (i.e., concentration)
and variability of PCBs in the wastestream. In compliance with current restrictions, items regulated for disposal
such as transformer carcasses, nonintact or leaking small capacitors, or wastes resulting from unauthorized uses
must not be placed in the metal stream destined for shredding facilities.

Risk-based disposal.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In general, EPA's preference for disposal of PCB non-remediation wastes under proposed 761.62 is to approve their
disposal in a well-engineered and operated municipal solid waste landfill with appropriate monitoring to detect
releases of PCBs to the environment. Facilities should also be designed and operated in such a manner as to control
the release of PCB non-remediation wastes to the environment by controlling among other things, areal dispersion,
run-on and runoff, and leachate generation and management from the waste disposal units. EPA would not be inclined
to approve the disposal of PCB non-remediation wastes as fill material in environmentally sensitive areas including
but not limited to sites in 100&hyph;year flood plains, near potential sources of drinking water, in wellhead protection
areas, and in residential settings. PCB non-remediation wastes could still be disposed of under the three current
disposal options of incineration, chemical waste landfill, or any alternative disposal methods approved under
TSCA authorities by the Regional Administrator upon application. Under the proposal, if the waste is not uniform
in PCB contamination, the Regional Administrator may specify appropriate limitations on the method or location
of disposal (761.62(c)(4)). Where PCB non-remediation waste is stored on the ground (e.g., in a pile), any soil contaminated
with non-remediation waste would be regulated for disposal under 761.61.

 Leachability-based disposal.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As an alternative to obtaining a risk-based TSCA disposal approval under proposed 761.62(c), EPA is proposing under
761.62(b), to allow the disposal of PCB non-remediation waste in a municipal solid waste landfill if the level of PCBs
in the waste as measured by the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure was less than 50 micrograms per liter (i.e.,
50 ppb) and the landfill is notified in writing, at least 15 working days prior to their receipt of the waste. This self-implementing
option would be available to only the PCB non-remediation waste itself and not to any material resulting from pre-treatment
such as microencapsulation or vitrification of the waste. Any proposal to process (i.e., pretreat) PCB non-remediation
waste currently requires an approval, and this is not proposed to change. Disposal of PCB non-remediation wastes,
such as wastes from automobile or appliance shredders, in a municipal solid waste landfill is currently prohibited
by the PCB regulations, but may be allowed by EPA on a case-by-case basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA requests comment, with supporting data, on the inclusion of other self-implementing options for the storage
and disposal of PCB non-remediation wastes under 761.62(b). These additional options would include provisions
to make them generally applicable nationwide and not require additional site-specific prohibitions or limitations.

 PCB non-remediation waste could still be disposed of in a TSCA approved incinerator or chemical waste landfill under
proposed 761.62(a). This option would be most appropriate where the PCB for PCB non-remediation waste which was no
longer being generated, the waste could not be disposed of under proposed 761.62(b) because of high levels of leachable
PCBs, and where the situation would not warrant the expenditure of resources to apply for a risk-based disposal approval
under proposed 761.62(c).

 Decontamination standards and procedures.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is proposing several changes and additions to 761.79 with general applicability throughout the PCB program under
TSCA, for liquids and non-porous surfaces, except where another standard is established, for example in a RCRA permit,
a TSCA PCB disposal approval, a Superfund ROD, or a Superfund enforcement decision document. Today's proposal includes
a general decontamination standard of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 10 micrograms PCBs (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) (as measured by standard wipe tests, 761.123) for a non-porous surface (see proposed definition at 761.3) and two
decontamination procedures for non-porous surfaces. The decontamination standard may be achieved using any disposal
or cleaning technique which, in some instances, may require prior approval by EPA. Although activities such as filtering,
soaking, wiping, stripping of insulation, chopping, scraping, or the use of abrasives to remove or separate PCBs
from contaminated surfaces or liquids may be processing for disposal as opposed to disposal, EPA is proposing to waive
any requirement to obtain prior approval under TSCA for these listed activities. EPA also considered whether to include
distillation in this exemption but remains concerned about releases of volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds
to the environment. EPA is seeking comment on the inclusion of distillation. All residues containing PCBs from these
and other ``disposal'' activities would remain regulated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed standard for decontamination of solid surfaces is the standard in the PCB Spill Cleanup Policy at 761.125(c)(2)(i).
EPA believes that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is protective for disposal or subsequent reuse of the decontaminated surface. This standard has also been demonstrated
to EPA through the PCB disposal approval process to be achievable through a wide variety of techniques. The residual
cleaning materials containing PCBs would be managed and disposed of as a PCB waste in accordance with the applicable
PCB disposal regulations in part 761, subpart D. The ``Note'' currently following 761.79 would be inserted as introductory
text under 761.79 to warn those conducting decontamination operations that compliance with this section would not
relieve them of their duty to comply with other Federal, State, or local requirements for the use and disposal of solvents.
One example is the requirement to comply with the rules for the disposal of wastes identified or listed under RCRA or
State or local laws as solid, hazardous, or otherwise regulated wastes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As an alternative to decontamination followed by sampling, for non-porous surfaces, especially those that cannot
be accessed for sampling, EPA is proposing two non-aggressive procedures for decontamination. The first procedure
is for surfaces contaminated with mineral oil dielectric fluid (MODEF) with PCB concentrations 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 10,000 ppm (see proposed 761.79(e)). The second procedure is for surfaces contaminated with higher concentrations
of PCBs in MODEF and askarel PCBs (see proposed 761.79(f)). Each procedure involves a 15&hyph;hour non-aggressive
soaking (i.e., no agitation of the kerosene or movement of the contaminated surface in the kerosene). Proposed 761.79(f)
would require a second soak with clean kerosene. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After decontamination using one of these procedures, the decontaminated surface would not be regulated for disposal
and could be reused except in association with food, feed, or drinking water in accordance with proposed 761.20(c)(5).
EPA's research demonstrates that these two non-aggressive procedures using kerosene should decontaminate surfaces
to a level 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Therefore, confirmatory sampling would not be required. EPA is requesting comment, supported by laboratory data,
on aggressive versus the proposed non-aggressive decontamination techniques especially where the volume of kerosene
or another solvent proposed by the commenter can be reduced. EPA recognizes that there is a possibility that the proposed
decontamination procedure may not result in final surface levels at or below 10

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. For purposes of implementation, if EPA subsequently sampled a decontaminated surface and found levels above 10

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the surface would be regulated unless it could be shown by the owner (i.e., through laboratory documentation) that
the original PCB concentrations were determined, the prescribed procedures in 761.79(e) or (f) were followed for
those concentrations of PCBs, and the prescribed volume of PCB rinseate was used and properly disposed of (i.e., through
copies of the manifests and certificates of disposal). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is also proposing additional language at 761.79(a) to clarify that the disposal of solvents, abrasives, or equipment
used in decontamination procedures is regulated and is proposing another disposal option, specifically disposal
in an industrial boiler, for certain of those solvents. The proposal would also require at 761.79(a)(5) that all decontamination
activities be conducted with containment adequate to prevent releases of PCBs to the environment. EPA is proposing
that any decontamination activities conducted in accordance with the provisions of 761.79 would not require a PCB
disposal approval from EPA. Workers would have to be protected against exposure through dermal contact or inhalation;
however, EPA is not specifying what measures must be taken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal establishes a decontamination standard for water of 0.5 micrograms PCB per liter (0.5 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/l) or approximately 0.5 ppb PCB (see proposed 761.79(g)). This standard is consistent with EPA drinking water levels
for PCBs at 40 CFR 141.61(c). EPA is proposing a 0.5 ppb decontamination standard because it is difficult to ensure
that the decontaminated water will not be reused in association with food or feed or as drinking water for livestock
or humans. A conforming amendment at proposed 761.20(c)(6) would allow the unrestricted reuse of water decontaminated
in accordance with the level established in 761.79(g). The Agency believes that uses of water at or below the proposed
decontamination level would not pose an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment. The proposal also
establishes a decontamination standard for organic liquids, not associated with remediation wastes, of less than
2 milligrams PCB per liter (i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
&lt;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2 ppm PCB) (see proposed 761.79(h)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that placing these standards in the decontamination section will clarify and simplify the implementation
of the PCB program by specifically defining levels for decontamination and removing the prohibitions against reuse
(see 761.20(c)(5) and (6)). The proposed introductory text to 761.60 states in part that ``...PCB wastes must be disposed
of in accordance with provisions of this subpart.'' EPA interprets this to mean that any PCB otherwise subject to the
disposal requirements of 761.60, may also be disposed of through decontamination under proposed 761.79.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Distribution in commerce and use of decontaminated equipment, structures, and materials
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The Agency is proposing a conforming amendment to the current provisions of 761.20(c) as an exception to the general
prohibition against the distribution in commerce and use of equipment, structures, and materials unless they are
decontaminated under a TSCA approval, or the provisions at proposed 761.79. This amendment is important because
it causes the scope of the PCB prohibitions in this section to, among other things, specifically conform to the current
use of TSCA disposal approvals in establishing decontamination or cleanup levels (see proposed 761.20(c)(4)).
EPA also proposes at 761.20(c)(7) to exempt from the general prohibition on use of PCBs, surfaces (e.g., equipment)
which comes in contact with PCBs or PCB wastes at 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
50 ppm by allowing its continued use until thw surface exceeded the appropriate decontamination standard, at which
point it would have to be decontaminated or disposed of. The Agency believes that the further use, or distribution
in commerce of items decontaminated or cleaned up to specific standards established in applicable EPA PCB spill cleanup
policies, 761.79, or a TSCA approval would not present an unreasonable risk of injury if the decontaminated items
are not used or reused in association with food, feed, or drinking water. For water, a standard is being proposed at
761.20(c)(6) that is stringent enough to allow unrestricted distribution or reuse of the decontaminated water.
In 761.20(c)(7), the Agency is proposing to allow the restricted distribution or reuse of solid, nonporous surfaces
that have been contaminated by regulated PCBs if the final PCB concentration meets the decontamination standard
proposed at 761.79(d), regardless of the original concentration of the PCBs. Although any liquid (e.g., a solvent)
or solid (e.g., an abrasive) used for decontamination would remain regulated, the decontaminated surface could
be distributed or reused pursuant to proposed 761.20(c)(5) and (6).

Processing for disposal

. Current 761.20(c)(2) says in part that PCBs ``may be processed . . . in compliance with the requirements of this part
for purposes of disposal in accordance with the requirements of 761.60.'' The preamble language addressing this
section (see 44 FR 31527, May 30, 1979) explained that the provision was intended to apply to the concentration of PCBs
in a manufacturing waste stream where the wastes resulted from the manufacture and processing of PCBs for use. EPA
is clarifying how this paragraph applies to the disposal of all PCBs, including those removed from use. Today, EPA
is broadening the exemption for processing for disposal by identifying which processing for disposal does not require
an approval and which processing for disposal does require a PCB disposal approval. EPA clarifies that processing
activities which are primarily associated with and facilitate the storage and transportation of PCBs for disposal
would not require an approval. Processing activities which are primarily associated with and facilitate treatment,
as defined in 261.10, or land disposal, rather than storage or transportation for disposal would require an approval
unless the processing was part of an activity already included in an approval or other authorization in subpart D of
this part, for example in 761.61(a), 761.62(b), or 761.79. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, EPA is implementing the existing provisions at 761.20(c)(2) as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Processing activities which are primarily associated with and facilitate storage or transportation for disposal
do not require a TSCA PCB disposal approval. Examples include, but are not limited to removing PCBs from service (e.g.,
draining liquids), packaging or repackaging PCBs for transportation for disposal, or combining materials from
smaller containers into larger containers in accordance with 761.1(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Processing activities which are primarily associated with and facilitate treatment or land disposal require
an approval unless they are part of an existing approval or are part of a self-implementing activity such as 761.61(a)
and 761.79 or otherwise specifically allowed under 40 CFR part 761, subpart D. Examples include but not limited to
microencapsulation; pulverization; particle size separation; employing augers or hoppers to facilitate feeding
non-liquid PCBs into a disposal unit; and directly piping liquid PCBs into a disposal unit from PCB items, storage
containers or bulk transport vehicles; or directly introducing non-liquid PCBs from containers, bulk transport
vehicles or on pallets into a disposal unit, such as an incinerator, a high efficiency boiler, industrial furnace,
alternate destruction method, or chemical waste landfill. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) With the exception of provisions in 761.60(a)(2) or (3), in order to meet the intent of 761.1(b), processing, diluting
or otherwise blending of waste prior to being introduced into a disposal unit for purposes of meeting a PCB concentration
limit shall be included in a disposal approval or comply with the requirements of 761.79. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The rate of delivering liquids or non-liquids into a PCB disposal unit shall be part of the conditions of the PCB
disposal approval for the unit when an approval is required.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 761.3 currently defines ``PCB Article'' as any manufactured article, other than a PCB Container, that contains
PCBs and whose surface(s) has been in direct contact with PCBs. ``PCB Article'' includes capacitors, transformers,
electric motors, pumps, pipes, and any other manufactured item (1) that is formed to a specific shape or design during
manufacture, (2) that has end use function(s) dependent in whole or in part upon its shape or design during end use,
and (3) that has either no change of chemical composition during its end use or only those changes of composition that
have no commercial purpose separate from that of the PCB Article. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The large volume article disposal proposals differ from the existing PCB Article disposal regulations in two ways:
they focus more on the presence of PCBs rather than on the presence of PCB containing liquids; and the proposed changes
focus more on the decontamination of portions of the articles for purposes of another use (metal recovery) or reuse
(by verifying the absence of PCBs presumed present), rather than for outright disposal (i.e., destruction or landfilling)
of the article.

Disposal.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The current 761.60(b)(5) would be redesignated as 761.60(b)(6). The new 761.60(b)(6)(ii) would be amended to include
language allowing disposal in industrial furnaces (as defined in the proposed 761.3) of drained PCB-Contaminated
Articles. A new 761.60(b)(6)(iii) would be added to address PCB Articles with surfaces contaminated with PCBs, but
which contain no liquids by which to characterize the article. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to 761.60(b)(6)(ii), although not explicitly provided for in the current regulations, EPA in the past,
has interpreted disposal in an industrial furnace, as defined in proposed 761.3, as an appropriate method of disposal
also for drained PCB-Contaminated Transformers and drained PCB-Contaminated natural gas pipeline (see Ref. 25).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, the regulations specifically state that ``salvage'' is an acceptable form of disposal for ``PCB hydraulic
machines'' containing PCBs at concentrations of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
50 ppm (761.60(b)(3)). The word ``salvage'' has been interpreted by EPA to allow smelting of ``PCB hydraulic machines''
that have been drained of all free flowing liquid. (See Ref. 21) In addition to disposal of hydraulic machines, which
have been drained of hydraulic fluids, in municipal or industrial landfills, EPA is proposing to amend 761.60(b)(3)
to allow salvage by disposal in industrial furnaces, as defined in proposed 761.3. It should be noted that PCBs, not
just free flowing liquids, associated with the PCB Articles must be removed from the surface of the item before the
item may be reintroduced into commerce. EPA is seeking comments and data on disposal techniques such as disposal in
industrial furnaces for inclusion in this amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new 761.60(b)(6)(iii) addresses PCB Articles with surfaces contaminated with PCBs, but which contain no liquids
by which to characterize the article. This category of PCB Articles would include, but not be limited to, ship hulls,
air handling systems, and other articles that could be characterized by a wipe sample. As a point of clarification,
EPA believes that PCB-Contaminated Electrical Equipment with porous material in its core will probably not rapidly
be able to meet the requirement of being drained, because the porous core will continue to release liquid for an extended
period of time after the initial liquid is drained from the unit. In these cases EPA recommends that the core and any
other sorbent material be removed and placed in a TSCA approved chemical waste landfill. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PCB-Contaminated Articles regulated under proposed 761.60(b)(6)(ii) or (iii) would be required to be disposed
of in: a facility permitted, licensed, or registered by a State to manage municipal or industrial solid waste (excluding
thermal treatment units), an industrial furnace (defined in proposed 761.3) operating in compliance with the requirements
of 761.60(a)(4), or other TSCA approved disposal facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a point of clarification, the phrase ``is not regulated for disposal'' at current 761.60(b)(4) and (b)(5)(ii)
does not mean that drained PCB-Contaminated Electrical Equipment and PCB Articles may be sold, distributed in commerce
for sale or use, or reused without an exemption under these rules. The phrase only means that a waste can be disposed
of, in accordance with the definition of disposal at 761.3, without a TSCA PCB approval.

 Open burning and industrial furnaces.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Currently, 761.60(b)(4) and (b)(5)(ii) provide that drained PCB-Contaminated Electrical Equipment (except capacitors)
and drained PCB-Contaminated Articles are not regulated for disposal. EPA chose not to regulate the disposal of certain
PCBs because it found that the risks were not unreasonable. However, EPA is aware that certain PCBs have been disposed
of through ``open burning'' (e.g., the burn-out of core materials in PCB-Contaminated Transformers) without adequate
provision for efficient combustion and control of gaseous combustion products. EPA currently controls the combustion
of PCBs through incinerator and industrial boiler criteria set out at 761.70, to limit the release of PCBs and the production
or release of byproducts of the incomplete combustion of PCBs such as dioxins and furans. EPA is proposing at 761.3
a definition of ``open burning'' that is consistent with RCRA's definition at 40 CFR 260.10, a ban on the practice of
open burning. Open burning can result in the volatilization of PCBs and several toxic products of incomplete combustion
including polychlorinated dibenzofurans; 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzofuran; polychlorinated dibenzo-

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-dioxin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This provision would prevent open burning of regulated PCBs in State permitted, licensed, or registered municipal
solid waste combustors (i.e., thermal treatment unit) unless the combustor met the requirements for an industrial
furnace set out at proposed 761.3 and 761.60(a)(4). To facilitate the Regional Administrator's review of the operation
of an industrial furnace, a site-specific risk assessment would need to accompany any request for a Regional Administrator's
determination of no unreasonable risk. This risk assessment could be in the form of a permit issued under RCRA or the
Clean Air Act, or as a separate determination issued by the Regional Administrator prior to combustion of PCBs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Industrial furnaces, as defined in 40 CFR 260.10, are being proposed as an acceptable form of disposal when as industrial
furnace combusting PCBs does not release unreasonable levels of PCBs to the environment. To help ensure that PCBs
disposed of in an industrial furnace do not pose an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, EPA is
proposing at 761.60(a)(4) that industrial furnaces used for disposal of PCBs be operated under either a RCRA permit
(40 CFR part 266, subpart H and 40 CFR 270.66) for industrial furnaces or a valid State air permit that includes a standard
for PCBs, and that the industrial furnaces be in compliance with the conditions of their permit. Where an industrial
furnace does not meet the permit requirements, upon written request by the owner or operator of the industrial furnace,
the Regional Administrator may make a finding, in writing, that the combustion of PCBs in certain industrial furnaces
would not pose an unreasonable risk to health or the environment if the industrial furnace is operating in compliance
with the proposed conditions discussed below even though it does not have RCRA or State air permits. EPA is amending
Form 7710&hyph;53, ``Notification of PCB Activity,'' to include a category for industrial furnaces and is proposing
that owners of this equipment comply with the notification requirements of 761.205 by notifying the Agency that their
equipment is used to dispose of PCBs. (For the reader's convenience, a copy of the revised form is reproduced at unit
III.J. of this preamble and may be used to notify EPA of PCB waste handling activities. The form will nolonger be shown
in 40 CFR part 761.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following operating conditions are being proposed at 761.60(a)(4) for industrial furnaces disposing of PCB-Contaminated
Items. The conditions are: (1) The operating temperature of the industrial furnace must be at least 1,000
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; C (centigrade) at the time it is charged; (2) each charge must be fed into molten metal or metal at or above 1,000
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; C; (3) successive charges must not be introduced into the hearth in less than 15 minute intervals, (4) there shall
be no visible particulate emissions from the stack during PCB disposal (as determined by Method 9 in 40 CFR part 60 Appendix
A), (5) there shall be no visible fugitive particulate emissions from the industrial furnace building during PCB
disposal (as determined by Method 9, in 40 CFR part 60 Appendix A); (6) the industrial furnace must have an operational
device which accurately measures, directly or indirectly, the temperature in the hearth; and (7) a reading of the
temperature in the hearth at the time it is charged must be taken, recorded, and retained at the facility for 3 years
from the date each charge is introduced. If EPA ever determined that an industrial furnace was not operating in compliance
with one or more of the conditions proposed in 761.60(a)(4), was not operating under and in compliance with a valid
RCRA permit or State air permit (with an emissions standard for PCBs) or a finding by the Regional Administrator, the
owner or operator of that industrial furnace would be deemed to be conducting ``open burning'', and would be, among
other things, prohibited from introducing any additional PCB wastes into the unit. Examples of acceptable industrial
furnaces which could meet the proposed operating conditions include, but are not limited to, electric arc furnaces,
blast furnaces, and open hearth furnaces. If drained PCB-Contaminated Items are charged at less than 1,000
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; C into a furnace chamber and the furnace gas emissions from this chamber passed through a secondary combustion
chamber, this kind of furnace shall be approved according to 761.60(e). This disposal option would not be available
for TSCA regulated PCB liquids. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a conforming change, due to the proposed ban on open burning, EPA is proposing to delete the phrase ``is not regulated
by this rule'' from the PCB regulations at 761.60(b)(4), governing disposal of drained PCB-Contaminated Electrical
Equipment, except capacitors and (b)(5), governing disposal of drained PCB-Contaminated Articles. The proposal
would substitute the phrase ``may be disposed of in a facility permitted, licensed, or registered by a State to manage
municipal or industrial solid waste (excluding thermal treatment units), an industrial furnace as defined in 761.3,
operating in compliance with the requirements of  761.60(a)(4), or a disposal facility approved under this part.''
The purpose of these proposals is to promote, with minimal regulatory burden, certain recycling practices such as
smelting for the recovery of metals and to stop such practices as the unapproved burning of PCB liquids, contaminated
wood or paper cores, or contaminated insulation even where there may be a claim of energy recovery unless specifically
allowed elsewhere by these regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters to the ANPRM advised EPA against proposing controls on industrial furnaces, stating that current
processes were adequate. However, another group of commenters recommended that either additional controls be placed
on industrial furnaces or that drained PCB-Contaminated Items be otherwise regulated for disposal. These commenters
suggested environmental harm could be caused by the unregulated combustion of PCB-Contaminated Items. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that responsibly run industrial furnaces provide a valuable recycling benefit and that the current
Federal regulatory matrix in conjunction with the proposed operating standards would provide adequate controls
on any potential emissions.

 Characterization of PCB Articles.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under 761.60(b)(5) of the current rules, PCB Articles are characterized by the PCB concentration found in the free
flowing liquid. This method is appropriate for electrical equipment containing PCBs and some other articles containing
PCBs. However, it may not be appropriate for PCB Articles whose surfaces may be contaminated with a very light coating
of liquid which is not free flowing. In these instances, EPA is proposing at 761.60(b)(6) that the standard wipe test
be used to characterize these articles. Nonporous surfaces including, but not limited to, ship hulls and air handling
systems could be wipe sampled under proposed 761.60(b)(6)(iii), pursuant to the wipe sampling guidelines, at locations
that accurately characterize the article. Areas directly in contact with PCBs would have to be sampled. Any nonporous
surface found to be contaminated with PCBs at 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
&lt;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
100 micrograms per 100 square centimeters could be disposed of in an industrial furnace. Other articles found to be

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
100 micrograms per 100 square centimeters must be disposed of in a TSCA approved incinerator or placed in a TSCA approved
chemical waste landfill. EPA is proposing to limit the application of the wipe test to characterize items for disposal
to certain articles. The wiped surface must be non-porous for the test to accurately characterize the contamination
level of the article. However, a standard wipe test may be applicable to other PCB Articles with porous surfaces under
an alternative disposal approval (761.60(e)). Any article may also be disposed of through decontamination under
proposed 761.79, as applicable.

 A new 761.60(b)(5) and Appendix I would be created to address disposal, including abandonment in place, and removal
of natural gas pipeline. This section proposes the characterization of natural gas pipeline by direct analysis of
pipeline fluids, commonly found in pipeline ``drips'' and geographic low points or the use of the standard wipe test
for characterization purposes, if liquid samples are not available. Natural gas pipeline being removed from service
which is characterized as PCB-Contaminated, that is, between 50 and less than 500 ppm PCBs in pipeline fluids or, for
drained pipe, those segments which are greater than 10 to less than 100 micrograms PCB per 100 square centimeters,
as characterized by the standard wipe test, may be disposed of in a facility which is permitted, licensed, or registered
by a State to manage municipal or industrial solid waste (except thermal treatment units), in an industrial furnace
operating in compliance with the requirements of 761.60(a)(4), or in a TSCA approved disposal facility. Natural
gas pipeline characterized at 500 ppm PCB or greater in its condensate liquids or 100

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 PCB or greater in a standard wipe sample could be removed and managed in a TSCA approved disposal facility, as a PCB non-remediation
waste under proposed 761.62 or decontaminated under proposed 761.79. Natural gas pipeline with an inside diameter
of 4 inches or less is proposed to be disposed of in the same manner as PCB-Contaminated pipeline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The natural gas pipeline industry routinely takes segments of pipeline out of service by abandoning the segments
in the right-of-way. EPA is proposing several options for natural gas pipeline that would be abandoned in place. Natural
gas pipeline at any concentration of PCBs, containing no free-flowing liquid and with an inside diameter of 4 inches
or less, could be abandoned in place by filling the pipe to 50 percent of the volume with cement or other materials listed
in proposed 761.60(b)(5) or placing the abandoned segment in a public service notification program and under either
option, sealing the ends shut. PCB-Contaminated natural gas pipeline of any diameter could be abandoned in place
if it contained no free flowing liquids and each end was sealed shut. Natural gas pipeline at concentrations of 500
ppm PCBs or greater, or 100

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 PCBs or greater could be abandoned in place if it was either washed once with diesel fuel or filled to 50 percent of its
volume with cement or other materials listed in proposed 761.60(b)(5) and, in either case, each end was sealed. Where
natural gas pipeline of any diameter or PCB concentration is abandoned in certain listed locations that could be difficult
to sample, the segments would be filled to 50 percent with cement or other materials listed in proposed 761.60(b)(5),
unless cement was specified as a requirement for abandonment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA proposes, in Appendix I, details on how to characterize natural gas pipelines containing PCBs for abandonment
and removal. Appendix I would require that natural gas pipeline containing PCBs be wiped on the lowest point on the
inside surface of each end of a removed segment of pipe as that point would be determined prior to removal from the ground.
Where the pipe was removed from the ground, the removed segment to be sampled could not exceed 40 feet in length. Segments
of natural gas pipe removed from the ground for disposal would be required to be sampled at each end. A length of pipe
having seven or fewer segments that was removed for disposal would have to be sampled at each end of each segment. For
removal of multiple contiguous segments, greater than seven segments but less than 3 miles in total length, samples
would be required from both ends of the first and last segments removed and both ends of five randomly chosen segments
in between (with this scheme producing seven sampled segments). For removal of multiple contiguous segments more
than 3 miles in total length, samples would be required from both ends of the first segment and both ends of each segment
that is one-half mile distant from the segment previously sampled (with this scheme producing a minimum of seven sampled
segments). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For pipe to be disposed of, the analytical results of both samples from each segment sampled would be averaged to determine
the level of contamination. If any average sample results from any segment removed were greater than 10 to less than
100 micrograms PCB/100 square centimeters, then that segment would be considered PCB-Contaminated. If any average
sample results from multiple contiguous segments removed were greater than 10 micrograms PCB/100 square centimeters
then all unsampled segments in that removal would be presumed to be contaminated with PCBs at that level. Other sampling
regimes could be approved in a disposal approval issued under 761.60(e) or 761.62(c).

The Agency solicited through the ANPRM information and comments regarding the regulation under TSCA of the continued
use, storage, and disposal of mixtures, items, and wastes with both PCB and radioactive constituents. Information
was requested to be used to propose criteria for developing an authorization for the continued use, storage, and disposal
of such materials, which would minimize risks to health and the environment from PCBs. With respect to radioactive
components, the proposed criteria would achieve compliance with requirements established under the authority
of the Atomic Energy Act (AEA) as amended (42 U.S.C. 2011) and maintain doses from radioactive materials regulated
under the AEA at a level that is ``As Low As Reasonably Achievable'' (ALARA) (40 FR 19442, May 5, 1975; 10 CFR part 50,
Appendix I). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the Department of Energy (DOE) participated in the identification of
situations of potential concern due to the presence of radionuclides and the development of the proposed waste management
options for PCB/radioactive waste, as reflected in this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ANPRM stated that neither TSCA nor the PCB regulations has waiver provisions similar to those under RCRA and solicited
comments on amending the 1&hyph;year time limit for storage and disposal for PCBs at 40 CFR 761.65(a) where no disposal
technology exists. An extension to the 1&hyph;year storage and disposal requirement could also be appropriate for
situations where the disposal capacity or the time necessary to complete the disposal are insufficient. This approach
would provide flexibility on a case-by-case basis to address specific use scenarios or storage requirements and
issues unique to PCB/radioactive waste management. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The majority of comments supported flexibility in extending the 1&hyph;year time limit for storage and disposal,
and concurred with the proposal that such extensions or waivers should be determined on a case-by-case basis. Some
commenters suggested a general regulatory waiver or variance to the 1&hyph;year time limit for storage and disposal
requirement. Still another commenter suggested that EPA grant an exemption similar to the national capacity variance
to RCRA's hazardous waste land disposal restriction requirements. Other commenters proposed a ``good faith'' showing
by contacting disposal facilities nationwide and certifying that disposal capacity is not available for wastes
remaining in storage. Many commenters also supported extending or waiving the 1&hyph;year time limit for storage
and disposal requirement for materials like PCB/radioactive waste. Commenters recommended extensions for problems
such as: a lack of disposal or treatment technology, a lack of disposal or treatment capacity, and a lack of sufficient
time to complete the disposal process (e.g., bioremediation). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA, in Unit III.G.3 of this preamble, is proposing to amend 40 CFR 761.65 to allow for self-implementing and case-by-case
extensions to the 1&hyph;year time limit for storage and disposal requirement for any PCB wastes. PCB/radioactive
wastes are included in that proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed 761.65(a)(2) would provide the Regional Administrator for the Region where the waste is being stored, or
the Director, Chemical Management Division (CMD), authority to grant extensions to the current 1&hyph;year time
limit for storage and disposal of PCBs, including PCB/radioactive wastes. An extension could be granted based on
a determination by the Regional Administrator or the Director, CMD, that there was a demonstrated need or justification
to store or conduct disposal of wastes beyond 1 year and that no unreasonable risks of injury to health or the environment
would result from an extension of the storage period. Criteria for extension would include, but not be limited to,
a demonstrated need to store wastes beyond the 1&hyph;year time frame due to a lack of disposal capacity, the absence
of a treatment technology or insufficient time to complete the treatment/destruction process, and a demonstration
that relevant treatment or disposal requirements are being pursued. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The problem of capacity shortfalls is expected to continue for some time after the disposal technology has been developed
because of the large volume of stored PCB/radioactive wastes awaiting disposal. As an example of capacity problems,
DOE operates a Regional disposal facility at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, for PCB/RCRA/radioactive mixed wastes. Fifty
million pounds of wastes are currently in storage for disposal at several Regional sites. Current generation rates
at the various facilities that rely on Oak Ridge for disposal are approximately 5 million pounds per year. The maximum
disposal rate for the unit is approximately 3.09 million pounds per year. Current projections indicate that it will
take 30 to 50 years to dispose of the current materials in storage and all the wastes yet to be generated using the facility
as currently configured (Ref. 11). Therefore, DOE is not expected to meet the 1&hyph;year time limit for storage and
disposal requirement even though it is pursuing additional capacity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters requested that under TSCA, the PCB and radioactive wastes in a mixture not be confused with the
term ``mixed wastes'' under RCRA. EPA agrees and proposes to apply the term ``PCB/radioactive wastes'' or ``PCB/fissionable
radioactive waste'' (See proposed definition at 761.3) as opposed to ``mixed wastes'' to wastes containing PCBs
and radioactive constituents subject to regulation under TSCA and the AEA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA disagrees with those cementers indicating that there is no disposal technology approved under TSCA for PCB/radioactive
waste. Incineration technology is available; however, there is no commercial disposal capacity and only limited
disposal capacity for incineration of PCB/radioactive waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e.g., the DOE incinerator at Oak Ridge, TN). Therefore, facilities storing PCB/radioactive waste often cannot
comply with the 1&hyph;year time limit for storage and disposal because insufficient disposal capacity exists.
Until additional disposal capacity becomes available, PCB/radioactive wastes will require storage, generally
exceeding the 1&hyph;year time limit for storage and disposal for PCBs. Even as capacity increases, there will still
be requests for extensions of the 1&hyph;year time limit for storage and disposal because of the sheer volume of materials
in storage. Therefore, EPA is not proposing to place a specific time limit on the extension to the 1&hyph;year time
limit for storage and disposal. Recipients of an extension to the 1&hyph;year time limit for storage and disposal
would have to request, if needed, and receive from the Regional Administrator or Director, CMD periodic renewals
to their original extension. It is possible that the same reasons that apply to an original extension request may apply
to any subsequent requests because no progress in developing a disposal technology has occurred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stated that annual status reports for PCB/radioactive wastes in storage for disposal should be required
and updated annually on July 15 to coincide with the submission of the PCB Annual Report for each facility. Status reports
or reviews of existing extensions may be conditions established by the Regional Administrator or Director, CMD providing
the extension. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters suggested that EPA amend 761.65 to accommodate concerns relating to management and storage and
the uniqueness of PCB/radioactive wastes. There are certain elements relating to storage of radioactive wastes
containing plutonium or enriched uranium that require consideration of criticality safety (i.e., the prevention
of nuclear reactions that would pose a threat to health and the environment). All actions relating to criticality
or radiation protection issues must be coordinated through, and approved by, the local office of the regulatory authority
for radioactive material regulation; for licensed nuclear facilities, this would be the appropriate NRC Regional
Office or State radiation protection authority office. The issue of criticality relates to proper storage of fissionable
materials so that a continuous self-sustaining chain reaction does not occur. [DOE Order 5480.5 states that ``nuclear
criticality is a self sustaining chain reaction, i.e., the state in which the effective neutron multiplication constant
of a system of fissionable material equals or exceeds unity.''] Proper storage of fissionable material is essential
to avoid a criticality event. A self-sustaining chain reaction (i.e., criticality) will not result in an atomic explosion.
However, it can result in the generation of harmful radiation that can cause death or serious injury (Ref. 54). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The issue of criticality relates to the types of containers used to store the fissionable materials or suspect fissionable
materials and the storage area. EPA is proposing to amend 761.65(c)(6) by allowing an alternative to the container
requirements approved by the Department of Transportation (DOT) for PCB/fissionable radioactive wastes. Containers
used to store liquid PCB/fissionable radioactive wastes would have to be nonleaking. Containers used to store both
liquid and non-liquid PCB/fissionable radioactive wastes would need to be designed to meet nuclear criticality
safety requirements such as those specified in the American National Standard for Nuclear Criticality Safety in
Operations with Fissile Materials Outside Reactors (ANSI Standard No. 8.1). The standard currently includes polyethylene
and stainless steel as acceptable container materials providing they are chemically compatible with the wastes
being stored. Some containers designed to prevent the buildup of liquids could be used to store non-liquid fissionable
PCB/radioactive wastes, provided they are stored in an area which would contain any spilled liquids. If any such containers
were found to be leaking, their contents would have to be transferred immediately to non-leaking containers, and
the leaked or spilled materials cleaned-up taking into account relevant safety procedures appropriate for radioactive
materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is also proposing to amend 761.65(b)(1)(ii) to allow storage areas for PCB/fissionable radioactive wastes to
meet performance criteria for containment volume rather than specific requirements for curb height. This amendment
would retain the current requirements that facilities storing PCB/fissionable radioactive wastes store those
materials in a storage area meeting the containment volume requirements equal to at least two times the internal volume
of the largest PCB container stored therein or 25 percent of the total internal volume of all PCB containers stored
therein or whichever is greater, but would not impose curb height requirements for these wastes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters stated that PCB/radioactive wastes may also contain additional materials such as asbestos that
cannot be incinerated. EPA believes that technology exists which allows PCBs to be separated from other materials
(e.g., radioactive waste or asbestos). EPA recommends that whenever possible PCBs be separated from other wastes;
however, today's proposal does not contain requirements for separating PCBs because guidance for separating PCBs,
from water for example, already exists. EPA had developed a policy allowing the physical separation of PCBs from other
wastes, so long as all waste parts separated from the original PCBs are regulated (TSCA Compliance Program Policy
6&hyph;PCB&hyph;2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter indicated that EPA does not have the jurisdiction to regulate radioactive PCBs under TSCA. EPA agrees
in part and disagrees in part. TSCA section 3(2)(B)(iv) states that the term ``chemical substance'' does not include
``any source material, special nuclear material, or byproduct material (as such terms are defined in the Atomic Energy
Act of 1954 and regulations issued under such Act).'' Generators of PCB/radioactive waste are subject to regulatory
oversight for radioactive materials under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 as amended (DOE or NRC). EPA, on the other hand,
has regulatory oversight for PCBs under TSCA. Thus, generators of PCB/radioactive waste must comply with both EPA
and NRC regulations, State requirements, or DOE Orders. Mixtures of radioactive PCB molecules and non-radioactive
PCB molecules that cannot be separated are subject to TSCA and the AEA because, for regulatory purposes, when separation
of the PCB molecules is not achieved, the statutory exemption does not extend to nonradioactive PCBs in a mixture.
It should be noted that regulation of PCB/radioactive mixtures under TSCA and the AEA applies to both wastes and non-wastes.
The NRC and DOE participated in the development of this section in order to ensure compatibility between TSCA and AEA.

In the ANPRM, EPA solicited comments on whether to establish a household waste exemption under TSCA, and information
regarding current PCB uses that are not authorized in the regulations. Items 1 and 2 below discuss the household waste
exemption and unauthorized use issues. In responding to these issues, several commenters raised questions regarding
the disposal requirements for certain items containing PCBs; these issues are addressed under Item 3.

 Household waste exemption.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA solicited comments in the ANPRM on whether a household waste exemption, similar to the household waste exclusion
under RCRA at 40 CFR 261.4, should be established under the TSCA PCB disposal regulations. The RCRA household waste
exclusion exempts from the hazardous waste requirements any material that was derived from households (including
single and multiple residences, hotels and motels, bunk houses, ranger stations, crew quarters, campgrounds, picnic
grounds, and day use recreation areas). Examples of household waste under the RCRA exclusion include garbage, trash,
and sanitary wastes in septic tanks. Under the RCRA criteria, household waste is limited to: (1) Waste generated by
individuals on the premises of a household, and (2) waste composed primarily of materials found in the wastes generated
by consumers in their homes (49 FR 44978, November 13, 1984). Additionally, EPA sought comments on the types of PCB
wastes for which such an exemption would be applicable. In today's notice, EPA is proposing a household waste exemption
for any waste containing PCBs generated by individuals on the premises of private households (including single or
individually owned or rented units of a multi-unit construction) primarily found in wastes generated by consumers
in their homes, i.e., domestic wastes (see proposed regulatory text at 761.3 and 761.63). This change in the PCB regulations
would authorize private homeowners, including individually owned or rented units of a multi-unit construction,
to dispose of their unwanted household items that contain hazardous and toxic wastes under a municipal solid waste
collection program without fear of recrimination even though the homeowner may have knowledge of the existence of
PCBs in the household appliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA received roughly a dozen comments, and all but two supported the establishment of a household waste exemption.
Some commenters provided additional caveats on how such an exemption should be structured. Comments in favor of the
household waste exemption essentially fell into four categories: (1) Broadly define the scope of the exemption,
(2) consider the impact of the exemption on recycling activities, (3) limit the scope of the exemption, and (4) address
other disposal considerations (i.e., the disposal of materials containing PCBs used in the construction of residential
buildings). Commenters not in favor of the TSCA proposal for an exemption questioned whether there should be a household
waste exemption under either TSCA or RCRA, and whether the volume of waste containing PCBs which was generated from
households was significant enough to warrant an exemption. EPA's responses to the four broad categories of comments
are provided below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Broadly define exemption
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Those in favor of establishing a household waste exemption suggested broadly defining the activities that would
qualify for the exemption. One commenter suggested EPA use the definition for ``Municipal solid wastes'' found at
761.3 to define the scope of the household waste exemption. Municipal solid wastes are defined as ``garbage, refuse,
sludges, wastes and other discarded materials resulting from residential and non-industrial operations and activities,
such as household activities, office functions, and commercial housekeeping wastes.'' However, if such a change
was made, the exemption would include items EPA believes should not be excluded from regulation (e.g., PCB wastes
from offices and commercial activities). Another commenter stated that commercial buildings should also be included
in a household waste exemption because the wastes generated at these buildings may be from the same sources and types
of equipment found in the household. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The effect of banning the manufacture, processing, and distribution in commerce of PCBs, coupled with actions taken
to limit the use of PCBs, focuses the Agency's concern on activities where the continued use of PCBs has been authorized
(i.e., industrial or commercial-scale settings such as utilities, manufacturing sites, construction/renovation/demolition
projects, etc.) rather than on household settings where appliances with PCBs may not generally be found (Ref. 32).
Additionally, industrial and commercial-scale PCB disposal activities, because of the risks associated with the
greater volume of PCB wastes generated by these activities, require a level of protection for health and the environment
that can best be achieved through demonstrated and effective PCB destruction and containment technologies. Therefore,
EPA is not persuaded that a broadly defined household waste exemption, encompassing large volumes of commercial-scale
PCB wastes, would be protective of health and the environment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Impact on recycling activities.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter stated that the exemption should include waste generated by households but diverted or removed from
the wastestream for purposes of recycling. Another commenter stated EPA should control the recycling and storage
of household waste (e.g., increase the storage timeframe from 1 to 2 years). The final set of comments associated with
this category suggested EPA take steps to encourage municipal collection programs for PCBs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The recycling of household waste contaminated with PCBs surfaced as a national issue during 1985&hyph;86 when the
problem of PCB contamination in shredder fluff (i.e., the non-metallic residue from the shredding process) was first
identified. Since that period, EPA has conducted a pilot study of the shredding industry to ascertain, among other
things, the source of the PCB contamination (Ref. 34). When the fluff contamination problem first surfaced, PCB Small
Capacitors in household appliances were thought to be the source of the contamination. Therefore, data search/collection
activities were initiated to determine the types of appliances that would most likely contain PCB Small Capacitors.
The results of these efforts indicated that PCB Small Capacitors were not used in most household appliances. However,
EPA determined that there was a significant likelihood that PCB Small Capacitors could be found in room and central
air conditioners, heat pumps, furnace blowers, fluorescent lighting ballasts, and microwave ovens (Refs. 32 and
33). As a result, many States have implemented PCB Small Capacitor removal programs to ensure that PCBs are not intentionally
processed during shredding operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In proposing a TSCA household waste exemption, EPA recognizes that some objects that contain a PCB component may inadvertently
be shredded, resulting in fluff containing PCBs. EPA is proposing at 761.62(b) that this residue when tested and found
to be contaminated at levels of 50 ppm PCB or greater, but measuring less than 50 micrograms per liter (ppb) when using
RCRA's Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (see 40 CFR part 261 Appendix II) may be disposed of in a facility
that is permitted, licensed, or registered by a State as a municipal or industrial waste landfill. However, shredder
residue when tested and found to contain 50 ppm or greater PCBs must be managed pursuant to the current disposal requirements
at 761.60. (Additional disposal options for this type of waste are proposed at 761.62 and discussed at Unit II.A.5.
of this preamble.) Under the current regulations, the processing and distribution in commerce of PCBs is prohibited
unless otherwise authorized by rulemaking or under a PCB exemption. The proposed household waste exemption authorizes
these activities for household wastes containing PCBs. The processing of non-exempt, non-household items such
as commercial or industrial grade appliances containing PCBs, fixtures from renovation or demolition projects,
and industrial or heavy duty equipment containing PCBs would continue to be a violation of the PCB regulations. EPA
is not encouraging the processing and subsequent dilution of PCBs by recycling facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a May 31, 1979, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice, EPA explained that the random disposal of PCB Equipment in municipal solid waste sites by householders and
other infrequent disposers did not present an environmental hazard (44 FR 31528). On the other hand, EPA determined
that the disposal of large quantities of PCB Small Capacitors posed a somewhat larger risk, and commercial and industrial
activities were encouraged to establish a voluntary collection and disposal program. EPA would therefore include
in the household waste exemption wastestreams created by recycling operations that accepted only wastes composed
of household items from private residences (see the discussion under Unit II.D.1.c., ``Limit Scope of the Exemption''
of this preamble). Therefore, the owner or operator of a recycling facility should establish contractual requirements
or other appropriate notification or inspection procedures to ensure that PCB wastes not covered under the exemption
(e.g., commercial or industrial appliances containing PCBs or fixtures from demolition or renovation projects,
industrial, or heavy-duty equipment containing PCBs) were not processed at the facility. In any event, the owner
or operator of such a facility would be subject to an enforcement action should such waste be processed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Municipal collection programs accepting only those wastes that satisfy the proposed exemption criteria could operate
under the TSCA household waste exemption; the TSCA chemical waste landfill and incineration requirements would
not apply to the disposal of these wastes (see the discussion under Unit II.D.1.c., ``Limit Scope of the Exemption''
of this preamble). Because disposal of the wastes collected under a municipal solid waste program that satisfy the
criteria proposed for the exemption would not be regulated by this rule, the wastes could be disposed of in a facility
which is permitted, licensed, or registered by a State to manage municipal or industrial waste. As a result, the commercial
storage approval requirement and compliance with the TSCA PCB 1&hyph;year time limit for storage and disposal limitation
would not apply. Therefore, EPA does not see a need to extend the storage timeframe from 1 to 2 years as suggested by one
commenter.

 Limit scope of the exemption.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A few commenters stressed the need to restrict the applicability of a household waste exemption to purely residential
settings in order to exclude business activities that take place in a residence. Another commenter believed the exemption
should be identical to the RCRA household waste exclusion. EPA has interpreted the RCRA Subtitle C rules at 40 CFR 261.4
as limiting the exclusion to those household wastes that meet two criteria: (1) The waste must be generated by individuals
on the premises of either a temporary or permanent household, and (2) the waste must be composed primarily of materials
found in wastes generated by consumers in their homes. The RCRA exclusion at 40 CFR 261.4(b) includes ``household
waste from single and multiple dwellings, hotels and motels, and other residential sources.'' The RCRA hazardous
waste program, in establishing a household waste exclusion, acted upon a Congressional intent to ensure that wastes
generated by consumers in their households would be exempt from the Subtitle C regulation. As a result, the RCRA exclusion
included materials from single and multiple residences, hotels, motels, bunkhouses, ranger stations, crew quarters,
campgrounds, picnic grounds, and day use recreation areas _ locations at which consumer activity is of a type that
would be conducted in a residential setting and result in the generation of hazardous wastes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As commenters have suggested, EPA is proposing an exemption under TSCA for the disposal of household wastes containing
PCBs that is similar, but not identical, to the RCRA exclusion. Like the RCRA exclusion, the TSCA exemption would not
include non-residential PCB wastes such as commercial or industrial grade appliances containing PCBs, fixtures
from demolition or renovation projects, and industrial or heavy duty PCB Equipment. Under TSCA, Congress sought
to eliminate the use of PCBs, unless specifically authorized, by banning their continued manufacture, processing,
and distribution in commerce. However, Congress intended that the use of equipment which contained PCBs in a totally
enclosed manner not be terminated prior to the end of the equipment's useful life. As stated earlier, research conducted
by EPA suggests that some refrigerators and household freezers, room and central air conditioners, heat pumps, furnace
blowers, fluorescent lighting ballasts, and microwave ovens may contain PCB Small Capacitors. The risks associated
with the disposal of those items containing PCB Small Capacitors in a random, geographically dispersed manner by
individual homeowners were considered by EPA in mid-1977 when it proposed the PCB Small Capacitor exemption. EPA
has re-evaluated this issue twice subsequent to that time and has determined that the exemption should remain in place
(see the discussion at Unit II.D.3.c. of this preamble). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The distinction that EPA makes between the TSCA household waste exemption, which focuses on consumer products used
by individuals in private residences, and the RCRA household waste exclusion, which focuses on consumer activity
conducted by private individuals in temporary or permanent residences, is based on the continued belief that the
unregulated disposal of large quantities of PCB Items such as light ballasts and PCB Small Capacitors by commercial
and industrial activities presents an environmental risk (see 42 FR 26568, May 24, 1977; 43 FR 7152, February 17, 1978;
44 FR 31528, May 31, 1979 and the discussion on the disposal of small capacitors at Unit II.D.3.c. of this preamble).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under RCRA, the risks associated with consumer activities that result in the generation of hazardous waste do not
change when the activities are conducted in a single or multiple residence, hotel, motel, bunkhouse, ranger station,
crew quarters, campgrounds, picnic grounds, or day use recreation areas. These are all locations at which the consumer
activity is of a type that would be conducted in a residential setting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the PCB household waste exemption under TSCA, EPA believes that the unregulated disposal by individual households
of consumer products which contain PCBs should be exempted from the TSCA disposal requirements because there are
relatively few household products that would contain PCBs. The proposed exemption would not apply to individuals
who reside in transient settings because they would likely not dispose of household appliances that would contain
PCBs (e.g., certain refrigerators and household freezers, room and central air conditioners, heat pumps, furnace
blowers, fluorescent lighting ballasts, and microwave ovens). Rather, equipment containing PCBs obtained for
use in transient settings would likely be of a commercial grade and disposed of in quantity. Therefore, the removal
and disposal of equipment containing PCB Small Capacitors by commercial activities and entrepreneurial interests
such as hotel and motel chains and owners of multiple unit residential buildings engaged in repair, renovation, and/or
demolition projects, would not be covered by this exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA considered excluding from the TSCA household waste exemption PCB wastes found in a home-based business, but has
determined that PCB Items found in a private residence would likely be evident in these smaller business enterprises
as well. That is, industrial-scale manufacturing activities would not normally be conducted in a residential setting.
If, however, such was the case, only those PCB Items commonly found in a private household would be covered by this exemption.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although EPA proposes to establish an exemption under TSCA for the disposal of household waste, the public is reminded
of the CERCLA reporting requirement for PCBs at 40 CFR 302.6 that essentially requires individuals to contact the
National Response Center when they are disposing of 1 pound or more of PCBs in any 24-hour period in a non-federally
permitted facility. The TSCA household waste exemption does not relieve an individual (i.e., the person disposing
of the waste and/or the owner of the disposal facility) of the liability for remediating PCB contamination if the non-federally
permitted disposal facility becomes a future Superfund site. Therefore, EPA is seeking comments on whether additional
limitations should be imposed when defining entities that would qualify for this exemption.

 Other disposal considerations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter, although not objecting to the exemption, suggested EPA should focus on the previous residential applications
of PCBs, such as a wall painted with PCB-containing paint, and the item's sale, destruction, and disposal. The proposed
TSCA household waste exemption would not apply to debris produced during building construction, renovation, or
demolition and similar type wastes, since such wastes do not consist primarily of materials found in wastes generated
by a consumer in his/her home. Disposal options for this large-volume waste are discussed under Unit II.A. of this
preamble.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA also sought comments in the ANPRM on widespread PCB applications that had not been addressed when the original
regulations were developed. EPA was particularly interested in obtaining information on current, but unauthorized
uses of PCBs. Nearly a dozen sets of comments were submitted from four primary sources: Natural gas pipeline companies,
the Armed Forces, civilian governmental agencies, and companies from the industrial sector. Items currently in
use and identified by the commenters as containing PCBs included wool felt insulating materials which have high levels
of PCBs and deck plates that are found on naval vessels; plastics, paints, small rubber parts, adhesive tape, and insulating
materials used in electrical cabling, for example; PCB-impregnated gaskets in heating, ventilation and air conditioning,
and other duct systems; concrete expansion joint materials, and large-diameter natural gas pipeline. Several distinct
``unauthorized use'' scenarios emerged based on a review of the comments and discussions with EPA Regional representatives.
These scenarios and the proposed regulatory provisions addressing these uses are discussed below.

. During the late 1940s through 1950s, the adhesive coating used on ventilation gaskets for use in the Department of
War (a predecessor of the Department of Energy (DOE)) heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems
was impregnated with PCBs to comply with the Department of War's specifications. This application was not in violation
of the ban on the manufacture, use, processing, or distribution in commerce of PCBs because it occurred prior to the
enactment of TSCA and promulgation of the implementing regulations. However, in late 1989, DOE notified EPA that
over time, operation of their plants had caused small amounts of the lubricating oil (from motor and compressor bearings)
to leach through the gasket material and to be drawn into the ventilation system, resulting in releases of material
containing PCBs.

 The Department of the Navy discovered that wool felt containing PCBs had been installed in older submarines for sound-dampening
purposes. Information provided to EPA by the Department of the Navy indicates no PCBs are emitted from the material
and that the material is generally located in inaccessible or rarely accessed areas, fixed between metal plates.
The Navy's current policy is to remove the material only when necessary (i.e., during maintenance).

 Agency experience.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Experience gained in implementing the PCB requirements has resulted in the identification of other uses of PCBs that
are not authorized by the regulations. Issues have arisen over time concerning the use of PCBs in paint formulations,
coatings for ceiling tiles, roofing, and siding materials, adhesives, waterproofing compounds, and any number
of other chemical uses such as additives and plasticizers. The recent discovery of asbestos roofing and siding materials
and insulating (potting) material in fluorescent light ballasts that contain PCBs are illustrations of the Agency's
expanding knowledge of the applications for PCBs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In November 1992, EPA was informed of the discovery of PCBs in asbestos roofing and siding materials that had been manufactured
by H. H. Robertson (circa 1917) and marketed as Robertson Protected Metal (RPM) and Galbestos. RPM and Galbestos are
multilayered steel siding materials that consist of steel, asphalt, or zinc (depending on the product line); asphalt-impregnated
asbestos felt; and an asphaltic waterproof coating. Although there is limited evidence available that PCBs were
ever introduced in the manufacturing process, preliminary sampling and analysis have indicated PCB concentrations
in this material ranging from 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
&lt;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2 ppm to 30,000 ppm. These products were purchased and used internationally by the U.S. Department of Defense (Department
of War, U.S. Navy, U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Marine Corps), U.S. Coast Guard, Tennessee Valley Authority, and
various industries such as airlines, railroads, chemical plants, steel mills, mines, and industrial/manufacturing
facilities. Manufacturing facilities for RPM and Galbestos products were located in Beaver Falls, PA, and subsequently
relocated to Ambridge, PA, as well as in Canada and England. Preliminary data suggests that the continued use of this
material, if in good condition, and subsequent disposal in a municipal solid waste landfill, would not present an
unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment (see ``Toxic Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP)
for Galbestos Siding Material'' MRI Report, Project No. 9802&hyph;30&hyph;01, August 16, 1993 [Ref. 45]).

Also, in August/September 1993 EPA received data from several sources indicating that PCBs were found in the insulating
(potting) materials of fluorescent light ballasts generally manufactured prior to 1978. PCBs at concentrations
of 50 ppm or greater were found in the insulating materials of approximately 70 percent of the ballasts analyzed. While
this data represents only a small portion of ballasts manufactured prior to 1978 still in use today, the continued
use of such ballasts would need to be authorized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing at 40 CFR 761.30(q) to authorize the use and distribution in commerce of non-liquid materials which
contain PCBs at any concentration (including, but not limited to, gaskets, insulation, plastics, plasticizers,
fluorescent light ballast potting materials, electrical cable, dried paints, small rubber parts, adhesive tape,
caulking, roofing and siding materials, waterproofing compounds, and ceiling tile coatings) in use prior to July
2, 1979, for the remainder of their useful life where monitoring indicates that the migration of PCBs from the material
does not pose an unreasonable risk of injury. Under the proposed authorization, the PCB-containing materials must
remain intact and in place in their existing application and location unless they are being removed for disposal.
The authorization of continued use and distribution in commerce of these PCB materials do not include an authorization
to remove the material from its existing location and subsequently reassemble or install the PCB material at a different
location but would allow for continued use in a mobile application such as a vehicle or vessel. Such PCB materials currently
in use that exhibit significant PCB migration, as discussed in proposed 761.30(q)(1)(iii), (iv) or (v), would not
be in compliance with this authorization and would be required to be removed, contained by means of encapsulation
(either with an epoxy-based or equivalent paint or sealant), or equipped with release controls in which a continual
release is collected in a closed container and displaces only the air in the container (i.e., a leak collection system)
to ensure personnel are protected from dermal and inhalation exposures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the owner or operator of a facility with such a use of PCB material would be required to notify the Regional
Administrator of the discovery of such material and submit documentary evidence that established the historical
use of such material. Notification to the Regional Administrator would be required within 30 days of the effective
date of the final rule or within 30 days of discovery thereafter. It would be required to include the location of the
material, a description of its use, an estimate of the amount of material in use (e.g., number, square footage, pounds),
the PCB concentration, expected useful life of the material, the condition of the material (e.g., potential for exposure),
and any additional information that might be useful to the Regional Administrator. Secondly, the owner or operator
of the facility would be required to post a PCB Mark ML as described in 761.40 in a prominent location near material containing
PCBs as a warning of the presence of PCBs. They would also be required to make available to any potentially exposed employee
and, upon request, to any other potentially exposed individual, information concerning the identity of the PCBs
and any health risk associated with the PCB application. Failure to provide documentary evidence that substantiated
the historical use of such material might result in the rejection of such claims by the Regional Administrator. Consequently,
the continued use of such materials might be a violation of the PCB regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Air monitoring readings and standard wipe test samples of exterior surfaces would have to be taken and recorded quarterly
for the first year and annually thereafter until the material was removed. Records would be maintained in a central
location at the facility for 3 years beyond the date of removal of the material for review by EPA officials. Air monitoring
results of PCB levels above 0.001 milligram per cubic meter of air (mg/m

) would require that action be initiated within 24 hours of the occurrence to modify the release controls, to re-encapsulate
the surface, or to remove the PCB-impregnated materials. In addition, individuals would be required to notify the
EPA Regional Toxics Office by facsimile machine or overnight delivery mail services within 24 hours of the occurrence
of an environmental release that exceeded the action levels listed above. The notification would indicate the actions
that would be taken to bring the facility into compliance. However, if the release occurred during a weekend or Federal
holiday, notification could be made during the next business day. This notification would not be in lieu of any other
Federal, State, or local notification requirements such as those under CERCLA for the release of a hazardous substance
(see 40 CFR 302.6). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the end of their current useful life, all such PCB materials with a PCB concentration of 50 ppm or greater, and materials
that came in contact with 50 ppm or greater PCBs, including leak collection systems, PCB-containing paint and other
encapsulation materials, and all materials used during decontamination or cleanup procedures would have to be handled,
stored, and disposed of in accordance with the PCB storage requirements at 40 CFR 761.65 and the disposal requirements
at 761.60 or 761.62. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the continued use of unauthorized pre-TSCA PCB materials is a violation of the existing PCB regulations, in
most cases, premature removal of the media containing PCBs could only be achieved with great difficulty and at enormous
expense given the extraordinary efforts that would be required to remove the PCBs. The conditions proposed by EPA
for the continued use of these items (i.e., removal upon evidence of deterioration, installation of release controls,
or encapsulation) would ensure no unreasonable risk from exposure to PCBs as a result of the continued use of these
materials. Comments are therefore solicited on whether consideration should be given to developing authorizations
for the conditional, continued use of these materials and whether additional restrictions should be imposed and
if there are other situations which are similar to the pre-1978 authorization issues which should be addressed in
this rulemaking. Comments are also solicited on whether the proposed authorization should allow for the movement
and reassembly of the PCB-Containing material when such movement and reassembly will not adversely impact the integrity
of the material (e.g., will not result in a risk of injury to health or the environment caused by the exposure to PCBs).
Comments supporting a modification of the proposed authorization should also provide examples of the specific material
and reuse scenarios that should be addressed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has no information indicating that PCBs were routinely used in the formulation of consumer products such as household
paints, sealants, finishes or caulking. It believes however, that consumers could now occasionally obtain products
such as industrial enamels or marine paints which were formulated with PCBs, through the purchase of these items as
surplus. The sale of these unauthorized items containing PCBs is currently prohibited under TSCA. Identification
and removal of these materials, once installed in households, could pose considerable costs to homeowners while
increasing risk of exposure through removal. Because the PCBs are bound into these materials, EPA believes they would
not pose a serious risk of exposure if left in place. Therefore, EPA is proposing a general use authorization at 761.30(q)(2)
for the non-liquid PCBs that meet the definition of household wastes at the time of disposal. In unit II.A. of this preamble
EPA discussed a proposed exemption for the disposal of household wastes containing PCBs. Today, EPA is also proposing
a general authorization for continued use at 761.30(g)(3) for non-liquid items that do not leach PCBs at levels

 Reuse of natural gas pipeline.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA received comments on both the reuse of and the disposal requirements for natural gas pipeline. A discussion concerning
the disposal of natural gas pipeline appears at Unit II.D.3.e of this preamble. Regarding the reuse of pipeline, commenters
contend that the inadvertent contamination of natural gas pipeline at or above regulated levels for PCBs all but eliminates
any opportunity for the natural gas industry to reuse the pipe and other natural gas pipeline appurtenances. Requirements
to dispose of or decontaminate the equipment often deprive these companies of the economic benefits associated with
recycling, reusing, or selling the equipment. EPA, under a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC), has been reviewing pipeline abandonment plans and issuing alternate disposal permits
for the decontamination of pipeline since late 1987. Based on this experience, EPA does not view risks of injury to
health and the environment from exposure to PCBs due to the continued use of PCB-Contaminated pipeline as being unreasonable.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PCBs when found in natural gas pipeline are generally located in the condensate that is collected from drips and geographical
low points along the pipeline or in the moisture on the interior of the pipe. Since these collection points are often
dry, EPA is proposing, as an alternative for characterization purposes, surface levels of greater than 10 micrograms
PCB per 100 square centimeters for dry pipe as the regulatory equivalent of 50 ppm, and 100 micrograms PCB per 100 square
centimeters in dry pipe as the regulatory equivalent of 500 ppm with regard to the TSCA PCB regulatory requirements
at part 761 (characterization of natural gas pipeline is discussed at Unit II.B.4. of this preamble). EPA is proposing
to amend 761.30(i) to authorize the reuse of natural gas pipeline systems, provided the liquids have been removed.
All removed liquids must be disposed of pursuant to the disposal requirements at 761.60(a)(3). EPA solicits comments
on whether EPA should require marking of pipe that may be in temporary storage while testing is being conducted. Pipe
in temporary storage is generally capped at each end and stacked in a restricted area along the perimeter of the pipeline
system. EPA solicits comment on whether the Agency should require each pipe in a temporary storage area to be marked
or whether only posting a sign in the storage area would be adequate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In today's notice at 761.30(i), the reuse of PCB-Contaminated natural gas pipeline and appurtenances would be allowed
in natural gas pipeline systems. Natural gas pipeline and pipeline appurtenances that were to be reused would have
to be drained of free-flowing liquids and decontaminated pursuant to procedures proposed in 761.30(i). Any natural
gas pipeline may also meet the decontamination level as proposed in 761.79(d). Based on experience gained from issuing
alternate disposal approvals to pipeline companies, EPA is also proposing several additional uses. Acceptable
proposed reuse scenarios are for the transport of bulk hydrocarbons, chemicals, or petroleum products; as a coal
slurry pipeline; as casing to provide secondary containment under transportation systems such as highways or railroads;
as temporary flume at construction sites; as culverts (less than 80 feet in length) in intermittent flow situations
(i.e., as culvert for a driveway over a roadside ditch); as equipment skids; for sewage service with written consent
of the Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTW); for steam service; in totally enclosed compressed air systems; as irrigation
systems where the pipe is less than 20 inches in diameter and 200 miles in length; or as industrial structural material
such as fence posts, sign posts, gate posts, bridge supports, and overhead sign cross members. In addition to commenters'
reactions as to whether natural gas pipeline should be authorized for reuse in these scenarios, EPA solicits comments
on the other specific uses for which this pipe would be suitable. The reader should remember that the reuse provision
is intended for contaminated equipment which is drained of all free flowing liquid (i.e., the surface is dry) and the
surface contamination is demonstrated to be less than 100 micrograms PCBs per 100 square centimeters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is also proposing a parallel authorization for the use of PCBs in other pipelines or air compressor systems, with
the consent of the Regional Administrator. The Agency is aware of the use of PCBs as lubricants in other air compressor
systems not associated with natural gas pipelines and believes that these uses pose no greater risk.

. The disposal of non-liquid, bound materials, such as plastic insulating material containing PCBs found in electrical
cabling and lead (Pb) cable insulated with PCB oil-soaked paper, were also identified by commenters to the ANPRM as
issues that are not adequately addressed by the current regulations. Since the ANPRM, EPA has also received comments
addressing the disposal requirements for the relatively small quantity of waste generated during the chemical analysis

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter requested that EPA designate these materials as unregulated for disposal. The PCB concentration encased
in this solid plastic insulating material ranges from less than 50 ppm to 500 ppm PCBs. The commenter argues that non-liquid,
bound PCB materials are distinct from liquid PCBs and that the current exemption at 761.60(b)(2)(ii) that allows
persons, except manufacturers, to dispose of PCB Small Capacitors in municipal landfills should be extended to cover
manufactured items containing non-liquid, bound PCB materials. Alternatively, the commenter argues that the PCB
bound plastic insulation should be treated as ``other PCB Articles'' having a PCB concentration between 50 and 500
ppm pursuant to the current 761.60(b)(5)(ii). The commenter suggests that these bound PCB materials should be viewed
as having been drained of free flowing liquid and should be treated as unregulated for disposal under that section.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, EPA is proposing provisions at 761.62 to address the disposal of PCB non-remediation wastes using one of
four options: Incineration, chemical waste landfill, municipal solid waste landfill, or a disposal method approved
by the Regional Administrator. Under this provision, the Regional Administrator could approve an alternate disposal
method based, among other things, on technical, environmental, or waste-specific characteristics or considerations
indicating that the disposal method would not pose an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment. EPA
believes that this provision would provide the flexibility being sought by the commenter, and that expansion of the
current exemption would therefore be unnecessary.

 Disposal of cable insulation containing PCBs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Another commenter informed EPA of lead-sheathed cable containing PCBs in the oil-soaked paper that is used to wrap
the copper conductors; the PCB levels typically range from 50 to 500 ppm with some levels reported as exceeding 100,000
ppm. Discarded lead cable is potentially stored for long periods of time, pending changes in the metals market, and
then ultimately sent to scrap yards where the metal is removed and sold to recycling operations. The scrap yards then
burn the PCB-soaked paper without regard to its PCB content. This may result in illegal disposal and site contamination
by PCBs, dioxins, and dibenzofurans. Further, cables that are not contained in a conduit are often abandoned in place.
The cable is ripped out to a convenient point, cut, and abandoned with no protection at all for the cut end. The PCB-containing
oil will often leak, as free flowing oil, from the paper when the cable is cut or the covering damaged, thereby creating
environmental concerns when cable runs are abandoned or old cable is improperly stored or disposed of. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the information submitted by the commenter, lead cable is used in high voltage distribution of electric
power, typically 5,000 volts and above. This cable has been in use for quite some time (about 100 years), and although
lead cable can be found everywhere, including in overhead distribution lines, the product typically was used in underground,
submerged, or submersible applications. In particular, lead cable was used to supply primary power to vaulted network
distribution systems and subway transformers. Almost all utilities serving metropolitan areas and most large industrial
facilities either currently own or have owned significant quantities of lead cable. Large commercial facilities
that distribute primary power also have lead cable.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 25, 1982 (47 FR 37352), EPA promulgated 40 CFR 761.30(m) to authorize the use of PCBs in, and the servicing
of, cable containing any concentration of PCBs for the useful life of the cable provided the cable is serviced (including
rebuilding) only with dielectric fluid containing less than 50 ppm PCBs. This provision was based in part on a study
conducted by the Edison Electric Institute (EEI) and the Utilities Solid Waste Activities Group (USWAG) that described
voltage regulators, switches, electromagnets, and cable as mineral oil-filled electrical equipment, not designed
to contain PCB dielectric fluid. The rulemaking record indicates that this oil-filled cable generally contained
less than 50 ppm PCBs (Previous Rulemaking Record Ref. 6, Support Document for the Electrical Equipment Use Rule,
Response to Comments, August 1982). Although this oil-filled cable was authorized for use until it reached the end
of its lifecycle, EPA required that the disposal requirements at 40 CFR 761.60 and the servicing requirements at 761.30(m)(2)
be followed for any cable found to contain a PCB concentration of at least 50 ppm. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the issue being raised by the commenter suggests that other types of electrical cable containing PCBs
may exist that were not anticipated when 761.30(m) was promulgated. As reflected at Unit II.D.2. of this preamble,
proposed 761.30(q) would expressly allow the continued use of electrical cable, in a totally enclosed manner, until
it reached the end of its useful life. However, the installation of materials containing PCBs as insulation and the
processing and distribution in commerce, except for purposes of disposal, would continue to be unauthorized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are solicited on whether EPA should include electrical cable under the proposed authorization to be inserted
at 761.30(q) or expand its interpretation of the current authorization at 761.30(m) to include, in addition to oil-filled
cable, all electrical cable containing PCBs such as electrical cable encased with PCB-impregnated insulation materials,
and lead cable containing PCB oil-soaked paper. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also welcomes information on any other electrical cable containing PCBs, including its uses, PCB concentrations,
and potential risks of exposure to workers, the general public, and the environment. For example, high-voltage cable
used in underground coal mines may have been manufactured with PCBs in the conductor insulation. In 1954, the U.S.
Bureau of Mines published fire-resistance standards for underground electrical equipment. In addition to requiring
non-flammable liquid [e.g., PCB dielectric fluid] in liquid-filled transformers, the Bureau also published a fire
test procedure which was mandatory for ``trailing cables,'' or electric cables that are reeled out the back of mobile,
high-voltage mining equipment such as continuous miners and shuttle cars (Ref. 56). The fire resistance test was
considered prudent because trailing cables, which lie on the mine floor, are often damaged by equipment travel and
can short out, causing an electrical fire. While the Bureau did not specify how such cable should be made, experience
with naval vessels indicates that such cable could have been manufactured with PCBs to meet the test standards. Some
of this cable may still be in use or may be abandoned with other electrical equipment in mine storage areas or in closed
mines. An environmental hazard would exist if the cable is improperly disposed of. A hazard to workers would exist
from inhalation of the fumes during an electrical short or from dermal contact when splicing cable. Therefore, EPA
is seeking comment from any person who may know of past uses of PCBs in electrical cables. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to concerns raised about handling lead cable, EPA cannot emphasize strongly enough that caution must
be exercised when handling any electrical cable which contains PCBs. First, caution must be exercised when servicing
the cable to prevent the inadvertent release of PCBs into the environment. In this instance, restrictions attendant
to the disposal of lead complicate the PCB disposal process, as environmental releases must be controlled when separating
the PCB and lead materials to ensure further contamination is avoided. Further, to ensure the PCBs are not reintroduced
into commerce, the lead cable must be decontaminated to remove the residual PCBs prior to sending it to a recycling
operation. The processing and distribution in commerce for the purpose of disposal of regulated PCB wastes and their
destruction require an approval (i.e., permit) from EPA (see 761.20(c)(2) and 761.60(a)). Owners and operators
of scrap yards who engage in activities to decontaminate the cable (i.e., to remove the PCBs) and/or destroy PCBs at
concentrations of 50 ppm or greater through the practice of ``open burning'' may be subject to an enforcement action
and are conducting these activities in violation of the TSCA permit requirements if they do not possess a PCB disposal
approval. Finally, owners and operators of recycling operations who accept lead cable containing PCBs for processing
are operating in violation of the TSCA ban on processing PCBs if they have not obtained an exemption for their activities
(see 761.20(c)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The disposal activities identified by the commenter are currently regulated under the TSCA PCB regulations at 40
CFR part 761 to include abandonment in place, storage, disposal, permitting, and manifesting requirements for PCB
wastes at concentrations of 50 ppm or greater. Therefore, from a regulatory perspective, no further rules are required
to address the disposal of this cable. However, an outreach program designed to reach scrap and salvaging operations
may be the most appropriate mechanism to ensure the owners and operators of these facilities are educated about their
responsibilities regarding the TSCA PCB disposal approval requirements and potential liabilities under CERCLA
for environmental releases of PCBs. EPA solicits the cooperation of the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries,
Inc. (ISRI) and any other individuals, organizations, or associations in developing a comprehensive mailing list
of facilities to whom such an outreach program could be directed.

 Disposal of small capacitors.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Another commenter suggested that EPA define the disposal requirements for PCB Small Capacitors and then cross reference
these disposal requirements to the CERCLA requirements for reporting releases of hazardous substances. The TSCA
disposal requirements for PCB Capacitors are provided at 761.60(b)(2); CERCLA reporting requirements for hazardous
substance releases are listed at 40 CFR 302.6. The regulations in 40 CFR 302.6(a) state: ``Any person in charge of a
vessel or an offshore or an onshore facility shall, as soon as he has knowledge of any release (other than a federally
permitted release or application of a pesticide) of a hazardous substance from such vessel or facility in a quantity
equal to or exceeding the reportable quantity determined by this part in any 24&hyph;hour period, immediately notify
the National Response Center ((800) 424&hyph;8802; in Washington, DC (202) 426&hyph;2675).'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since PCBs are a hazardous substance with a reportable quantity (RQ) of 1 pound under CERCLA, the question becomes
which scenarios constitute a ``release'' under CERCLA. In the case of fluorescent light ballasts containing PCB
Small Capacitors, open or closed drums of light ballasts collectively containing 1 pound or more of PCBs, that are
abandoned or otherwise disposed of, such as through placement in a municipal solid waste landfill, would generally
be regarded as a reportable release under CERCLA. One point should be made clear; unlike TSCA or RCRA, CERCLA imposes
no disposal requirements itself on the initial disposal (i.e., release) of hazardous substances such as PCBs, even
if the release is in excess of the RQ for that substance. For specifics regarding the reporting requirements for the
release of hazardous substances under CERCLA, readers are advised to contact EPA's Superfund/RCRA Hotline, which
is the information service for the Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response in Washington, D.C. (Toll-free (800)

In promulgating the disposal and marking rule published on February 1978 (43 FR 7150), EPA decided not to impose special
disposal requirements for small capacitors (except those owned by capacitor manufacturers or PCB Article manufacturers
in which the small capacitor was placed as a result of manufacturing activities) due to problems associated with regulating
this class of PCB wastes (e.g., enforcement difficulties, the expense associated with their collection/disposal,
and issues surrounding the question of who should incur these costs). In reassessing whether steps should be taken
to further limit the small capacitor exemption, EPA determined not to impose additional regulatory controls (44
FR 31528, May 31, 1979). However, because the disposal of large quantities of PCB Small Capacitors by commercial and
industrial activities posed a somewhat larger risk to the environment than disposal by householders and other infrequent
disposers, EPA encouraged commercial and industrial firms to establish a voluntary PCB Small Capacitor collection
and disposal program that would result in the disposal of these capacitors in either a chemical waste landfill or an
incinerator. EPA still recommends disposing of fluorescent light ballasts containing intact and non-leaking PCB
Small Capacitors in an approved hazardous waste incinerator or an approved chemical waste landfill. Persons who
can dispose of such fluorescent light ballasts under the household waste exemption should consider utilizing local
hazardous waste collection efforts sponsored by city/county health departments, local fire departments or other
local government entities for disposal of these items. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the current regulations, PCB Small Capacitors found in light ballasts generally are not required to be disposed
of in a TSCA approved disposal facility (see 761.60(b)(2)(ii)). Readers are, however, advised that State and local
governments may impose more stringent disposal requirements on items containing PCB Small Capacitors such as fluorescent
light ballasts and are advised to determine all other disposal requirements prior to undertaking disposal. EPA's
Office of Air and Radiation has developed guidance addressing these activities in conjunction with its ``Green Lights
Program'' (Ref. 53). Once a PCB Small Capacitor starts leaking, it is regulated for disposal under 761.60(d) as a PCB
Article and must be disposed of according to the disposal rules for PCB Articles at 761.60(b)(5) (Ref. 57). Also, 761.60(b)(2)(iv)
identifies another exception: ``Any PCB Small Capacitor owned by any person who manufactures or at any time manufactured
PCB Capacitors or PCB Equipment and acquired the PCB Capacitors in the course of such manufacture shall be disposed
of in ... an incinerator which complies with 761.70 or until March 1, 1981, ... in a chemical waste landfill which complies
with 761.75.'' In practice, this means that, except for manufacturers of capacitors or manufacturers of equipment
containing small capacitors, any quantity of intact, non-leaking small capacitors may be disposed of in a municipal
landfill. As mentioned earlier in this section, EPA reevaluated the scope of the small capacitor exemption and determined
not to impose additional regulatory controls. In the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice of May 31, 1979 (44 FR 31528), EPA also warned readers that any PCB spillage that might result from failure of,
or from damage to small capacitors, could be considered illegal disposal, as is the case for other spills of PCBs. If
the insulating material inside the ballast, sometimes referred to as ``potting'' material, contains PCBs at greater
than or equal to 50 ppm, then the entire ballast is regulated for disposal under current rules even if the internal small
capacitor remains intact and nonleaking. Many facilities are disposing of light ballasts or their capacitors in
TSCA incinerators to avoid the potential for Superfund liability should today's municipal landfills become subject
to future CERCLA cleanup action. Therefore, EPA proposes to include a statement in 761.60(b)(2)(vii) in response
to the commenter's suggestion that the PCB regulations cross reference the CERCLA requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the publication of the ANPRM, EPA has received a TSCA section 21 petition from several fluorescent light ballast
recyclers and the Hazardous Waste Treatment Council (Ref. 49). The petitioners requested that disposal requirements
for intact and non-leaking small capacitors in fluorescent light ballasts at 761.60(b)(2)(ii) be amended to require
incineration of fluorescent light ballasts or incineration of the PCB Small Capacitors or PCB potting materials
removed by recycling the fluorescent light ballasts. EPA granted their petition and stated its intention to initiate
a regulatory investigation to determine whether or not to amend the PCB Small Capacitor disposal requirements at
761.60(b)(2)(ii) (Ref. 50).

As noted earlier, EPA has discussed the disposal and phaseout of PCB Small Capacitors in various rulemakings. In 1979,
EPA encouraged firms disposing of large quantities of PCB Small Capacitors to establish a voluntary collection and
disposal program resulting in the waste capacitors going to chemical waste landfills or high temperature incinerators
(44 FR 31514, 31528, May 31, 1979). In 1982, EPA revisited the issue of small capacitors, this time in regard to their
potential phaseout. EPA concluded that because many of these PCB-containing small capacitors are encapsulated
and contain minimal quantities (0.1 to 0.6 pounds) of fluid and a significant amount of absorbent materials such as
paper, PCBs are rarely released from the capacitors during their use or from equipment using the capacitors. Therefore,
EPA determined the exposure risks to humans, food, feed, water, and the environment were low (47 FR 37342 and 37349,
August 25, 1982). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In their petition, petitioners raised a number of issues for which EPA is seeking information regarding the proposed
amendment of the disposal requirements for intact and non-leaking PCB Small Capacitors, specifically those in fluorescent
light ballasts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, the petitioners indicated that the PCBs are not only found in small capacitors but in the potting material of
fluorescent light ballasts as well. EPA is seeking data on the level of PCBs found in the potting materials of fluorescent
light ballasts and whether the PCBs were in the potting material prior to recycling, i.e., were the PCBs in the potting
material because of a rupture of the PCB Small Capacitor. EPA is also seeking data on the percentage of ballasts recycled
that contain PCBs in either a small capacitor and/or the potting material, as well as the concentration of PCBs in the
potting material. EPA is also seeking information regarding the manufacture of light ballasts that have PCBs in their
potting materials, i.e., date of manufacture, PCB concentration, etc. However, any additional disposal requirements
for fluorescent light ballasts with PCB Small Capacitors become moot if the ballast potting material contains PCBs.
Fluorescent light ballasts with PCBs in their potting material meet the definitional requirements of PCB Articles
under 761.3 and the disposal requirements for such items are already prescribed at 761.60(b)(5). If PCBs 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
50 ppm are found in the potting materials of fluorescent light ballasts, the issue of continued use becomes a significant
problem because such PCBs are not authorized for use under 761.30. However, PCBs found at 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
&lt;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
50 ppm (and not the result of dilution) in the potting compound would qualify the fluorescent light ballast as an ``Excluded
PCB Products'' as defined at 761.3. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, if EPA determines that additional disposal requirements need to be placed on fluorescent light ballasts
containing PCB Small Capacitors, the number of ballasts that may be disposed of as municipal solid waste within a 1-year
period needs to be determined. EPA is proposing at 761.60(b)(2)(viii) that any person may dispose of up to 25 intact
and non-leaking fluorescent light ballasts containing PCB Small Capacitors as household waste in a municipal solid
waste landfill within a 1-year period from a single household. The number 25 was chosen because under CERCLA the reportable
quantity (RQ) for PCBs is 1 pound (40 CFR 302.4). If an estimate of approximately 2/3 ounce of PCBs in each small capacitor
is used, 25 small capacitors equals just over 1 pound or the RQ for CERCLA. This number could be lower, such as 10 ballasts
within a 1&hyph;year period as the petitioners suggested or higher, such as 3,000 per month which approximates the
100 kg per month small quantity exemption under RCRA. EPA is seeking information on the number of fluorescent light
ballasts containing PCB Small Capacitors that should be allowed to be disposed of in a municipal solid waste landfill.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, on a related issue, the petitioners indicated that fluorescent light ballasts containing PCB Small Capacitors
sent to municipal solid waste landfills do not remain intact and nonleaking once they are placed in the landfill. EPA
is seeking data indicating that the disposal practices at a municipal solid waste landfill, such as compaction, will
cause the PCBs to leak into the environment. If true, EPA is seeking data in support of statements that the PCBs leaking
from small capacitors in municipal solid waste landfills can create a risk to health and the environment through ground
water contamination. Such information should include the degree of risk reduction that could be achieved, the costs
of risk reduction methods, and the impacts of any regulation on the economy, small businesses and other affected entities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Large volume PCB liquids.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA also received a request to address the issue of disposal options for large volume liquid PCB wastes. Under current
regulations at 761.60(a)(3), liquids at concentrations of 50 to 499 ppm may be disposed of in a high efficiency boiler
meeting the requirements of 761.60(a)(3)(iii), in an incinerator meeting the requirements of 761.70, or a chemical
waste landfill (CWL) meeting the requirements of 761.75, if information is presented to the CWL owner or operator
that the fluid does not exceed 500 ppm and is not an ignitable waste as described in 761.75(b)(8)(iii). However, the
commenter was referring to industrial sludges at 500 ppm or greater that must be disposed of by incineration or by an
alternate method that has been demonstrated to be the equivalent of incineration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In responding to a citizens petition under section 21 of TSCA that had been submitted to EPA on behalf of several potentially
responsible parties to a Superfund cleanup (Refs. 5 and 6), the Agency indicated that ``[a]s a matter of policy, EPA
in 1985 determined to treat industrial sludge similarly to PCB liquids.... Under this policy, PCB-Contaminated
industrial sludges may be placed in a TSCA landfill complying with 40 CFR 761.75, while sludges contaminated at greater
than 500 ppm must be disposed of in a TSCA incinerator complying with 40 CFR 761.70.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed earlier in this rule (see the discussion on ``Large Volume PCB Wastes'' at Unit II.A. of this preamble),
EPA is proposing to consider the site-specific risk factors in determining the appropriate disposal mechanisms
for PCB remediation wastes, a category of wastes which includes industrial sludges.

 Abandonment and disposal of natural gas pipeline.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 There are approximately 1.5 million miles of natural gas pipeline in the United States, including approximately
275,000 miles of interstate transmission line with the remainder comprising local distribution systems. Several
thousands of miles of pipeline are removed from service every year for a variety of reasons. One commenter suggested
``that the regulations should allow for the abandonment in place of all distribution mains after removal of any liquids
by reasonable means and the sealing of the ends of each segment of pipe.'' This commenter also suggested that the disposal
requirements for drained hydraulic machinery and drained natural gas pipeline should be equivalent. Another commenter
stated that 761.60(b)(5)(ii), which addresses disposal of ``Other PCB Articles,'' should be revised to say ``the
handling, storage, and disposal of the drained article (gas pipeline) is not regulated.'' Moreover, one commenter
suggested EPA revise the definition for PCB Items ``so that natural gas pipelines can be regulated in a manner more
in line with the risks presented.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A review of the history of the regulation of PCBs in natural gas pipelines is needed to put these comments into perspective.
The use of PCBs in natural gas pipeline compressors and in the liquids found in natural gas pipeline is authorized at
concentrations below 50 ppm (761.30(i)). The current authorization does not extend to the use of PCBs in air compressor
units that are routinely found at natural gas compressor stations. EPA believes that the risk of exposure associated
with other PCB Articles such as hydraulic equipment are much different than the risk of exposure to the end-users of
natural gas containing PCBs or the reuse of pipeline containing PCBs. In a final rule published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 31, 1979 (44 FR 31536), EPA authorized the use, including servicing, of PCBs in natural gas pipeline compressors
at levels above 50 ppm until May 1, 1980. The authorization was intended to give individuals time to drain and refill
these compressors with non-PCB fluid to further reduce the PCB concentration below 50 ppm. EPA determined that ``[b]ecause
of the small quantities and low concentrations of PCBs involved, ... this authorization will not result in exposure
to PCBs that presents an unreasonable risk to health or the environment.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1981, EPA found that industry practices continued to result in the use of PCBs in at least 13 natural gas pipeline
transmission systems at concentrations above 50 ppm, and in some instances above 500 ppm, in violation of the PCB regulations.
To address the elevated levels of PCBs found in the pipeline systems, EPA implemented remedial plans with four basic
objectives: (1) To contain the contamination to limited areas of the transmission system; (2) to eliminate any further
entry of PCBs into the system; (3) to remove remaining PCB contamination from these systems; and (4) to ensure proper
handling of PCBs that were removed. Each of these 13 interstate pipelines were originally presumed to contain PCBs
at levels greater than 50 ppm. Data collected since a 1981 compliance program was implemented showed the levels to
be, in fact, greater than 500 ppm. This presumption did not extend to other interstate pipelines or to associated distribution
system pipelines. Further, on July 10, 1984 (49 FR 28185), EPA amended the regulations to allow the continued use of
PCBs at less than 50 ppm in the natural gas compressors and liquid of natural gas pipelines provided the compressors
are marked in accordance with 761.45(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, commenters questioning the disposal requirements are advised that, when the natural gas pipeline has
been operated in compliance with the PCB use authorization (i.e., the compressor and liquids contain less than 50
ppm), the handling, storage, and disposal of these items are currently not regulated. Reuse of this pipeline, such
as for culverts, is not currently authorized by these rules; however, reuse of pipeline is specifically addressed
in Unit II.D.2.b. and generally addressed in Units II.A.5. and 6. of this preamble. Items containing PCBs at levels
of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
50 ppm are subject to the disposal requirements at 40 CFR 761.60. However, PCB-Contaminated Articles that have been
drained of all free flowing liquids could still be abandoned in place under proposed 761.60(b)(6)(ii), as under current
761.60(b)(5)(ii), but not used or reused. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Local distribution system pipe frequently shares public rights-of-way, thus underlying major public infrastructures
such as roadways, water lines, sewer lines, and telephone and electrical service lines. Unlike interstate transmission
lines, testing and removal of some distribution lines have a great potential for causing prolonged disruption of
other utilities sharing these rights-of-way. Today's proposal at 761.60(b)(5) would allow segments of either interstate
or distribution natural gas pipelines to be abandoned in place along these rights-of-way if certain activities were
undertaken to limit the risk of exposure. EPA believes that it is not a function of who owns the pipeline but rather how
disruptive a removal would be that is the determining factor for allowing abandonment in these circumstances. DOT
requires that natural gas pipeline abandoned in place must be disconnected from all sources and supplies of gas; purged
of gas (but not liquids); in the case of local distribution lines, physically disconnected from the customer; and
sealed at both ends (49 CFR 192.727). EPA believes that these requirements do not provide protection from exposure
to pipe containing PCBs, even of the small diameters routinely found in local distribution systems because the distribution
company may lose physical control of the pipeline containing PCBs after abandonment. EPA specifically requests
data on levels of PCB contamination in local distribution systems and the protection from exposure to PCBs afforded
by the DOT requirements for abandonment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA proposes at 761.60(b)(5)(i)(A), that when levels of PCB contamination cannot be determined because condensate
samples cannot be collected and the pipe is too small (having an inside diameter of 4 inches or less) to be accurately
wipe sampled, the pipe may be abandoned in place if it is either filled to 50 percent of its volume with grout or high density
polyurethane foam and sealed closed at each end, or sealed closed at each end and included in a public service notification
program, such as a ``one-call'' underground utility warning program under DOT regulations at 49 CFR 192.614. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal also provides a series of options for the removal with subsequent disposal or decontamination of pipeline
containing PCBs and defines procedures for determining the level of contamination and whether the pipeline contains
liquid. PCB-Contaminated natural gas pipeline, i.e., pipeline containing or contacting PCBs at concentrations
of 50 &hyph;

100 micrograms PCB per 100 square centimeters, or natural gas pipeline containing PCBs at any concentration and having
an inside diameter less than or equal to 4 inches could be disposed of in a solid waste landfill or an industrial furnace.
In addition, natural gas pipeline containing PCBs at any concentration could be disposed of in a TSCA chemical waste
landfill, a TSCA incinerator, by a TSCA approved alternate disposal method, or as a PCB non-remediation waste in compliance
with proposed 761.62. Pipe containing or contacting PCBs at concentrations of less than 50 ppm or with surface concentrations

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 937 F.2d 649 (D.C. Cir. 1991)], is proposing to clarify the disposal requirements relating to solvents used in decontamination
procedures. Current regulations at 761.79(a) explicitly require the disposal of solvents used to decontaminate
PCB containers in a TSCA approved facility once the PCB concentration in the solvent reaches 50 ppm PCBs. Section 761.79
does not address the disposal requirements for solvents used to decontaminate that do not reach 50 ppm. Existing rules
at 761.1(b) require solvents used in decontamination to be disposed of as PCBs regardless of the final concentration
of PCBs in the solvent. Such solvents have been in contact with PCBs and as such are regarded as containing the concentration
of the original PCBs because of the principle of anti-dilution. The PCB rules currently contain no other provisions
for decontamination; however, EPA has approved various decontamination-like activities under 761.60(e). PCB
disposal approvals for decontamination-like activities, issued under 761.60(e), specify disposal requirements
for solvents. In the Rollins Circuit Court decision, the disposal requirements for solvents that contain less than
50 ppm PCB used to decontaminate PCB containers were found to be unclear. In order to clarify this situation, EPA is
proposing to amend the provisions at 761.79 to allow hydrocarbon solvents containing less than 50 ppm PCBs to be used
in accordance with the provisions for used oil as outlined in 761.20(e) or to be decontaminated themselves through
processes such as filtration.

 Disposal of waste generated during the chemical analysis of PCBs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Chemical analysis is needed to determine PCB concentrations for the purposes of determining compliance with the
PCB regulations; characterize PCB contamination; determine the effectiveness of various decontamination and
treatment technologies; and determine PCB levels in humans and their food chain. The chemical analysis of PCBs includes
sample preparation, sample extraction, extract concentration, extract cleanup, addition of PCB standards, and
instrumental analysis. There are several possible wastestreams resulting from the chemical analysis of PCBs: excess
sample, potentially contaminated drying agent (anhydrous sodium sulphate), extract solvent removed during extract
concentration (acetone, hexane, methylene chloride, etc.), cleanup column packing materials (alumina, florisil,
etc.), cleanup liquids (concentrated sulfuric acid), glassware, filtering materials, extracted sample material,
and excess extract. In addition, analytical instrumentation is contaminated and therefore regulated if regulated
PCBs are analyzed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The relatively small amount of PCBs extracted in a sample is often diluted significantly in most potential laboratory
wastes, and most wastes that cannot be recycled contain materials that should absorb PCBs. Extraction of small amounts
of PCBs resulting from PCB analysis would likely be more burdensome than disposal in a controlled disposal facility
and would result in less reduction in risk. Therefore, EPA is proposing at 761.64 special disposal provisions for
laboratory waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All samples, including extracted sample material, would remain regulated for disposal, but could be returned to
the site of generation for disposal according to the concentration measured in the sample. EPA is also proposing to
permit, under certain conditions, the recycling for reuse of limited quantities of organic solvents used in the chemical
analysis process described above. This change would result in cost savings to the laboratory by not having to replace
used solvent, that could otherwise be safely and economically recycled by distillation within the laboratory, and
would also result in minimization of laboratory waste solvents for disposal. In addition, EPA is proposing to allow
the disposal of small quantities of non-liquid waste according to their existing (or presumed) concentration even
though that concentration is known to be the result of dilution from performance of chemical analysis. EPA believes
that the relatively small quantity of these wastes which are generated, their low concentrations of PCBs in non-liquid
materials, and the significant quantity of materials in the non-liquid waste which would absorb PCBs present make
disposal of these materials in a RCRA approved or TSCA approved landfill a safe and economical option.

 h. Transboundary movement of PCBs for disposal.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA periodically receives requests from individuals wishing to import or export PCBs for disposal. Current regulations
at 40 CFR 761.20(b)(2), promulgated under section 6(e)(1) of TSCA, authorize the import or export for disposal of
PCBs only at concentrations less than 50 ppm. EPA believes there are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instances where the import or export for disposal of PCBs at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
higher concentrations would not pose an unreasonable risk of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injury to health or the environment. EPA therefore proposes to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amend 761.20(b)(2) and add 761.20(b)(3) to create certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categorical exceptions to the general ban on import for disposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of PCBs at 50 ppm or greater and to clarify what constitutes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
import or export for purposes of this regulation. This proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would also establish a petition procedure under proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
761.20(b)(4) and (c)(3) under which other imports and exports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for disposal could be allowed on a case-by-case basis. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section of the proposal would not alter the current ban on import 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or export of PCBs at 50 ppm or greater for purposes other than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal (including import for use, reuse, or recycling), or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affect the meaning of the terms ``import'' or ``export'' for any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other provisions of TSCA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 When EPA addressed the issue of import and export for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal in 1979, it noted that regulation of these types of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities could be accomplished under TSCA section 6(e)(1), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which governs disposal activities, or alternatively under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6(e)(3), which governs manufacture and import activities (44 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
31514, 31526 (May 31, 1979)). Based upon the authority in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 6(e)(1), EPA elected to issue comprehensive regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that temporarily authorized the import and export of PCBs for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal, otherwise known as the ``Open Border Policy.'' EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decided not to extend these regulations in 1980 and they expired 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(45 FR 29115 (May 1, 1980)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1984, EPA issued the current PCB regulations that address 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
import and export for disposal (40 CFR 761.20(b) and 761.60(h)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 761.60(h) provides that the import and export of PCBs and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PCB Items for purposes of disposal are regulated under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
761.20. Section 761.20(b)(2) authorizes only the import or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
export for disposal of PCBs at concentrations of less than 50 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ppm. The current rules do not authorize import or export for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal of PCBs at higher concentrations. In the absence of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general rule that allows the import or export for disposal of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such PCBs, the only way that such wastes may currently be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imported or exported is if EPA grants an exemption pursuant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TSCA section 6(e)(3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule is designed to control the transboundary movement of PCB waste in a manner consistent with the Basel Convention
on the Control of Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is requesting comment on the circumstances under which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the U.S. border should be opened to transboundary shipments of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PCBs for disposal. The options range from allowing all imports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for disposal under section 6(e) to maintaining the current closed border 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
status, and might include opening the border to PCBs from a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited geographic area such as the Great Lakes drainage basin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's proposal, if finalized, would retain the general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prohibitions on import and export of PCB wastes at concentrations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 50 ppm or greater, with certain exceptions described below.

In the Tariff Schedules, ``customs territory of the United States'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is defined as ``any State of the United States, the District of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Columbia, and Puerto Rico.'' Thus, a problem arises when a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
territory or possession which is outside the customs territory of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the United States attempts to ship PCB wastes back into the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
customs territory of the United States for disposal. Any such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transfer of such PCB wastes at concentrations of 50 ppm or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greater would be considered a prohibited import under existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. This is problematic because most United States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
territories and possessions outside the customs territory do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have adequate disposal facilities. Since PCBs persist in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment, improper disposal of PCBs in those territories or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possessions could create an unreasonable risk to health or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment in the territory or possession of the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, EPA proposes to allow transfers of PCBs from United 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States territories or possessions that are outside the customs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
territory of the United States into the customs territory of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
United States for disposal.

 Imports of PCBs for disposal where EPA determines that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it is in the interests of the United States and will not result 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in unreasonable risks to health or the environment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In addition to the categorical exceptions listed above, there may be instances in which it would be in the interests
of the United States to allow import of PCBs for disposal. This might be the case where PCBs were located outside the
United 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, but in close proximity to the United States, and adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal facilities were not available in the country in which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they were located. Import of the PCBs into the United States for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal might be in the interests of the United States to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mitigate an unreasonable risk to health or the environment in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
United States that could not be mitigated by other means. It 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
might be in the interests of the United States to allow import of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PCBs for disposal to implement a federal law such as CERCLA, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to carry out United States obligations under a treaty or other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
international agreement. EPA would not be inclined to find that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
import for disposal was in the interests of the United States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solely because disposal of the PCBs in this country was less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expensive. EPA proposes to allow imports for disposal that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the interests of the United States on a case-by-case basis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where they would not pose an unreasonable risk of injury to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health or the environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under its section 6(e)(1) authority to regulate disposal, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA proposes to allow these case-by-case exceptions to the ban on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
import for disposal of PCBs at concentrations of 50 ppm or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greater at EPA's initiative or in response to a petition. Under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed 761.20(b)(4), any person may petition EPA for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exception to the prohibition on import for disposal, and EPA may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grant such an exception if it finds that to do so would be in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interests of the United States and would not result in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitions would be filed with the Director, Chemical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management Division. The Director has the authority to issue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TSCA PCB disposal approvals in certain instances and is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsible for coordination and oversight of PCB disposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities in the United States. Therefore, the Director is in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the most advantageous position to require proper disposal of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imported PCBs. Petitions would have to be submitted on an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual basis for each individual that would be subject to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exception. If EPA determined that it was appropriate to create a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categorical exception, it could do so by adding through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking to the categorical exceptions proposed at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
761.20(b)(2) and (b)(3). Information to be included in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petition is specified at proposed 761.20(b)(4)(i) through (vii). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner would be notified of EPA's decision by letter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To implement the proposed 761.20(b)(2) through (4), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is also proposing at 761.20(b)(5) that all PCBs at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentrations greater than or equal to 50 ppm that are imported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for disposal must be disposed of in an EPA designated facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which has a TSCA PCB disposal approval. Each facility's TSCA PCB 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal approval would have to contain specific conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addressing at a minimum its designation to receive specified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shipments of imported PCBs for disposal, analytical data on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastes to be imported including their compatibility with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility's approved waste disposal techniques, prior notification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and certification to EPA of adequate disposal capacity, use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the manifest system, provisions for financial responsibility for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the imported PCBs from the port of entry through final disposal, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate recordkeeping for these activities, and any other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions that EPA found were necessary to ensure that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
import and disposal of PCBs did not present an unreasonable risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of injury to health or the environment. Since EPA cannot easily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reach foreign generators of imported PCBs to enforce liability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions of TSCA or other Federal statutes and cannot be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assured that shipments of imported PCBs could be returned to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their country of origin if they could not be disposed of at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designated facility, conditions would be included in disposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approvals to address these situations. Imported PCBs could also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be decontaminated under the proposed changes to 761.79. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the PCBs would have to be imported to a commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage facility which had a PCB commercial storage approval, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unless exempt, including special approval conditions for imported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastes, as noted above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Export.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 When EPA announced the expiration of the Open 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Border Policy in 1980 it stated, with regard to exports, that it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not grant an exemption unless the nation to which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
export was destined had proper facilities for ultimate disposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(See 45 FR 29115). EPA believes that export of PCBs to other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
countries needs to be limited so as not to pose a risk of injury to
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health or the environment in those countries and that to the maximum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extent practicable, each nation should manage its own waste within its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
own borders. Therefore, EPA is proposing at 761.20(c)(3) to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allow export for disposal of PCB waste at concentrations of 50 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ppm or greater on a case-by-case basis unless EPA has reason to believe that the PCBs in question will not be properly
managed, where the receiving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
country has an international agreement consistent with the international obligations of the United States relating
to transboundary movements of PCBs and their disposal, with the U.S. Government concerning such exports; the government
of the receiving country certifies to EPA that it has received accurate and complete information about the waste,
consents to receive it, and has adequate disposal facilities to assure proper management; and the exporter identifies
waste containing liquid PCBs or PCB-containing electrical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment. As an example, vessels are sometimes exported for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
salvage of the considerable amounts of metal they contain. PCBs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present in integral components of the ships, such as wire cable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or air handling system gaskets, could be exported with the ship 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under conditions specified in the export approval. EPA could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require as a condition of approval for export that PCBs found in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
large capacitors, transformers, and hydraulic or heat transfer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fluids, be removed prior to export for disposal. EPA could allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such exports for disposal on its own initiative or in response to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a petition. Other information that would have to be included in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the petition is set out at proposed 761.20(c)(3).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposal would clarify that PCB waste generated in the United States may be transported through a foreign country
and returned to the United States for disposal. For example, PCB 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste generated in Michigan could be transported across Canada 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for disposal in New York. Any residual PCB waste resulting from

the cleanup of spills that might occur in transit could also be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brought into the United States for disposal. Otherwise, it would

be impractical and inefficient to transport PCBs generated in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain parts of the United States to nearby United States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal facilities. This provision is included in 761.20(b)(3) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a clarification. For purposes of this regulation, EPA

resulting from cleanup of spills occurring during use, while in

 Landfilling of liquid PCBs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA proposes to remove the provisions allowing for the disposal of liquid PCBs, which have been stabilized on-site
prior to disposal, at a chemical waste landfill, 761.60(a)(2)(ii), 761.60(a)(3)(ii), and 761.75(b)(8)(ii). These
provisions were established in the May 31, 1979 rulemaking, since at the time of the rulemaking there was a limited
number of incinerators permitted to burn PCB waste and disposal capacity was a concern. Currently, and as can be reasonably
expected in the future, the amount of low concentration PCB liquids anticipated to be designated for disposal and
in storage for disposal can easily be accommodated within the existing and anticipated future PCB disposal technologies
other than landfilling. The existing PCB disposal and storage for disposal regulations and the amendments proposed
in this rulemaking are expected to accommodate the surplus in the disposal capacity supply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further support for this deletion of a disposal option for liquid PCBs having low PCB concentrations is the prohibition
on landfilling liquid hazardous wastes containing PCBs under the RCRA land disposal restrictions at 40 CFR 268.42.

. This change would eliminate the time-consuming process of obtaining an R&amp;D approval in order to engage in limited
R&amp;D into PCB disposal. R&amp;D for PCB disposal not conforming with the limitations of this section would require
written approval or written waiver of the requirements of a 761.60(e), 761.60(i)(2), or 761.70(a) or (b) approval
by the Regional Administrator in the EPA Region where the R&amp;D would occur. Persons engaged in research and development
into PCB disposal technologies would now be required to obtain an EPA identification number. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA proposes at 761.60(j) a self-implementing approval for research and development (R&amp;D) for PCB disposal
activities. Limitations are proposed for the amount of PCB material disposed of, the concentration of the PCBs disposed
of, the total amount of PCBs, and the duration of the R&amp;D for disposal activity. All treated and untreated PCB materials
from a PCB R&amp;D for disposal activity would be required to be disposed of according to 761.60(a)-(e).

 An individual engaged in R&amp;D for PCB disposal activities is someone who is not accepting PCB waste on a commercial
scale; the person is involved solely in the R&amp;D for preliminary investigation and limited scale up of PCB disposal
technologies and may or may not possess a TSCA PCB R&amp;D Approval issued according to 761.60(e), 761.60(i)(2),

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Limitations.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is proposing at 761.60(j) that the maximum quantity used annually under this exemption for PCB treatability study
samples be 70 cubic feet for solid material or 500 gallons for liquid material. This should be a sufficient amount of
material for conducting small-scale treatability studies. If additional material is needed to conduct the study,
the Regional Administrator may at his or her discretion grant requests on a case-by-case basis for quantity limits
in excess of those specified or require a formal R&amp;D approval if the increased quantity could present an unreasonable
risk to health or the environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to a quantity cut-off, EPA is proposing at 761.60(j) to limit the maximum concentration for PCB waste that
is used in a treatability study to 10,000 ppm for those utilizing the 500 gallon or 70 cubic feet volume cap or 1 kilogram
(kg) of pure PCB waste annually at the facility. It has been EPA's experience in the past in reviewing applications
for R&amp;D approvals and in discussions with those in the waste treatment field, that it is rare that one would need
a sample that contains more than 10,000 ppm PCBs to conduct a small-scale treatability study. The concentration limits
are also proposed based on the Agency's concern with the potential risks associated with the distribution in commerce
(without a manifest) and handling of high concentration PCBs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is also limiting the approvals under proposed 761.60(j) to one calendar year to evaluate the progress and scope
of the R&amp;D and to plan for potential formal permitting of successful technologies.

 Permitting and exceeding the limitations.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under the proposal, a the laboratory conducting the treatability study conforms to the criteria of 761.60(j), then
it is not subject to the permitting requirements of 761.60(e), 761.60(i)(2), or 761.70(a) or (b). The Agency feels
that the criteria in proposed 761.60(j) coupled with the applicable provisions of OSHA regulations at 29 CFR part
1910 provide adequate oversight and protection to health and the environment to forego the need for formal permitting.
The Regional Administrator or Director, CMD would, however, have the authority even in cases where the R&amp;D activity
would not exceed the maximum allowable volume (500 gallons of liquid or 70 cubic feet of solid) or the maximum allowable
concentration (10,000 ppm or 1 kg of pure PCB), to require the requestor to submit a formal permit application if the
disposal activity could present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment. Under proposed 761.60(j),
the Regional Administrator in the Region in which the R&amp;D disposal activity is proposed would have to be informed
in writing at least 30 days prior to the commencement of the disposal activity.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following issues were identified in the ANPRM as items where changes may be appropriate. These revisions include
providing clarification on certain provisions (e.g., the 1&hyph;year time limit for storage and disposal requirement)
and amending the regulations where appropriate, eliminating seemingly duplicative requirements (e.g., marking),
and creating new provisions to promote efficiency in disposal operations (e.g., temporary storage of greater than
500 ppm PCB liquids). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Marking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations at 761.40(b) and (e) essentially express the same requirements with regard to the marking of transport
vehicles when loaded with PCBs in the liquid phase at concentrations of 50 ppm or greater. In the ANPRM, EPA solicited
comments on the best remedy for this regulatory duplication. In response to the ANPRM, commenters expressed general
support for EPA's overall objective to clarify the language and eliminate duplication in the marking regulations.
Several commenters suggested that both 761.40(b) and (e) be deleted and totally rewritten. Other suggestions included
combining the paragraphs, rewriting both subsections, or deleting one and updating the other. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In today's proposal, EPA proposes to eliminate this duplication by combining references to the marking requirement
for transport vehicles at 761.40(b) and (e) under proposed paragraph (d), thus leaving the requirements for the remaining
PCB Items under paragraph (e). This amendment would not result in any substantive change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, EPA has determined that Large Low Voltage Capacitors often are not identified and disposed of properly at
the time of removal, because they are not required to be marked while in use. Therefore, EPA is proposing to strengthen
the marking requirements for Large Low Voltage Capacitors to include those still in use. Because of these identification
and disposal concerns, the Agency is proposing at 761.40(k) that all PCB Equipment in use containing PCB transformers
or PCB Large Capacitors be marked with the mark ML. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is also aware of reports that PCB Capacitors were not marked because they were assumed not to contain PCBs.
To clarify what capacitors must be assumed to contain PCBs, EPA is proposing to amend the definition of ``Capacitor''
in 761.3 to clarify that a capacitor whose PCB concentration is unknown generally must be assumed to contain 500 ppm
or greater PCBs. This should make it evident to readers that this rule applies to the marking, use, and recordkeeping
requirements, and not just disposal.

B. Department of Transportation Containers for Storage of PCB Waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, the regulations at 761.60(b)(2)(vi) and 761.65(c)(6) specify the use of Department of Transportation
(DOT) specification containers for PCB storage and disposal. Section 761.65(c)(7)allows liquid PCB waste to be
storedin containers that are larger than the DOT containers specified at 761.65(c)(6), provided they meet OSHA requirements
(761.65(c)(7)(i)). In addition, a Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) Plan must be prepared and
implemented in order for these larger containers to be used. For non-liquid PCB waste, containers larger than those
specified in 761.65(c)(6) may be used, if they provide as much protection against leaks and exposure as the DOT containers,
and they are of the same relative strength and durability. In short, the current regulations require the most durable
containers be used for storing and/or transporting PCBs, which in most cases, and in particular when storing PCB/radioactive
waste, may not be the best alternative (See discussion at Unit II.C._PCB/Radioactive Waste). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing to amend 761.60(b)(2)(vi) and 761.65(c)(6) by deferring to the DOT container requirements for the
storage and transportation of PCBs. EPA proposes to eliminate all citations to specific container type and to cross
reference the new performance-based DOT container requirements set forth in the DOT Hazardous Material Regulations
(HMR) at 49 CFR Parts 171&hyph;180. EPA regulates PCBs at a much lower concentration than DOT. Therefore, EPA would
also like to emphasize that although some material may not be subject to DOT regulations, part 761 would still require
these materials to be packaged in accordance with the DOT regulations, that is, in DOT authorized containers. PCBs
are shown in the Hazardous Materials table at 49 CFR 172.101, in Packing Group II. However, under those regulations
PCBs that are transported by highway or rail need only be packaged pursuant to Packing Group III. PCB/radioactive,
PCB/fissionable material, PCB/mixed waste, and PCB/hazardous waste not packaged in accordance with the HMR are
not allowed to be transported. Additionally, readers are advised that the HMR as amended on December 21, 1990 (55 FR
52402) prohibits the construction of DOT specification packaging previously designated for the storage of PCB waste
(i.e., DOT Specification 5, 5B, 6D, 17C, 17E, and 17H containers) effective October 1, 1994. Further, transportation
of PCBs in these outdated DOT specification containers is not authorized beyond September 30, 1996. Although most
commenters agreed with EPA's decision to defer to DOT, one commenter suggested that EPA continue to list all containers
authorized by DOT. However, such an approach would defeat EPA's objectives in amending the PCB rules which are to provide
flexibility to industry and to minimize the resource burden associated with updating the PCB regulations each time
DOT modifies its requirements.

C. Definition of a PCB Transformer and PCB-Contaminated Electrical Equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment to the definition of a PCB Transformer at 761.3 provides: ``PCB Transformer means any transformer
that contains 500 ppm PCBs or greater. A transformer is a PCB Transformer if: the nameplate indicates that the transformer
contains PCB dielectric fluid; the owner or operator has any reason to believe that the transformer contains PCB dielectric
fluid; or the transformer dielectric fluid has been tested and found to contain PCBs at 500 ppm or greater. A transformer
is assumed to be a PCB Transformer if: the transformer does not have a nameplate; records do not exist that indicate
the type of dielectric fluid; or records do not exist that indicate the PCB concentration.'' In order to clarify the
current definitions of ``PCB-Contaminated Electrical Equipment'' (specifically PCB-Contaminated Transformer
within this definition) at 761.3, EPA is proposing incorporate into this definition the provisions of the ``assumption
rule'' in this preamble to the PCB to the PCB Ban rule (44 FR 31517, May 31, 1979).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA inspectors have suspected that some owners of transformers are abusing the ``assumption rule'' to avoid the stricter
disposal requirements of 761.60. An example of such an avoidance technique is the removal of the manufacturer's nameplate
or other identifying information that could be used to classify a transformer as PCB. Additionally, the possibility
exists that a transformer may have been serviced with fluid containing 500 ppm PCBs or greater. For purposes of clarification,
``records'' as used above refers to servicing records, manufacturers certifications and/or other data that would
indicate or impact PCB concentration. Generally, commenters expressed support for EPA's effort to clarify the existing
definition of a PCB Transformer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the current definition of PCB-Contaminated Electrical Equipment at 761.3 which includes ``oil-filled
electrical equipment,'' has been misinterpreted to mean that a transformer with any oil in it could be assumed to be
PCB-Contaminated (50 to 499 ppm). To further clarify this definition, the Agency is proposing to add the word ``mineral''
before the words ``oil filled''. In addition, language would be added to this definition which states that ``a transformer
is assumed to contain PCBs at 500 ppm or greater, if it is an untested mineral oil transformer and reasons exist to believe
that the transformer was at any time serviced with fluid containing PCBs at 500 ppm or greater.'' Historically, mineral
oil transformers encompassed the vast majority of non-askarel transformers; however, over time the types of non-askarel
transformers have expanded to include, for example, silicone filled transformers. Adding this clarification would
reestablish the Agency's intent when this definition was added to the regulation in August of 1982 (46 FR 37342) that
mineral oil filled transformers are assumed to be PCB-Contaminated (50 to 499 ppm) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters suggested that instead of amending the definition, the Agency should consider requiring that these
units be tested prior to disposal. Others commented that EPA should provide immunity from enforcement action to owners
who assumed their oil-filled electrical equipment was PCB-Contaminated Electrical Equipment when it was later
determined that the transformer contained PCBs at 500 ppm or greater. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the costs of testing have decreased since 1979, EPA is not proposing to change its long standing policy, which
does not require testing transformers prior to disposal, while the equipment is in use. Nonetheless, owners of electrical
equipment containing PCBs should consider verifying the concentration prior to disposal to avoid violations of
TSCA. In addition, EPA is not proposing to issue a blanket exemption from enforcement action for use of a mineral oil
transformers assumed to contain less than 500 ppm PCBs but later found to contain PCBs at 500 ppm or greater. The regulations
at 761.30(a)(1)(xv) currently describe procedures for bringing such transformers into compliance with the use
authorization provisions. For example, in order to qualify for the current use authorization, all PCB Transformers
were required to have been registered with fire response personnel by December 1, 1985 (761.30(a)(1)(vi)). PCB transformers
erroneously assumed to have been contaminated at less than 500 ppm PCBs must be registered within 30 days of discovery
of the actual contamination level with the required fire response personnel (761.30(a)(1)(xv)(D). If it cannot
be demonstrated (e.g., by the production of the receipt from a registered letter used to register the transformer
and signed by the fire response personnel) that, this registration has taken place, then that PCB Transformer is not
authorized for use under 761.30. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is seeking information regarding numbers of small transformers or other electrical equipment that contains
PCBs. These small transformers or other types of small electrical equipment generally do not have nameplates and
are not easily sampled. Some examples of this type of equipment are: potential transformers, current transformers,
instrument transformers, grounding transformers, voltage transformers, and ignition transformers. These small
transformers can range in size from several inches to several feet in height. Such small transformers can be filled
with oil, epoxy, or tar-like potting compounds that contain PCBs, or they could be ``dry''. Since these small transformers
generally do not have a nameplate, under the proposed amendment to 761.3 they would have to be assumed to be PCB Transformers
and would be subject to the use requirements at 761.30(a) and the disposal requirements at 761.60(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is also soliciting comments regarding the disposal requirements that could be imposed on these small transformers
or other similar types of small electrical equipment. Their disposal requirements could resemble those for small
capacitors (e.g., 3 pounds of dielectric fluid (761.60(b)(2)(ii)) or could be expanded to include the size (physical
dimensions) or the total weight of the equipment as well. Such small transformers or similar small electrical equipment,
meeting the size or weight conditions, could be authorized for disposal in an approved chemical waste landfill under
761.75, or if less stringent disposal was deemed protective, in a municipal solid waste landfill.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Drained PCB-Contaminated Electrical Equipment is unregulated for disposal under the existing regulations at 761.60(b)(4)
and may be salvaged through smelting, a process recognized by EPA as an acceptable form of disposal when certain conditions
are met. EPA solicited comments in the ANPRM on whether the Agency should consider amending the regulations for the
disposal of drained PCB-Contaminated Electrical Equipment to ensure that the equipment is properly disposed of
and is not illegally reused. Possible remedies such as decontamination and stricter controls to ensure that units
were completely drained were not well received by commenters. In particular, most commenters stated that the anecdotal
information that drained PCB-Contaminated Electrical Equipment carcasses were used for barbecue grills reflected
isolated instances of non-compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Considering the low potential exposure to humans and the environment and the valuable metals that could be salvaged
for recycling, EPA is proposing to modify the disposal requirements at 761.60(b)(4) for drained PCB-Contaminated
Electrical Equipment by including this equipment under the proposed general ban against open burning of PCBs and
allowing disposal only in facilities that are permitted, licensed, or registered by a State to manage municipal or
industrial wastes (excluding thermal treatment units), in an industrial furnace or in a TSCA approved disposal facility
(See Unit II.B.2. of this preamble). Finally, EPA also proposes to add language to 761.60(b)(4) which states that
for a period of not less than 48 hours, equipment should be allowed to drain, so that as much liquid as possible is removed
from the equipment to further reduce PCB content prior to disposal.

E. Transfer of Totally Enclosed PCBs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under current rules, PCB Items with concentrations of 50 ppm or greater, sold before July 1, 1979, for purposes other
than resale may be distributed in commerce in a totally enclosed manner (761.20(c)(1)). While under 761.20(c)(1),
totally enclosed PCB Items such as transformers, and Large High and Low Voltage Capacitors 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
50 ppm (as defined in 761.3) may be distributed in commerce (e.g., sold), EPA requested comment in the ANPRM on the requirement
that records be maintained on these transactions. Generally, commenters were very supportive of the requirement
that records be maintained to document the distribution in commerce of these items. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the proposed recordkeeping requirement at 761.180(a)(2)(ix), EPA seeks to prevent illegal disposal of PCB
Items, including PCB and PCB-contaminated transformers and Large Capacitors, by those who explain the disappearance
of such items by claiming a sale has occurred. To minimize the potential for illegal disposal, EPA is proposing that
the name, address, and phone number of the parties to which the item was transferred, the date of transfer, and the identifying
number of the item be recorded in the annual document log for any distribution in commerce of a PCB Item (excluding small
capacitors) with a concentration of 50 ppm or greater. In addition, EPA suggests that summary information relevant
to the equipment (e.g., PCB content, servicing, and inspection records) and its compliance with applicable sections
of part 761 be passed on to the new owner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA had anticipated in the ANPRM that this recordkeeping requirement would be imposed pursuant to a sale. However,
in order to avoid claims that the transaction is exempt from the proposed recordkeeping requirement because it involved
no transfer of money, EPA is proposing to require that any transfer of ownership resulting in the transformer or other
PCB Item being distributed in commerce, be included in the recordkeeping requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The intent behind this proposed recordkeeping requirement is to identify instances of illegal disposal hidden behind
the guise of a transfer of ownership. As such, EPA is seeking to require additional information on transactions which
result in the removal of the transformers and capacitors from the property. In this proposal, EPA would not require
the annual document log to identify the transfer of ownership of PCB Items (excluding small capacitors) with a concentration
of 50 ppm or greater when that transfer was included in a real estate transfer. For example, a company sells a warehouse
and the surrounding property. As long as the transformers and capacitors were transferred in the same transaction
as the real estate, a separate log of the transaction would not be necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters to the ANPRM suggested that the sale of totally enclosed electrical equipment should be banned outright.
EPA believes that the sale or transfer of totally enclosed PCB Items should not be banned and that there is still a legitimate
need for such equipment. However, EPA believes that additional controls are needed to ensure proper disposal of such
equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stated that a recordkeeping requirement would be impossible since not all PCB Items (e.g., PCB-Contaminated
Transformers, or Large Capacitors) are marked with a serial number. Although EPA proposes that the records include
the serial number of the equipment, the absence of a serial number should not preclude EPA from tracing an illegal disposal.
Therefore, EPA is proposing that any internal identification number that the company uses to identify the specific
PCB Item be included in the records. Any facility with PCB Items (excluding small capacitors) with a concentration
of 50 ppm or greater not equipped with manufacturer identification numbers should develop some mechanism for identifying
those pieces of equipment for activities such as maintenance or quarterly inspections. The proposal would require
permanent marking, such as engraving of an internal identifying number in a prominent location on the equipment,
as a means of identifying this equipment. Absent a manufacturer's identification, the company's own identification
number would have to be documented on the records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters recommended that the recordkeeping requirement be included in the annual record requirements
at 761.180(a). EPA agrees that this would be an appropriate method of maintaining the records of a transfer of ownership
of a PCB Item (excluding small capacitors) with a concentration of 50 ppm or greater. Therefore, EPA is proposing to
implement this requirement by adding paragraph (ix) to 761.180(a)(2).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In attempting to provide more consistency with other Federal statutes, EPA solicited comments on whether 761.125(a)(1)
should be modified to the new reporting requirement to the National Response Center. Changing the notice requirements
from 10 pounds to 1 pound or more of pure PCBs, would reflect changes made to the reportable quantity (RQ) under CERCLA
at 40 CFR part 302. In addition to seeking comments on this issue, the Agency restated its objective in establishing
the TSCA PCB Spill Cleanup Policy of April 2, 1987; i.e., to provide guidance for the cleanup of recent (after May 4,
1987) or fresh spills. Commenters conveyed general support for changing the National Response Center RQ to 1 pound
or more of pure PCBs. However, some suggested addressing old spills by applying the TSCA PCB Spill Cleanup Policy,
while others recommended changes to the Regional reporting requirement. In considering these options, EPA concluded
it is inappropriate to change the current policy to address these issues at this time. EPA's objective in initiating
this rulemaking is to provide flexibility and to remove redundancies without weakening the existing policy. Finally,
further discussion of EPA's position regarding the remediation of old spills can be found by referring to Unit II.A.,
``Large Volume PCB Wastes'' in this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this rule, EPA proposes to change only the notice of a reporting requirement to the National Response Center at 761.125(a)(1)
by lowering the RQ to 1 pound or more of pure PCBs to be consistent with CERCLA.

G. PCB Storage Requirements

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Indefinite storage of PCB Articles designated for reuse.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA regulations specifically state at 40 CFR 761.65(a) that any PCB Articles or PCB Containers that are stored for
disposal shall be removed from storage and disposed of within 1 year from the date when it was first placed into storage.
However, there currently is no comparable provision in the regulations that addresses the length of time a PCB Article
may be stored for reuse. Further, EPA has been made aware of situations where PCB Transformers and PCB-Contaminated
Transformers have been held ``in storage for reuse'' well beyond a time when it is reasonable to expect the equipment
could be reused. This storage is being done under the pretext that the equipment is being retained as ``spares'' for
critical components of existing electrical systems or that at some future date the owner will service the unit. It
was not EPA's intent to allow PCB Articles that clearly could not be reused due to their state of disrepair, and therefore
should be disposed of, to remain in storage for ``reuse.'' This activity constitutes illegal disposal and creates
additional risks of environmental exposure to PCBs while the equipment is ``in storage for reuse.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is aware, however, that there are many legitimate instances which warrant the storage of PCB equipment for many
years for the purpose of reuse as spares for critical components of electrical systems. These are typically intact
and nonleaking PCB Articles which are treated as if they were in service. Many comments received in response to the
ANPRM suggested that limiting storage for reuse would in effect amount to a new use restriction without any apparent
basis from the standpoint of protection of health and the environment. Nevertheless, EPA is aware of other situations
for which restrictions are warranted to minimize potential risks to the environment and health from exposure to PCB
Articles which are being stored for reuse. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are many compelling reasons for allowing the storage for reuse of PCB Articles. Since transformers, for example,
can easily have an active service life of more than 40 years, disposing of this equipment prematurely based upon an
arbitrary time limit would not be economically prudent nor serve any environmental goals. Placing such a piece of
electrical equipment in storage for reuse to be used as a spare or in emergency situations is both prudent and economically
sound. EPA is proposing to minimize the potential risks associated with the storage for reuse of this equipment, that
once it is placed in storage for reuse it be treated as if it were in use (i.e., in-service). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters provided a number of scenarios in which extended storage for reuse is warranted: (1) Some PCB Articles
are designed and manufactured for very specific use and size requirements and for which replacement is imperative
for the continued uninterrupted operation of a facility (i.e., power rectifiers to convert electrical power to a
usable form for specific manufacturing operations, side-mounted bushings, etc.); (2) certain industries must
maintain inventories of all vintages of spare equipment, for example, owners of locomotive and stationary PCB Transformers
often maintain these units in storage for reuse for a number of years prior to reinstalling and reusing the transformer;
(3) aircraft and airport operations require airport safety and facility operational flexibility and expedient
maintenance capabilities; (4) changes in facility ownership or business transactions may result in the premature
storage of some PCB Articles; (5) there may also be difficulties forecasting electrical demand or specialty needs
and obtaining parts for repair which are not readily available; and (6) if spares of older designs that had been removed
from service for reuse could not be maintained, significant changes to system design would be necessary and in-service
equipment would have to be replaced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although EPA takes these many factors and situations into consideration, there are nevertheless, situations where
the storage for reuse policy is abused. This abuse results, or has the potential to result, in serious environmental
damage. It is these situations which the Agency is seeking to control by limiting the time allowed for storage for reuse
and imposing other safeguards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certain types of businesses, by their nature (e.g., brokers, junk yards, service shops, etc.), accumulate larger
quantities or volumes of PCBs than owners or users (e.g., a utility or industrial facility). Besides accumulating
large volumes of PCB equipment that in many cases are in disrepair and may not be intact and non-leaking, these businesses
have no intent of reusing the equipment themselves. The equipment may be awaiting repair prior to some future resale
or may be in storage for ``reuse'' prior to purging for metal reclamation. In many cases, these units ``in storage for
reuse'' remain for years in locations that are exposed to the elements which further compromise the integrity of the
unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, EPA is proposing to add new 761.67 to limit storage for reuse in an area that was not designed, constructed
and operated in compliance with 761.65(b) for a maximum of 3 years from the date a PCB Article was taken out of service
or 3 years from the effective date of the final rule, whichever is later. PCB Articles placed into storage for reuse
would have to be labeled at the time the PCB Articles were taken out of service, or upon the effective date of the final
rule, and placed into storage for reuse. In addition, the storage for reuse of any PCB Article would have to comply with
all marking and recordkeeping regulations. Information required on these labels would include the date the equipment
was placed into storage for reuse, or the effective date of the final rule if the other date is not known, a projected
location for the future use of the equipment, and the date the equipment was scheduled for repair or servicing, if appropriate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Individuals would be required, upon request of an EPA inspector, to provide records of the potential use for the stored
articles, a description of any leak containment precautions, and the PCB status (PCB or PCB-Contaminated) of the
PCB Article. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PCB Articles that are intended to be stored for reuse for a period longer than 3 years would have to be disposed of unless
the person storing the PCB Article had requested and received from the Regional Administrator for the Region in which
the Article is located a written approval for an extension of the 3-year period. Anyone requesting an extension would
be required to do so in writing to the Regional Administrator no later than 6 months prior to the expiration of the storage
for reuse period. Requests for an extension of the storage period must include the rationale for exceeding the storage
limitation on an article-by-article basis. All extension requests would be subject to approval by the Regional Administrator
and any conditions the Regional Administrator deems necessary to protect health or the environment. A record of these
evaluations would have to be kept at the storage site for a minimum of 3 years. EPA also requests comment on the inclusion
of site-specific or nationwide exemption or waiver provisions in addition to the proposed waiver provision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One option for stored equipment would be to reclassify the equipment in storage for reuse. EPA, in another rulemaking,
is currently considering modifications to the reclassification regulations to facilitate a widespread application
of the reclassification procedures. Such an approach would significantly reduce the risk that might be posed by the
longterm storage for reuse of PCB or PCB-Contaminated equipment. PCB Equipment that is reclassified to non-PCB status
(i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
&lt;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
50 ppm) would not be subject to any of the storage for reuse restrictions proposed today. EPA recommends that owners
and users or brokers and servicers of PCB equipment develop their own ``reuse or reclassification schedule'' to account
for properly retained equipment. The schedule should include a simple inventory to aid in monitoring the status of
the equipment. This may include the reclassification schedule and/or the purpose for storing for reuse. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One question raised in response to the ANPRM was whether the time between a piece of equipment's removal from service
for repair and its return to the owner is considered storage for reuse. Until a determination is made that the piece
of equipment can or cannot be repaired, any storage of that piece of electrical equipment prior to such a determination
is considered storage for reuse. The owner of malfunctioning equipment that has been sent off-site for repair will
still be subject to the 1-year time limit for storage and disposal, beginning on the date it was determined the equipment
could not be repaired. Although service facilities may hold units for several months while scheduling the unit for
repair, EPA views prolonged storage in such situations as an abuse of the storage provisions. Records must be maintained
by the servicers, for review by PCB inspectors, of the dates of receipt of the equipment for repair, the type of malfunction,
and the anticipated date for return of the equipment to the owner or user.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Clarification of the 1-year time limit for storage and disposal.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA proposes to clarify the requirement at 761.65(a) that states that a PCB Article or PCB Container must be disposed
of within 1 year from the date the item is first placed into storage. EPA is proposing to amend the language at 761.65(a)
to explicitly state EPA's original intent that the 1-year period begins on the date when the equipment is taken out
of service and designated for disposal (when it is determined by a servicer, for example, that the equipment cannot
be repaired) not when the equipment is placed into storage for disposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, the 1-year time limit for storage and disposal of drums, which are used to collect liquid from various PCB
Articles, and for other containers used to store the accumulation of PCB wastes such as oil, rags, booties, cleanup
debris, etc., starts on the day an item is first placed into the container for storage for disposal. EPA is not proposing
to allow the accumulation in containers of these items for periods of greater than 1 year except as proposed in Unit
III.G.3 of this preamble. Currently this waste has to be stored in containers. However, comments suggested that this
is not a common practice and may lead to disagreements within the regulated community. Therefore, EPA is proposing
to change the language at 761.65(a) from ``PCB Article and PCB Containers'' to ``PCBs or PCB Items'' to effectively
capture all storage scenarios. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For transformers that are taken out of service but are not drained until later, the 1-year clock, for both the oil and
the transformer, starts when the transformer is taken out of service and designated for disposal (i.e., the date of
removal from service for disposal). EPA also wants to clarify that the start date for the 1-year period for disposal
(and any other applicable requirements) for PCBs legally returned into the United States for disposal (see Unit II.D.3.h
and proposed 761.20(b)(3)) is the date the PCBs reach the port of entry in the continental United States, or the date
the PCBs reach the port of entry if the disposal facility is outside the continental United States or if the waste is
stored during transport for more than 10 days in a State. This policy applies to certain PCBs, to include wastes containing
PCBs at less than 50 ppm which are imported for disposal. The policy also applies to PCBs purchased in the United States.,
by the U.S. Government, taken overseas for use (including any wastes directly resulting from the remediation of these
PCBs), and subsequently returned to the United States for disposal in an approved facility from U.S. embassies, U.S.
military installations, other U.S. Government installations or territories, and PCBs imported under any Federal
administrative order issued under TSCA or any Federal court action.

Situations which warrant an extension or waiver of the 1-year time limit for storage and disposal
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In the June 10, 1991 ANPRM, EPA solicited comments on whether an extension of the 1-year time limit for storage and
disposal requirement would be appropriate in situations, for example, innovative PCB destructive technologies;
such as biological treatment technologies that may take more than 1 year to achieve acceptable levels; and the absence
of disposal capacity, specifically for PCB/radioactive wastes. Comments on alternative options, procedures and/or
restrictions for dealing with such situations were also requested. EPA received several comments, most of which
supported the establishment of a provision which would allow the Regional Administrator for the Region in which the
material is stored, or the Director, CMD, if the Director issued the permit, to recognize situations which require
more than the 1-year time limit for storage and disposal, and to grant an extension to the requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters also identified other situations for which they believe equal consideration should be given to extending
the 1-year time limit for storage and disposal. These situations included: (1) Technologies, such as thermal separation
(thermal desorption) and bioremediation, that require more than 1 year to process waste at a remediation site; (2)
limited expedited remedial action undertaken ahead of the main remediation effort; and (3) conflicting remediation
or disposal requirements associated with the presence of certain co-regulated wastes from which the PCBs cannot
be separated (i.e., such as mine cable coated with a solid anti-fouling compound containing both PCBs and mercury).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most commenters supported the grounds for extension cited in the ANPRM (justification of need, demonstration that
treatment/disposal options are being pursued, and the submission of periodic progress reports). Other commenters
offered variations on the EPA proposal including: (1) Modify regulations to allow DOE to seek an extension on a complex-wide,
multifacility basis to address the PCB/radioactive waste situation and to submit reports on a biennial basis; (2)
for PCB/radioactive wastes, also require compliance with ALARA principles; (3) use a letter rather than the permit
process as the mechanism for granting extensions; (4) make the extension effective upon submission of the request,
or alternatively, make the extension automatic if the Agency does not object within 90 days; and (5) eliminate the
1-year limitation for extensions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has considered these suggestions and is proposing several changes to 761.65(a). First, criteria for extending
the 1-year time limit for storage and disposal requirement include, but are not limited to: A demonstrated need to
store wastes beyond the 1-year time limit due to a lack of disposal capacity, the absence of a treatment technology,
or insufficient time to complete the treatment/destruction process and a demonstration that relevant treatment
or disposal requirements are being pursued. Additional criteria for PCB/radioactive waste, PCB/fissionable radioactive
wastes, or RCRA/mixed wastes and PCB/RCRA wastes could also be required to comply with the requirements of the appropriate
Federal, (i.e., Nuclear Regulatory Commission or EPA) or State regulatory authorities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Anyone storing PCB waste that was subject to the 1-year time limit could provide written notification to the Regional
Administrator for the Region in which the PCB waste was stored that they had been unsuccessful in their continuing
attempts to dispose of their waste within the 1-year time limit and could receive an extension for one additional year
provided certain conditions were met. Second, the Regional Administrator could grant additional extensions of
1-year or longer upon receipt of a justified request. Third, EPA would consider including site-specific time frames
for storage and disposal, where appropriate, when approving a TSCA PCB storage or disposal application or a modification
to a previously issued approval (see 761.60(e) or 761.65(d)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, EPA is less receptive to allowing organizations to develop complex-wide (i.e., nationwide) justifications
and/or reports of their storage and disposal activities. If the data were allowed to be submitted in an aggregate form,
resources would be required to disaggregate the information and transmit the data to the appropriate Regional Administrator.
Nonetheless, EPA would consider aggregation of these data on a Regional basis for submission to and approval by the
Regional Administrator for the Region in which the materials are stored. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, under the proposal EPA may impose conditions when approving requests for an extension. These conditions
would vary due to the specifics of each situation. Therefore, it is not possible to list every conceivable requirement
that could be imposed on a facility in granting additional or longer extensions. EPA is proposing that the Regional
Administrator or the Director, CMD, may require any information deemed necessary to ensure protection of health
and the environment, and may likewise require that additional steps be taken during the storage period, such as marking,
inspection, recordkeeping or financial assurance or complying with ALARA principles for PCB/radioactive wastes
to protect health or the environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA wishes to make a distinction between those situations for which an extension of the storage and disposal requirement
may be legitimate (see example (3) above) versus those situations that would result in the abuse of such an extension,
such as the acceptance of PCB wastes in excess of the capacity limitations imposed either by the permit or the physical
constraints of the technology being used. EPA does not believe an extension of the storage and disposal requirement
is warranted because of failure to initiate attempts to obtain disposal capacity, the cost of disposal, or to allow
for the aggregation by multiple generators of PCB wastes into one vehicle for shipment. EPA is not modifying its view
that PCB wastes should be properly managed and disposed of as quickly as possible, and therefore is not inclined to
take steps that would relieve the generator of its responsibility to remove the PCBs from the environment in a timely
manner. On the other hand, individuals engaged in on-site remediation activities are most likely conducting those
activities in accordance with some instrument developed by EPA, another Federal agency, or a State that provides
instruction on what/how the project is to be conducted and when the project is to be completed (as the case may be for
examples (1) and (2) above). In these instances, the TSCA PCB permit and 1-year time limit for storage and disposal
may not apply. (Also see the discussion regarding the Coordinated Approval provision at Unit III.K. of this preamble.)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA would also consider extension requests to be legitimate when an individual's ability to store and dispose of PCBs
within the 1 year is inhibited by other Federal or State disposal/remedial requirements (e.g., RCRA, CERCLA, the
Clean Water Act (CWA), the Clean Air Act (CAA)), or any statute governing remedial actions which involve PCBs at or
derived from federally-regulated levels.

 Temporary storage of PCB liquid at 500 ppm or greater.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under the existing regulations at 761.65(c)(1), temporary storage is allowed for certain PCB Items, including PCB
Containers that are filled with liquid containing PCBs at concentrations of 50 to 499 ppm in an area that does not meet
the requirements of paragraph (b) of that section for up to 30 days from the date of their removal from use. In the case
of liquid PCBs, a Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure (SPCC) Plan must be in place for the temporary storage
area in accordance with 40 CFR part 112. The current regulations, however, do not authorize temporary storage of liquids
containing PCBs with a concentration of 500 ppm or greater. However, the current regulations at 761.20(c)(2) authorize
the processing and distribution in commerce of PCBs and PCB Items greater than 50 ppm for purposes of disposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency does not believe that there are significant risks associated with temporarily storing for disposal PCB
liquids at concentrations greater than 500 ppm provided the waste is in containers meeting DOT specifications and
an SPCC plan is implemented. In the ANPRM, EPA suggested two approaches to amending the regulations to allow the temporary
storage of liquids greater than 500 ppm: (1) To add a provision to allow temporary storage of liquid with concentrations
of 500 ppm or greater at 761.65(c)(1), or (2) to consider the holding/storing of this liquid as a step in the disposal
process. Most commenters supported the option of amending the temporary storage provision at 761.65(c) as opposed
to amending the provision at 761.20(c) which allows the processing and distribution in commerce of PCBs and PCB Items
for disposal. Many commenters also suggested increasing the 30-day time allotted for temporary storage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency believes it is appropriate to extend the allowance for temporary storage for disposal of liquid PCB waste
above 500 ppm, but not beyond the existing 30-day limit. The point of the 30-day temporary storage provision is to allow
for the accumulation of waste prior to shipment to a disposal facility or commercial storage facility. This rationale
should also apply to liquids above 500 ppm, especially when one considers the preponderance of PCB Transformer owners
who are opting for reclassification of these units. To have them build or ship to a formal storage area in each instance
would be unduly burdensome. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing that the 30-day temporary provision at 761.65(c)(1) be extended to liquids at 500 ppm or greater,
provided an SPCC Plan is in place and the liquid waste is in stationary bulk storage tanks (excluding rolling stock
such as, but not limited to, tanker trucks) or DOT specification containers.

 Storage of large PCB Capacitors and PCB-Contaminated equipment on pallets next to a qualified storage area.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The storage for disposal of non-leaking and structurally undamaged Large High Voltage capacitors and PCB-Contaminated
Transformers on pallets next to qualified storage areas was permitted until January 1, 1983, under the May 31, 1979,
PCB rule (formerly 40 CFR 761.42(c)(2)). This provision was designed to relieve the burden on PCB storage facilities
until EPA-approved incineration facilities were commercially available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of the fact that EPA was initiating an accelerated phaseout of Large PCB Capacitors (Final Electrical Equipment
Use Rule, August 25, 1982, 47 FR 37342), EPA recognized that there would be a need for additional storage space for this
type of equipment. Therefore, temporary storage for disposal was allowed indefinitely after January 1, 1983, on
pallets next to a qualified storage facility for PCB-Contaminated Electrical Equipment and PCB Large High Voltage
Capacitors (761.65(c)(2)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In today's proposal, EPA is proposing to delete 761.65(c)(2) from the PCB regulations since the October 1, 1988 phaseout
date (761.30(l)(1)) for most uses of PCB Large High Voltage Capacitors has passed and there should no longer be a need
for additional storage space for this type of equipment. In addition, EPA does not believe that this provision is needed
for PCB-Contaminated Electrical Equipment because this equipment is typically drained prior to disposal and the
drained hull or carcass is not subject to the storage for disposal provisions of 761.65. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current PCB regulations do not prohibit expansion of the storage capacity of a given storage area as long as, in
the case of commercial storage facilities, the closure plan, and financial assurance mechanisms are also adjusted
to reflect the increased amount of waste stored at the facility. EPA believes that the deletion of this provision for
storage on pallets next to a qualified storage area will not result in undue hardships on existing storage facilities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is soliciting comments on the appropriateness of deleting this provision and also seeks information from storers
of PCB waste as to whether they are currently utilizing the provisions of 761.65(c)(2).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 Alternate storage of PCBs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is proposing a modification at 761.65(b)(2) to the storage requirements to allow the storage of PCBs and PCB Items
designated for disposal in waste management units permitted by EPA under section 3004 of RCRA or by a State authorized
under section 3006 of RCRA to manage hazardous waste in containers. This proposal would also allow the storage in units
otherwise regulated by a State under a TSCA look-alike law or approved as part of a PCB disposal approval. EPA believes
that the RCRA requirements for permitted container storage units provide an equal level of protection to the TSCA
requirements, and preclude an unreasonable risk of injury from PCBs (i.e., recordkeeping, waste tracking, secondary
containment, monitoring for leaks, inspections, and financial assurance and closure requirements). This proposal
does not extend to units operating in interim status under RCRA. All other requirements for PCB wastes, including
but not limited to containerization, marking, recordkeeping, manifesting, and spill cleanup would continue to
apply. Any PCBs or PCB Items that are currently required to be stored in compliance with 40 CFR 761.65(b)(1) would be
eligible. PCBs, especially large volume wastes, which would otherwise be required to be stored in compliance with
this section could be stored instead under the terms and conditions of a PCB disposal approval. It may not be feasible
or desirable to construct a PCB storage area where large volumes of PCB remediation wastes or PCB Items are concerned.
EPA views storage and disposal of PCB wastes as a continuum and believes this issue of storage of large volume wastes
is best addressed on a case-by-case basis through the PCB approval or other permitting process. However, anyone subject
to the PCB storage requirements could choose to follow 761.65(b)(1) and not avail themselves of these other options.

 Storage requirements for PCB Article Containers.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under 761.65(c)(5), PCB Articles and PCB Containers are required to be checked periodically for leaks, and 761.65(c)(8)
requires that they be dated when they are placed into storage. By not including PCB Article Containers in 761.65(c)(5)
and (c)(8), a loophole exists that allows a storage unit owner to omit dating and inspecting these containers and to
circumvent the 1-year time limit for storage and disposal requirement. Therefore, EPA is proposing to correct this
oversight by replacing the phrase ``PCB Articles and PCB Containers'' with ``PCB Items'' wherever it occurs in 761.65(c)(5)
and (c)(8).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Recordkeeping requirements for storage unit operators.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Certain additional recordkeeping requirements for storage unit operators are being proposed under 761.180(a)(1)
and (b)(1). The first addition would be to require the operator to maintain a record of the inspections for leaks, and
cleanups, that must be performed under 761.65(c)(5). Currently, EPA inspectors have no way to verify that unit operators
are complying with these requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, EPA is proposing that storage unit operators keep an up-to-date written inventory or log of what they
are currently holding in their unit. The annual log requires similar information; but since it is an annual summary,
it does not reflect what is actually in a unit on a given day and thus is of no assistance to an EPA inspector performing
a site inspection. Although this would be an additional recordkeeping requirement, EPA believes that it would not
place any additional burden on unit operations. EPA believes that most operators maintain some sort of inventory;
maintenance of such is almost a necessity to properly manage a facility, as well as to ensure compliance with the 1-year
time limit for storage and disposal deadline, and to collect data for the annual log. Allowing EPA inspectors access
to this inventory would greatly facilitate on-site inspections, particularly at larger facilities. Also, since
the purpose of this inventory is to facilitate on-site inspections, EPA is requiring that the inventory be maintained
on-site at the storage unit, rather than at a central facility. This requirement to maintain the inventory on-site
applies only to this inventory, and affects no other portion on the annual records.

 Revision to storage unit criteria. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Proposed 761.65(b)(1)(iv) would reflect the proposed definition of ``Porous surface'' found at 761.3. This proposed
definition includes concrete and cement within the definition of ``Porous surface.'' The reference to Portland
cement or concrete in 761.65(b)(1)(iv) as impervious would be inconsistent with the proposed definition of ``Porous
surface.'' The references to Portland cement and concrete would not be deleted, however, from 761.65(b)(1)(iv)
because this would create a situation where all existing storage units that have used Portland cement or concrete
would be out of compliance. Therefore, the references have remained, albeit parenthetically, to Portland cement
or concrete as acceptable. EPA would recommend, however, that nonporous surfaces be used for curbing and flooring
for storage units since cleanup of nonporous surfaces is easier and less costly.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has incorporated by reference several test standards developed by the American Society for Testing and Materials
(ASTM) which describe various testing and sampling procedures for conducting PCB analyses. These standards are
referenced throughout 40 CFR part 761, and a listing of the applicable test methods can be found in the back of the CFR
under the heading ``Material Approved for Incorporation by Reference;'' 40 CFR chapter I (parts 761, 763)_Subchapter
R_Toxic Substances Control Act, Environmental Protection Agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA published a final rule on April 16, 1992, which updated the listing of the ASTM test standards incorporated by reference
in the PCB regulations. In that rule, EPA indicated that copies of ASTM standards were available for inspection and
copying at the TSCA Public Reading Room. This notation is also included at 761.19 which states: ``Copies of the incorporated
material may be obtained from the TSCA Public Docket Office (7407) Rm. B&hyph;607, Northeast Mall, Office of Pollution
Prevention and Toxics, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460, or from the American
Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), 1916 Race Street, Philadelphia, PA 19103.'' On May 21, 1992, ASTM contacted
EPA and requested that the Agency either produce a copy of an existing agreement that grants EPA permission to reproduce
ASTM standards (i.e., copyrighted material) or refrain from making further copies until permission is granted.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While EPA does not believe that copyright law prohibits the copying of copyrighted materials that are part of a statute
or regulation, EPA has offered to refer requests for copies of the ASTM standards to ASTM. EPA's offer, however, makes
clear that EPA will continue to satisfy requests for these documents under the Freedom of Information Act. Therefore,
in today's notice, EPA is proposing to modify the regulatory text at 761.19. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also received one comment reminding the Agency of an earlier commitment to propose the addition of ASTM Method
D&hyph;4059, ``Standard Method for Analysis of Polychlorinated Biphenyls in Insulating Liquids by Gas Chromatography,''
which ASTM has validated through a series of round robin tests, to the list of references. Copies of the test method,
ASTM D&hyph;4059, are available for public inspection at the TSCA Nonconfidential Information Center (7407), Office
of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, Rm. B&hyph;607, Northeast Mall, at the address listed earlier in this notice.
Copies of the standard are available from the ASTM, 1916 Race Street, Philadelphia, PA 19103. Instead of incorporating
this standard, EPA proposes adding 761.60(g)(1)(iii) and (2)(iii) to identify ASTM D&hyph;4059 and other applicable
EPA procedures as standards that can be used for the analysis of PCBs when using gas chromatography. Comments are invited
on whether the PCB regulations at 40 CFR part 761 should be amended to include this procedure.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA received comments that the current regulatory requirement to obtain a rearch and development (R&amp;D) approval
(761.60(e) and (i) and 761.70(a) and (b)) limits innovative development of effective remediation technologies
such as identifying biological and other innovative processes that destroy or contain PCBs, developing technologies
that can enhance those processes, finding methods of separating PCB contaminants from other media, and identifying
contaminants present in environmental samples so that appropriate remediation techniques may be selected and applied.
A comment was submitted for EPA's consideration citing as rationale for a change the regulation's inflexible and
harmful effects on international scientific exchange and U.S. competitive/technological advancement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter included a suggestion that EPA eliminate the requirement to obtain a R&amp;D approval for research
into the disposal of PCBs, allow the manufacture of 13.23 lbs. of PCBs per facility annually, and eliminate restrictions
placed on the import/export of PCBs. The comment would require notification of the Regional Administrator of the
facility's site, the amount of PCBs to be handled, whether R&amp;D activities were laboratory scale or not, and whether
PCBs would be manufactured. Additionally, the principal researcher would be required to certify that the R&amp;D
facility would be in compliance with the terms of the PCB regulations. Other features of the comment included storage
of materials pursuant to the requirements at 761.65(b) and (c), labelling the work areas with the ML mark, maintenance
of a log covering materials received and shipped (e.g., date, source, PCB weight, media), compliance with OSHA laboratory
and recognized research practices, disposal of materials within 1 year of completion of the R&amp;D activity, and
a provision that the Regional Administrator could terminate the R&amp;D activities if a determination could be made
that the PCB regulations had been violated or that bona fide R&amp;D activities were not being conducted at the facility.
Finally, the material would be shipped in compliance with DOT regulations, or if applicable, the laws of a foreign
nation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential quantity of PCBs the comment would allow each R&amp;D facility to manufacture (i.e., 0.5 kilograms
within 30 days, or roughly 13.23 pounds per year per facility) is of particular concern to the Agency. EPA recognizes
the public policy importance of PCB research; however, there is a need to maintain a certain level of control over the
manufacture of PCBs for R&amp;D activities. Further, as more countries ratify international agreements to control
the movement of PCBs across their borders, it would be inappropriate for the United States to establish a rule or policy
that would allow the indiscriminate transboundary movement of PCBs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has considered the commenter's proposal and in 761.80(e) is proposing to grant a class exemption to all R&amp;D
facilities to manufacture (including import) PCBs solely for the facility's own research for the development of
PCB disposal technologies, but not for purposes of distributing in commerce the PCBs that are manufactured. For purposes
of this rulemaking provision, use ``solely in a facility's own research'' would mean use by the manufacturer or one
of its wholly owned subsidiaries conducting disposal-related research and development. All PCBs and materials
containing PCBs, regardless of concentration, resulting from the conduct of disposal-related studies, would be
required to be decontaminated or disposed of pursuant to the original PCB concentration. EPA proposes to limit PCB
manufacturing, including import, activities to no more than 454 grams (or 1 pound) of PCBs per year. Since PCBs are
generally used in extremely small quantities (i.e., micrograms) during R&amp;D activities, EPA believes, based
on its experience in issuing R&amp;D approvals, that an annual limitation on the manufacture of PCBs at no more than
1 pound for each R&amp;D facility should be adequate. Individuals wishing to exceed this amount would be required
to submit a petition pursuant to TSCA section 6(e)(3)(B) and the interim procedural rules at 40 CFR part 750. Likewise,
EPA is proposing to grant a class exemption at 761.80(g) to allows the processing and distribution in commerce of PCBs
for the purpose of exporting PCBs for research and development.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To be included in the class exemption, a petition for an exemption from the manufacturing prohibitions would have
to be received by EPA within 60 days of the effective date of the final rule or 60 days prior to engaging in this activity.
Renewals of or modifications to the petition would be required annually pursuant to the interim procedures for manufacturing
exemptions at 750.11(e)(1), as finalized in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of April 11, 1994 (59 FR 16991). In order to reduce the paperwork burden of the renewal process for the class, EPA would
deem a properly filed request for a renewal of the exemption by any member of the class as a renewal request for the entire
class. In addition, to ensure the manufacture of PCBs is being conducted for purposes of research and development
into the disposal of PCBs, EPA is proposing that the Regional Administrator be notified in writing 30 days prior to
the commencement of R&amp;D activities that require the manufacture of PCBs. However, this notification would not
be required if an individual has obtained a PCB R&amp;D approval from EPA pursuant to 761.60(a), (i)(2), and 761.70(a)
or 761.70(b) and the approval contains a provision regarding the manufacture of PCBs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In granting an exemption under section 6(e)(3)(B) of TSCA, a demonstration must be made that there is no unreasonable
risk of injury to health or the environment associated with the exempted activity and that good faith efforts have
been conducted to find a substitute for PCBs.

OSHA regulates workplace safety in laboratories under 29 CFR 1910.1450. These regulations define ``laboratory''
as ``a facility where the 'laboratory use of hazardous chemicals' occurs. It is a workplace where relatively small
quantities of hazardous chemicals are used on a non-production basis.'' ``Laboratory scale'' means ``work with
substances in which the containers used for reactions, transfers, and other handling of substances are designed
to be easily and safely manipulated by one person.'' ``Laboratory scale'' excludes those workplaces whose function
is to provide commercial quantities of materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under 29 CFR 1910.1450, an employer, among other requirements, must develop and carry out the provisions of a written
Chemical Hygiene Plan for employees working in laboratories. Appendix A of that section is non-mandatory, but provides
guidance to assist employers. The guidance in Appendix A was extracted from ``Prudent Practices for Handling Hazardous
Chemicals in Laboratories,'' which is available from the National Academy Press, 2101 Constitution Avenue, NW.,
Washington, DC 20418. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Prudent Practices'' is cited in the OSHA regulations because of its wide distribution and acceptance and because
of its preparation by members of the laboratory community through the sponsorship of the National Research Council.
``Prudent Practices'' deals with both safety and chemical hazards, while the OSHA laboratory standard is concerned
primarily with chemical hazards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that the limited manufacture (i.e., 1 pound or less of PCBs) and use of PCBs in conducting research pursuant
to the OSHA workplace safety requirements would not result in an environmental release of PCBs or risks of exposure
to PCBs due to the highly trained nature of laboratory workers and scientists, the limitation on the volume of production,
and the current marking regulations that require containers be labelled as containing PCBs. Instrumentation contaminated
with PCBs would be required to be decontaminated in accordance with current requirements at 761.79, using a triple
rinse procedure in which each rinse is 10 percent or greater of the volume of the container, or disposed of pursuant
to the regulations at 40 CFR 761.60. Finally, all wastes, including diluted PCB materials and any PCB residues or other
contaminated media, would be subject to the 1&hyph;year time limit for storage and disposal requirements at 761.65
and 761.60 and the manifesting requirements at 761.207 et seq.

The good faith efforts finding does not apply because other chemicals cannot be substituted in toxicological, environmental
or analytical testing for PCBs.

EPA has received a number of inquiries as to whether ``round robin'' analytical exercises or inter-laboratory studies
require exemptions from the ban on the distribution of PCBs. EPA's response has been that these exercises may be exempt
if they meet the requirements of the current provision at 761.80(g). These kinds of activities are normally conducted
as quality assurance measures to test or verify a laboratory's performance using a given chemical analysis methodology.

In authorizing the processing and distribution in commerce of small quantities of PCBs for research and development
in 1984, EPA was addressing the need to process and distribute in commerce PCBs for activities such as toxicological
and environmental testing and analytical testing that include analyzing and monitoring PCBs in the air, soil, surface
waters, and sediments; conducting bioassays and toxicological studies; and producing reference standards for
identifying PCBs using gas chromatography (49 FR 28162, July 10, 1984). ``Small quantities for research and development''
is currently defined at 761.3 as ``any quantity of PCBs (1) that is originally packaged in one or more hermetically
sealed containers of a volume of no more than five (5.0) milliliters, and (2) that is used only for purposes of scientific
experimentation or analysis, or chemical research on, or analysis of, PCBs, but not for research or analysis for the
development of a PCB product.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA intends to retain the class exemption at 761.80(g) so that these activities may be continued without disruption.
So as not to change the scope of the class exemption at 761.80(g), EPA proposes to modify 761.80(g) by adding to it the
criteria currently found at 761.3 in the definition of small quantities for research and development. Further, EPA
is proposing, for purposes of consistency, to modify the provision at 761.80(o) that addresses the renewal requirements
for the class exemption at 761.80(g). Under current section 761.80(g)(2), any person or company covered by the class
exemption who expects to exceed the limitation on the amount of PCBs that may be processed or distributed in commerce
in 1 year (100 grams or 0.22 pound) must report to (i.e., petition) EPA, identifying the sites of PCB activities and
the quantity of PCBs to be processed or distributed in commerce pursuant to 761.80(g)(2). EPA is proposing to modify
761.80(o) to clarify that activities being conducted under the class exemption may be continued only when the activities
conform to the provision at 761.80(g). To increase the quantities of PCBs that are processed or distributed at 761.80(g)(2),
individuals must submit a written request to the Director, CMD for approval to exceed the 100 grams limit prior to engaging
in the activity. Each request must include a justification for the increase. Any increase granted will be in writing
and will extend only for the time remaining in a specific exemption year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also recognizes that some laboratories may work with amounts of media containing PCBs that are needed for chemical
analysis procedures at required quantitation levels and which will not fit into 5.0 milliliter hermetically sealed
vials. For example, many non-academic research scenarios require the use of contaminated media to conduct chemical
analyses; to conduct health and environmental studies; and as quality assurance samples for evaluating innovative
disposal technologies. Increasing efforts are being devoted to remediating PCB contamination, whether under TSCA
or some other environmental statute. As a result, the use of media containing PCBs as quality assurance environmental
samples plays a much larger role in the disposal universe than it did initially. Today, environmental samples containing
PCBs are required and are used in conducting research activities to determine toxicity, health, environmental,
and other effects. The Agency's intent in proposing to broaden the use authorization at 761.30(j) and to add a class
exemption for processors and distributors of media containing PCBs at 761.80(i) is to promote required testing for
toxicity and health effects which may be used in setting risk-based cleanup levels at PCB remediation sites. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Use authorization. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under the current 761.30(j), PCBs may be used in small quantities for research and development. That term is narrowly
defined at 761.3. PCB uses not compatible with the limitations established by that definition can only be authorized
through rulemaking or a disposal approval under 761.60(e), 761.60(i)(2), or 761.70(a) and (b), if the PCBs are to
be used in conjunction with developing disposal technologies. This proposal would delete the definition of ``small
quantities for research and development'' and would modify 761.30(j) to allow the use for research and development
of PCBs in organic liquids and contaminated media other than organic liquids which did not exceed the proposed material
limitations. This change would eliminate the time-consuming process of obtaining an approval or awaiting regulatory
changes for the use of PCBs when conducting tests to determine toxicity, health, environmental, and other effects.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under proposed 761.30(j), permissible research and development activities would include, but not be limited to,
scientific experimentation or chemical research on PCBs, and the chemical analysis of PCBs and testing to determine:
biochemical transport processes; environmental transport processes; the effects of PCBs on aquatic and terrestrial
environments; and the health effects of PCBs such as general toxicity, subchronic toxicity, chronic toxicity, specific
organ/tissue toxicity, neurotoxicity, genetic toxicity, and metabolic products. However, permissible research
and development activities would not include research or analysis for the development of a PCB product. This section
would allow the continued use of PCBs in limited quantities for research and development provided the PCBs were originally
packaged in hermetically sealed containers no larger than 5 milliliters, or as samples of environmental media containing
PCBs in containers larger than 5 milliliters that had been packaged pursuant to the DOT performance standards at 49
CFR parts 171&hyph;180 when the following requirements were met: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The Regional Administrator was notified in writing 30 days prior to the commencement of any R&amp;D activity authorized
under this section. Notifications would have to include information which identifies the sites of PCB R&amp;D activities,
the quantity of PCBs to be used, the type of R&amp;D process to be used, the kind of material being treated, and includes
an estimate of the duration of the PCB activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) No more than 100 grams of pure PCBs could be used annually at a facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) All PCB wastes (e.g., spent laboratory samples, residuals, unused samples, contaminated media/instrumentation,
clothing, etc.) would have to be stored in a unit that complies with the storage requirements of 761.65(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Manifests were used for all R&amp;D PCB wastes being transported from the R&amp;D facility to a storage and/or
disposal facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Requests would have to be submitted in writing to the Regional Administrator for approval to exceed the 100 grams
in total weight of pure PCB limitation for use in non-disposal PCB research and development activities. Such requests
would have to provide a justification for the additional quantity needed, as well as specify the quantity of PCBs that
would be needed. The approval would be in writing, signed by the Regional Administrator, and include all requirements
that would be applicable to the R&amp;D activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All R&amp;D facilities would have to comply with the applicable storage and disposal requirements of subpart D, and
applicable Federal, State, and local laws and regulations. The requirements at 761.207 to manifest PCB waste at concentrations
of 50 ppm or greater would not apply to PCB samples taken from any PCB waste and sent off-site to be used for research and
development under proposed 761.30(j). In addition, all PCB wastes would be subject to the 1&hyph;year time limit
for storage and disposal requirements at 761.65. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposal would create a distinction between PCB wastes that a generator decides to place into storage or send
to a disposal facility for final disposal, to which manifesting requirements would still apply, and PCB samples that
remain in use for quantitative analysis of constituents in the samples and PCBs which are sent for treatability or
other limited research and development for PCB disposal activities, such as, materials containing 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
50 ppm PCBs as a result of a spill. Samples of materials containing PCBs and meeting the requirements of the proposed
revised use authorization would be considered ``PCB materials in use'' and not PCB wastes. Manifests would not be
required to return unused samples under 761.30(j), or untreated samples under 761.60(j), to the site of generation,
such as a Superfund remediation site, or under the provisions of proposed 761.77, Coordinated Approval. (See Unit
III.K. of this preamble for a discussion of the Coordinated Approval.) However, spent laboratory or R&amp;D samples
could not be placed back in use after completion of the study. Materials not returned to the site of generation would
then be considered wastes and would be required to be disposed of pursuant to the provisions at 761.60. Individuals
handling waste that had been subsequently placed into storage for disposal or shipped to a disposal facility would
again be subject to the notification and manifesting requirements of subpart K. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also received a proposal regarding research and development activities in which the commenter questioned why
regulatory approval is required for PCB R&amp;D activities when no such impediment is imposed on facilities that
are engaged in research involving neurotoxins, bioactive micro-organisms, and highly radioactive substances.
Proposed changes in 761.30(j) would make it clear that EPA has interpreted that research on the physical properties,
chemical properties, chemical analysis, toxicity, health effects, and environmental effects of PCBs falls under
the use authorization in that paragraph. Treatability research on the disposal of any kind of PCB waste, using any
kind of disposal technology, including the use of microorganisms to degrade, destroy, or chemically alter PCBs,
falls under disposal and not use, and is being addressed in the new proposed 761.60(j). Facilities that conduct treatability
research or R&amp;D into PCB disposal would have to comply with applicable notification requirements of subpart
K, the storage and disposal requirements of subpart D, and applicable Federal, State, and local laws and regulations.
To comply with the notification requirements of 761.205, the facility would have to notify EPA using EPA Form 7710&hyph;53,
``Notification of PCB Activity''. (For the reader's convenience, a copy of the draft revised form is inserted in this
part of the preamble; when the rule becomes effective, the final version may be used to notify EPA of PCB waste handling
activities. The form will not appear in the codified text.)

Although processors/distributors would have the option of expanding their processing/distributing activities,
they would also incur the responsibility of providing, in the form of a petition, notification to EPA if they chose
also to process and distribute in commerce media containing PCBs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the ANPRM, EPA solicited comments on whether it should codify its policy that exempts EPA laboratories and other
U.S. Government agency laboratories, i.e., the National Institute for Standards and Testing (NIST), from the processing
and distribution in commerce prohibitions when such activity is being conducted to effectively implement or enforce
the regulations. Since an accurate determination of PCB concentration is the basis for compliance with many of the
PCB regulations, such activities are crucial for effective compliance by the regulated community and effective
enforcement by EPA. Therefore, the class exemption at 761.80(i) is intended to also address the need for EPA and other
Federal Government laboratories to process and distribute in commerce small quantities of PCBs for purposes of supporting
enforcement or compliance activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing at 761.80(p) that a properly filed request for a renewal of the exemption by any member of the class
would be deemed a renewal request for the entire class. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Individual processors/distributors wishing to exceed the limit of 100 grams by total weight of pure PCBs proposed
at 761.80(i) would have to obtain approval from the Director, Chemical Management Division who may grant approval,
without further rulemaking, to any processor or distributor who qualifies for the exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The standards imposed by TSCA section 6(e)(3)(B) for granting an exemption based on no unreasonable risk and good
faith efforts to develop substitute substances must be addressed. EPA believes that no unreasonable risk would result
from the processing and distribution in commerce of media containing PCBs because such samples would be handled by
laboratories that have established procedures for handling hazardous materials. (See Unit III.I. of this preamble
for a discussion of the OSHA laboratory workplace safety requirements.) Further, EPA believes that the use of such
samples would further enhance efforts to implement, comply with, and enforce the requirements for PCBs under TSCA.
Once the use of such samples was over, persons who had used the samples would be subject to any Federal, State, and local
law governing the disposal of the PCBs, including the rules found in 40 CFR part 761. The good faith efforts finding
does not apply because other chemicals cannot be substituted for PCBs for these purposes.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the ANPRM, EPA solicited comments on a proposal to recognize other Federal and/or State-issued PCB storage and
disposal permits with the view toward limiting concurrent Federal/State and multi-Federal permitting of PCB storage
and/or disposal facilities. (Implementation of Federal requirements promulgated under section 6 of TSCA regulating
the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, and use of PCBs would not be affected by this proposal.) Under
this proposal, dual or multiple permitting requirements could be eliminated where the TSCA PCB Program would recognize
PCB remediation and disposal activities that were implemented and monitored under another authority. The goal is
to encourage recognition of other regulatory authorities and participation by additional States to implement some
form of a PCB disposal program under, for example, an expanded State RCRA hazardous waste program. In that way, limited
EPA resources could be diverted to other issues or areas where no other Federal or State PCB presence now exists. EPA
was interested in obtaining information on the perceived impacts of recognizing PCB disposal programs that are implemented
under either an expanded State waste management program (i.e., by listing PCBs as a hazardous waste) or a TSCA look-alike
program (i.e., by establishing a State PCB disposal program that is analogous to the TSCA PCB Program through the development
of State legislation and implementing regulations). Comments were solicited on enforcement activities and other
factors associated with implementing such a proposal (e.g., issues of national consistency, policy advantages
and/or disadvantages, etc.). Many comments submitted in response to the ANPRM reflect a misunderstanding of the
State enhancement proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Roughly 30 comments were received on this issue with nearly 50 percent of the commenters in favor of the concept. Those
in favor of the proposal supported any reduction in duplicative permitting requirements that would lower the cost
of compliance, but viewed TSCA look-alike programs as the preferred approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those opposed to the proposal voiced strongly held views that differences between Federal requirements, coupled
with inconsistency among State-imposed requirements, would severely hamper and complicate compliance efforts,
create confusion, result in increased costs to the regulated community, and possibly serve as a barrier to interstate
commerce. Additionally, differences between the TSCA and RCRA requirements were cited as having the opposite effect
of alleviating the burden for the regulated community in complying with the PCB disposal requirements. Examples
cited of scenarios where each of these disadvantages would be evident include utilities operating across State lines
or entities with interstate activities (e.g., natural gas transmission companies) and facilities with multiState
locations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters questioned EPA's authority to establish a State-delegated PCB disposal program. These commenters
believe that TSCA's legislative history mandated implementation of the PCB disposal program at the national level,
and that anything short of a nationally orchestrated program would be
<!-- PJG 0101 clearpage -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
abdicating EPA's responsibility. EPA disagrees with the legal interpretation and believes that this argument is
not compelling as a policy matter since PCB disposal facilities are currently subject to both Federal and State regulations
governing PCB disposal. Furthermore, recognition of the actions of another authority is not an abdication since
EPA retains authority to enforce the TSCA PCB regulations. Additionally, one commenter advocated transferring
the PCB Disposal Program to the RCRA program, or totally suspending the TSCA disposal requirements if a State chooses
to regulate PCBs under their expanded hazardous waste management program. The State enhancement proposal is not
intended to serve as a mechanism for ``delegating'' EPA's responsibility for implementing any of the statutory requirements
of TSCA. Federal oversight of PCB storage and disposal activities under State permits would still be undertaken.
One commenter suggested that all facilities should be required to register the use of PCB Transformers with EPA. If
the intent of such a registration program is to enhance monitoring capabilities over the disposal of this equipment,
EPA believes that it would be permissible under TSCA for a State to promulgate its own requirements for that purpose.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
TSCA section 18 addresses preemption of State law. Section 18 provides, with a few exceptions, that the provisions
of TSCA shall not affect the authority of any State or political subdivision of a State to establish or continue in effect
regulation of any chemical substance, mixture, or article containing such chemical substance or mixture. Under
section 18(a)(2), however, a State or locality is preempted from regulating a chemical substance or mixture to protect
against a risk of injury to health or the environment where EPA has acted under section 6 of TSCA to protect against such
risk. An exception to this preemption provision applies when the State regulation concerns a requirement ``described
in'' TSCA section 6(a)(6), i.e., the manner or method of disposal of a chemical substance or mixture. This provision,
referred to as the ``parenthetical exception'' to preemption, is enclosed in parentheses at the beginning of section
18, subsection (2)(B). EPA has interpreted the ``parenthetical exception'' to mean that State PCB disposal rules
are not preempted because they describe the manner or method of disposal of PCBs. Other examples of situations that
would not be preempted by TSCA include: (1) A State regulation that is identical to EPA's regulation; (2) a State requirement
that is ``adopted under the authority'' of another Federal law; (3) a State prohibition on the use of the substance
or mixture in the State (other than in its use in the manufacture or processing of other chemical substances or mixtures);
or (4) when a State or local government prevails in a petition to the Administrator for a rule that would exempt them
from the preemption requirement on the grounds that the State requirement is consistent with Federal requirements,
providing ``a significantly higher degree of protection'' while not unduly burdening interstate commerce.

 Coordinated approval.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the ANPRM, EPA requested comments on whether to adopt regulatory changes to reduce the need for concurrent permitting
for PCB storage and disposal by allowing recognition under TSCA of PCB storage and disposal permits issued under expanded
State hazardous waste or TSCA lookalike programs, or under other Federal environmental statutes (e.g., CERCLA site
remediation, RCRA corrective action, and National Pollution Discharge Elimination System permitting). The regulated
community often must procure both Federal and State permits prior to commencing PCB storage or disposal activities.
Current Federal requirements for PCB storage and disposal under TSCA, including the permitting requirements, are
set out at 40 CFR 761.60, 761.65, 761.70, and 761.75. Additional requirements are proposed in this notice at 761.61.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA received several comments; those commenters maintained opposite views on this proposal. Comments addressing
the TSCA PCB Coordinated Approval mechanism suggested that such a ``program would trigger undesirable regulatory
responses under various environmental statutes for activities that fall under the jurisdiction of only one particular
statute.'' Although section 6(e)(1)(A) of TSCA requires the Administrator to prescribe methods for the disposal
of PCBs, section 9(b) of TSCA further requires the Administrator to coordinate actions taken under the Act with actions
taken under other Federal laws administered in whole or in part by the Administrator. Section 9(b) further requires
the Administrator to use such authorities to protect against such risk, if a determination can be made that the risk
to health or the environment can be eliminated or reduced to a sufficient extent by actions taken under other Federal
laws. Therefore, EPA believes the TSCA PCB Coordinated Approval provision is a viable alternative to issuing duplicative
TSCA PCB storage and disposal approvals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As with EPA's May 19, 1980, final rule under RCRA (45 FR 33325), EPA sees little value in requiring duplicative permit
proceedings and duplicate paperwork. A State that opts to expand its State hazardous waste program by including PCBs
would be operating under an expanded State authority, not under a federally-authorized or delegated program. In
that event, the State may elect to regulate all or some aspect of the disposal program. Standards developed by EPA under
programs such as the RCRA Land Disposal Restriction Requirements, RCRA Corrective Action permits, remediation
projects initiated under CERCLA, and/or expanded State hazardous waste programs which must incorporate Federal
standards as their baseline regulatory requirements are likely to provide a level of protection adequate for eliminating
or reducing to a sufficient extent the risks to health or the environment from exposure to PCBs and to require little
or no further review under TSCA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Remediation of PCB contamination, based on site-specific conditions, may trigger compliance with several Federal
requirements such as TSCA, RCRA, CERCLA, and the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES permitting),
just to name a few. Additionally, State environmental requirements, such as the California listed or New Jersey ``X-Code''
waste requirements, also may need to be factored into the regulatory requirements equation. For illustrative purposes,
an example of a current permitting scenario which resulted in multiple layers of various State/Federal involvement
and the benefits that would be derived under this proposal are presented here: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A manufacturing facility which discharged waste waters into a river located adjacent to the facility discovered
PCB contamination in the soils and the groundwater of a nearby residential community. Wells were drilled and PCB-laden
oil was found. Prior to the installation of oil/water separators in 1965, untreated process and stormwater flowed
into a brook (which flows through the property) and the river. This facility housed, among other things, a Transformer
Division, and from 1932 to 1977 insulating oil containing PCBs was used extensively in the operation of its transformer
plant. In addition, hazardous wastes, including wastes containing PCBs, were generated as a result of these and other
manufacturing processes. The wastes were disposed of both on- and off-site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PCB contamination in the river had been an issue since the late 1970s when studies conducted by EPA and the two neighboring
States detected PCBs in the sediments, fish, and waters of the river. The facility had obtained a NPDES permit from
EPA for discharges into a navigable waterway (in early 1978) and Interim Status under RCRA in 1980. In 1981, the facility
was required by EPA and the resident State Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to conduct three major studies
focussing on: (1) The hazardous waste disposal practices at the facility, (2) a determination of the extent of on-site
contamination, and (3) an assessment of the PCB contamination and corrective action alternatives for the nearby
river. The studies concluded that sediment along the river was contaminated with 39,000 pounds of PCBs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Using the authority of the State's Superfund Law, the facility was required in 1981 to install groundwater pumps and
remove PCB containing oil from the top of the groundwater. In 1987, the facility installed a slurry wall to minimize
migration of the PCBs towards the river. In 1988, EPA's Regional office issued a TSCA disposal permit for a high temperature,
thermal oxidizer incinerator for the destruction of the oil containing PCBs. Also in 1988, the facility was required
by the State DEP to make necessary repairs at the dam to decrease future transport of PCBs downstream. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, in October 1988, EPA initiated the corrective action process under the provisions of the Hazardous and Solid
Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984 to RCRA. A draft RCRA Part B permit to initiate cleanup was developed by EPA in early
1989, and the final RCRA Corrective Action Permit was issued in early 1991. In addition, EPA's TSCA PCB disposal permitting
program had issued several R&amp;D permits to conduct pilot-scale experiments of the effectiveness of various bioremediation
processes as viable cleanup technologies. In summary, the facility was required to obtain operating and air emission
permits from the State DEP, corrective action permits from EPA under RCRA, a TSCA operating permit for the thermal
incinerator (issued by the Region), TSCA R&amp;D permits for pilot-scale experiments (issued by EPA Headquarters),
and a NPDES permit for water discharges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the TSCA PCB Coordinated Approval proposal were a reality, the TSCA PCB Program could have recognized, in this case,
permits that could have been issued by the State for the operation of the thermal incinerator and the R&amp;D permits
for experimental disposal technologies if the State elected to either implement an expanded PCB program under its
RCRA authority or to establish a TSCA look-alike PCB disposal program. In addition, action taken under any Federal
authority (e.g., RCRA or CERCLA) to require remediation of PCB contamination could also be recognized as not posing
an unreasonable risk of injury and thus suitable for a TSCA PCB Coordinated Approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter, although supporting the concept of regulating PCB disposal activities under an expanded State hazardous
waste program for stationary technologies, encouraged EPA to maintain centralized control over PCB mobile technologies.
However, such an approach is not acceptable to EPA since there are limited situations whereby the Administrator can
preempt the State's authority to regulate PCB disposal activities. Although the TSCA PCB Coordinated Approval provision
would not require the owner or operator of a mobile, or multiple, but identical stationary unit to obtain a single approval
from EPA, it also would not require the owner or operator of such a unit to obtain multiple approvals from each State
in which the disposal technology will be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The owner or operator of a mobile, or multiple, but identical stationary unit may want to obtain a TSCA Coordinated
Approval to ensure the Federal and State requirements are harmonized. A State may chose to permit mobile technologies
that will be used exclusively in that State, and EPA would respect its authority to do so. However, an approval that
has been obtained from one state may not be acceptable to EPA in developing a TSCA Coordinated Approval that is intended
for use in multiple States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the process for implementing a TSCA PCB Coordinated Approval mechanism was not discussed in the ANPRM, EPA
considered establishing a self-implementing or an interactive coordinated approval process. The two approaches
are discussed below.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA proposes at 761.77 to recognize permits issued under other Federal laws administered by EPA and State PCB disposal
authorities using an interactive TSCA PCB Coordinated Approval mechanism. EPA believes the interactive approach
described below would provide the Agency the best opportunity to effectively oversee PCB activities that are conducted
under another statutory authority. In addition, the interactive coordinated approval would maximize the Regional
Administrator's ability to serve in a preventative rather than a reactive role in those instances where unintentional
negligence by the regulated community could result in risks of injury to health and the environment from exposure
to PCBs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At 761.77, EPA is proposing to include as a condition of the TSCA PCB Coordinated Approval all requirements, conditions,
and limitations of a non-TSCA permit or other waste management document issued by a State or under another statute
administered by EPA prior to the effective date of this rule. The provision allows for both simultaneous coordination
under the TSCA PCB permitting authority and the other State or Federal permitting authority when a waste management
document does not exist and the subsequent review and approval (or inclusion of additional conditions, if deemed
appropriate) of an existing waste management document. The facility could commence PCB waste storage or disposal
operations only after the Regional Administrator received and reviewed a request for a TSCA PCB Coordinated Approval
that included a copy of the non-TSCA approval and a verification that the facility had submitted EPA Form 7710&hyph;53
and received an EPA I.D. Number, which most facilities would already have for their hazardous waste management permit.
The Regional Administrator would either issue the TSCA PCB Coordinated Approval accepting the non-TSCA approval
as written provided the relevant standards of 761.77(b) through (g) have been met, request additional information,
impose additional conditions, or require the owner or operator of the facility to obtain a TSCA PCB approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If, at any time during the facility's operation under the TSCA PCB Coordinated Approval the Regional Administrator
determined that the facility was in violation of any requirement of the Approval (e.g., failure to comply with the
TSCA PCB reporting and recordkeeping requirements, violation of the conditions of a non-TSCA permit or waste management
document, or operation of the facility in a manner that might result in an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the
environment), the Regional Administrator could issue a notice of deficiency, revoke the TSCA PCB Coordinated Approval
or require the owner or operator of the facility to apply for a Federal TSCA PCB approval. The owner or operator of the
facility could continue operations until the TSCA approval was issued; however, a facility could not commence operation
until it received a TSCA PCB approval if it received a notice of deficiency from the Region. The deadline for submitting
the permit application and the Regional Administrator's rationale for requiring a TSCA approval would be reflected
in the Regional Administrator's written notice of deficiency.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Self-implementing approach.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This approach would allow the owner or operator of a facility with a Federal environmental waste management document
(e.g., signed ROD, final RCRA permit) or State-issued final PCB permit to commence operations after (1) filing EPA
Form 7710&hyph;53 and obtaining an EPA identification number, (2) providing written notification to the Regional
Administrator and (3) receiving confirmation of receipt of that notification from the Region. Under TSCA, the Region
would intervene in the facility's operations only in those instances of non-compliance, for example, with the non-TSCA
permit or TSCA reporting and recordkeeping requirements, or operation of the facility in a manner which would result
in an unreasonable risk. The Federal or State agency issuing the underlying environmental waste management document
would be the lead organization in the development and issuance of that document, monitoring of its implementation
and enforcement of its provisions. EPA's responsibility under TSCA for oversight in those instances would include
enforcement of the TSCA PCB Coordinated Approval rules and could result in the Regional Administrator exercising
his/her authority to require the owner or operator of the facility to obtain a TSCA approval. A detailed description
of the proposed process follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the self-implementing approach, facilities with a State issued PCB permit or a permit issued by EPA (or an authorized
State Director) under another Federal law administered by EPA for PCB remediation, storage, and disposal activities
would be recognized by EPA as having a TSCA PCB approval provided the permit or other waste management document generally
addresses those disposal activities normally covered by a TSCA PCB approval. Additionally, the facility would have
to be in compliance with the conditions of that permit and the TSCA PCB reporting and recordkeeping requirements of
761.180 and 761.202 through 761.218. Owners or operators of facilities storing or disposing of PCBs pursuant to a
permit issued under another environmental statute such as a CERCLA ROD, a RCRA Corrective Action permit, or an expanded
RCRA-authorized State hazardous waste program would be required to obtain an EPA I.D. number (or confirm an existing
number), provide written notification to the Regional Administrator for the Region in which the facility is located
that they would like to handle PCBs in accordance with a permit that addresses the remediation, storage, and/or disposal
of PCBs and receive written confirmation of receipt of the notification to the Region. A separate formal TSCA PCB approval
would not be required. The owner or operator of the facility could commence operations immediately once an EPA I.D.
number for PCB activities was obtained (or confirmed), written notice was given to the Regional Administrator, and
the Regional Administrator confirmed that the owner's notification had been received. A Region could also respond
with a notice of deficiency in those instances where the Region determines that a TSCA PCB Coordinated Approval is
not available or appropriate and a TSCA PCB approval is needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If, after a TSCA PCB Coordinated Approval has been issued, conditions such as, but not necessarily limited to, the
following exist, the Regional Administrator for the Region in which the facility is located would have sufficient
basis to issue a notice of deficiency and/or require the owner or operator of the facility to submit an application
for a TSCA PCB approval: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Current or subsequent substantive violations of the permit conditions and/or the TSCA reporting and recordkeeping
requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Operation of a facility in a manner that may result in an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The program under which the permit was issued has expired or the permit has been revoked. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) For CERCLA actions, requirements conducted pursuant to a ROD have been completed or the facility is not in compliance
with the conditions of the ROD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the event the Region required the owner or operator of the facility to obtain a TSCA approval, the Regional Administrator
would establish a deadline for the owner or operator of the facility to submit an application (generally not less than
30 days from receipt of the notice of deficiency) for a TSCA PCB approval. However, the owner or operator of the facility
would be able to continue operations under the provisions of the TSCA PCB Coordinated Approval until the TSCA approval
is issued (except in the instance where a notice of deficiency was issued, then a TSCA PCB approval would first be required).
After issuance of the TSCA approval, EPA would no longer recognize the State or other Federal permit for that facility
as being the equivalent of a TSCA PCB approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The primary responsibility for compliance monitoring and enforcement of the permit or waste management document
would reside with the Federal or State agency issuing that permit or waste management document. These underlying
permits or waste management documents would be deemed to be requirements of TSCA whose breach is a prohibited act under
section 15 of TSCA. EPA would reserve its rights to conduct inspections and take enforcement actions under TSCA or
any other applicable Federal statute. It is EPA's intent to exercise its authorities in consultation with or at the
request of the other Federal program or State agency issuing the permit or waste management document. However, based
on any information, EPA could act without consultation, especially where a facility poses an immediate risk of injury
to health or the environment or where EPA's intent is to initiate a criminal investigation or criminal or civil judicial
action.

 PCB State Enhancement Grants.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Also cited in the ANPRM was EPA's proposal to make resources, as appropriated by Congress, available through the TSCA
section 28 State grant mechanism. A Notice of Availability for the PCB State Enhancement Grant Program was published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of March 4, 1991 (56 FR 9008). This notice solicited applications for financial assistance to support current State
activities to establish a PCB disposal program. Funding under this program was not anticipated to continue beyond
fiscal year 1992. Under the State grant proposal, EPA would partially fund efforts by the States to establish a State
PCB disposal program through the development of State legislation and regulations of PCB disposal activities. States
were also required to provide a ``match'' of 25 percent of the total cost of the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters were not in favor of EPA's encouragement of the listing of PCBs under State hazardous waste programs.
Additionally, some commenters voiced concern that EPA was trying to delegate its responsibility to the States to
enforce Federal requirements. And finally, commenters were also skeptical of whether there would be adequate funding
under the grants to implement State disposal programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TSCA grants were to be used as ``seed'' money to complement ongoing State PCB disposal activities. In creating the
TSCA section 28 grant provision, the intent of Congress was to provide financial assistance to selected States to
complement and augment EPA's efforts authorized under the Act (Ref. 55). It had envisioned that those States most
heavily impacted by chemical pollution problems, upon application and approval by EPA, would receive assistance
from EPA. To be eligible for a grant, States would have to be engaged in the process of listing PCBs under its hazardous
waste laws or in adopting TSCA look-alike laws for the storage and/or disposal of PCBs. The process for establishing
a PCB disposal program would have to have been completed by September 30, 1992. Since the response to the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 761.60(e) of the PCB regulations states that persons who are required to incinerate PCBs and PCB Items and
who can demonstrate that an alternate method exists for destroying these PCBs or PCB Items and that this alternate
method can achieve a level of performance equivalent to 761.70 incinerators may submit a written request to the EPA
for an exemption from the incineration requirements of 761.70 or 761.60. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It was never the Agency's intent that the submission of an application for an alternate disposal method in lieu of incineration
be optional, as could be construed by the use of the word ``may'' in 761.60(e). EPA, therefore, proposes to amend 761.60(e)
to clarify that written approval to use an alternate method of destroying PCBs or PCB Items must be obtained from the
appropriate EPA official prior to any use of the method to destroy PCB waste.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule proposes to clarify the basis on which PCB concentrations are to be determined for the purpose of identifying
applicable requirements under the PCB rules. Proposed 761.1(b) of this rule would require that PCB concentrations
for non-liquid materials, which contain no liquids which pass through the filter when using the paint filter test
method (EPA Method 9095 in ``Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste'' (SW&hyph;846), be determined on a dry weight
basis according to the definition proposed at 761.3. The proposed rule would require the PCB concentration to be determined
on a wet weight basis for liquid PCBs as proposed to be defined at 761.3, i.e., homogeneous flowable material containing
PCBs and no more than 0.5 percent non-dissolved materials. This rule would also establish requirements for determining
PCB concentrations in situations where separate, distinct phases were present within samples of materials containing
PCBs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 6, 1990 (55 FR 12866), EPA published a proposed rule that sought to clarify how to determine the PCB concentration
in media where water is present. However, several comments on the April 6, 1990 proposed rule indicated that it could
be read to require determination of PCB concentrations of all samples, including liquid samples, by removing (drying,
evaporating or condensing) the liquids and thus leaving only PCBs. This Notice responds to those comments by clarifying
the April 6, 1990 proposal and proposes distinct requirements for determining the PCB concentration in liquids,
non-liquids, and multiphasic liquid/liquid and liquid/non-liquid samples. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The April 6, 1990 Notice proposed that PCB concentrations be determined on a dry weight basis for all substances (non-liquids
or liquids) regulated under part 761, including, but not limited to, dielectric fluids, contaminated solvents,
oils, waste oils, heat transfer fluids, hydraulic fluids, paints, sludges, slurries, dredge spoils, soils, materials
contaminated as the result of spills, and other chemical substances or combination of substances, including impurities
and byproducts and any byproduct, intermediate, or impurity manufactured at any point in a process. EPA assumes that
most substances or mixtures, from which samples will be taken for the determination of PCB concentrations by chemical
analysis, will fall into the categories listed above, with the addition of wastewater. Water may be present in some
of these substances or mixtures in varying amounts and for various reasons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PCB current regulations do not require a specific chemical analytical method for the determination of PCB concentrations.
Many chemical analysis procedures, used to determine PCB concentrations, require accounting for the presence of
water in samples in a way that accomplishes EPA's objectives in this rule. However, there are some chemical analysis
procedures that could be used for PCBs, but that were developed to address more general objectives. Therefore, these
more general chemical analysis procedures may either offer several options for accounting for water in samples or
require a different way to account for water than would be appropriate for determining the PCB concentration to meet
the requirements and intent of the PCB regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The overall purpose of the proposed revisions to 761.1(b) is to ensure a consistent and reproducible basis for determining
the concentration of PCBs in the PCB-containing medium. Such a basis would enable the Agency to apply the PCB rules
in a consistent manner. To determine the PCB concentration of a nonliquid, as will be discussed below, the medium of
concern is the non-liquid material because it is the most likely repository of the PCBs. Therefore, any water in the
sample should be accounted for in the determination of the PCB concentration of the sample because the amount of water
can significantly bias the PCB concentration in the sample. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For liquid samples, however, the medium of concern is the liquid itself; therefore, to determine the PCB concentration
in that medium, one may determine the PCB concentration on a wet weight basis. (For example, for water samples, the
medium of concern is the water, and it would not make sense to exclude the water.)

 Liquid PCBs, including organic liquids and wastewater.

 ``Liquid PCBs'' would be defined in 761.3 as homogenous flowable material containing PCBs and no more than 0.5 percent
by weight non-dissolved materials. The proposed revisions to 761.1(b) would require concentrations for liquid
PCBs to be determined on a wet weight basis. ``Wet weight basis'' means reporting chemical analysis results by including
the weight of all dissolved water in a homogeneous liquid. If the liquid is homogenous, the PCBs will be distributed
throughout the medium evenly. For nonhomogenous liquid samples, however, PCBs are more likely to be more concentrated
in one component of the sample than they are in others because of the physical and chemical properties PCBs possess
(e.g., PCBs are hydrophobic). Thus, for these samples, the proposal would require each phase of a non-homogeneous
liquid to be separately analyzed (on a wet weight basis). EPA recognizes, however, that even if each phase of a liquid
sample is separately analyzed, some small amounts of water that are not separable may be found in a particular phase
(i.e., some small amount of water may be found in oil). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For liquid samples containing water, the separable water must be removed, and each phase of the sample must be separately
analyzed (on a wet weight basis). Separable water is water that may be readily physically separated, e.g., by the use
of a separatory funnel, filtration, or by decantation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA notes that most organic liquids in which PCBs are found (including mineral oil dielectric fluid, heat transfer
fluid, oil based hydraulic fluid, and rinse solvents) usually do not contain more than 1 or 2 percent of non-separable
water. This non-separable water usually is in a suspension or in solution. Since the amount of non-separable water
is usually very low compared to the amount of organic liquid, the effect of non-separable water on the concentration
of PCBs in these organic liquids is relatively small. Thus, EPA believes that allowing the non-separable water to
be included in the analysis would generally not affect the regulatory status of a sample. When there is non-separable
water in an organic liquid, chemical analysts will normally use a desiccant to remove even this small amount of non-separable
water from the liquids during chemical analysis. These small amounts of non-separable water are removed to avoid
potential interference to PCB instrumental response from water and potential damage to the chemical instrumentation.
Even though the small amounts of non-separable water removed by desiccation could be accounted for, they normally
are not accounted for because this non-separable water has limited influence on the PCB concentration of the organic
liquid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, EPA notes that wastewater samples consist almost entirely of non-separable water. For wastewater samples
the analyst will normally use an organic solvent to extract the PCBs from the wastewater. Even though the PCBs are removed
from the water during the determination of the PCB concentration, chemical analysts do not consider this determination
to be on a dry weight basis. Since wastewater may contain significant amounts of suspended materials, this rule proposes
to identify how much suspended material may be present in the water to still be considered a homogenous liquid for the
purpose of determining PCBs in water. If wastewater contains greater than 0.5 percent non-dissolved non-liquids,
the wastewater would be considered to be ``multiphasic liquid/non-liquid.'' If wastewater contained other immiscible
liquids separable by decantation, the PCB concentrations for those other liquids would be considered to be ``multiphasic
liquid/liquid.''

 Non-liquid PCBs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 ``Non-Liquid PCBs'' are proposed to be defined at 761.3 as PCBs which contain no liquids which pass through the filter
when using the paint filter liquids test method (EPA Method 9095 in ``Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste'' (SW&hyph;846).
Proposed 761.1(b) would require PCB concentrations for non-liquid PCBs to be defined on a dry weight basis. ``Dry
weight basis'' would be determined as reporting chemical analysis results by excluding the weight of the water from
the weight of the sample. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, for purposes of this proposal, any chemical analysis process which removes and/or accounts for the amount
of water present in non-liquids complies with the requirement to determine the PCB concentration in non-liquids
on a dry weight basis. These processes include some or all of the following: filtration, decantation, and heating
at low temperatures followed by cooling in the presence of a desiccant. The determination of the PCB concentration
in the non-liquid would be based on the weight of PCBs in the weight of the resulting dried non-liquids. Water separated
from non-liquids through filtration or decantation would be treated as a liquid sample as described in Unit III.M.1.,
``Liquids Including Organic Liquids and Wastewater'' above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Soils, sediments, and sludges are examples of PCB containing media that can contain varying amounts of water and still
pass the paint filter liquids test for non-liquids. In addition, there are any number of other PCB containing media
such as paper, wet automobile shredder fluff, and other fiber products that can also contain varying amounts of water
and pass the paint filter liquids test for non-liquids as well. These non-liquid PCBs may contain a relatively large
amount of non-separable water compared to the amount of non-separable water that can be contained in the organic liquids
normally encountered in PCB samples. For the purposes of determining PCB concentrations of soils, sediments, and
sludges on a dry weight basis, the amount of water not separated from these non-liquid samples by filtration or decantation
would have to be accounted for in reporting the PCB concentration.

 Mixtures of liquids and/or non-liquids.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In multiphasic samples, that is, samples containing (a) both non-liquids and liquids or (b) more than one liquid phase,
chemical analysts usually separate non-liquids from liquids and immiscible liquids from each other before chemical
analysis. This separation eliminates the potential consistency and reproducability problems and also provides
meaningful comparisons of PCB concentrations for regulatory purposes. The separation techniques employed in the
laboratory to separate non-liquids from liquids must result in equivalency to the paint filter liquids test in order
to assume a complete separation of liquid and non-liquid materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a sample containing more than one phase, where the phases are capable of being separated from each other (by procedures
such as decantation and filtration), the proposed rule would require the phases to be separated from each other prior
to chemical analysis, and the PCB concentration for each separate phase of the mixture sample to be determined individually.
Separated non-liquids would be required to be analyzed on a dry weight basis and liquids would be required to be analyzed
on a wet weight basis.

N. Oil-filled Equipment Manufactured After the Ban 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the applicability section of part 761 at 761.1, EPA is proposing to add paragraph (g) to provide clarification with
regard to the classification of oil-filled equipment manufactured after the ban on the manufacture of PCBs took effect
on July 2, 1979. The purpose of this clarification is to recognize that oil-filled equipment manufactured after the
ban, accompanied either by documentation provided by the manufacturer or a label or mark affixed by the manufacturer
certifying, based on test data, that the equipment does not contain PCBs, does not fall into the assumption category,
under the definition of ``PCB-Contaminated Electrical Equipment'' at current 761.3, that all oil-filled equipment
where PCB concentration is unknown must be assumed to be greater than 50 ppm PCBs. For purposes of this proposed rulemaking,
the criteria for demonstrating that the transformer contains no PCBs are: the equipment must have been originally
manufactured with no PCBs after the effective date of the ban (July 2, 1979), and must not have been serviced with any
PCBs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At Unit III.C. of this preamble, EPA is proposing to amend the definition of ``PCB-Contaminated Electrical Equipment''
to indicate that the reference to ``oil-filled'' means mineral-oil and that not all equipment that contains an oily
substance can be assumed to be PCB-Contaminated. Similarly, proposed 761.1(g), would clarify that oil-filled (mineral
or otherwise) equipment that was manufactured after the ban on the manufacture of PCBs that was certified to contain
no PCBs at the time of manufacture and has not been subsequently serviced with fluids containing PCBs should not and
will not be assumed to be PCB-Contaminated. In fact, this equipment is not subject to the provisions of 40 CFR part 761.

O. PCB Voltage Regulators 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current regulation at 761.30(a)(1)(xv) requires owners of mineral oil transformers that the owner had assumed
to contain 50 to 499 ppm PCBs, that are tested and found to contain 500 ppm or greater PCBs, to bring those units into compliance
with all the applicable provisions of part 761. EPA is proposing at 761.30(a)(1)(xvi) the same requirements for voltage
regulators. Accordingly, voltage regulators, assumed to be PCB-Contaminated, that are later tested and found to
contain 500 ppm PCB or greater would be required to come into compliance with part 761. Voltage regulators which were
marked or otherwise known to contain PCBs at greater than 500 ppm would also be required to come into compliance with
all the applicable requirements of part 761. Section 761.30(h) would also be revised to reflect this change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In many respects, voltage regulators are designed to function in a manner similar to transformers. They consume a
small amount of current and adjust their output voltage with precise limits based on voltage and current needs of the
power system. Though the actual size and fluid requirements of voltage regulators vary depending upon precise voltage
rating, age, and manufacturer, voltage regulators of less than 100 KVA contain approximately 30 gallons of fluid
and those over 100 KVA approximately 200 gallons. Voltage regulators were manufactured with mineral-oil fluid of
which 14 percent contained PCBs greater than or equal to 50 ppm and less than 2 percent contained greater than or equal
to 500 ppm PCBs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on this data, EPA does not expect many voltage regulators to be above the 500 ppm PCB level; however, as with mineral-oil
transformers later tested and found to contain above 500 ppm PCB, those that were found to be 500 ppm or greater would
be treated in the same manner as transformers at 500 ppm or greater. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The impetus for this proposal is to ensure that voltage regulators that are found to contain 500 ppm or greater PCBs
are properly marked while in service, their locations are marked, records are kept pursuant to 761.180, they are registered
with fire departments, and they are properly disposed of when they are taken out of service. As well as soliciting comments
on this proposed change in general, EPA is soliciting comments on the appropriateness of requiring enhanced electrical
protection for voltage regulators as is the case for mineral-oil transformers later found to contain greater than
or equal to 500 ppm PCBs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, EPA is soliciting comments on whether it is sufficient to simply add voltage regulators to existing 761.30(a)(1)(xv)
(renumbered in this proposed rule as 761.30(a)(1)(xvi)) or whether a separate subparagraph should be added to address
this issue because voltage regulators containing greater than or equal to 500 ppm PCB should not be treated in the same
manner as PCB Transformers. If there are compelling reasons to treat these voltage regulators differently due, for
example, to their size, location, or use, EPA welcomes suggestions on the most appropriate way to regulate these pieces
of PCB electrical equipment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 18(b) of TSCA, the State of Connecticut petitioned EPA for an exemption from the preemption provisions
of section 18(a)(2) to allow the State to require, among other things, the registration of PCB Transformers (i.e.,
transformers with dielectric fluid at 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
500 ppm PCB) with the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection. Connecticut argued that this notification
would provide a significantly higher degree of protection for State residents and emergency response personnel
from the risks posed by PCB Transformers than the current Federal rules under TSCA because (1) State emergency response
personnel often respond to fires and spills at sites throughout the State and (2) State administrative actions such
as issuing warnings regarding fishing, swimming, or other activities that could increase human exposure to PCBs
when fires or spills occur, could be made in a more timely manner. While EPA sees merit in these arguments, EPA believes
that residents of every State would be better protected by a uniform, nationwide registration requirement, where
EPA would receive the data and make it available to Federal and State emergency response personnel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's rule proposes a new 761.30(a)(1)(vii) to require all owners of PCB Transformers to register their transformers
with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assistance (2245), 401 M St.,
SW., Washington, DC 20460 no later than 90 days after the effective date of the final rule. PCB Transformers subsequently
identified or received from another location would have to be registered with EPA no later than 30 days after identification
or receipt. To minimize data gathering and processing, EPA proposes that transformer owners would only have to report
information about their transformers that is currently required under 761.180(a), to be included on their annual
document logs. The registration would include the following information: (1) Transformer location (address) and
number of PCB Transformers, (2) kilograms of PCB liquid in each PCB Transformer, and (3) name, address, telephone
number and signature of the owner, operator, or other authorized representative certifying the accuracy of the information
submitted. If a PCB Transformer is transferred to a different location after it is registered, information concerning
that transfer would be recorded in the former owner's annual document log. (See discussion at Unit III.E._Transfer
of Totally Enclosed PCBs.) Anyone who took possession, either through transfer of location or sale of a PCB Transformer,
90 days after the effective date of this rule would be responsible for demonstrating that the newly acquired PCB Transformer
was registered with EPA under this proposed provision or, if the new owner could not make that demonstration, he would
have to register that PCB Transformer within 30 days of the transfer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations at 761.30(a)(1)(vi) and (vii) currently include requirements for registering all PCB Transformers
with fire response personnel and owners of any nearby commercial buildings. State and local authorities may also
have notification requirements for emergency response personnel. Owners of transformers at industrial sites could
fulfill the current requirement by registering with their on-site fire brigade, while owners of PCB Transformers
in or near commercial buildings had to register with the local fire department. Subsequent review of the regulated
community's compliance with these registration requirements by the Office of the Inspector General of EPA and EPA
Regional personnel found that many fire departments, including those serving large cities, had not received registration
information for a large percentage of those PCB Transformers which should have been registered. In addition, many
owners could not demonstrate that they had registered their transformers, as required to continue each unit's authorization
for use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the registration requirements proposed today would extend to all PCB Transformers in use or in storage
for reuse, even if a specific PCB Transformer was registered under the current requirements at 761.30(a)(1). Under
proposed 761.30(a)(1)(vii)(C), this requirement would be a part of the authorization for continued use for each
PCB Transformer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA solicits comments on this proposal and the petition from the State of Connecticut. If EPA does not promulgate today's
proposed uniform national registration requirements, then it would be inclined to promulgate an exemption under
section 18(b) to allow any State to implement its own registration requirements for transformers.

Q. Rectifiers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has come to EPA's attention that a certain number of oil-filled and solid-state rectifiers (devices that convert
AC current to DC current) contain PCBs. While rectifiers are not specifically authorized for use in the PCB regulations,
it is EPA's intent to authorize at proposed 761.30(r), the continued use of rectifiers in a similar manner as transformers
to be consistent with EPA's use authorizations for non-totally enclosed electrical equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To add specificity to this proposed authorization for rectifiers, EPA is soliciting comments and data on the following:
(1) The number of rectifiers currently in use, (2) the extent of PCB contamination in rectifiers, (3) the size of such
units and whether EPA should adopt a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 volume amount (as is the case with capacitors, i.e., capacitors with less than 3 pounds of fluid are considered small
and generally not regulated under TSCA for disposal) at which rectifiers would be regulated under TSCA, (4) the number
of oil-filled vs. solid state rectifiers, and (5) any information that will assist EPA in supporting a use authorization
for this type of equipment. Proposed 761.30(r) would authorize PCBs at any concentration to be used in rectifiers
and PCBs at less than 50 ppm to be used in servicing rectifiers for the remainder of their useful life.

R. Use of PCBs in Scientific Equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has come to EPA's attention that certain types of scientific equipment have historically used PCBs as a medium for
comparative measurements. Specifically, EPA has been made aware of the historic use of PCBs in studies of birefringence
and viscoelasticity of long chain polymers (Ref. 58). The PCBs serve as a high viscosity medium to uniformly reduce
all movement to facilitate comparisons of long-chain polymers. These studies date back to well before the enactment
of TSCA and have included hundreds of thousands of comparable reference data runs. Other media could be used to replace
PCBs in these instruments, but none yield results comparable to the large historical reference data set using PCBs
as reference standards. While PCBs are not specifically authorized for specialized uses in scientific equipment,
it is EPA's intent to authorize at proposed 761.30(s), their continued use in situations where the PCBs were in use
as of the date of publication of today's proposal. Additional information is requested as to why substitutes are not
available or otherwise could not be used and why the continued use of PCBs presents no unreasonable risk to health and
the environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to add specificity to this proposed authorization, EPA is soliciting comments and data on the following:
(1) The types and number of scientific applications for which PCBs are currently in use; (2) explanations as to why
substitutes can not be used in each identified scientific application; (3) the size of such units and whether EPA should
adopt a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 volume amount; (4) the types of PCBs used; (5) descriptions of how releases and exposures to PCBs are minimized during
preparation, operation, and disassembly of the testing equipment; and (6) any additional information that will
assist EPA in supporting a use authorization for PCBs in scientific equipment. In all authorized and unauthorized
scientific uses or applications of PCBs, the disposal of the PCBs and any contaminated equipment is fully regulated
under TSCA.

S. Remove Outdated Material 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to a request to remove outdated material from the Code of Federal Regulations, EPA is proposing to remove
the provisions at 761.20(c)(3) that require the submission to EPA of a notice at least 30 days prior to the export for
disposal of PCBs or PCB Items; the regulations had authorized export for disposal until May 1, 1980. In deleting the
notification requirement, EPA proposes to retain the prohibition against exporting PCBs for disposal after May
1, 1980, as reflected at 761.20(c)(3) in today's notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Likewise, several use authorizations specified deadlines by which certain activities were to cease. Section 761.30(a)(1)(iii),
which prohibits the installation of PCB Transformers in or near commercial buildings after October 1, 1985, contains
provisions for the continued installation of such transformers in emergency situations or for reclassification
up until October 1, 1990. Since these provisions are now obsolete, EPA is proposing their removal, with the exception
of the provision to allow the indefinite installation of Mineral Oil PCB Transformers, which is still valid and would
be retained. Therefore, 761.30(a)(1)(iii)(A) through (D) would be deleted, with the exception of the requirements
of 761.30(a)(1)(iii)(C)(2)(ii) and (C)(2)(iii), which would be retained and redesignated as 761.30(a)(1)(iii)(A)
and (iii)(B), respectively. The definition of ``emergency situation'' under 761.3 would therefore be rendered
unnecessary and also would be deleted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions at 761.30(b), which authorize the use in and servicing of railroad transformers, contain procedures
for phasing in a reduction of the PCB concentration for dielectric fluids used in railroad transformers. Essentially,
the use of greater than 1,000 ppm PCBs in these transformers was prohibited after July 1, 1986. Therefore, EPA is proposing
to amend paragraph (b)(1) by deleting paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(vii) at 761.30(b)(1) ``Use restrictions.''
Paragraph (b)(1) would be amended to restrict the use of PCBs in the dielectric fluids of railroad transformers to

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
&lt;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1,000 ppm after July 1, 1986 (as is currently required by 761.30(b)(1)(vi)). Further, EPA is proposing to delete 761.30(b)(2)(ii)
``Servicing restrictions.'' and to redesignate 761.30(b)(2)(iii) through (vii) as (b)(2)(ii) through (vi). The
provisions at 761.30(c) ``Use in and servicing of mining equipment'' would be revised to delete the conditions listed
at paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(5) since the timeframe of the authorization for the use and servicing of mining equipment
containing PCBs has lapsed and these conditions are no longer relevant. The introductory paragraph for 761.30(c)
would also be amended to delete the processing and distribution in commerce servicing authorization for PCBs greater
than 50 ppm used in mining equipment which expired on January 1, 1982. The authorization would be revised to allow servicing
only with PCBs at a concentration level of less than 50 ppm. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 761.30(d)(1) through (d)(5) set conditions on the use of PCBs at concentrations of 50 ppm or greater prior
to July 1, 1984. The recordkeeping requirement under paragraph (d)(5) expired on July 1, 1989 (5 years after the deadline).
Therefore, paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(5) are effectively obsolete, and EPA is proposing their deletion. Similar
provisions for hydraulic systems under 761.30(e)(1) through (e)(5) are also being proposed for removal. The introductory
paragraphs for 761.30(d) and 761.30(e) would be amended to allow heat transfer or hydraulic systems that were in operation
after July 1, 1984 at a concentration level of less than 50 ppm PCBs to be serviced to maintain a concentration level
of less than 50 ppm PCBs. This action is being proposed so that heat transfer and hydraulic systems that were in compliance
(containing less than 50 ppm PCBs in their fluids) could be serviced to maintain PCB levels at less than 50 ppm should
the PCB levels rise above 50 ppm because of leaching from the systems. Heat transfer and hydraulic systems could only
be serviced with fluids containing PCBs at less than 50 ppm.

IV. Proposed Amendments to the Notification and Manifesting Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the promulgation of the PCB Notification and Manifesting (N&amp;M) rule on December 21, 1989 (54 FR 52716) a
number of issues have been raised that were not contemplated when the final rule was being drafted. Some of these issues
were raised by litigants who petitioned the Agency for review of the rule or by other waste handling associations.
Other items which are being proposed in today's notice have been previously promulgated under RCRA regulations and
seem appropriate for inclusion in the PCB N&amp;M rule. Some of the issues below are simply clarifications and are
not intended to result in changes to the codified sections of 40 CFR part 761. EPA is soliciting comments on the following
proposed amendments and clarifications to the PCB N&amp; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
M rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Small Quantity Exemption for Solids 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 27, 1990 (55 FR 26204), EPA issued a correction to the N&amp;M rule that among other things sought to clarify
the definition of ``Commercial storer of PCB waste'' at 761.3. The word ``liquid'' was added to the phrase ``exceeds
500 gallons of PCBs'' so that the phrase now reads ``exceeds 500 liquid gallons of PCBs.'' This excluded facilities
that were storing at any one time less than 500 gallons of liquid PCB waste from the need to seek approval as a commercial
storer of that waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a petition for review of the N&amp;M rule, filed with the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals on September
25, 1990, the petitioner claimed that EPA acted arbitrarily when it narrowed the small volume exemption in the definition
of commercial storer so that only storers of liquid PCB wastes at amounts of less than 500 gallons would qualify. EPA
agreed that there were certain classes of businesses (e.g., companies performing PCB waste treatability studies
and laboratories affiliated with PCB handling companies) that on occasion may possess relatively small quantities
of solid PCB waste generated by others. Under the current rule, these companies do not qualify for the exemption for
small quantity liquid and, therefore, must apply for approval as commercial storers of PCB waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA agreed there may be reasons for establishing a small quantity exemption for solids to complement the rule's small
quantity exemption for liquids. EPA also indicated to the petitioner that until a formal amendment to the rule was
promulgated, no enforcement action would be taken against a facility storing small quantities of PCB solids without
a commercial storage approval if the following requirements were met: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Timely notification to EPA of its PCB waste activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Storage at no time of more than 70 cubic feet of PCB solid waste, the approximate volumetric equivalent of 500 gallons.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Compliance with all other applicable requirements as set forth in TSCA or the PCB rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule would add a small volume exemption for storage of no more than 70 cubic feet of non-liquid PCBs to
the definition of ``commercial storer of PCB waste'' at 761.3. EPA is soliciting comments on the appropriateness
of this small volume exemption for solids and in particular, whether 70 cubic feet is an appropriate cutoff. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also in the proposed amendment to the definition of commercial storer at 761.3, EPA is clarifying a point on the change
of ownership or release of title of PCB waste and how that relates to a person becoming or not becoming a commercial storer
of PCB waste. The following example illustrates the proposed clarification. If a facility that generates and stores
its own waste (e.g., transformers) is sold (or the title otherwise changes ownership), the new owner (or holder of
the title) does not become a commercial storer of PCB waste because the owner is now a storer of waste generated by someone
else. The waste, along with the facility, is now owned by the purchaser, and the purchaser is storing its own waste;
therefore the purchaser is not a commercial storer.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Clarification of Exception Reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing to amend 761.215(b), (c), and (d), which discuss the times when a generator, commercial storer, or
disposer must submit One-year Exception Reports to the EPA Regional Administrator. Currently, a disposer is required
to submit a One-year Exception Report whenever both of the following occur: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The PCB waste is received on a date more than 9 months from the date the PCB waste was removed from service for disposal
as indicated on the manifest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The disposer could not dispose of the PCB waste within 1 year from the date of removal from service for disposal.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A generator is required to submit the Exception Report when a copy of the manifest with the hand-written signature
of the owner or operator of the designated facility has not been received within 45 days of the date the waste was accepted
by the original transporter. Also, a generator or commercial storer who manifests PCBs or PCB Items to a disposer of
PCB waste must submit the Exception Report when both of the following occur: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The waste was transferred to the disposer within 9 months of the date of removal from service for disposal as indicated
on the manifest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The generator or commercial storer has not received within 13 months from the date of removal for disposal a Certificate
of Disposal (CD) or they receive the CD and it indicates that the waste was disposed of on a date more than 1 year after
the date of removal from service for disposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These sections of the regulation do not, however, indicate when the disposer, commercial storer, or generator has
to submit the One-year Exception Report to the Regional Administrator. EPA is proposing to amend 761.215(b), (c),
and (d) to require that the disposer, commercial storer, or generator submit the One-year Exception Report to the
Regional Administrator no later than 30 days from the discovery of the passage of the regulatory deadlines. EPA solicits
comments on the appropriateness of the proposed 30&hyph;day period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Timing for Submission of the Certificate of Disposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 761.218(b) requires that a Certificate of Disposal (CD) be sent to the generator indicated on the manifest
that accompanied the shipment of PCB waste to the disposal facility within 30 days of the date that disposal of the PCB
waste identified on the manifest was completed. Section 761.215(d)(2) indicates that one of the occasions when a
generator or commercial storer should submit a One-year Exception Report to the Regional Administrator is when the
CD is not received from the disposer within 13 months from the date of removal from service for disposal (DORFSFD).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA wishes to clarify that there may be different DORFSFD dates for different individual items on any given manifest.
This means that some items listed on the manifest will need to be disposed of earlier than others to meet the 1&hyph;year
time limit for storage and disposal. Due to the fact that there may be different disposal dates for different items
on the same manifest, there will also be different CDs associated with those different disposal dates (unless of course,
the entire shipment listed on the manifest is disposed of before the 1&hyph;year anniversary of the item with the earliest
DORFSFD). The generator may either submit more than one manifest per shipment based on whether or not there are different
DORFSFDs for the items in the shipment or attach a continuation sheet to reflect the different DORFSFDs. This may be
time consuming initially, but will ensure that the generator receives a proper CD that identifies the specific PCB
Items (noting the generator's identifying number, if assigned) to close the disposal loop on the generated waste.
EPA wants to make clear that it is not appropriate to base the disposal of the item on the manifest with the latest DORFSFD
or, correspondingly, to send the CD based on that item.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. No Manifest for Pre-1978 &lt;50 ppm Spills 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA proposes to amend 761.207(j). This section describes what wastes, based on PCB concentration and factoring in
whether or not dilution has occurred, are subject to the manifesting requirements. The section now states that if
the waste contains less than 50 ppm PCBs, but comes from a source that contained greater than 50 ppm PCBs, the waste is
subject to the manifesting and disposal requirements. Cited as an example is PCB spill cleanup material containing
less than 50 ppm when the spill involved material containing greater than 50 ppm. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment at 761.207(j) would specify that there is no manifest requirement for material currently
below 50 ppm that derives from pre-April 18, 1978, spills (of any concentration) or pre-July 2, 1979 spills less than
500 ppm. This is because (1) the material ``as found'' is below the regulatory threshold that would make it subject
to the disposal requirements of subpart D, and (2) the original spilled material was either below or not subject to
the disposal requirements of part 761, subpart D at the time of the original spill. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the manifest requirement does not apply to material derived from spills that have been decontaminated
in accordance with EPA's spill cleanup policies. In other words, material containing PCBs that has been decontaminated
to the policy standards to a level below 50 ppm would not be treated as if it contained greater than 50 ppm PCBs for disposal
purposes, and could be disposed of in a municipal landfill or by other non-PCB disposal methods. This position is consistent
with EPA's regulations that permit material that has been contaminated as the result of a spill of PCBs to be distributed
in commerce if the material is decontaminated in accordance with the applicable spill cleanup policies. (See 40 CFR
761.20(c)(5).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is soliciting comments on the proposed amendment to 761.207(j) to make it clear as to when one does or does not have
to manifest PCB waste material that is less than 50 ppm.

E. Notification by Transporters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has come to the Agency's attention that there is some confusion in the regulated community as to whether a subcontractor
or a ``permanently leased operator'' can use the EPA Identification Number (EPA ID number) issued to an unrelated
company that has notified as a transporter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since any person engaged in the transportation of regulated PCB waste must, under current 761.205, apply for and receive
an EPA ID number, a ``permanently leased operator'' or a subcontractor must notify separately and receive a separate
and distinct EPA ID number to transport PCB waste. The intent of the PCB N&amp;M rule would be subverted if this were
not the case. The Agency would have no record of who was doing the actual physical transport of PCB waste. Theoretically,
a company could apply for a master ID number that could be used by hundreds of permanently leased operators or subcontractors.
This would be clearly contrary to the intent of the N&amp;M rule which is to have a record of each PCB waste handler. The
regulations at 761.3 define a ``Transporter of PCB waste'' as ``...any person engaged in the transportation of regulated
PCB waste ...'' and 761.205 requires that all transporters notify EPA of their PCB waste handling activities.

F. Renotification for Changes in Facility Operations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 761.202 and 761.205 discuss who must obtain an EPA ID number and how to obtain such an ID number through the
use of EPA Form 7710&hyph;53. EPA wishes to clarify that when a facility has previously notified the Agency of its PCB
waste handling activities using EPA Form 7710&hyph;53 and those activities change (e.g., the owner or operator of
the facility notified EPA as a commercial storer and now wants to engage in the transport of PCB waste, or notified as
a transporter and a commercial storer but no longer wishes to engage in the activity of transporting PCB waste), the
notifier must resubmit EPA Form 7710&hyph;3 to reflect those changes. Other examples of when a PCB waste handler must
renotify the Agency include, but are not limited to, when the company stops handling PCB waste or changes the facility's
location. Indication in a cover letter or on the form itself that this is a resubmission based on changes in facility
operations and not a new submission will help to facilitate the process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing to add this requirement for resubmission of EPA Form 7710&hyph;53 when there is a change in a facility's
status to new 761.205(f). EPA is proposing that the resubmission be submitted to EPA no later than 5 work days after
the change was made.

G. Transfer of Ownership of Commercial Storage Facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing to amend 761.65 by adding a new paragraph (j) to include language on the procedures and timing associated
with the transfer of ownership of a commercial storage facility. The timing and procedures would apply to facilities
with either interim or final approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Existing commercial storage facilities had until August 2, 1990, to submit a completed application to EPA and receive
interim status to operate until the application was formally approved or denied. Section 761.65(d)(3) describes
the information that must be included in the application, such as a closure plan, closure cost estimate, and financial
assurance for closure. The N&amp;M rule did not, however, discuss procedures and criteria for transferring ownership
of a facility with interim status or final approval to operate (as is the case under the regulation implementing RCRA
at 40 CFR 270.72(a)(4)). The Agency is soliciting comments on the following proposed procedure as a way to address
the issue of transfer of ownership of commercial storage facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency would recognize the transfer of interim status or final approval for commercial storage facilities if
all the following conditions were met: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The transferee demonstrated it had established, by the date of transfer, financial assurance for closure pursuant
to 761.65(g) using a mechanism effective as of the date of final approval. This would assure that there would be no lapse
in financial assurance for the transferred facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The transferee submitted a new and complete application for final storage approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Any significant deficiencies (e.g., technical operations, closure plans, cost estimates) that EPA had identified
in the application of the transferor, were resolved in the new application by either the transferor or by the transferee.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new application would also have to include all the elements listed in 40 CFR 761.65(d)(3), including but not limited
to, a demonstration that the applicant and its principal and key employees were qualified to engage in the business
of commercial storage of PCB waste, the facility had the capacity to handle the PCB waste estimated by the applicant,
certification of compliance with the storage facility standards at 761.65(b) and/or (c)(7), a written closure plan,
demonstration of financial responsibility for closure, demonstration that operation of the facility would not
present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, and the environmental compliance history of
the applicant and its principals and key employees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before the transfer of interim status or final approval could occur, EPA would have to review the new application and
deem it ``complete,'' i.e., all the required elements were included in the application. The application would also
have to correct any significant deficiencies previously identified. Of course, EPA would reserve the right to deny
the transfer of the interim approval status or final approval if upon interim review of the new application, EPA determined
that the transferee was not qualified or was unable or unwilling to achieve and maintain its operations in compliance
with TSCA and the PCB rules. In addition, a determination by the EPA Regional Administrator that the transfer of interim
status or final approval could occur would not be determinative of the final decision that would be made regarding
the commercial storage application. EPA would also reserve the right to deny any subsequent transfer request respecting
a particular facility if EPA believed that such a transfer was undertaken to avoid the requirement of seeking a final
commercial storage approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirements proposed above would have to be met before EPA would recognize the transfer of interim status. For
example, Company ``X'' is interested in acquiring ownership of Company ``Y'', which has interim status to operate
as a commercial storer of PCB waste. If EPA does not recognize the transfer of interim status before Company ``X'' takes
legal title of ownership of the facility from Company ``Y'', Company ``X'' may be in violation of the commercial storage
regulations because it did not have interim status to operate at the time it took legal title. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To facilitate the transfer of ownership, the Agency also solicits comments on whether a ``new'' application is entirely
necessary. If, for example, the transferee accepted the contents of the old application, the only parts of the application
that would have to be amended (excluding any deficiencies that have yet to be corrected) would be the financial assurance
for closure, a new list of principles and key employees, and the compliance history of any business with which those
individuals had been affiliated in the preceding 5 years. This submission of an ``amended'' application would save
both the transferee and the EPA time and money and ultimately facilitate the transfer process.

H. Modifications to Storage Facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 761.65(e)(4) discusses when a commercial storage facility must submit a request to EPA for a modification
to its storage approval to amend its closure plan. The Agency is proposing a similar requirement for revising the financial
assurance for closure when there are modifications to the commercial storage facility, for example, where the facility
is enlarged and the maximum inventory of waste increases sufficiently to warrant an increase to the financial assurance
mechanism. EPA is proposing to add 761.65(g)(9) to indicate that when a modification to the storage facility occurs
that warrants establishing a new financial assurance mechanism or amending the existing financial assurance mechanism,
the owner or operator shall have established and activated the new financial assurance mechanism no later than 30
days after the Regional Administrator (or Director, CMD) is notified of the completion of the modification of the
facility, but prior to the use of the modified portion of the facility. In addition, the Regional Administrator (or
Director, CMD) would have to be notified in writing no later than 7 days of completion of the modification to the facility.
EPA is also soliciting comments on the appropriateness of adding those requirements to the existing language at 761.65(f)(3)
since this section also addresses modifications (in this case closure) rather than adding a new paragraph (g)(9)
to 761.65.

I. Clarification of Which Disposers Must Submit Annual Reports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 761.180(b)(3) requires that each owner or operator of a PCB disposal or commercial storage facility shall
submit an annual report to the Regional Administrator of the EPA Region in which the facility is located by July 15 of
each year, that briefly summarizes the records and annual document log required to be maintained and prepared under
paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of that section. Sections 761.180(b)(1) and (b)(2) are recordkeeping requirements
including information obtained from manifests that are generated or received by the facility. If a disposal facility
disposed of only its own waste and, therefore, never received or generated a manifest, it would still have to prepare
an annual document log as per the requirements at 761.180(b)(2)(iii). However, the annual report requirements of
761.180(b)(3) should not be misinterpreted as not applying to such a facility simply because they do not receive or
generate manifests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It was not the intent of the Agency to exclude disposers of PCB waste as defined at 761.3 who dispose of their own waste
from the requirement to submit an annual report. To remedy this discrepancy, EPA is proposing amendments to 761.180(b)(3)
that would state that a disposer's obligation to submit an annual report is based on the act of disposing of PCB waste
material and not necessarily whether or not manifests were received or generated at the facility. This should clarify
EPA's intent on receiving annual reports from all disposers of PCB waste, including those disposing of their own waste.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing to reference 40 CFR 264.143(f)(10) of the regulations implementing RCRA (final rule September 16,
1992, 57 FR 42832) to add an additional financial assurance mechanism for closure of PCB commercial storage facilities.
This mechanism allows for the corporate guarantor to also be a firm with a ``substantial business relationship''
(as in RCRA Subtitle C) with the owner or operator of the commercial storage facility. This additional financial mechanism
would be added to 761.65(g) by adding it as paragraph (g)(7) and redesignating existing paragraph (g)(7) as paragraph
(g)(8).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The PCB N&amp;M rule requires that generators prepare (761.207(a)) and transporters sign and date (761.208(b)(2))
a manifest for each shipment of PCB waste. The rule exempts ``laboratory samples'' from the manifesting requirements
when the samples are, among other things, ``being transported to a laboratory for purposes of testing'' (761.65(i)(2)).
The Agency's policy is that media containing PCBs at >50 ppm which are being sent to validate PCB disposal methods are
not subject to the manifesting requirements of 761.207 and 761.208. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unlike the requirements promulgated for hazardous wastes under RCRA at 40 CFR 261.4, the final PCB N&amp;M rule did
not include an exemption from the manifesting requirements for treatability study samples. While the N&amp;M rule
adopted almost verbatim 40 CFR 261.4(d) regarding laboratory samples, it did not incorporate 40 CFR 261.4(e) regarding
treatability study samples. Accordingly, at this time, the exemption applies only to PCB samples sent to a laboratory
to determine concentration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the existing TSCA requirements, the treatability medium is not an exempt ``laboratory sample'' for two reasons.
First, the medium is not being transported ``for the purposes of testing''. The preamble to the N&amp;M Rule strongly
suggests that ``for purposes of testing'' means analysis to determine the sample's concentration (e.g., is it 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
50 ppm?). As the preamble to the N&amp;M rule states, samples that are sent to a laboratory to determine the PCB concentration
are implicitly authorized for use and not subject to the disposal requirements until the analysis is complete or use
in an enforcement case has ended. (See 54 FR 52716, 52719 (Unit III.D.), December 21, 1989.) Treatability studies,
on the other hand, are in essence small-scale disposal experiments and not efforts solely to determine PCB concentration.
The concentration of treatability media is already known to be greater than 50 ppm. The purpose of testing is not to
determine the PCB concentration but to determine whether the disposal method under review works. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the preamble makes it clear that to be exempt from the requirements of the N&amp;M rule, laboratories
must be ``independent'' from any company whose activities involve PCB waste handling, storage, treatment, and disposal.
Where the entities receiving the media containing PCBs are themselves engaged in treatment and disposal activities
and are affiliated with companies whose other activities also involve PCBs, they would be unable to satisfy the definition
of ``laboratory'' in 761.3.

 Definitions

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In order to promote regulatory uniformity with the exemption for treatability study samples under RCRA and to help
promote and facilitate research and development into alternate disposal and treatment technologies for PCB waste,
the Agency is proposing a new self-implementing PCB disposal approval at 761.60(j) for research and development
for PCB disposal of limited quantities of PCBs, including treatability studies, and to add 761.80(i) to create a class
exemption for processors and distributors of limited quantities of media containing PCBs for research and development.
This disposal approval is explained in greater detail in unit II.D.3.j. of the preamble and the class exemption is
explained in greater detail in Unit III.J. of this preamble. In addition, EPA is proposing to amend 761.3 to add the
definition of ``Treatability Study'' that would essentially mirror the existing definition under RCRA at 40 CFR
260.10. Treatment is a form of disposal under the PCB rules.

L. Clarification of the Term ``Facility'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In today's proposed rule, the Agency is soliciting comments on the need to clarify the terms ``facility'' and ``facilities''.
The term is used in different contexts throughout the regulatory text of 40 CFR part 761. The impetus for the Agency
raising this need for a clarification of the term arose after reviewing a section of preamble language in the PCB Notification
and Manifesting rule (54 FR 52716). In the preamble on page 52722, column 2, the discussion focusses on the requirement
for generators with on-site storage facilities to notify the Agency of their PCB waste handling activities. The first
two sentences in the last paragraph read, ``In submitting their notifications to EPA, members of this class of generator/storer
will submit a notification form for each of their storage areas that is subject to  761.65. EPA will issue a unique identification
number to each notifying storage facility, and this identification number will correspond to the physical location
of the facility.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Here the terms ``storage area'' and ``storage facility'' are used interchangeably; in the first case to mean a particular
building, structure, cell, or unit, and in the second instance, all structures on contiguous land or specified piece
of property. As a matter of record, it was not the Agency's intent to require notification for each storage unit on the
contiguous piece of property, which would result in multiple, individual identification numbers for that property.
The facility, regardless of the number of storage areas or units on the piece of property, need only notify once for
that contiguous piece of property. Therefore, in this instance, the term facility means, all contiguous land and
structures used for the storage of PCB waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are, however, other sections of the PCB regulations where the term facility means an individual unit or structure;
most notably at 761.65(b)(1). Here the regulation states that a facility used for the storage of PCBs and PCB Items
shall have an adequate roof, walls, and floor; continuous curbing with a minimum 6 inch high curb; no floor drains or
expansions joints, etc.; and shall not be located at a site below the 100&hyph;year flood water elevation. It is clear
in this instance that the Agency is not referring to a contiguous piece of property but to an individual structure or
unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the vast majority of cases in 40 CFR part 761, the term facility refers to the contiguous piece of property including
the structures or individual storage or disposal units on that property. There are, however, 10 or so citations in
the PCB regulations where the term facility refers only to the individual unit or structure. It is these 10 places in
the regulation where EPA is proposing to delete the term facility and insert a term whose definition will best represent
the Agency's intent (i.e., an individual unit, structure, or building). The Agency solicits comments on the most
appropriate term to convey this meaning. For purposes of this proposed rule, the term ``unit'' will be used to indicate
this change in the proposed regulatory text. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Agency welcomes comments if it has inadvertently omitted a section or sections of the regulations
where the term facility should be deleted and the term ``unit'' inserted or for that matter made a change where one was
not appropriate.

V. Confidentiality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All comments will be placed in the public record unless the commenter claims that they contain confidential business
information (CBI) and the comments are clearly labeled as containing information claimed as CBI at the time of submission.
Because of the need to expedite the review of any CBI claims, each claim must be accompanied by detailed comments substantiating
the claim as described in 40 CFR 2.204(e)(4). While a part of the public record, comments claimed as CBI will be treated
in accordance with 40 CFR part 2. A sanitized version of all comments subject to CBI claims must be submitted to EPA for
the public record by the close of the comment period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is the responsibility of the commenter to comply with 40 CFR part 2 so that all materials claimed as confidential
may be properly protected. This includes, but is not limited to, clearly indicating on the face of the comment (as well
as on any associated correspondence) that information claimed to be CBI is included, or marking ``CONFIDENTIAL,''
``TSCA CBI,'' or a similar designation on the face of each document or attachment in the comment which contains the
claimed CBI. EPA considers the failure to clearly identify the claimed confidential status on the face of the comment
or attachment as a waiver of any such claim and will make such information available to the public without further notice
to the commentor.

In accordance with the requirements of section 19(a)(3) of TSCA, EPA is issuing the following list of documents, which
constitutes the record of this proposed rulemaking. The official records of previous PCB rulemakings are incorporated
as they exist in the TSCA Public Docket. This record includes basic information considered by the Agency in developing
this proposal. A full list of these materials is available for inspection and copying in the TSCA Nonconfidential
Information Center from 12 noon to 4 p.m. However, any CBI that is a part of the record for this rulemaking is not available
for public review. A public version of the record, from which CBI has been excluded, is available for inspection.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the Order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to (1) have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting
a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local,
or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) create serious inconsistency
or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially alter the budgetary impacts
of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raise
novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth
in this Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, OMB determined that this rule was ``significant'' because of the substantial
cost savings estimated in association with the changes proposed. As such, this rule was submitted to OMB for review
and any changes made in response to OMB comments are available for review in the docket.

Section 603 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (15 U.S.C. 8091 et seq. Pub. L. 96&hyph;534. September 19, 1980), requires
EPA to prepare and make available for comment a regulatory flexibility analysis in connection with rulemaking. The
initial regulatory flexibility analysis must describe the impact of the proposed rule on small business entities.
If, however, a regulation will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities, no such regulatory
impact analysis is required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendments to the PCB regulations will generate a variety of regulatory and deregulatory impacts on
the diverse entities and industries affected by PCB handling and disposal requirements. This section examines the
compliance costs and cost savings the regulated community will experience as a result of the proposed amendments.
It also assesses how the PCB amendments will affect a variety of small businesses that handle and dispose of PCB Items
and PCB wastes.

 This section describes compliance costs and cost savings estimated for each of the proposed revisions to the PCB regulations.
The cost estimates use various economic data inputs. In several cases, wage rate estimates were used for estimating
the labor costs or cost savings from regulatory changes. The wage rates are derived from an EPA study and represent
standard wage rate estimates used in OPPT studies. The hourly wage rates used are:

Treatment of costs for provisions that codify EPA policy.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In several instances, an EPA policy has been developed in response to new information received by EPA or concerns about
compliance problems, and the proposed rule would codify these policies. Because the existing regulations differ
from EPA's policies, two sets of cost estimates were prepared based on two different baselines. The strict language
of the existing regulations served as the first baseline, which was used to generate cost estimates for all sections
of the proposed regulations. Actual EPA policy or practice was used as the baseline for 29 provisions of the amendments.
In cases where the current EPA policy and the existing regulations do not differ, a single cost estimate was prepared
and applied in either case.

 All cost estimates were prepared assuming full compliance with the existing and the proposed regulations, although

estimate the costs of the proposed regulations; the actions necessary to achieve compliance with the existing regulations
are not considered.

Treatment of the effect of the proposed amendments on disposal capacity and disposal prices.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The analysis does not reflect possible effects of the proposed amendments on either disposal capacity or disposal
costs for PCB wastes. The proposed amendments include several elements that could reduce demand for disposal of PCB
wastes in chemical landfills, such as allowing for longer storage of some wastes and for use of alternative disposal
technologies. It is reasonable to anticipate that the availability of alternatives to TSCA permitted landfills
and incinerators will lower costs for disposal at those facilities. Nevertheless, these market changes were not
modeled in this study.

Consideration of future declines in the volume of PCB waste requiring disposal.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In future years the amount of PCB waste will decline. Discussions with various industry representatives, however,
indicated that this waste stream still would be substantial for a number of years. Disposal of PCB-Contaminated soils
from remediation sites, one of the major categories of wastes addressed in the proposed regulations, is likely to
continue for several decades.

The estimated time horion for disposal of PCB wastes from remediation sites is based on estimates of the time needed
for remediating hazardous waste sites in the Superfund program. EPA estimated that at the current rate of cleanup,
remediation of the sites on the National Priority List will take 48 more years (U.S. EPA, 1993).

Cost annualization.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In several cases, the compliance costs or cost savings would be incurred solely in the first year after regulatory
implementation. Examples of such regulations include one-time requirements for the registration of transformers.
Since most new elements create recurring annual costs or cost savings, consistency required that the one-time elements
be annualized. The one-time items were annualized over 5 years at 3 percent per year (annualization factor of 0.2184).
The 5&hyph;year time horizon was chosen as most appropriate for the administrative and recordkeeping tasks most
numerous among the first-year requirements; a longer annualization schedule would have suggested long-term investments,
such as in durable assets and equipment; a shorter term annualization schedule would suggest regulatory requirements
that need to be renewed.

Aggregate net cost estimates
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Table 4&hyph;1 of the Regulatory Impact Analysis developed for this rulemaking presents the aggregate net cost
savings for the PCB regulations under the two baselines. The net cost impact of the proposed amendments, using either
current EPA policy or the EPA regulation as the baseline, is a cost savings of over $4 billion per year. This figure was
based on cost savings of $4.2 billion to $4.8 billion per year under the alternative baselines, and compliance costs
of $11.6 million. As noted in the previous section, these cost savings would likely extend indefinitely into the future.
The difference between the two baselines occurs because current EPA policy took into account exceptional compliance
difficulties that arose when previously unknown sources of PCB contamination were discovered. A strict interpretation
of the existing PCB regulations in these areas would have generated large compliance costs for various users of PCBs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The specific areas of additional compliance costs (i.e., incremental to baseline conditions) and cost savings are
discussed below.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Areas of additional cost
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The total incremental costs for new compliance requirements in the proposed regulations were estimated to be $11.6
million. This estimate does not include certain cost items that are included in paragraphs that show a net cost savings.
The effect of these additional items on the total compliance costs, however, is quite modest. The compliance cost
estimate is the same for either baseline since the existing regulatory environment does not influence the cost of
new requirements. Table 4&hyph;2 of the Regulatory Impact Analysis developed for this rulemaking lists the sections
of the proposed regulation that will lead to additional costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Six provisions of the proposed regulations describe new recordkeeping or reporting requirements for facilities
with PCB equipment or wastes. The two most costly of these requirements are under 761.180(a)(1)(iii) and (iv), which
require recordkeeping and the preparation of an inventory of PCB equipment. These two sections would generate estimated
annual compliance costs of $3,771,180. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another major cost increment would be generated by 761.60(b)(6)(ii), the disposal of drained PCB Articles. While
the existing policy did not regulate the disposal of these articles, the proposed regulations specify acceptable
disposal means. The total additional costs are estimated to be $3.5 million, generated primarily by greater costs
for disposing of PCB-Contaminated Transformers. Most transformers now are disposed of via industrial furnace,
but certain of these facilities would not meet the furnace standards specified in proposed 761.60(a)(4), and the
furnaces no longer would be able to accept this equipment. It is likely that most of these PCB Articles would be incinerated
or placed in chemical waste landfills. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Costs of $1.3 million and $1.1 million per year were estimated for 761.40(k) and 761.30(a)(1)(vii), which cover the
marking of PCB Large Low-Voltage Capacitors and Transformers and the registration with EPA of PCB Transformers in
use, respectively. Many facilities are estimated to require 4 hours or more to locate, mark, and register these items.
Similarly, the transformer registration requirement would require electric utilities and a variety of industrial
facilities to submit information on their PCB Transformers. While this amendment requires only the submission of
information that the firms should have readily available, a large number of facilities would incur some expense to
register their PCB Transformers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

of equipment. Incremental costs are estimated to be $0.9 million per year.

language to indicate appropriate options for the disposal of drained equipment. The added costs are estimated to
be $131,400 per year.

 Areas of cost savings.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Cost savings of $4.2 billion to $4.8 billion per year are estimated using either existing EPA policy or the existing
regulations as the baseline. The areas of estimated cost savings are summarized in Table 4&hyph;3 of the Regulatory
Impact Analysis developed for this rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provision expected to result in the largest cost savings (estimated at slightly over $4.0 billion per year) is
proposed 761.61, which covers the disposal of remediation wastes when the existing EPA regulations are used as the
baseline. This section allows an expanded set of disposal options and simplified administrative procedures, where
the existing regulation allowed only chemical waste landfilling and incineration. There is, however, uncertainty
about the estimate of the remediation rate (i.e., the amount of waste that is remediated annually); the variation
in the plausible values of this estimate produces a range for the annual cost savings of $2 billion to $6 billion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The disposal of non-remediation waste, covered in proposed 761.62, is estimated to generate another large annual
cost savings ($150 million per year) compared to either the existing regulations or EPA policy. The proposed rule
establishes disposal options other than chemical waste landfills or incineration for non-remediation wastes containing
PCBs in concentrations 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
&lt;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
50 ppm. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional substantial cost savings of the PCB amendments were estimated at $500 million per year for proposed 761.30(q),
the Continued Use of Pre-TSCA PCBs. The proposed section provides that PCB Items (such as HVAC gaskets, plastic, plasticizers,
electric cable, and others) would be authorized for use for the remainder of their useful life, whereas the existing
regulations banned the use of these items. The large estimated savings for this section are based on the estimates
of the number of buildings with PCB contamination for which continued use is allowed under the regulatory amendments.
The number of these locations is not known, however, and thus cost savings can only be roughly approximated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another provision that would result in cost savings is proposed 761.60(b)(5), which covers the abandonment and disposal
of PCB-Contaminated natural gas pipelines. An annual cost savings of close to $63 million is generated because the
proposed regulations would allow considerably greater latitude in dealing with this waste stream than did the existing
regulations. Under the existing regulations, all PCB-Contaminated natural gas pipelines that are inaccessible
for characterization or that contain PCBs in concentrations >500 ppm require excavation and either incineration
or disposal in chemical waste landfills. Based on existing EPA policies, which are similar to the proposed regulations,
the annual cost savings is much smaller_$387,310. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another area of cost savings is estimated for proposed 761.60(b)(6)(iii), which identifies disposal options for
nonporous surfaces, including metal ship and submarine hulls and air handling systems contaminated by PCBs at concentrations

. The existing regulations require these materials to be disposed of via chemical waste landfill or incineration.
The annual cost savings of this provision is estimated to be $37.5 million, using either the existing regulations
or EPA policy as the baseline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A cost savings of $10.6 million per year was estimated for 761.77, Coordinated Approval, using either the existing
regulations or EPA policy as the baseline. These proposed regulations would acknowledge permits for PCB facilities
(i.e, for land disposal, incineration, research and development, alternative disposal technologies, commercial
storage, or site remediation) issued under other State and Federal environmental programs, including RCRA, and
where states classify PCBs as hazardous wastes or regulate PCBs in a similar fashion to the TSCA regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
50 ppm, provided that a Spill Prevention Plan has been prepared. Existing measures allow temporary storage only when
concentrations are 50 ppm up to 500 ppm. The estimated annual savings is $3.0 million, using either the existing regulations
or EPA policy as the baseline.

 Section 761.65(a) extends the allowable storage period for PCB wastes and allows EPA to grant storage time extensions

 Section 761.65(c)(6) allows the use of a wider range of DOT approved containers for storing liquid and non-liquid
PCBs, and thereby avoids the need to revise the PCB regulations after each change to the DOT regulations. A cost savings
of $565,000 per year was estimated for this provision.

 Regulatory impact on small businesses.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The PCB amendments would affect a variety of small businesses that handle and dispose of PCB Items and PCB wastes. This
section considers the economic impacts on those businesses and addresses the analytical requirements of the Regulatory
Flexibility Act (RFA). The RFA requires agencies to explore options for minimizing small business impacts whenever
there is a ``significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' While this discussion will
consider the significance of the potential impacts, EPA's internal policy is to consider any impacts on any small
entities (U.S. EPA, 1992d).

 Economic impacts on small industrial furnace operations.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The small industrial furnace operators handling PCB-Contaminated transformers would experience negative economic
impacts as a result of the proposed amendments. It was estimated that approximately 100 industrial furnace operations
specialize in recovery of transformer carcasses. Most of the businesses are small, ranging from owner-operated
units with fewer than 10 employees, to larger operations approaching 100 employees. The major asset for these facilities
is their furnace which, in the case of Aljon-United furnaces, carries a capital cost of over $100,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Through contacts with a selection of operators, their likely response to the PCB amendments was estimated. In general,
firms would not be likely to invest in the new furnace equipment that would meet EPA specifications. The new equipment
is quite costly and the high temperatures required would make recovery of the metals impossible. It was estimated
that, on average, these operations derive approximately 15 percent of their inputs from PCB-Contaminated transformers,
based on several contacts with industry personnel. The remainder of their inputs are non-PCB-Contaminated transformers
and other electrical equipment. There are no financial statistics available through conventional or other sources
of industry data that can provide an overview of the condition of the metal recovery furnace industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given these characteristics of the affected industrial furnace operations, the EPA criteria to determine whether
the economic impacts are significant were applied. None of the first three criteria shown could be evaluated, however,
because they all are defined by the size of the compliance costs incurred. The industrial furnace operators would
not incur direct compliance costs, choosing instead to cease handling of the PCB-Contaminated transformers. The
last criterion asks whether the small firms will cease operations. Based on discussions with industry firms, it was
estimated that few operations would shut down. As noted, the affected PCB transformers represent approximately
15 percent of the inputs for metal recovery operations. A corresponding 15 percent decline in profits, while representing
a hardship, should not cause many plant shutdowns. Most likely there would not be many firms whose inputs, owing to
a peculiarity in their sources of supply, contain a much higher portion of PCB-Contaminated transformers than other
firms. Nevertheless, some firms might experience sharper profit declines. Also, firms that are currently in poor
financial condition could be weakened further as a result of the amendments and might, therefore, now face closure.
The extent or likelihood of such closures cannot be estimated, however.

 Economic impacts on small demolition contractors
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Section 761.60(b)(2)(ii) prohibits disposal of more than 24 light ballasts as municipal solid wastes. Most waste
light ballasts are generated during building demolition operations. Many demolition contractors that handle the
disposal of light ballasts, and their customers, would incur increased disposal costs due to these regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At present, most PCB light ballasts are disposed of as municipal solid waste. Demolition contractors, however, would
be required to assemble and transport PCB-containing light ballasts for transportation to and disposal at a PCB disposal
facility. The aggregate economic impact was estimated for this provision of the regulations at $54 million for disposal
of approximately 30 million PCB-containing light ballasts. This translates to an average incremental cost of approximately
$1.80 per PCB-containing light ballast, covering transportation and disposal, as derived in the specific cost estimates
for this provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The size of the incremental cost incurred on a specific demolition job would vary directly with the size of the job.
Thus, relatively small demolition jobs (those generating only slightly more than 24 PCB-containing light ballasts,
for example, those with 25 to 50 ballasts) would incur incremental disposal costs of $45 to $90 (25 to 50 times $1.80).
In contrast, large demolition jobs, with thousands of light ballasts would incur additional disposal costs of several
thousands of dollars. Thus, the incremental costs are distributed among demolition jobs according to their size,
and the incremental costs would not be likely to be a large percentage increase in the cost of demolition jobs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Demolition contractors do not vary much in their ability to handle and dispose of PCB-containing light ballasts,
so there would not be much variation in the unit costs of compliance among firms. For example, virtually all demolition
firms would use commercial waste facilities to dispose of light ballasts. This consistency of impacts among firms
suggests that firms would not be able to compete on their ability to dispose of PCB wastes, and therefore, would all
face similar cost increases. In competitive markets, where all firms face similar cost increases, the price of services
should increase to cover the increase in costs. Thus, demolition contractors would be likely to pass the incremental
disposal costs to their customers, new building or land development companies, and therefore, would be able to mitigate
even minor cost impacts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA criteria on small business impacts were applied to the case of demolition contractors. None of the four criteria
are satisfied, however, by the regulatory impacts. Compliance costs are estimated to be less than 5 percent of the
costs of production and less than 10 percent of the cost of sales in all but very exceptional circumstances. Essentially
no capital cost expenditures would be required of the affected firms. Finally, few operations, if any, would likely
fail due to these regulatory impacts.

 Economic impacts on other small businesses
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Small businesses in other industries also would be affected by the PCB amendments. These costs were estimated, however,
to be widely distributed among small firms, and generally would be distributed in proportion to the level of PCB disposal
activities. Also, the aggregate costs of these remaining items is not very large, and therefore, no significant impacts
on small businesses are forecast. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Among the businesses potentially affected are a small number of companies that currently have special EPA approvals
to decontaminate various types of PCB-Contaminated equipment, including PCB Transformers, components of natural
gas pipelines, and others. For these businesses, the proposed amendments might generate additional competition
because many more companies would be able to decontaminate equipment without needing to obtain special EPA approval.
It was judged, however, that impacts are likely to be modest among such firms. The companies in question are either
confident that their clients would not be interested in decontaminating their own equipment (due either to the capital
investments required or the relative ease of using outside contractor personnel for these functions) or the PCB-decontamination
business represented a modest portion of their current operations.

C. Paperwork Reduction Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. authorizes the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) to review certain information collection requests by Federal Agencies. EPA has determined that the
recordkeeping and reporting requirements of this rule constitute a ``collection of information'' as defined at
44 U.S.C. 3502(4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information collection requirements of this proposed rule have been submitted for approval to the OMB under the
Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. An Information Collection Request document has been prepared by EPA
(ICR No. 1729), and a copy may be obtained from the Information Policy Branch (2136), Environmental Protection Agency,
401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public burden for this collection of information is estimated to average anywhere from 140 hours to 1,977 hours
per respondent depending on the PCB activities in which the respondent is engaged. These estimates include time for
reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the needed data, and completing
and reviewing the collection of information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions
for reducing this burden, should be submitted to the Chief, Information Policy Branch (2136), Environmental Protection
Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. These comments should also be submitted to the Office of Information
and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503, marked ATTENTION: Desk Officer for
EPA. The final rule will respond to any OMB or public comments on the information collection requirements contained
in this proposal.

(b) This part applies to all persons who manufacture, process, distribute in commerce, use, or dispose of PCBs or PCB
Items. Substances that are regulated by this part include, but are not limited to: dielectric fluids; contaminated
solvents; oils; waste oils; heat transfer fluids; hydraulic fluids; paints; sludges; slurries; sediments; dredge
spoils; soils; materials contaminated as a result of spills; and other chemical substances or combinations of substances,
including impurities and byproducts and any byproduct, intermediate, or impurity manufactured at any point in a
process. Unless otherwise noted, references to volumes or weights in this part apply to total volume or weight of the
material containing or contacting PCBs. Most of the provisions of this part apply to PCBs only if PCBs are present in
concentrations above a specified level. For example, subpart D of this part applies generally to materials at concentrations
of 50 parts per million (ppm) and above. Also, certain provisions of subpart B of this part apply to PCBs inadvertently
generated in manufacturing processes at concentrations specified in the definition of ``PCB'' under  761.3. PCB
concentrations for non-liquid PCBs under this part shall be determined on a dry weight basis according to the definition
at 761.3. For liquid PCBs as defined in 761.3, PCB concentrations shall be determined on a wet weight basis. For samples
containing PCBs and equal to or greater than 0.5 percent non-dissolved non-liquid materials, the non-dissolved
materials shall be separated and the PCB concentration determined for non-liquid PCBs; the rest of the sample shall
be considered to be liquid PCBs. For multiphasic non-liquid/liquid or liquid/liquid mixtures, the phases shall
be separated before chemical analysis. Following phase separation, the PCB concentration in each non-liquid phase
shall be determined on a dry weight basis and the PCB concentration in each liquid phase shall be determined separately
on a wet weight basis. No provision specifying a PCB concentration may be avoided as a result of any dilution, unless
otherwise specifically provided.

 means a capacitor which contains less than 1.36 kg (3 lbs.) of dielectric fluid. The following assumptions may be used
if the actual weight of the dielectric fluid is unknown. A capacitor whose total volume is less than 1,639 cubic centimeters
(100 cubic inches) may be considered to contain less than 1.36 kgs (3 lbs.) of dielectric fluid and a capacitor whose
total volume is more than 3,278 cubic centimeters (200 cubic inches) must be considered to contain more than 1.36 kg
(3 lbs.) of dielectric fluid. A capacitor whose volume is between 1,639 and 3,278 cubic centimeters may be considered

Commercial storer of PCB waste
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means the owner or operator of each facility that is subject to the PCB storage unit standards of 761.65 and who engages
in storage activities involving PCB waste generated by others, or PCB waste that was removed while servicing the equipment
owned by others and brokered for disposal. The receipt of a fee or any other form of compensation for storage services
is not necessary to qualify as a commercial storer of PCB waste. It is sufficient under this definition that the facility
stores PCB waste generated by others or the facility removed the PCB waste while servicing equipment owned by others.
If a facility's storage of PCB waste at no time exceeds 500 gallons of liquid or 70 cubic feet of non-liquid PCBs, the
owner or operator is a commercial storer but is not required to seek EPA approval as a commercial storer of PCB waste.
Change in ownership or title of a generator's facility, where the generator is storing PCB waste, does not make the
new owner of the facility a commercial storer of PCB waste.

PCB field screening test
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means a portable analytical device or kit which measures PCBs. PCB field screening tests usually report less than
or greater than a specific numerical PCB concentration. These tests normally build in a safety factor which increases
the probability of a false positive report and decreases the probability of a false negative report. PCB field screening
tests do not usually provide: an identity record generated by an instrument; a quantitative comparison record from
calibration standards; any identification of PCBs; and/or any indication or identification of interferences with
the measurement of the PCBs. PCB field screening test technologies include, but may not be limited to, total chlorine
colorimetric tests, total chlorine x-ray fluorescence tests, total chlorine microcoulometric tests, and rapid
immunoassay tests.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For purposes of this section, permissible research and development (R&amp;D) activities include, but are not limited
to: the chemical analysis of PCBs for purposes of determining PCB concentrations; scientific experimentation on:
the physical properties of PCBs, and chemical reactions of PCBs (other than the evaluation of the disposal or destruction
of PCBs), and the chemical analysis of PCBs; and testing to determine: environmental transport processes, biochemical
transport processes, the effects of PCBs on the atmospheric environment, aquatic environments, terrestrial environments,
and the health effects of PCBs such as general toxicity, subchronic toxicity, chronic toxicity, specific organ/tissue
toxicity, neurotoxicity, genetic toxicity, and metabolic products. However, R&amp;D activities authorized pursuant
to this section do not include research or analysis for the development of any PCB product. In addition, R&amp;D activities
authorized in this section do not include R&amp;D for disposal, including, but not limited to, demonstrations for
PCB disposal approvals, pre-demonstration tests, testing major modifications to approved PCB technologies, treatability
studies, the development of new disposal technologies, and research on transformation processes such as biodegradation.
R&amp;D for disposal activities are addressed in 761.60(j). The R&amp;D activities conducted under this section
are subject to all other applicable Federal, State, and local laws and regulations. PCBs may be used for R&amp;D in
limited quantities when originally packaged in hermetically sealed containers of 5 milliliters or less, or as samples
of environmental media in containers larger than 5 milliliters containing PCBs that have been packaged pursuant
to applicable DOT performance standards, in a manner other than a totally enclosed manner, provided that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The Regional Administrator for the Region in which the R&amp;D activity will occur is notified in writing at least
30 days prior to the commencement of any R&amp;D activity authorized under this section. Each notification shall
identify the person conducting the R&amp;D activity, the location where the PCB R&amp;D activities will be conducted,
the quantity of PCBs to be treated, the type of R&amp;D technology to be used, the general physical and chemical properties
of the material being treated, and an estimate of the duration of the PCB activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) No more than 100 grams of pure PCBs is used for R&amp;D activities under this section at a facility annually. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) All PCB wastes (e.g., spent laboratory samples, residuals, unused samples, contaminated media/instrumentation,
clothing, etc.) are stored in compliance with the storage requirements of 761.65(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Manifests are used for all R&amp;D PCB wastes being transported from the R&amp;D facility to a commercial storer
and/or a disposal facility. However, no manifests are required if the residuals or unused samples of PCB wastes are
returned to the site of generation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Material limitations for use of PCBs, are set out at paragraph (j)(1) of this section shall not be exceeded without
prior approval from the Regional Administrator. Requests to exceed the material limitation for PCBs used in R&amp;D
as defined in this section must be submitted in writing to the Regional Administrator for the Region in which the R&amp;D
will be conducted for approval. Each request must provide a justification for the additional quantity or concentration
needed, as well as specify the quantity or concentration of PCB material needed, and the duration of the activity.
Any approval will be in writing and signed by the Regional Administrator. The approval will state all requirements
applicable to the R&amp;D activity.

PCBs disposed of, placed in a land disposal facility, spilled, or otherwise released into the environment prior to
April 18, 1978, will be presumed to be disposed of in a manner that does not present a risk of exposure and, therefore,
does not require further disposal action unless a Regional Administrator makes a finding that such a disposal prior
to April 18, 1978 presents a risk of exposure from PCBs. The Regional Administrator may then require the submission
of an application for a risk-based disposal approval under 761.61 or 761.62. Liquid PCBs shall not be processed into
non-liquid forms to circumvent the high temperature incineration requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.
Open burning of PCBs is prohibited. Combustion of PCBs approved under 761.60(a) or (e), or otherwise allowed under
part 761 is not open burning. When storage is desired prior to disposal, PCBs at concentrations of 50 ppm or greater
shall be stored in a facility which complies with 761.65. Except as authorized in 761.30 or prohibited in 761.20, PCB
waste must be disposed of in accordance with the provisions of this subpart. Any person disposing of PCBs is also responsible
for determining and complying with all other applicable Federal, State, or local laws or regulations.

) A comparison study, using an appropriate gas chromatography (GC) analytical procedure such as EPA Method 8080 or
8280 to analyze the PCB remediation wastes, shows that there are no materials present in the PCB remediation waste
which would interfere with the screening test. (For purposes of this section, interfering with the PCB field screening
test means that for the analysis of at least three samples having PCB levels greater than 10 ppm, the PCB concentration
reported by the PCB field screening test is no less than 75 percent of the PCB concentration reported GC method for the
same sample.)

On-site cleanup and disposal of PCB remediation waste.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For purposes of cleaning or decontaminating PCB remediation waste under this section there are two general categories
of waste: bulk PCB remediation waste (everything other than non-porous surfaces, such as: soil, sediments, dredged
materials, debris, muds, municipal sludge, industrial sludge, and porous surfaces) and non-porous surfaces. Sampling
for the verification of the cleanup of the PCB remediation wastes shall be in accordance with Appendix II of this part.
Interim sampling during on-going cleanup may use PCB screening tests to determine when to take samples to verify that
cleanup is complete. Requirements for the use of the PCB screening tests for this interim sampling are the same as for
site characterization in paragraphs (a)(2)(ii)(B) of this section.

 Any persons storing PCB waste that is subject to the 1&hyph;year time limit for storage and disposal in paragraph (a)(1)
of this section may provide written notification to the Regional Administrator for the Region in which the PCB waste
is stored that they have been unsuccessful in their continuing attempts to dispose of or secure disposal for their
waste within the 1&hyph;year time limit. Upon receipt of the notice by the Regional Administrator, the time for disposal
is automatically extended by action of this section for 1 additional year (2 years total) if the following conditions
are met: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The notification is received by the Regional Administrator at least 30 days before the expiration of the initial
1&hyph;year time limit and it identifies the storer, the types, volumes, and location of the waste and the reasons
for failure to meet the initial 1&hyph;year time limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A written record documenting all continuing attempts to secure disposal is maintained until the waste is disposed
of. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The written record required by paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section is available for inspection or submission
if requested, by the Agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Continuing attempts to secure disposal must have been initiated within 30 days of the time the waste is first subject
to the 1&hyph;year time limit requirement (i.e., the date of removal from service for disposal). A claim that disposal
costs are prohibitive or failure to initiate and continue attempts to secure disposal throughout the total time the
waste is in storage shall automatically disqualify the notifier from receiving an automatic extension under this
section.

 Extensions under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, may be granted as a condition of any TSCA PCB Disposal approval,
by the Regional Administrator for the Region in which the PCBs or PCB Items are to be stored or the Director, Chemical
Management Division (CMD), as appropriate, if the Regional Administrator or Director, CMD determines that there
is a demonstrated need or justification for such extension and that no unreasonable risk of injury to health or the
environment will result. Criteria for extending the 1&hyph;year time limit for storage and disposal include, but
are not limited to, lack of disposal capacity, the absence of a treatment technology, or insufficient time to complete
the treatment/destruction process and a demonstration that relevant treatment or disposal options are being pursued.
In granting such extensions, the Regional Administrator or the Director, CMD may require the submission of any information
the Regional Administrator or the Director, CMD believes is necessary for an evaluation of the requested extension
and periodic progress reports that demonstrate that appropriate treatment or disposal options are being pursued.

 Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, the EPA Regional Administrator for the Region in which a PCB disposal
or PCB commercial storage facility described in paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section is located may issue a TSCA
PCB Coordinated Approval to the persons described in those paragraphs if the conditions listed in this section are
met. A TSCA PCB Coordinated Approval will designate the persons who own and who are authorized to operate the facilities
described in paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section and will apply only to such persons. All requirements, conditions,
and limitations of any other permit or waste management document described in those paragraphs are deemed to be conditions
of the TSCA PCB Coordinated Approval whose violation is a prohibited act under section 15 of TSCA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Persons seeking a TSCA PCB Coordinated Approval shall submit a request for approval by certified mail, return
receipt requested, to the Regional Administrator for the Region in which the activity will take place. Persons seeking
a TSCA PCB Coordinated Approval for a new PCB activity shall submit the request for approval at the same time they seek
a permit, approval, or other action for a PCB waste management activity under any other Federal or State authority.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The request for approval shall include a copy of the letter from EPA announcing or confirming the EPA ID Number issued
to the facility for conducting PCB activities; the name, organization, and telephone number of the individual who
is the point of contact for the non-TSCA Federal, State, or local permitting authority; a description of the waste
management activities to be conducted if a permit or other relevent waste management document has not been issued;
a copy of the relevant permit or waste management document specified in paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section;
and a certification that the person who owns or operates the facility is aware of and will adhere to the TSCA PCB reporting
and recordkeeping requirements at subparts J and K of this part. When a permit or other waste management document has
been issued for the PCB waste activity, a final copy of the non-TSCA document that will be used during the PCB activity,
including all requirements, conditions, and limitations, shall be submitted to the Regional Administrator. This
requirement may be waived, in writing, by the Regional Administrator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The Regional Administrator shall confirm receipt of the request for approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(3) A written record must be established and maintained for a period of 3 years from the date of any decontamination
under this section. The record must show sampling locations and analytical results and must be retained at the site
of the decontamination or a copy of the record must be made available to EPA in a timely manner, if requested. This recordkeeping
requirement does not apply when sampling is not required under this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) For purposes of decontamination under this section, filtering, soaking, wiping, stripping of insulation, chopping,
scraping or the use of abrasives to remove or separate PCBs from contaminated surfaces or liquids does not require
a disposal approval under subpart D of this part.

a PCB waste is spill cleanup material containing less than 50 ppm PCBs when the spill involved material containing
PCBs at a concentration of 50 ppm or greater. However, there is no manifest requirement for material currently below
50 ppm which derives from pre-April 18, 1978, spills of any concentration, pre-July 2, 1979, spills of less than 500
ppm PCBs, or materials decontaminated in accordance 761.20(c)(5) of this part.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.1 There are three site selection parameters: position around the circumference of a selected pipe segment or pipe,
position along the length of a selected pipe segment or pipe, and selection of a pipe segment from a length of pipe or
population (group) of pipe segments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.2 Position around the circumference of a pipe segment or pipe. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.2.1 When pipe or a pipe segment is accessed for sampling, the pipe shall be marked to identify the location of the bottom
of the pipe or pipe segment when the natural gas pipeline was in service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.2.2 The inside center of the bottom of a pipe or pipe segment shall be sampled. The sample shall be centered on the bottom
of the pipe, that is, the sample shall encompass an equal area on both sides of the middle of the bottom of the pipe for
the entire length of the sample. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.3 Position along the length of the pipe or pipe segment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.3.1 The sample shall be taken 15 centimeters (6 inches) inside the end of a pipe or pipe segment at the bottom of the
pipe or pipe segment as determined in procedure 3.2 of this appendix. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.3.2 If the sample site location selected in procedure 3.3.1 of this appendix is a porous surface (for example, there
is significant corrosion so as to shred the wipe material), then the sample site shall be moved inward (away from the
end of the pipe or pipe segment) until there is no such porous surface. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.3.3 There are three options in the event that there is no non-porous surface accessible by procedure 3.3.1 or 3.3.2
of this appendix. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.3.3.1 The sample for that pipe or pipe segment shall only be taken at one end and a written notation documented in the
sampling and analysis records as to why only one sample was taken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.3.3.2 Select another pipe segment using the random selection procedure in 3.4.2 of this appendix, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.3.3.3 In the event that there is no other pipe or pipeline in the population to be sampled and both ends of a pipe have
porous surfaces at all possible sample collection sites, then the pipe segment or pipe shall be assumed to contain
greater than 50 but less than 500 ppm PCBs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.4 Selection of a pipe segment from a length of pipe or population (group) of pipe segments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.4.1 For purposes of wipe sampling pipe segments, the segments shall not exceed 12.1 meters (40 feet) in length. In
the event that a segment is longer than 12.1 meters in length, the segment shall be cut so that all resulting segments
are 12.1 meters or less in length. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.4.2 Pipe segments removed from the ground for disposal shall be sampled at each end. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.4.2.1 When a length of pipe having seven or fewer segments is removed for purposes of disposal, samples shall be taken
at each end of each segment removed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.4.2.2 When a length of pipe having multiple contiguous segments less than 3 miles in total length is removed for purposes
of disposal, samples shall be taken at each end of the first and last segments removed and each end of five randomly chosen
segments in between. A total of seven segments shall be sampled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.4.2.3 When a length of pipe having multiple contiguous segments more than 3 miles in total length is removed for purposes
of disposal, samples shall be taken at each end of the first segment and each end of each segment that is one-half mile
distant from the segment previously sampled. A minimum of seven segments shall be sampled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.4.3 Sampling of Pipe to Be Abandoned in Place 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.4.3.1 Procedures in 761.60(b)(5)(iii)(B) shall be followed first to assure the absence of free flowing liquids.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.4.3.2 Both ends of all pipe to be abandoned in place are to be sampled, samples shall be taken at each end of each pipe.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.4.3.3 For abandonment of pipe exceeding 50 miles but less than 100 miles in length, an additional sample at the midpoint
shall be taken. Sampling the midpoint sample may be taken by removing all covering soil and cutting the pipe to gain
access to the sampling location in lieu of removing a segment of pipe. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.4.3.4 For abandonment of pipe exceeding 100 miles in length, both ends and a point every 50 miles from the downstream
(of the direction of the former gas flow) shall be sampled. Internal samples may be collected by removing any covering
soil and cutting the pipe to gain access to the sampling location in lieu of removing segments of pipe.

4.1 Sample Extraction and Chemical Analysis Procedures. Section 761.60(g) provides guidance on chemical analysis
procedures. Extraction and cleanup of the extract shall be in accordance with applicable extraction and cleanup

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5.1.1 The analytical results of both samples from each segment sampled shall be averaged to determine the level of
contamination in that segment. This average will be referred to as an averaged sample result. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5.1.2 If the averaged sample result, from any segment sampled from a removal population is greater than 10 micrograms
PCB/100 square centimeters then that segment is considered contaminated with PCBs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5.1.3 From a multiple contiguous segment removal project, all unsampled segments in the removal project are presumed

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2.0 Regardless of the amount of each type of PCB remediation waste present at a PCB remediation site, a minimum of samples
shall be taken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2.1 For each type of PCB remediation waste present at the remediation site and at each separate site within a facility,
a minimum of three samples shall be taken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2.2 For each sample, the PCB concentration shall be measured, recorded and kept on file. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2.3 This is an example of a minimum number of samples calculation at a PCB remediation waste location. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are three distinct, sites at the location: a loading dock, a transformer storage lot, and a disposal pit. The
minimum number of samples appears after each type of waste for each site. The PCB remediation wastes present at the
loading dock are concrete (3), and clay soil (3). The PCB remediation wastes present at the transformer storage lot
are oily soil (3), clay soil (3), and gravel (3). The PCB remediation wastes present at the disposal pit are sandy soil
(3), clay soil (3), oily soil (3), industrial sludge (3), sludge aqueous decantate (3) and gravel (3). For purposes
of the self-implementing cleanup and disposal of these PCB remediation wastes, the minimum total number of samples
needed to verify cleanup at this entire site as described is procedure 3.0 of this appendix.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.0 Once remediation is assumed to be complete, the following procedure shall be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.1 Sample collection locations shall be based on a hexagonal grid system similar to the one employed in the document
``Field Manual for Grid Sampling of PCB Spill Sites to Verify Cleanup'' (EPA-560/5&hyph;86&hyph;017), except that
the interval between adjacent sampling points shall be 1 meter. Copies of the grid sampling manual may be obtained
from the TSCA Hotline by calling (202) 554&hyph;1404. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.2 There is no upper limit to the number of samples required or allowed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3 In the event that a site is sufficiently small or oddly configured that a hexagonal grid with the grid interval of
one meter will not place the minimum of three sampling points in the site, then sampling coordinates shall be selected
based on the following random sampling scheme. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.1 There shall be no sample compositing for this kind of small site and oddly configured sites. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.2 Designate the length and width of the area as the two axes of a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate grid system.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.3 The grid system is to be oriented so that its origin is nearest to the lower left corner of the area to be sampled.
When this Cartesian system is oriented this way, the entire area falls into the first (upper right or positive on both
axes) quadrant of the grid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.4 Measure the length of each axis (length and width) in centimeters (or inches). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.5 Select an eligible set of two coordinates in centimeters (or inches) from a random number table or random number
generator for each of the minimum of three samples to be taken. Eligible means that the point defined by the selected
coordinates falls in the area cleaned up. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.6 A third coordinate is not necessary. Samples shall be taken on the surface of the location left after cleanup
has been completed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5.1 Flat non-porous surfaces shall be wipe sampled at the selected grid point. Individual surface samples shall be
no smaller than 100 square centimeters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5.2 Sampling of Bulk PCB Remediation Wastes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5.2.1 At each sampling grid point, core samples shall be collected from at least one and no more than four different
locations surrounding each grid point. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5.2.2 Each core sample around the grid point shall be no closer than 10 centimeters (4 inches) and no farther than forty
centimeters (16 inches) from the grid point. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5.2.2.1 If more than one core sample is taken at a grid point, all of these samples shall be composited (see procedure
6.0 of this appendix) and mixed thoroughly into a single sample representing the grid point. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5.2.2.2 Core sampling for bulk PCB remediation waste having particle size diameter of less than or equal to one centimeter.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5.2.2.2.1 Each sample shall be collected using a 2.5 centimeter (1 inch) or 2 centimeter diameter core sampler. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5.2.2.2.2 Each core sample shall be taken to a depth of 2.5 centimeters below the surface 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5.2.2.3 Core sampling for bulk PCB remediation waste having particle size diameter of greater than one centimeter.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5.2.2.3.1 Each core sample shall be taken by a core having a diameter no less than two and a half times the diameter of
the average particle in the material. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5.2.2.3.2 The depth of the core sample shall be two and a half times the estimated average diameter of the particles
in the waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5.3 Sampling of Porous Surfaces 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5.3.1 Porous surfaces such as asphalt, wood, and concrete, shall be core sampled as for bulk PCB remediation waste
having a particle size diameter of less than one centimeter (see procedure 5.2.2.2 of this appendix).

6.1 When compositing, all individual samples added to compose a composite sample shall be the same weight. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6.2 All chemical analyses for PCBs in composite samples shall be by means of a gas chromatography with electron capture
detector (GC/EC) method such as EPA SW&hyph;846 Method 8080. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6.3 Compositing bulk PCB remediation waste samples from more than one grid point. Bulk PCB remediation waste samples
from one grid may be composited so long as the PCB concentration of interest (the clean/not clean level) is divided
by the number of samples in the composite. The resulting quotient shall be called the ``composite action level.''
The composite action level eliminates the possibility that any one sample in the composite is above the PCB concentration
of interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6.3.1 If the concentration from the analysis of the composite exceeds the ``composite action level,'' then it shall
be assumed that at least one sample in the composite exceeds the PCB concentration of interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6.3.1.1 For example, for bulk PCB remediation waste samples, if the concentration of interest is 50 ppm and then ten
samples are composited and analyzed, then the ``composite action level'' is 5 ppm. If the chemical analysis results
indicates less than 5 ppm, there are no samples having a concentration greater than 50 ppm (the PCB concentration of
interest). If the chemical analysis is 5 ppm or greater then there may be at least one sample in the composite having
a concentration exceeding the concentration of interest and further sampling and or compositing is necessary to
demonstrate that no sample exceeds the concentration of interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6.3.2 If the concentration from the analysis of the composite is less than the ``composite action level,'' then it
shall be assumed that none of the individual samples in the composite exceeds the PCB concentration of interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6.4 Compositing wipe samples from non-porous samples from more than one grid point. When accounting for dilution
from compositing wipe samples, it is not necessary to use samples wiped from the same total surface area so long as the
``composite action level'' (see procedure 6.1 of this appendix) assumes the smallest surface area from any of the
wipe samples composited. This difference from bulk remediation waste sample compositing is the result of the PCB
amount reported being a weight rather than a concentration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6.4.1 For example, if the PCB concentration of interest is

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8.1 If, for the sampled type of waste at a designated site, any grid point sample PCB concentration exceeds the concentration
of interest or the PCB concentration of a composite sample exceeds the composite action level, then the type of waste
at the site has not been successfully cleaned up and, for purposes of self-implementing disposal, further cleanup
is required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8.2 In the event that further cleanup is required in paragraph 8.0 of this appendix, all of the type of waste at a particular
site at a facility (or any portion of the site) may be recleaned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8.3 Following the recleaning, the procedure to verify the completeness of the cleanup shall be reinitiated (starting
at paragraph 4.0 of this appendix) to determine whether the requirements have been met. This ``reverification''
shall include that the verification sampling grid be reoriented and all of the type of waste at a particular site at
the facility shall be resampled as required in paragraph 4.0&hyph;7.0 above. Cleaning a portion of the site and sampling
only the portion which was recleaned does not comply with these self-implementing PCB remediation waste cleanup
requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, assume that random samples were collected to verify a site remediation under 761.61(a) and one of the
samples of seven taken in a grid sampling plot had a concentration above the PCB concentration of concern. The site
represented by the seven grid samples may be recleaned only in the area surrounding that one sample. However, following
recleaning, the entire site must be resampled using a new set of seven grid samples, collected from a reoriented grid,
to verify that the cleanup resulted in no PCBs in any of the seven grid samples above the PCB concentration of concern.
This sampling procedure does not allow only resampling the areas which were recleaned. Nor does this sampling procedure
allow using the arithmetic mean or any other statistical evaluation of the results from several samples to arrive
at an overall ``average'' site concentration.

3.1 To characterize a population of non-liquid PCB non-remediation waste accumulated in a pile or piles, it is necessary
to collect seven approximately 100 milliliter (just less than 0.5 cup or approximately 100 grams) subsamples. These
seven sub-samples shall be composited into one sample in a covered wide-mouth one liter (one quart) jar. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.2 Pieces of PCB non-remediation waste larger than half of the sub-sample size (approximately 50 milliliters, 50
grams, or 0.25 cup) shall be excluded from a sub-sample.

4.1 Selection of the Piles from which Sub-Samples Will Be Collected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.1.1 If the processed PCB non-remediation waste from a single source consists of more than one pile or container,
each pile or container shall be assigned an integer number and then seven random integer numbers shall be generated
to select piles (from which sub-samples shall be collected) from the population of all piles. It is possible that this
random selection procedure will result in selecting the same pile number more than once, even if seven or more piles
are present. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.1.2 If only one pile or container is present, all seven samples shall be taken from the same pile. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.2 Collecting Sub-Samples from Flattened Piles or Containers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If possible, spread the pile(s) out to a uniform thickness of approximately 1 foot (or 30 centimeters [cm]) into a rectangular
or a circular shape. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.2.1 For a circular shape flattened pile or cylindrical container: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.2.1.1 Use the procedures in the PCB Spill Cleanup manual (a triangular/hexagonal grid system) to select the seven
surface points for each composite sample for each flattened pile or container. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.2.1.2 Measure the depth of the pile at each sampling point in inches or centimeters. Randomly select a number of inches
or centimeters down from the surface using a random number generator. Then collect a 50 gram sample at the selected
depth. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.2.1.3 Composite the seven 50 gram samples collected from the seven sampling locations into a single sample for analysis.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.2.2 For a rectangular shape flattened pile or boxshaped container there are two options a random coordinate option
(procedure 4.2.2.1 of this appendix) and a grid option (procedure 4.2.2.2 of this appendix): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.2.2.1 Designate the length, width, and depth of the flattened pile or container as three axes of a three dimensional
Cartesian coordinate grid system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.2.2.1.1 Measure the length of each axis (length, width, and depth) in centimeters (or inches). Using a random number
generator, select an eligible set of three coordinates in centimeters (or inches) for each of seven sub-samples to
be taken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.2.2.1.2 Collect each sub-sample at the location selected and composite the sub-samples into a single sample for
analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.2.2.2 Use the grid sampling procedure in the Field Manual which is part of the ``Sampling Guidance for Scrap Metal
Shredders.'' Briefly described, this procedure divides the length and width of a flattened pile into three equal
segments, intersection of the length segments with the width segments results in a 3 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
&times;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 3 grid or nine cells. The length and width shall be chosen to be perpendicular. Samples shall be collected at the center
of each cell on the surface. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3 Collecting Sub-samples from Unflattened Piles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the pile is too large to be spread on the site to a uniform thickness of 1 foot or 30 centimeters, or there are too many
piles to spread out in the working area, the following procedure can be used to sample the piles. This procedure assumes
that the shape of the piles is roughly conical; that is, having a circular base with PCB non-remediation waste stacked
up uniformly to a peak which is roughly a point centered above the center of the circular base. For each sub-sample,
three sample site coordinates will be selected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.1 Setting Up the Sample Site Selection System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.1.1 Use a rod, dowel, stake, or broom handle as a marker. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.1.1.1 Nail or otherwise fasten to the top of the marker a piece of string or cord of sufficient length and strength
to reach from the top of the marker to the farthest peripheral edge of the pile. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.1.1.2 Pound or push the marker into the top center (apex) of the pile downward toward the center of the base at least
30 centimeters or one foot until the marker is rigidly standing on its own, even when the cord is pulled tight to the bottom
of the pile. The marker shall protrude from the top of the pile sufficiently to allow easy movement around the pile with
the tightened string. A side view of a pile with a marker and string is illustrated below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.2 Select the first coordinate as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.2.1 Use a random number to generate a number between 0 and 360. The number generated is the number of degrees from
magnetic north. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.2.2 In a pile containing a lot of ferrous metal, the ferrous metal may have sufficient magnetism to deflect the
compass needle. Confirm the magnetic north direction at a location distant from a pile of metal before assuming that
the compass is not effected by local magnetism. In the event that the compass needle is deflected by the material to
be sampled, this sampling procedure shall not be used and the material to be sampled shall then be flattened. Once the
material is flattened, the sampling procedures in procedure 4.2 of this Appendix shall be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.2.3 Use a magnetic compass to determine this direction on the pile as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.2.3.1 Pull the cord to the bottom of the pile. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.2.3.2 Orient the compass so that the needle is pointing to magnetic north (At this point it may be helpful to sketch
a picture of the top view of the pile oriented to magnetic north and draw a line from the center of the pile outward in the
direction of the selected coordinate. (This drawing can be used to locate the approximate coordinate in the next step
and may be used to document the sampling location.). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.2.3.3 With the cord slightly slack, hold the cord and walk around the outside edge of the pile to be sampled until
the approximate coordinate is reached. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.2.3.4 Tighten the cord and place the compass directly under the tightened cord at the bottom edge of the pile. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.2.3.5 Move around the outside of the pile with the cord laying over the center of the compass and with the needle
pointing to magnetic north and stop when the cord lies over the selected coordinate direction on the compass. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.2.4 Mark this first coordinate by tying the cord to a peg or placing it under a heavy weight. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.2.5 An illustration of the orientation of a magnetic compass and the cord with respect to a pile appears below 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.3 Select the second coordinate as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.3.1 Once the first coordinate has been fixed, along the first coordinate (the cord), measure the distance in centimeters
(or inches) from the bottom edge of the pile to the point where the marker meets the top of the pile. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.3.2 Select a random number between 0 and the total number of centimeters (inches) measured in paragraph 4.3.3.1
of this appendix. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.3.3 Proceed up the cord, from the bottom of the pile to the top, the selected number of centimeters (inches). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.3.4 Pound or push a marker rod, dowel or broom handle down into the pile until the marker is secure to mark the second
coordinate point. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.4 Select the third (final) coordinate as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.4.1 Measure or estimate the vertical distance in centimeters (or inches) from the surface of the pile at the second
coordinate marker to the bottom of the pile or ground level. This distance will be referred to as ``vertical distance.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.4.2 Select a random number between 0 and the total number of centimeters (inches) of vertical distance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.4.3 Dig a hole straight down into the pile the selected number of centimeters (inches) from the surface of the pile.
The hole shall be of sufficient distance from the second coordinate marker so as to allow the marker to remain in place.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.4.4 Slowly dig over to expose the second coordinate marker and collect the sub-sample on any side of this marker
at the depth selected in paragraph 4.3.4.2 of this appendix. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.4.5 In the event that the measurement or estimate of the distance to the bottom of the pile or the ground level was
too large and the selected depth is below the bottom of the pile, reselect a random number as indicated in paragraph
4.3.4.2 of this appendix using the vertical distance determined by digging as indicated in paragraph 4.3.4.3 of this
appendix.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 6(e) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) bans the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce,
and the use of PCBs unless the PCBs are totally enclosed. Section 6(e) gives EPA authority, however, to allow these
activities if the Administrator finds that they will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to health and the environment.
This proposed rule addresses 19 individual petitions under TSCA section 6(e)(3)(B) for exemptions from the prohibition
against the manufacture, processing, and distribution in commerce of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). In this
proposed rule EPA proposes to deny eight petitions and to grant seven petitions; four petitions were withdrawn by
the petitioners.

 Section 6(e) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) bans the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce,
and the use of PCBs unless the PCBs are totally enclosed. Section 6(e) gives EPA authority, however, to authorize these
PCB activities if the Administrator finds that they will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the
environment. TSCA provides that EPA may set terms and conditions, including recordkeeping and reporting requirements,
for granting an exemption.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 6(e) of TSCA, 15 U.S.C. 2605(e), generally prohibits the manufacture of PCBs after January 1, 1979, the processing
and distribution in commerce of PCBs after July 1, 1979, and the use of PCBs after October 11, 1977, unless otherwise
permitted. While section 6(e)(2)(A) of TSCA bans the use of PCBs in any manner other than a totally enclosed manner,
section 6(e)(2)(B) provides that the Administrator may by rule authorize the use of PCBs if such use will not present
an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment. Section 6(e)(3)(A) of TSCA prohibits the manufacture,
processing, and distribution in commerce of PCBs except for the distribution in commerce of PCBs that were sold for
purposes other than resale before July 1, 1979. Section 6(e)(3)(B) provides that any person may petition the Administrator
for an exemption from the prohibition on the manufacture, processing, and distribution in commerce of PCBs. The Administrator
may by rule grant an exemption if the Administrator finds that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment would not result, and (ii) good faith efforts have been
made to develop a chemical substance which does not present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment
and which may be substituted for such polychlorinated biphenyl.

Section 6(e)(1) also authorizes EPA to regulate the disposal of PCBs consistent with the provisions in section 6(e)(2)
and (3). EPA has issued a regulation that authorizes the import for disposal of PCBs with concentrations below 50 ppm.
PCBs with greater concentrations, currently may only be imported for disposal pursuant to an exemption granted by
EPA based upon the criteria discussed above.

EPA's Interim Procedural Rules for manufacturing, processing, and distribution in commerce exemptions describes
the required content for the manufacturing, processing, and distribution in commerce exemption petitions and the
procedures EPA follows in rulemaking on exemption petitions. Those rules are codified at 40 CFR 750.10 through 750.41.
These rules were amended effective April 11, 1994, by notice in the

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

II. Findings Necessary to Grant Petitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Unreasonable Risk Finding
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before granting an exemption petition, section 6(e)(3)(B)(i) of TSCA requires the Administrator to find that granting
an exemption would not result in an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment in the United States. Consistent
with the principle that persons seeking an exemption from a legislative prohibition bear the burden of demonstrating
eligibility for that exemption, EPA has interpreted this provision to require a petitioner to demonstrate that the
proposed activity would not pose an unreasonable risk.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To determine whether a risk is unreasonable, EPA balances the probability that harm will occur to health or the environment
against the benefits to society from granting or denying each petition. (See generally, 15 U.S.C. 2605(c)(1).) Specifically,
EPA considers the following factors: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Effects of PCBs on human health and the environment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In deciding whether to grant an exemption, EPA considers the magnitude of exposure and the effects of PCBs on humans
and the environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Health effects.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA has determined that PCBs are toxic and persistent. PCBs can enter the body through the lungs, gastrointestinal
tract, and skin, can circulate throughout the body, and can be stored in the fatty tissue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Environmental effects.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Certain PCB congeners are among the most stable chemicals known, which decompose very slowly once they are released
in the environment. PCBs are absorbed and stored in the fatty tissue of higher organisms as they bioaccumulate up the
food chain through invertebrates, fish, and mammals. This ultimately results in human exposure through consumption
of PCB-containing food sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Risks
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Toxicity and exposure are the two basic components of risk. Based on animal data, EPA concluded that in addition to
chloracne, PCBs may cause developmental toxicity, reproductive effects, and oncogenicity in humans. EPA also concluded
that PCBs present a hazard to the environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A lengthy discussion of these factors is provided in the preamble to the August 24, 1988 proposed exemption rule (53
FR 32327). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Benefits and costs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The benefits to society of granting an exemption vary, depending on the activity for which the exemption is requested.
The reasonably ascertainable costs of denying an exemption vary, depending on the individual petition. EPA has taken
benefits and costs into consideration when evaluating each exemption petition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Good Faith Efforts Finding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 6(e)(3)(B)(ii) of TSCA also requires the Administrator to find that ``good faith efforts have been made to
develop a chemical substance which does not present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment and
which may be substituted for [PCBs].'' Based upon general legal principles allocating the burden of proof to the person
seeking to qualify for an exemption, EPA has interpreted this provision to require that a petitioner has the burden
of demonstrating that it has made the requisite good faith efforts. EPA considers several factors in determining
whether good faith efforts have been made. For each petition, EPA considers the kind of exemption the petitioner is
requesting and whether the petitioner expended time and effort to develop or search for a substitute. In each case,
the burden is on the petitioner to show specifically what they did to substitute non-PCB material for PCBs or to show
why it was not feasible to substitute non-PCBs for PCBs. To satisfy this finding for requests for an exemption to import
PCBs, a petitioner must show why such activity must occur in the United States and what steps will be taken to eliminate
the need to import PCBs in the future.

III. Explanation of Class Exemption for Research and Development 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Distinct from its authority to exempt PCBs from the ban on manufacturing, processing, and distribution in commerce,
EPA may also authorize the use of PCBs. EPA authorized, indefinitely, the use of PCBs in small quantities for research
and development in the Use Authorization Rule, 40 CFR 761.30(j), published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of July 10, 1984 (49 FR 28154). ``Small quantities for research and development'' is defined at 40 CFR 761.3 as ``any
quantity of PCBs (1) that is originally packaged in one or more hermetically sealed containers of a volume of no more
than 5.0 milliliters, and (2) that is used only for purposes of scientific experimentation or analysis, or chemical
research on, or analysis of PCBs, but not for research or analysis for the development of a PCB product.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The processing and distribution in commerce of PCBs in small quantities for use in research and development is allowed
under a class exemption in the PCB Exemptions Rule, 40 CFR 761.80(g), published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of August 8, 1986 (51 FR 28556). This rule eliminated the need for each person who wishes to process and distribute small
quantities of PCBs in commerce for research and development to file an individual exemption petition. EPA placed
the following terms and conditions on the class exemption: That all processors and distributors maintain records
of their PCB activities for a period of 5 years; and that any person or company that expects to distribute in commerce
100 grams (0.22 lb.) or more of PCBs for research and development within a 1&hyph;year period must report to EPA and
identify the sites of PCB activities and the quantities of PCBs to be distributed in commerce. The processor or distributor
could process and distribute PCBs in commerce and, provided it gives proper prior notification to EPA, increase the
amounts of PCBs that are processed and distributed in commerce, until EPA takes action to issue a final rule that changes
(e.g., terminates) the applicability of the exemption at 761.80(g) to the processor or distributor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In granting a class exemption, EPA retains the authority to terminate the class exemption, or to exclude any distributor
from the class exemption, upon determining the activities allowed in the class exemption will pose an unreasonable
risk of injury to health or the environment. Any changes in the disposition of the class exemption, or the status of
individuals within the class exemption, will be accomplished through notice and comment rulemaking and members
of the class will be allowed to continue activities until a final rule is promulgated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA received eight exemption petitions to import PCBs. Two of these petitions were withdrawn by the petitioners.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
S.D.Myers, Inc. (Myers).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA has received a total of four petitions from S.D. Myers, Inc. of Talmadge, Ohio, to import large volumes of PCB waste
from Canada for disposal. The first petition was received by EPA on May 15, 1991, the second and third were both received
on September 9, 1992, and the fourth was received on October 27, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Current petitions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Myers processes PCBs for disposal. It has received approval from EPA to: disassemble, decontaminate, and recycle
capacitors, to operate a mobile PCB disposal process, and it has received interim approval to commercially store
PCBs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petition received on May 15, 1991 (Petition 1) is to import drained PCB Transformers from Canada for purposes of
disposal at Myers' facility in Talmadge, Ohio. The petition requests a 5&hyph;year exemption, without a limit on
quantity. Petition 1 cites data that 21,000 PCB Transformers are in storage for disposal in Canada, and that an additional
10,000 PCB Transformers are still in service, but could be imported for disposal. Myers estimates that if all 31,000
transformers were imported into the United States, approximately 1.8 million pounds of PCBs in those transformers
would enter the United States. Once at Myers' facility, the transformers would be disposed of in accordance with Myers'
permit from EPA Region V. The transformers would be disassembled, metallic portions would be decontaminated and
subsequently smelted for metal recovery, and residual PCBs and porous materials would be shipped off site to a TSCA-permitted
incinerator.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Myers' second petition, received on September 9, 1992, (Petition 2) is to import intact, non-leaking PCB Capacitors
from Canada for disposal. The capacitors would be disposed of by Myers through a disassembly, decontamination, and
materials recycling process similar to its transformer process. Myers is permitted by EPA Region V to process capacitors
for disposal. Petition 2 requests a 5&hyph;year exemption, with no limit on quantity. Myers states that there are
18.6 million pounds of PCB capacitors in Canada, and estimates that 13 million pounds of PCB waste requiring incineration
would be generated by the processing of these capacitors at its facility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third petition, also received on September 9, 1992, (Petition 3) is a request to import askarel PCB liquids (500
ppm and over) from Canada to the United States for purposes of disposal. The petition cites data that 40 million pounds
of high-concentration fluid is present in Canada. Myers would transport the PCBs to a TSCA-approved incinerator
for disposal. The PCBs would not be disposed of at Myers' Talmadge, Ohio, facility, but some might be stored there before
being incinerated elsewhere. Myers is a permitted PCB transporter and has interim approval as a commercial storer
of PCBs. Petition 3 also requests a 5&hyph;year period with no limit on quantity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Myers' fourth petition, received by EPA on October 27, 1993, (Petition 4) is to import intact, non-leaking PCB-containing
fluorescent light ballasts from Canada for disposal. The ballasts would be taken to Myers' facility, where they would
be processed to recover reclaimable metals, and the contaminated materials remaining would be shipped off site to
a TSCA-approved incinerator. EPA Region V has permitted Myers' ballast disposal method. Myers is requesting an exemption
for a 5&hyph;year period, and estimates that 60 million pounds of PCB containing light ballasts are present in Canada
[Canadian Government data from 1991 actually estimates that there are 60 million units present in Canada, which have
a total weight of 220 million pounds (see ``Canadian PCB Summary: A Summary of National PCB Inventory'' January, 1991)].
Myers provides estimates that indicate about 20 percent of the ballast weight would consist of unrecoverable PCB
waste [44 million pounds] requiring incineration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In all four petitions, Myers asserts that since EPA has permitted their disposal processes based on the fact that these
processes do not pose an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, this finding should be applied to
any PCB waste imported from Canada for purposes of disposal. Petition 3, which does not involve in-house disposal
activities but only transportation and storage, cites the overall safety record and safety procedures of the company
as grounds for a no unreasonable risk finding, and specifically asserts that Myers' PCB tank truck fleet ``has not
had an accident or spill when moving PCBs.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In terms of benefits, Myers estimates in Petition 1 that by importing all of Canada's PCB transformers, it would generate
$180 million in service fees, and an additional $20 million in scrap metal sales. Petitions 2, 3 and 4 are estimated
to generate revenues of $46 million, $30 million, and $45 million, respectively. Myers estimates that Petition 3
would earn a profit of $20 million for Myers and the incinerators (the other petitions do not provide profit estimates).
In addition, Petitions 2 and 4 state that each would create an additional 20 jobs. Other benefits mentioned in the petitions
include speeding the removal of PCBs from North America and a lowering of disposal costs for companies in Canada.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the good faith efforts criteria of TSCA section 6(e)(3)(B)(ii) have been met, Myers maintains in all
four petitions that this criteria is not applicable to his petitions. Petition 1 does, however, go on to state that
Myers has investigated the possibility of destroying these wastes in Canada, but concluded that it would not be politically
or economically feasible to do so.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

b.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Proposed decision on petitions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA proposes to deny all four petitions from S.D. Myers. EPA has determined that the petitioner has failed to establish
that there is no unreasonable risk as required in TSCA section 6(e)(3)(B). The petitioner has not demonstrated how
the benefits accruing from granting these petitions would outweigh the risks inherent in the importation of PCB waste
as proposed by petitioner. In addition, EPA believes that the petitioner has failed to demonstrate that it has made
a good faith efforts to investigate and develop alternatives to import.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has already made a general determination that the import of PCBs into the United States and the distribution in
commerce of PCBs present an unreasonable risk of injury to human health and the environment [See 40 CFR 761.20 and 44
FR 31514, May 31, 1979]. EPA has also stated that ``[i]t is the clear intent of TSCA to minimize the addition of PCBs to
the environment of the United States.'' Id. Moreover, while EPA believes that there is always some risk inherent in
the import of any quantity of PCBs, the large quantities that Myers would import significantly increases the risk.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All four of Myers' petitions would involve the importation, transportation, and disposal of very large quantities
of PCB waste. Taken together, they would account for most of Canada's PCB fluids at concentrations over 500 ppm, as
well as all of its PCB Transformers, PCB Capacitors and PCB-containing fluorescent light ballasts. Myers indicates
in the four petitions that over a 5 year period it wishes to import a total of approximately 300 million pounds of PCB
waste for disposal. Based on the data supplied in the petitions and supplemental information (see note to docket ``Calculations''),
EPA calculates that the four petitions could involve the importation of up to 457 million pounds of PCB waste into the
United States, for disposal either at Myers' Talmadge, Ohio facility, or, in the case of Petition 3, at an unspecified
TSCA-approved incinerator.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to disposal, Myers would transport large quantities of PCB waste through the United States either to the Ohio
site or to an incinerator. Subsequent to Myers' disposal activity in Ohio, an additional 60 to 90 million pounds of
concentrated PCB waste (not counting any additional solvents and process waste that Myers would generate) would
have to be transported from Ohio to a TSCA-approved incinerator. Currently, the closest available incinerator is
located in Coffeyville, Kansas (Aptus, Inc.). In information supplemental to the petitions, Myers estimates that
an average truckload for such waste would weigh 40,000 pounds. Using this estimate, EPA calculates that 7,500 to 11,750
truckloads of waste would be shipped to Talmadge, and an additional 1,500 to 2,250 truckloads would be shipped from
Talmadge for incineration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Myers has failed to demonstrate that the proposed activity would not pose a risk to health and environment in the United
States. The introduction and disposal of large volumes of PCBs would pose some risk of exposure, even if the PCBs are
disposed of in an EPA-permitted facility such as Myers' Ohio facility or other TSCA-approved incinerator. In addition,
the large volumes of PCBs that would be transported to various facilities in different parts of the United States pose
a potential risk of spills or other exposure to PCBs despite the past safety record of the transporting company.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Myers also has failed to submit adequate information with respect to the benefits of the proposed activity. Myers
states that one of the benefits would be additional revenues for the company. With the exception of Petition 3, however,
Myers has provided revenue information only with respect to gross revenues. Gross revenue estimates tend to overinflate
the actual financial benefit to the petitioner. To properly evaluate the financial impacts, EPA needs additional
information regarding any costs that might offset projected gross revenues.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, Myers has failed to substantiate its claim that the United States would benefit by the removal of PCBs
that are stored in Canada and the elimination of possible risk of crossborder contamination. EPA acknowledges that
there is a possibility that some PCBs stored in Canada could pose some risk to health or environment in the United States.
Myers, however, has not presented factual information to demonstrate why PCBs stored in Canada pose such a risk or
to show the extent of the risk to health and environment in the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Canadian government regulates the storage and disposal of PCBs in that country which should provide adequate
protection against releases or spills that could threaten the United States. Moreover, Canada possesses a domestic
disposal facility, and is in the process of expanding its PCB disposal resources (Memo from Bryan to Greenwood, June
25, 1991). The government also has some mobile disposal facilities. Id. Some of these facilities may be available
to dispose of the PCBs that Myers proposes to import into the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Myers also states that lowered disposal costs for Canadian companies constitute an additional benefit of the proposed
activities. Under TSCA, however, EPA does not consider benefits that may occur accrue to foreign businesses, just
as it does not consider risks that do not threaten domestic health or the environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing to deny Myers' petitions because Myers has failed to demonstrate that the risks of the proposed activity
are reasonable when weighed against the benefits, particularly in view of the limited information available to substantiate
the alleged benefits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Myers contends that the proposed disposal activities do not pose an unreasonable risk by noting that the facilities
that would dispose of the PCBs are permitted by EPA pursuant to 40 CFR 761.60(e). Section 761.60(e) authorizes EPA
to issue a permit if the method of destroying PCBs will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment.
Under this provision, EPA weighs the risk of the disposal methodology against the benefits to the health and environment
in the United States. The fact that EPA has determined that the benefits outweigh the risks when the activity involves
the disposal of domestic PCBs that are already present in the United States, however, does not demonstrate that the
benefits outweigh the risks when the activity involves disposing of foreign PCBs that would be introduced into this
country. The introduction of additional PCBs that would otherwise not be in the United States adds an additional factor
to the risk/benefit equation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA further finds grounds to deny the petitions based on the good faith efforts criteria of TSCA section 6(e)(3)(B)(ii).
Petition 1 maintains that this criteria is ``not really applicable,'' in that Myers only wishes to import PCBs for
disposal, and not for use in commerce; however, the petition does go on to discuss other disposal options. The subsequent
three petitions simply state that the good faith efforts criteria does not apply, and provide no discussion of alternatives.
While, strictly speaking, section 6(e)(3)(B)(ii) refers to finding substitute chemicals, EPA believes that under
this section it must generally consider the issues of the availability of alternatives, and the overall necessity
for granting an exemption. The alternative to importation of Canadian PCB waste into the United States for destruction
is to destroy those wastes in Canada itself. Myers maintains in Petition 1 that it has investigated the possibility
of setting up a facility in Canada to recycle/destroy PCB Transformers, and it concluded that it would be uneconomical
and politically difficult to establish a facility in Canada. However, Myers fails to demonstrate that establishing
a facility in Canada is not feasible; rather, Myers only forwards arguments as to why doing so is less expedient and
less profitable for Myers than importing the waste to its existing facility in the United States. Myers does not provide
any evidence that it made substantial good faith efforts to pursue such an option before it petitioned the Agency for
this exemption. More importantly, Canada already possess a domestic disposal facility, and is in the process of expanding
its PCB disposal resources. There are no technological barriers to the effective destruction of PCBs in Canada that
would necessitate their shipment to the United States for safe disposal. Myers has not demonstrated the necessity
for the PCBs in question to be imported to the United States for disposal, and accordingly EPA finds that all four petitions
have failed to meet the good faith efforts criteria.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although Myers has not submitted adequate information to allow the Agency to make the requisite findings for these
four specific exemptions to import Canadian PCBs for disposal, EPA is considering whether to amend existing PCB disposal
rules to modify the general restriction on the import of PCBs with 50 ppm or greater for disposal. EPA believes that
opening the border to allow import for disposal may have far-reaching consequences and that it is preferable to raise
the issue of the transboundry movement of PCB waste generally in the proposed disposal rules rather than to examine
it in isolation in the context of individual company's petitions for exemption. In the proposed disposal rules, EPA
is requesting comment on the circumstances under which the United States border should be opened to the transboundry
shipments of PCBs for disposal. The proposal, if finalized, would retain the general prohibitions on import of PCB
wastes at concentrations of 50 ppm or greater, with certain exceptions described in more detail in the preamble to
the proposed disposal rule.

 Gene Rideout Dangerous Goods Consultants, Inc. (DGC).

 On December 27, 1993, Dangerous Goods submitted an exemption petition to import laboratory samples from Canada for

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The petitioner requests to import PCB waste samples, primarily soil samples, not to exceed 5 kilograms total weight.
DGC estimates that samples would be shipped no more than once a week. Assuming weekly shipments of 5 kilograms each,
approximately 260 kilograms of soil and other media would be imported annually. If granted an exemption, DGC expresses
an intent to renew their exemption for up to 5 years. Treatability analysis would be conducted at unidentified client
laboratories in the United States (DGC is a consulting firm and does not operate its own laboratory facilities). The
petitioner claims that PCBs in the waste samples would normally be destroyed during treatment and analysis, but if
any remained, the residuals could be returned to Canada if EPA so stipulates. According to DGC, the capability to treat/analyze
such PCB waste samples does not exist in Canada at this time, but at least one U.S. laboratory possesses such technology.
DGC believes that such capability should be developed in Canada within 4 or 5 years time. DGC does not claim any economic
losses to the United States would result from a petition denial, but it maintains that without this exemption, PCB-contaminated
soil in Canada will remain untreated until Canada develops this laboratory technology domestically.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Proposed decision on petition.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA proposes to deny this exemption petition. EPA has determined that, in general, the import (manufacture) of PCBs
into the United States and the distribution in commerce of PCBs present an unreasonable risk of injury to health and
the environment [See 40 CFR 761.20 and 44 FR 31514, May 31, 1979]. EPA has also stated that ``[i]t is the clear intent
of TSCA to minimize the addition of PCBs to the environment of the United States.'' Id. DGC has not demonstrated what
benefits would accrue to the United States through the granting of its petition, and how those benefits would outweigh
the risk inherent in importation of PCB wastes. Accordingly, EPA cannot make the finding that granting this petition
will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, EPA finds that the petitioner has failed to satisfy the good faith efforts criterion, i.e., DGC has not
demonstrated that there is no viable alternative to importing these samples into the United States. According to
the Canadian Association for Environmental Analytical Laboratories, there are laboratories within Canada capable
of conducting PCB analysis. The petition does not provide any details on the unidentified U.S. laboratory's techniques,
why the Canadian laboratories are unable to provide such analysis, or why developing such technologies would take
Canadian laboratories so long. Further, the petition fails to justify how the shipment of individual laboratory
samples to the United States will expedite the cleanup of PCB-contaminated sites in Canada: cleanup of these sites
will not occur until the Canadians develop their own domestic ability to apply such technologies

. On June 14, 1993, Jaco (formerly National Chem Lab) submitted an exemption petition to import oil samples from transformers
from Canadian utilities to test for PCBs, and to return (export) to the Canadian utilities any unused samples that
test positive for PCBs following their analysis. On May 13 1994, Jaco amended its petition and notified EPA that National

 The sample sizes would be 2.5 milliliters per sample of oil. These samples would then be analyzed for PCB content. Following
their analysis, waste oil 499 ppm or less would be recycled in a high efficiency boiler at Big Stone Utility; and waste
oil 500 ppm or greater would be sent to Aptus for incineration. Jaco estimates that based on a submittal rate of 50,000
samples per year, the total volume of PCBs to be imported would be 6 gallons. Jaco maintains that historical laboratory
data indicates that less than 5 percent of the samples are in the PCB classification (over 50 ppm). In addition, Jaco
estimates that their volume of waste oil greater than 499 ppm would only increase by 3 gallons annually.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During analysis, Jaco states that the 1 microliter injected into the Gas Chromatograph (GC) is destroyed in the destructive
detector and the residual oil from this process contains no PCBs since the extraction process removes the PCBs from
the oil. Further, the 9.4 milliliters of 2,2,4-trimethylpentane that is used in the extraction process and remaining
after the GC sample is run, is separated from the acid and reclaimed in a distillation process for reuse. This recycling
of the solvent used in the extraction eliminates the need for solvent disposal.

Jaco states that the economic consequences of denial would be greater for the Canadian utilities. In their petition,
Jaco indicates that Canadian utilities currently pay $100.00 per sample, while Jaco's cost is $15.00 per sample.
Jaco maintains that denial of their petition would limit the growth of Jaco (4 additional jobs) and the number of non-farm
jobs available in Eastern Washington State.

 EPA proposes to deny this exemption petition. EPA has determined that the petitioner has failed to establish that

benefits accruing from granting these petitions would outweigh the risks inherent in importation of PCB waste.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has determined that the import (manufacture) of PCBs into the United States and the distribution in commerce of
PCBs present an unreasonable risk of injury to health and the environment (See 40 CFR 761.20 and 44 FR 31514 and 31537,
May 31, 1979). EPA has also stated that ``[i]t is the clear intent of TSCA to minimize the addition of PCBs to the environment

the Rancho Cordova/Sacramento Office to Analytical Associates Inc. located at 4011 Power Inn Road, Suite G, Sacramento,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner states that the analytical evaluations (e.g., dielectric breakdown voltage, acid number, dissipation
factor, etc.) of these samples is in an effort to assist power utilities in understanding the inner performance of
their electrical equipment. The petitioner expects that a maximum of 3 liters of fluid (250 ml or 50 samples less than
5 milliliters), with a PCB concentration range from 0 to 100 percent, would be imported in 1 year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The petitioner states that PCB release prevention measures would be implemented for their shipments. In addition,
the petitioner would require all contracting laboratories to handle the samples in an environmentally sound manner,
throughout the process and up to final disposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner states that the no unreasonable risk criteria would be met because no handling of the PCBs would take
place outside of an experienced laboratory. Transportation of the samples would be according to International Air
Transportation Authority (IATA) guidelines. In quantifying the economic consequences if their petition were denied,
the petitioner states that there is major economic benefit to be realized, but an accurate estimate of the economic
impact cannot be given at this time. Moreover, the petitioner believes that it may be liable if this activity is not
allowed because the petitioner's operation in the Philippines would not be able to properly determine risks to personnel
safety and the environment.

 On May 6, 1992, Sigma-Aldrich submitted an exemption petition to export small quantities of PCBs for research and
development to the international monitoring community for use in the identification and quantification of environmental
contaminants. On May 24, 1994, Sigma-Aldrich submitted an amendment to its petition.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Current petition.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Sigma-Aldrich states that they obtain PCBs for environmental monitoring purposes from companies already exempted
by EPA. These PCBs are analyzed for quality control by highly trained chemists using gas chromatography and then prepared
as analytical reference standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PCB standards are prepared in concentrations not exceeding 1,000 micrograms per milliliter in organic solvent.
The standards will be packaged in volumes of 1 milliliter in flame sealed amber glass ampules. The ampules will be packaged
using die-cut cardboard inserts that hold the ampules securely in place inside a rigid cardboard box which will be
overpacked in a box that has been tested, certified and labelled according to Department of Transportation (DOT)
specifications. Sigma-Aldrich also states that all shipping will be done in observance of all domestic and foreign
transportation requirements. The processing of these standards will be performed at the Sigma-Aldrich facility
at 3500 DeKalb Street, St. Louis, Missouri. The maximum total volume of PCB solution will not exceed 5 liters and the
maximum total PCB volume contained in the solution will not exceed 5 milliliters. Sigma-Aldrich estimates that the
total amount of PCBs to be exported in 1 year will not exceed 100 grams or 0.220 pounds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to Sigma-Aldrich the analytical work will generate a wastestream that contains a maximum of 2.5 milligrams
of PCBs, while the processing wastestream will not exceed 5.0 milligrams of PCBs. Sigma-Aldrich states that these
wastestreams will be handled in accordance with 40 CFR part 761, subpart K. In its petition, Sigma-Aldrich also states
that through customer screening they will ensure proper handling of the materials by qualified personnel. Sigma-Aldrich
estimates that denial of this petition will result in a loss in revenue of $60,000 per year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a letter dated March 24, 1994, Sigma-Aldrich amended their petition to include an exemption to export small quantities
of Carbon 14-labelled PCBs for sale to foreign customers for use in the performance of metabolic and environmental
fate studies. Sigma-Aldrich synthesizes Carbon 14-labeled PCBs in small quantities for metabolism and environmental
research according to their existing exemption. Sigma-Aldrich's existing exemption for manufacturing PCBs for
these products is in the name of Pathfinder Laboratory which is now the Radiochemicals Department of Sigma Chemical
Company (part of Sigma-Aldrich Corporation).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner states that these Carbon-14 PCBs are analyzed by highly trained chemists using high pressure liquid
chromatography in a quality control laboratory. Packaging for these items consists of flame-sealed glass ampules
containing less than 0.5 milliliters of solvent. The primary container is overpacked using packing material and
a second box that is DOT specified and labeled. The petitioner also states that if the petition is granted, applicable
foreign requirements for air, land and water transportation will be followed. In addition, the wastestream that
is produced during the synthesis and analysis will be absorbed on silica gel and solidified in concrete prior to storage
in compliance with Nuclear Regulatory Commission requirements. The activity for this petition will be conducted
at 11542 Fort Mims Drive, St. Louis, Missouri.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner maintains that the total number of ampules to be distributed in a year will not exceed 500, at less than
5 milligrams of PCBs per ampule. The petitioner also states that through a customer screening procedure, the PCBs
would be handled by qualified personnel and should not present a risk of injury to health or the environment. The petitioner
estimates that denial of this petition would result in a loss of up to $100,000 per year in sales from foreign distributors.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA proposes to grant the Sigma-Aldrich an exemption for 1 year to export small quantities of PCBs for research and
development under 761.80(c). The Agency generally treats petitions for exemption to export PCBs more stringently
than petitions to distribute PCBs within the United States. This is because once the PCBs cross beyond our borders,
the United States loses its ability to monitor the handling and distribution activities, to inspect the receiving
facilities for any regulatory violations, or to protect health or the environment from releases of those PCBs that
might lead to additional PCB contamination in this country. However, EPA believes that those concerns are mitigated
in the export of PCBs in small quantities for research and development particularly given the viscosity, quantity,
marking, and packaging of the PCBs, as well as the careful handling of the PCBs by trained personnel as described in
the petition and amendment. Since there are no substitutes for PCB analytical samples, the good faith efforts finding
has been met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sigma-Aldrich would be prohibited from exporting PCBs in excess of the amounts and quantities specified in its petition
(i.e., less than 100 grams/year - Petition 1 and less than 2.5 grams/year - Amendment), and would be required to petition
EPA and obtain an exemption prior to an increase in the quantity or a change in the manner of handling PCBs under the Sigma-Aldrich
exemption. EPA would consider any such change as a new exemption petition and address the request by rulemaking. If
Sigma-Aldrich were to wish to continue its export activities beyond the 1&hyph;year timeframe under the EPA approved
exemption, a certified letter, pursuant to the amended Interim Procedural Rules, would have to be submitted to EPA
at least 6 months prior to the expiration of the exemption.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the petition, Edwin Kraemer states that he seeks to use a procedure that converts car shredder waste or fluff (less
than 50 ppm) into a product filler which will constitute a commodity in trade. The process Mr. Kraemer proposes to use
is a mechanical process which specializes in grinding to a microstructure size resulting in filler material. Mr.
Kraemer maintains that these fillers can be flame retarding, lightweight, compressible, absorbent, and have sound
proofing, thermal insulating and energy absorbing characteristics. As described in the petition, items to be manufactured
using this process include, but are not limited to: product filler, absorbent, solid bulk filler, substitute for
concrete fill, ceiling tile, adobe block, brick, concrete block, insulation panels for walls and ceilings, packaging,
furniture and mattress stuffing, gymnastics mats, safety barriers, sound insulation, replacement for asbestos,
injection moulding filler, fire retardant coating, plaster board or building panel filler.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Kraemer proposes to conduct his initial work using material from the Orange County Steel Salvage Company which
he states is considered one of the most contaminated sites in the country where 50,000 tons of contaminated material
has been stockpiled. Based on the 50,000 tons of contaminated material, Mr. Kraemer estimates that 10,000,000 lbs.
will be processed onsite at a concentration of 30 ppm PCBS, for a total of 300 lbs of PCBs. Mr. Kraemer also asserts that
the PCB contamination is not the result of shredding appliances, motors and transformers or PCB Items, but is actually
attributable to the use of plastics and finishes in products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner maintains that due to the low concentrations and the anticipated nonfriable uses, that any release
of PCBs to the environment is unlikely. In addition, the petitioner states that the predictable and anticipated level
of inadvertently generated PCBs in any end product will be kept under 25 ppm; therefore, the manufacturing or processing
for commercial purposes of products with PCB concentrations of less than 50 ppm should be excluded from the prohibitions
of TSCA section 6(e)(2) and (3). The petitioner states that he does not see a need for any special labelling, disposal
and recordkeeping requirements, since he is not producing a PCB Item, article, equipment or container.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner states that denial of this petition would eliminate a potential $18.5 million (cost for disposal)
savings for the State of California and a potential $50 million in profit. If the exemption is granted and the process
is successful, the petitioner states that it would generate employment, eliminate a hazardous waste, recycle a strategic
material, conserve landfill space and protect the environment and public safety on a long term basis.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA proposes to deny the petition submitted by Edwin C. Kraemer. Although EPA agrees that conversion of fluff into
viable products for trade might ameliorate the disposal problem in the area of PCB-contaminated fluff, EPA would
not be able to make a finding of no unreasonable risk to health and the environment in this instance due to insufficient
data to support such a finding. EPA encourages the petitioner to continue to pursue research in this area in order to
generate more data in support of this petition. The good faith efforts criterion would have been met because the use
of a substitute is not applicable in this instance in that this proposal seeks to provide an alternative to disposal
for PCB-contaminated fluff.

EPA received two petitions to manufacture PCBs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 General Electric (GE).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 On November 16, 1992, GE submitted a petition to manufacture small quantities of PCBs for use on-site in EPA- authorized
research activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Current petition.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 GE seeks to synthesize small quantities of PCBs for use on-site in EPA-authorized activities. In the petition GE states
that ongoing and future research involving the remediation of PCB-contaminated media requires ready access to a
supply of individual PCB congeners of a known quality and quantity, which is currently not readily available commercially.
This activity would be conducted at GE-Corporate Research and Development, River and Van Antwerp Roads, Niskayuna,
New York, 12309.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner states that the PCB congeners will be synthesized only as necessary for specific EPA-authorized research
experiments while the amount of PCBs to be synthesized will be determined by the project specific requirements. The
petitioner estimates that the total amount of PCBs to be synthesized will be limited to 2 kilograms per year, and the
total amount of PCBs synthesized with bench-scale laboratory procedures will be limited to a maximum theoretical
yield of 150 grams or less per experiment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner maintains that the accidental release of PCBs is prevented by the use of apparatus such as condensers,
cold traps, molecular sieves, or filters for retaining all reactants and reaction products. Also, reaction products
and waste materials will be analyzed for PCB content, handled and disposed of in accordance with applicable regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As described in the petition, PCB congeners are needed for research into developing alternative PCB remediation
methods and innovative PCB destruction methods; therefore, use of a PCB substitute would not be feasible.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Proposed decision on petition.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA proposes to grant GE an exemption for 1 year to manufacture small quantities of PCBs for use on-site in EPA-authorized
activities. Because the research is being conducted by highly trained and experienced professionals under controlled
conditions and only small quantities are involved, EPA finds that no unreasonable risk will result from granting
an exemption to GE to manufacture small quantities of PCBs for use on-site in EPA-authorized research activities.
The good faith effort criterion has been met, because for research in development of alternative PCB remediation
methods and PCB destruction methods, use of a PCB substitute may not be possible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GE would be prohibited from manufacturing PCBs in excess of the amounts and quantities specified in their exemption
petition, and would be required to petition EPA to obtain an exemption prior to an increase in the quantity or a change
in the manner of handling PCBs under the GE exemption. EPA will consider any such change as a new exemption petition
and address the request by rulemaking. If GE were to wish to continue its export activities beyond the 1&hyph;year
timeframe according to the EPA approved exemption, a certified letter, pursuant to the amended Interim Procedural
Rules, would have to be submitted at least 6 months prior to the expiration of the exemption.

Supelco Inc. (Supelco).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 On July 31, 1990, Supelco submitted a petition to manufacture PCBs in small quantities for use in research and development.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Current petition.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Supelco seeks approval to manufacture individual pure PCB isomers in quantities of 0.02 to 0.04 pounds (i.e., 10 to
20 grams) each at its Supelco Park facility in Bellefonte, PA. The petitioner estimates that a 10 to 20 gram production
lot of an individual pure PCB isomer would represent a 3 to 5 year supply. Total annual production is projected at less
than 1 pound (i.e., 454 grams). The PCBs would be diluted in the microgram range and packaged for distribution in sealed
vials for solids and amber ampules for liquids in either 5 milliliter or 1 milliliter quantities. Waste materials
from the manufacture of PCBs would be manifested off-site for incineration in accordance with TSCA regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To produce unsymmetrical PCBs, Supelco proposes to use a modified Gomberg-Bachmann reaction. An aromatic amine,
an organic nitrite, and excess substrate are heated for several hours. Distillation under vacuum removes the remaining
substrate. Column chromatography and/or high pressure liquid chromatography yields the product. Supelco asserts
the merits of the method are that most of the starting materials are readily available from commercial sources, the
synthesis is a simple one-step reaction, the final products following chromatography are sufficiently pure (>97
percent), and the yields are relatively good (30 to 35 percent).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To produce symmetrical PCBs, Supelco proposes to use replacement reaction of biphenylsulfonic acid with carbon
tetrachloride. The reactants are heated in a Parr reactor for several hours at 250
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; C and, after removal of excess solvent, the final product is obtained in high purity (>98 percent) and high yield
(>80 percent).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The synthesis of PCBs would be conducted in a controlled access laboratory that has been constructed for the preparation
of hazardous chemicals by specially trained personnel in compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's
(OSHA's) requirements at 29 CFR part 1910, subpart Z. Standards would be distributed in sealed glass ampules, no larger
than 5 milliliters, to analytical laboratories with personnel trained in the handling of hazardous materials. Processing
and distribution in commerce activities would be conducted pursuant to the class exemption at 761.80(g), and although
processing activities would be expected to reach a maximum of 150 grams, distribution activities would not be expected
to exceed 100 grams and therefore would not trigger the reporting requirement of the class exemption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Supelco maintains that since it has been selected as the private industry participant in a Cooperative Research and
Development Agreement (CRADA) to produce and distribute organic quality control samples for EPA's EMSL-Cincinnati
laboratory, the consequences of EPA's denial of its exemption would be a serious inconvenience to the EPA and an economic
loss of not less than $100,000 annually in potential sales to Supelco, Inc.

Proposed decision on petition.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA proposes to grant Supelco an exemption for 1 year to manufacture PCBs for use in small quantities for research and
development under 761.80(f) . EPA believes that, due to the careful handling of PCBs by trained personnel as demonstrated
in the petition, there would be no unreasonable risk presented by granting this exemption petition request. All manufacturing,
processing and distribution activities would be performed at the Supelco, Inc. facility at Supelco Park, Bellefonte,
PA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since no PCB substitutes exist for analytical standards, the good faith effort criterion does not apply. Granting
an exemption would benefit society by allowing important health, environmental, and analytical research to continue.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA proposes to prohibit Supelco from manufacturing PCBs in excess of the amounts and quantities specified in its
petition (i.e., not to exceed 1 pound). Further exemptions beyond the 1&hyph;year period would be subject to the amended
Interim Procedural Rules at 40 CFR part 750. Supelco would be required to petition EPA to increase the amount of PCBs
handled, and to change the type of activities, the procedures for handling the PCBs, and any other term under the Supelco
exemption. EPA would consider any such change as a new exemption petition and address the request by rulemaking. If
Supelco were to wish to continue its manufacturing activities beyond the 1&hyph;year timeframe, a letter sent by
certified mail would have to be received by EPA at least 6 months prior to the expiration of the exemption pursuant to
the amended Interim Procedural Rules.

 On October 22, 1993, Chemsyn Science Laboratories submitted an exemption petition to manufacture/import and export
PCBs in small quantities for research and development. Chemsyn is a manufacturer of chemical samples based in Lenexa,
Kansas, and associated with Wellington Laboratories in Ontario, Canada. Chemsyn distributors are located in the
United States, the Netherlands, Spain, Japan, and Italy. Chemsyn manufactures small quantity, high purity chemicals
for use by industry, universities, government agencies, etc., for basic scientific research. Chemsyn produces

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Chemsyn wishes to add PCB analytical standards to its current selection of environmental contaminant standards.
The petition estimates that not more than 50 grams of PCBs would be produced annually. Chemsyn will produce each PCB
congener in milligram quantities, and then diluted to the necessary concentration for the appropriate standard.
Chemsyn also will import some standards containing PCBs that will be made in Canada by its partner, Wellington Laboratories.
All the PCB standards will be flame sealed in 2 ml ampoules, and will contain less than 1

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g PCB per vial dissolved in 1.2 ml solvent. The PCB standards will be packaged and shipped in accordance with DOT shipping
requirements. Chemsyn literature indicates that all toxic preparations are shipped with documentation sheets
describing known hazards. Chemsyn expects production waste generation to be minimal due to the small production
rate and batch size involved. These wastes will be treated as PCB wastes. Chemsyn asserts that it has a highly trained
staff, including chemists involved in the development of PCB chemistry and standards with Midwest Research Institute.
Chemsyn estimates annual sales from PCB standards would be approximately $30,000.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Proposed decision on petition.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA proposes to grant the Chemsyn petition for manufacture, import, and export PCBs. EPA has previously established
the need for analytical standards [49 FR 28154, July 10, 1984]. Because of this need, the small quantity limitations,
and the carefully controlled conditions of PCB manufacture, EPA finds that no unreasonable risk would result from
granting an exemption to Chemsyn to manufacture PCBs in small quantities for research or development. This finding
also applies to the import of samples from Chemsyn's Canadian partner, Wellington Laboratories, provided that the
imported samples are prepared, packaged, and labeled in the same manner as domestically produced samples. Because
the manufacture of these analytical standards is being conducted by highly trained and experienced professionals
under controlled conditions and only small quantities are involved, EPA finds that no unreasonable risk would result
from granting this exemption. As such, EPA does not believe that the importation of these standards, when compared
with their domestic manufacture, would pose any added risk to health or the environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency generally treats petitions for exemption to export PCBs more stringently than petitions to distribute
PCBs within the United States. This is because once the PCBs cross beyond our borders, the United States loses its ability
to monitor the handling and distribution activities, to inspect the receiving facilities for any regulatory violations,
or to protect health or the environment from releases of those PCBs that might lead to additional PCB contamination
in this country. However, EPA believes that those concerns are mitigated in the export of PCBs in small quantities
for research and development particularly given the quantity, marking, and packaging of the PCBs, as well as the careful
handling of the PCBs by trained laboratory personnel. This finding would be consistent with previous determinations
regarding the export of PCB analytical samples for research and development [49 FR 28154].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has determined that the good faith efforts finding would be met for petitions to manufacture, import, distribute
or export PCBs in small quantities on projects consistent with the overall purposes of section 6(e) of TSCA, such as
using PCBs as standards for the purpose of measuring PCB concentrations or using PCBs in the study of health and environmental
effects of PCBs, because, in these cases, there are no PCB substitutes. There will always be a need for pure analytical
standards to be developed to support laboratory analysis for PCBs. Also, pure PCBs are needed in critical health and
environmental research because commercial PCBs contain mixtures of isomers and contaminants which may adversely
affect experimental research.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chemsyn would be prohibited from exporting PCBs in excess of the amounts and quantities specified in its petition
(i.e., less than 50 grams/year), and would be required to petition EPA and obtain an exemption prior to an increase
in the quantity or a change in the manner of handling PCBs under the Chemsyn exemption. EPA would consider any such change
as a new exemption petition and address the request by rulemaking. If Chemsyn were to wish to continue its export activities
beyond the 1&hyph;year timeframe under the EPA approved exemption, a certified letter, pursuant to the amended Interim
Procedural Rules, must be submitted to EPA at least 6 months prior to the expiration of the exemption.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (55 FR 21023). This exemption allowed EASA members, for a period of 1 year, to process and distribute in commerce for
reuse non-porous component parts from PCB-Contaminated Transformers that have been double washed and rinsed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Background.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA determined in granting the original exemption that, due to the non-porous nature of these component parts and,
also, because of the relatively small amounts of PCBs involved, the activity of reusing component parts presents
no unreasonable risk to health and the environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the benefits to society of granting this exemption, EASA maintained that, without access to their stockpiles
of component parts, both economic loss to the member companies and detriment to the society would be incurred. EASA
asserted that its members may be put out of business if reuse of these components were prohibited, due to their inability
to repair transformers during the activities of buying and selling used transformers and servicing customers' transformers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although EPA made no judgement regarding this claim, EPA acknowledged that without stocks of component parts, many
transformers could not be repaired promptly and equipment users could experience interruptions of electrical services
and could be forced to prematurely dispose of reusable units.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To support its claim of good faith efforts to reduce inventories of PCB-contaminated components, EASA submitted
evidence of their efforts to develop a double-rinse method to remove PCBs from the non-porous component parts that
would be reused on the PCB-Contaminated Transformers. This double-rinse procedure employs a protocol similar to
that in EPA's Spill Cleanup Policy (40 CFR part 761, subpart G). EASA maintained that the introduction of double-rinsed,
non-porous component parts back onto the PCB-Contaminated Transformers would not change the original parts per
million PCB content of the transformer into which the component part is incorporated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA concluded that the processing and distribution in commerce of the PCB residues on non-porous, double-rinsed
transformer component parts as well as the buying and selling of PCB or PCB-Contaminated Transformers that have been
serviced with double-rinsed, non-porous parts, meets both the no unreasonable risk and good faith effort criteria.
EPA granted this class exemption for 1 year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA decided that in future requests for renewal of their (EASA) exemption, that EPA would consider the petitioner's
evidence of no unreasonable risk and good faith efforts by evaluating whether stockpiles of component parts have
been effectively decontaminated and also whether inventories of PCB and PCB-Contaminated Transformers in EASA's
contained storage areas have been reduced.

. In this petition EASA seeks to renew their exemption to process and distribute in commerce for reuse non-porous component
parts from PCB-Contaminated Transformers that have been double washed/rinsed as granted in the May 22, 1990 FR 21023.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EASA has submitted two additional reports from T R Service Company to support that the double wash/rinse method is
effective to decontaminate non-porous components. As described in the renewal petition, one report showed that
20 samples were taken from 10 transformers and all showed PCB concentrations of less than 10 micrograms per 100 square
centimeters.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On June 12, 1990 the petitioner stated that it surveyed its members and of those that responded, only 20 percent were
still handling mineral oil transformers 50 ppm or greater. In the petitioner's opinion the number of members with
inventories of 50 ppm to less than 500 ppm has decreased significantly.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to terms of this Executive Order, it has been determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review.

B. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (the Act), 5 U.S.C. 603, EPA must perform a regulatory flexibility analysis
for all rules that are likely to have a ``significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' Pursuant
to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, which provides that section 603 of the Act ``shall not apply to
any proposed or final rule if the Agency certifies that the rule will not, if promulgated, have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities'', EPA certifies that this rule will not have a significant impact
on a substantial number of small entities. In addition, EPA is sending a copy of this rule to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy
of the Small Business Administration. Section 6(e)(3)(A) and (B) of TSCA and EPA's PCB Ban Rule, 40 CFR part 761, prohibits
the manufacture, processing, and distribution in commerce of PCBs. This rule, under section 6(e)(3)(B) of TSCA,
would exempt persons from these prohibitions where petitioners have demonstrated that granting an exemption would
not result in an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment and that they have made good faith efforts
to develop substitutes for PCBs. Both small and large businesses must meet the same statutory standard. Thus, even
if EPA believed that it was an economically desirable policy to grant an exemption petition for a small business, it
could do so only if the small business met the requirements set forth in TSCA. This rule would not add to the burden placed
on small businesses, it would only remove the prohibition placed on such businesses through granting an exemption.
In essence, any impact from granting or denying a petition would only affect the petitioner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Owners of individual small businesses who elect to petition the Administrator to engage in activities otherwise
banned by the statute have already considered the economic consequences of conducting these activities, and nonetheless
have opted to pursue an authorization for these activities. Finally, because this rule basically would benefit some
small entities, without imposing direct economic costs on others, EPA believes that it is appropriate to certify
that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA proposes to strengthen the rules protecting information from release to unauthorized persons. The current
rules fail to: Require individuals to protect security sensitive information that is in their control; and specify
all sensitive security information that should be protected from public disclosure. This proposed rule would specify
all sensitive security information that must be protected and would require air carriers, airport operators, indirect
air carriers, foreign air carriers, and individuals to be responsible for protecting it from disclosure to unauthorized
persons.

The Security Regulatory Scheme
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Sections 315 and 316 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended (FAAct) (49 U.S.C. app. 1356, 1357), require the
FAA to prescribe rules, as needed, to protect persons and property aboard aircraft against acts of criminal violence
and aircraft piracy, and to prescribe rules for screening passengers for weapons. To carry out the provisions of the
FAAct, the FAA has adopted rules requiring airport operators, air carriers, indirect air carriers, and foreign air
carriers to carry out various duties for civil aviation security. Part 107 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR)
(14 CFR part 107) applies to certain airport operators; part 108 (14 CFR part 108) governs certain air carriers. Part
109 (14 CFR part 109) applies to indirect air carriers, such as freight forwarders, who engage indirectly in air transportation
of property. Part 129 (14 CFR part 129) applies to the operation of foreign air carriers within the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Parts 107, 108, 109, and 129 contain general requirements for promoting civil aviation security. Each airport operator,
air carrier, indirect air carrier, and foreign air carrier covered by these parts also has a security program that
is approved or accepted by the Administrator, containing information that specifies how airport operators and air
carriers perform their regulatory and statutory responsibilities. The security programs are available only to
persons with the need to know, as described more fully below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each air carrier's security program is a comprehensive document that details the full range of security procedures
and countermeasures that air carriers are required to perform under &sect;108.5 of the FAR. This program includes
procedures for: (1) screening of passengers, carry-on baggage, checked baggage, and cargo; (2) using screening
devices (such as X-ray systems and metal detectors); (3) controlling access to aircraft and air carrier facilities;
(4) reporting and responding to bomb threats, hijackings, and weapons discovered during screening; (5) reporting
and protecting bomb threat information; (6) identifying special procedures required at airports with special security
needs; and (7) training and testing standards for crewmembers and security personnel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The airport security program is a comprehensive document that details the full range of security procedures and countermeasures
that airport operators are required to perform under &sect;107.3. Most programs include the: (1) Description of
the air operations area (AOA), each area on or adjacent to the airport that affects the security of the AOA, and air carrier
exclusive areas; (2) procedures to control access to the AOA; (3) alternate security procedures for use in emergency
and other unusual conditions; and (4) law enforcement support training and record maintenance programs in furtherance
of part 107. Programs for some airports include a description of the law enforcement support training program and
the system for maintaining records.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The indirect air carrier security program covers security procedures for cargo that is accepted for transport on
air carrier aircraft. In general, it requires indirect air carriers to carry out security procedures for handling
cargo that will be carried on air carrier aircraft.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Foreign air carrier's security programs provide security procedures for foreign air carriers while operating to
and from the United States, which is a counterpart to the procedures required under part 108.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Security programs of individual companies largely are based on standard security programs and amendments developed
by the FAA and industry. As new threats are identified, and as improved countermeasures are developed, the FAA develops
standard means to respond to the threats and improve security.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other sources of information and countermeasures are in Security Directives and Information Circulars, described
in &sect;108.18. They address threats to civil aviation security and countermeasures to respond to those threats.
In addition, there is information concerning various security devices, such as metal detectors and X-ray machines,
that is sensitive.

The Need to Protect Security Information
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FAA has, over the years, adopted security procedures to respond to the growing threat to civil aviation. The trend
has been towards a more sophisticated and dangerous threat.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Until 1984, hijackings of U.S. air carriers primarily were conducted by single individuals who were asylum seekers,
expatriates desiring to return to Cuba, mentally disturbed persons, or single individuals who were carrying out
their criminal acts for personal motives. Beginning in 1985, however, there were a series of sophisticated hijackings
and attempted hijackings of airliners of U.S. registry. These hijackings were conducted by relatively well-organized
teams of trained individuals with political motives primarily connected to international affairs in the Middle
East. The June 1985 hijacking of TWA 847 and intelligence reporting in subsequent years clearly indicated that U.S.
air carriers were facing a higher level and type of threat. Similar incidents that occurred over the next few years
routinely involved murder and extended hostage takings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The change in the hijacking threat faced by U.S. air carriers was accompanied by increasingly sophisticated and deadly
sabotage attacks against civil aviation. These attacks also were perpetrated by well-organized international
terrorist groups with, in some cases, nation states also involved as supporters and facilitators, if not direct participants.
These groups and countries repeatedly attempted to collect information concerning extant security countermeasures
and to devise methods of attack to bypass or defeat those countermeasures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the 1985 terrorist attacks on the airport terminals in Rome and Vienna and the December 1988 explosion and crash
of Pan American World Airways [Pan Am] Flight 103 in Lockerbie, Scotland, the FAA, along with the world civil aviation
community, recognized that an entirely new phase of terrorism had opened. In response, the FAA issued new, detailed,
amendments to the air carrier standard security program to counter the threat to U.S. carriers at foreign airports.
The FAA also developed new procedures to decrease the vulnerability of airports to terrorist attacks. These procedures,
both foreign and domestic, went into both the air carrier and airport security programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the increasing sophistication of those who may pose a threat to civil aviation, it is increasingly important
that information regarding the manner in which the FAA, the airport operators, and the air carriers may seek to guard
against criminal threats be protected. The unauthorized disclosure of sensitive aviation security information
could assist in the development of techniques to counter those measures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA is mindful of the public's legitimate interest in how the FAA operates and how it regulates the aviation industry.
The FAA has a corresponding responsibility to prevent undue disclosure of information that could compromise public
safety if it falls into the wrong hands. The proposals in this notice have been carefully considered to cover only information
that could reasonably be anticipated to be damaging to the security of the traveling public if given to unauthorized
persons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Security programs are absolutely essential mechanisms through which the FAA regulates the air carriers' and airports'
detailed obligations with respect to ensuring civil aviation security. Much of the effectiveness of the programs
depends on strictly limiting access to such information to those persons who have a need to know. Unauthorized disclosure
of the specific provisions of the air carrier and airport security programs or other aviation security information
would allow potential attackers of civil aviation to devise methods to circumvent or otherwise defeat the security
provisions. It would also discount the deterrent effect inherently provided in prohibiting disclosure of security
measures that may or may not be in place.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
There are sophisticated criminal elements who actively seek information on what seemingly are minor security points,
with a view to accumulating a larger picture of the entire security program. Therefore, it is imperative that the entire
security program be protected. Similarly, it is critical to protect the information contained in Security Directives
and Information Circulars. These documents contain detailed information on threats that the FAA has identified,
and the measures to counter those threats. The unauthorized release of that information could compromise those countermeasures.
In addition, particular information regarding FAA approved security devices, such as metal detectors, should also
be protected to the extent possible.

Current Protection of Security Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Currently, the FAA, airport operators, air carriers, indirect air carriers, and foreign air carriers are required
to restrict the availability of information contained in security programs to those with a need to know, and to refer
requests for such information to the FAA. These requirements are in &sect;&sect;107.3(e), 108.7(c) (4) and (5),
109.3(c), and foreign air carrier security programs. In addition, &sect;108.18(c)(1) specifically requires air
carriers to restrict the availability of Security Directives and Information Circulars, and the information contained
therein, to persons with a need to know. However, individuals who work for or perform activities in support of the air
carriers are not required to protect the information, except for Security Directives and Information Circulars.
Part 191 allows the FAA to withhold certain requested information, such as a request under the Freedom of Information
Act (FOIA) (5 U.S.C. 552) or in litigation. Part 191 currently applies only to the FAA. Section 191.3 identifies specific
information, such as security programs and hijacker profiles, that the FAA withholds. Section 191.5 provides generally
that the FAA prohibits disclosure of information when release would constitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy,
reveal trade secrets or privileged or confidential information, or be detrimental to the safety of persons traveling
in air transportation or in intrastate air transportation. However, it does not cover all of the potential sources
of sensitive security information that should be covered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Civil aviation security information protected under the Federal Aviation Regulations is different from National
Security Information governed by Executive Order 12356 and related orders, statutes, and rules. The Executive Order
provides for classifying information as Top Secret, Secret, and Confidential, and covers a wide range of information
affecting the national security. All persons with access to such information must have an appropriate security clearance,
and there may be a criminal penalty for misuse of the information. While there is some ``classified'' civil aviation
security information, these proposed rules are not directed to the handling of all classified information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA proposes to improve the protection of sensitive security information by amending parts 107, 108, 129 and 191
as described more fully below.

The FAA currently is reformulating the authority citations of all parts in accordance with the recodification enacted
in Public Law 103&hyph;272 on July 5, 1994. This process is not complete. Accordingly, the authority citations in
this proposed rule are those in the current rules.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Part 191 sets forth the rules that allow the FAA to withhold information from public disclosure. The FAA proposes to
amend and reorganize part 191 as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
&sect;191.1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The FAA proposes to expand part 191 to apply not only to the FAA, but also to air carriers, airport operators, indirect
air carriers, foreign air carriers, and individuals. As discussed below, parts 107, 108, 109, and 129 still would
contain some requirements regarding the protection of information, but part 191 would be the primary rule for withholding
information from unauthorized public disclosure.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 191.1(a) would be amended to conform to the current statute. In 1976, the FAA promulgated part 191 to implement
the Air Transportation Act of 1974, Pub. L. 93&hyph;366. Section 316(d)(2) of the FAAct provides, in part, that the
Administrator shall prescribe regulations to ``prohibit disclosure of any information obtained or developed in
the conduct of research and development activities'' if the disclosure meets certain conditions. This section is
a major basis for the current rules in part 191 on withholding information from unauthorized disclosure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1990, section 316(d)(2) was amended to provide that the Administrator shall adopt rules to prohibit disclosure
of ``any information obtained in the conduct of security 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
or 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
research and development activities *&blank;*&blank;*.'' Section 9121 of the Aviation Safety and Capacity Expansion
Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;508) (emphasis added). The FAA proposes to amend &sect;191.1(a), to protect information
obtained during the course of specified security activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA also proposes to remove from the title of part 191 reference to the 1974 Act, to avoid any implication that it
is the only source of statutory authority for the part.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 191.1(b) now defines ``record,'' in part, as ``documentary'' material. The FAA proposes to delete the word
``documentary.'' The FAA intends to address all methods of preserving information, including computer records.
This would avoid any misunderstanding over whether such records were ``documentary.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part 191 now refers to the ``Director of Civil Aviation Security'' as the official who makes the determination on behalf
of the Administrator to withhold information. Following a reorganization, the FAA official who makes such determinations
now is the Assistant Administrator for Civil Aviation Security. The FAA proposes to amend part 191 accordingly. In
addition, the Deputy Assistant Administrator for Civil Aviation Security, and any individual formally designated
to act in the capacity of the Assistant Administrator or the Deputy, would have authority to make such determinations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also propose to state in more detail the extent to which the Assistant Administrator may further delegate the authority
to make these decisions. For decisions involving information and records described in &sect;191.7(a) through (i),
we propose to permit delegation below the Assistant Administrator level. The information that is described in (a)
through (i) is well-defined, and decisions on release or withholding of the information involves relatively objective
judgments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 191.7(j) provides a ``catch all'' basis for determining that other information is sensitive security information.
A decision to release or withhold information under &sect;191.7(j) requires a careful evaluation of, on the one hand,
the need to provide the highest level of security to the traveling public by preventing sensitive security information
from falling into the wrong hands, and on the other hand, an awareness of the public's strong interest in obtaining
information about security in air transportation. These decisions require a careful evaluation of security threats
as well as important policies of the agency. Therefore, the FAA proposes that such decisions be made by high policy-level
officials, and not below the Assistant Administrator and Deputy Assistant Administrator level. The Assistant Administrator
is responsible for carrying out the agency's civil aviation security program, and reports directly to the Administrator.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
&sect;191.3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Section 191.3 would continue to state generally that the FAA withholds certain information, but would be clarified
to state that part 191 applies, notwithstanding FOIA and other disclosure statutes. For instance, the FAA may adopt
certain security rules affecting air carriers and airports without disclosing the rules to unauthorized persons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA proposes to move the provisions currently in &sect;191.5 that describe the circumstances under which the
FAA prohibits disclosure of information to &sect;191.3(b).

airport operators, indirect air carriers, and foreign air carriers, and individuals employed by, or contracted
by, air carriers, airport operators, indirect air carriers, and foreign air carriers. This section is intended to
be very inclusive.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A difficult aspect of protecting sensitive security information is that a large number of persons must be aware of
at least portions of the information in order to carry out their duties. These include pilots, flight attendants,
ticket agents, screeners, baggage handlers, and law enforcement officers. Frequently, some of these people are
not direct employees of the air carrier or airport operator, but they do carry out duties for or on behalf of the air carrier
or airport operator. For instance, in many cases, screeners and law enforcement officers are not directly employed
by air carriers or airport operators, but do have important security responsibilities to carry out. This section
is intended to cover all such persons who have access to sensitive security information. It should be emphasized,
however, that airports and air carriers would continue to have the responsibility they now have to protect sensitive
security information. If sensitive security information is released to unauthorized persons, depending upon the
circumstances, the FAA may hold the airport or air carrier, as well as the individual, accountable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 191.5(a) would state the general requirement that disclosure of and access to sensitive security information
shall be restricted to persons with a ``need to know.'' Section 191.5(b) would define ``need to know'' as the requirement
to have knowledge of or access to the information to carry out FAA-approved or directed aviation security duties.
Of course, in the case of foreign air carriers that are owned or operated, or closely regulated, by the foreign government,
various officials in that government have a ``need to know.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In most cases, the air carrier or airport operator has the discretion to decide who in its organization has a need to
know sensitive security information. There are times, however, when information is so sensitive that extra measures
should be taken to protect it from release to those without a ``need to know.'' The rule would, therefore, provide that
for some specific information the Assistant Administrator may make a finding that only specific persons, or classes
of persons, have an operational need to know.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 191.5(c) would require that, if sensitive security information is released to unauthorized persons, the
FAA must be notified. This will permit the FAA to evaluate the risk presented by the release of the information, and
to take whatever action may be needed to mitigate that risk.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 191.5(d) alerts persons that violations may result in a civil penalty or other action by the FAA. Under the
FAAct, the FAA may take a broad range of enforcement action for violation of the regulations. The FAA anticipates that
civil penalty action will be considered for a violation of part 191, as it is for violations of parts 107 and 108. However,
the FAA may seek any enforcement action deemed appropriate based on individual circumstances of the case. Further,
the FAA may take action to mitigate or correct the risk posed by the violation. Such actions may include requiring air
carriers or airport operators to change their procedures for protecting security information, or change the security
procedures in place that may have been compromised by unauthorized release of the information.

&sect;191.7.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Proposed 191.7 would incorporate and expand current &sect;191.3, which describes information that is protected
from public disclosure. There is information not specifically mentioned in &sect;191.3 that should be protected.
The FAA now withholds such information from public disclosure based on findings under &sect;191.5 that disclosure
would be detrimental to the safety of persons traveling in air transportation or intrastate air transportation.
Those findings are set forth in written denials of FOIA requests for such information, and in Declarations submitted
to judges to seek protection of information in litigation cases. To better inform the public of the information prohibited
from unauthorized release, the FAA proposes to add this information to &sect;191.7, as described below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 191.7(a) would retain the current requirements to protect any approved or standard security program for
an air carrier, indirect air carrier, airport operator, or foreign air carrier, and that portion of the security program
of the United States Postal Service that relates to security of parcel mail to be transported by air. The FAA proposes
to expand this provision to include any comments, instructions, or implementing guidance pertaining to these security
programs. Generally, these materials reveal some or all of the sensitive information and must be protected the same
as the security programs themselves.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b) would be revised to include any comments, instructions, or implementing guidance pertaining to Security
Directives and Information Circulars.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c) would list any profile used in any security screening process, including persons, baggage, or cargo.
Section 191.3(b) (1) and (2) currently cover any hijacker profile and profile used in baggage screening. This proposal
makes that provision general to cover profiles for screening persons, because there are systems in place to protect
against terrorists and others who might seek to commit criminal violence, not just hijackers. It would also cover
profiles for cargo. Like baggage, cargo is a potential tool for criminal violence that the security rules cover.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d) would include any security contingency plan and comments, instructions, or implementing guidance
pertaining thereto. These plans, when adopted, become part of the security program and are already covered by rules
governing security programs. They are included in &sect;191.7 for emphasis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA proposes to delete the provisions currently in &sect;191.3(b)(6), pertaining to the technical specifications
for devices for protection against, or detection of, cargo theft, from the rule. Such devices are not directly used
to meet the requirements for civil aviation security under the FAA regulations. Any devices that serve a dual function
of protecting cargo and security are protected under other provisions in this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (e) would cover the technical specifications of any device used for the detection of any explosive, incendiary,
or deadly or dangerous weapon. It is essentially the same as current &sect;191.3(b)(5), except that the current rule
is worded ``explosive or incendiary device or weapon.'' The proposed rule would use the same wording that is in &sect;108.9(a),
which contains the requirements for air carriers to screen passengers and property for such items.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (f) would address the specifications for objects used to test screening equipment, and equipment parameters,
and paragraph (g) would address any security communications equipment and procedures. Knowledge of the devices
used to perform various security functions could lead to a plan to defeat those devices. Accordingly, details of such
devices should be protected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (h) would address any information pertaining to: (1) Threats of any criminal acts directed against air
transportation; and (2) the details of an alleged violation of parts 107, 108, 109, or 129, and any information that
could reasonably lead to the disclosure of such details, i.e., the airport name, the location of the gate or access
point; the air carrier, indirect air carrier, or foreign air carrier. Paragraph (h) would apply only to the release
of information by the FAA. There is less risk of harm from the casual disclosure of this information by individuals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (i) would include any draft, proposed, or recommended change to sensitive security information or records.
The FAA frequently issues proposed revisions for sensitive security documents to air carriers and airport operators
and requests comments on the proposals. These proposals contain sensitive security information that also should
be protected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (j) would include any other information that the Administrator determines should not be disclosed under
the criteria in &sect;191.3(b). While we have attempted to anticipate all sources of information that should be protected
from unauthorized disclosure, additional information may be discovered in the future. As with the current rule,
this paragraph would allow the Administrator to determine whether other information should be considered to be sensitive
security information.

The FAA proposes to make changes to the specific parts that apply to airport operators, air carriers, indirect air
carriers, and foreign air carriers, to correspond to the proposed changes to part 191. Parts 107, 108, 109, and 129
require these organizations to protect security information as required in part 191, and would require them to direct
requests for such information to the administrator. These parts would be redundant with the proposed changes to part
191. These organizations currently refer to their specific parts of the FAR for security requirements. Including
a cross-reference to part 191 in parts 107, 108, 109, and 129, alerts organization to the new requirements, and makes
it clear that part 191 is part of their security duties.

Economic Evaluation

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section summarizes the regulatory evaluation prepared by the FAA. The regulatory evaluation provides more
detailed discussion of the potential economic consequences of this proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Executive Order 12866, dated September 30, 1993, directs Federal agencies to promulgate new regulations or modify
existing regulations only if benefits to society for each regulatory change outweigh potential costs. The order
also requires the preparation of an economic analysis of all ``significant regulatory actions'' except those responding
to emergency situations or other narrowly-defined exigencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this proposed rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' as defined by Executive
Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review). A synopsis of the costs and benefits associated with this rule are summarized
below. (A more detailed discussion is contained in the full regulatory evaluation placed in the docket for this proposed
rule.)

Costs and Benefits
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule would help protect persons and property at airports and aboard aircraft against terrorist and
other criminal acts by strengthening the rules protecting sensitive security information from being released to
unauthorized persons. It would require the affected entities to be responsible for safeguarding this security information
from unauthorized disclosure. The accidental divulgence of such material could lead, directly or indirectly, to
injuries, the loss of life, and/or the loss of an aircraft.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These rules could be implemented at no cost. Given the lack of cost and given the potential benefits of avoided fatalities
and injuries, the FAA finds this proposed rule to be cost beneficial.

In accordance with the Office of Management and Budget memorandum dated March 1983, federal agencies engaged in rulemaking
activities are required to assess the effects of regulatory changes on international trade. The FAA finds that this
proposed rule would not have an adverse impact on trade opportunities for either U.S. firms doing business overseas
or foreign firms doing business in the United States. The proposed rule would impose no costs on both domestic and foreign
air carriers, so neither would have a trade advantage over the other.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily
burdened by government regulations. The RFA requires agencies to review rules that may have a ``significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' There is no cost associated with this proposed rule; therefore,
this proposal does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

This proposal will not have a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship between the national government

implications to warrant preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

For the reasons discussed above, and based on the findings in the initial Regulatory Flexibility Determination and

economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory
Flexibility Act. This proposal is not considered a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866
and is not considered significant under Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR
11034; February 26, 1979).

of such information would:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

medical, or similar file);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
