SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On March 30, 1994 (59 FR 14739), the Board published a revision to its organization and functions statement to reflect
the realignment of its regional offices. Since that time, the Board completed its review of the organization and functions
of its headquarters offices and effected a reorganization of those offices in accordance with the recommendations
of the National Performance Review (NPR) and the President's Memorandum of September 11, 1993, titled ``Streamlining
the Bureaucracy.'' The reorganization eliminates excessive layers of management review and control, consolidates
functions, and improves the ratio of supervisors and managers to other employees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following organizational changes have been made in the Board's headquarters offices: (1) The office of the Executive
Director has been abolished; (2) the offices of Inspector General and Management Analysis have been abolished and
their functions distributed to other offices; (3) the offices of Administrative Law Judge and Regional Operations
have been combined; and (4) the office of Administration has been assigned additional functions and retitled the
office of Planning and Resource Management Services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board is amending the titles of &sect;&sect;1200.1, 1200.2, and 1200.10 of this part to conform them to the format
of the new &sect;1200.3 of this part added effective August 5, 1994 (59 FR 39937) and the other parts of the Board's regulations
(5 CFR parts 1201 through 1210). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board is publishing this rule as a final rule pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &sect;1204(h).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Merit Systems Protection Board is amending its rules at 5 CFR part 1201 to add a new appealable action and to correct
the citations for two others in &sect;1201.3(a); to delete &sect;1201.3(d); to clarify the place of filing requirements
in &sect;&sect;1201.4(d), 1201.22(a), and 1201.182 following the realignment of the Board's regional and field
offices; to correct a cross-reference in &sect;1201.37(a); to conform the method of filing requirements for original
jurisdiction cases in &sect;1201.122(c) to those for appellate jurisdiction cases; to replace the July 1991 edition
of the MSPB Appeal Form in Appendix I with the revised October 1994 edition; to add information regarding the TDD (Telecommunications
Device for the Deaf) capability of facsimile numbers in the regional and field offices, add the suite number of the
Atlanta Regional Office, and change the address and facsimile number of the Denver Field Office in Appendix II; and
to add and delete approved hearing locations in Appendix III.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Section 1201.3(a)(6) is amended by adding 5 CFR part 844 to the citation so that the citation refers to the part of
the regulations of the Office of Personnel Management governing disability retirement determinations under the
Federal Employees' Retirement System, as well as to 5 CFR parts 831 and 842.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Section 1201.3(a)(7) is amended by correcting the citation to read ``5 CFR 731.103(d) and 731.508.'' The corrected
citation refers to the regulations of the Office of Personnel Management providing for appeals to the Board of suitability
determinations made by an agency acting under authority delegated by OPM (5 CFR 731.103(d)) and such determinations
made by OPM (5 CFR 731.508).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Section 1201.3(a) is amended by adding a new subparagraph (21) to include as an action appealable to the Board a
reduction-in-force action affecting a career or career candidate appointee in the Foreign Service. Public Law 103&hyph;326,
effective April 30, 1994, amended the Foreign Service Act of 1980 (22 U.S.C. 4001 et seq.) by, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 providing authority to the Secretary of State to conduct reductions in force affecting career or career candidate
appointees in the Foreign Service and by granting those appointees the right to appeal such reduction-in-force actions
to the Board.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Section 1201.3 is amended by deleting paragraph (d). This paragraph was added to the Board's rules in this part
to implement 5 U.S.C. 1221(j), as added by the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;12). Subsequently,
the Board ruled in

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 57 M.S.P.R. 288 (1993) that 5 U.S.C. 1221(j) and the Board's regulation at 5 CFR 1201.3(d) should be construed to apply
only to individual right of action appeals and other actions established by 5 U.S.C. chapter 12. Because the provisions
of part 1201 are applicable to appeals that arise from actions other than those established by 5 U.S.C. chapter 12,
the Board has determined that the continued inclusion of &sect;1201.3(d) in this part is likely to prove confusing
to parties and that it should, therefore, be deleted.

(e) Section 1201.4(d) is amended to clarify the definition of ``appropriate'' office for purposes of filings with
the Board. On March 30, 1994 (59 FR 14739), the Board published a revision to its rules in appendix II and appendix III
of this part to reflect the realignment of its regional office structure into six regional and five field offices.
In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 explaining that revision, the Board stated in part: ``Appeals and related matters will continue to be filed with either
the regional or field office having geographic jurisdiction.'' The Board is now amending &sect;1201.4(d) to specifically
include field offices, as well as regional offices, in the definition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Section 1201.22(a) is amended to clarify that appeals and responses to appeals are to be filed with the appropriate
Board regional or field office. See explanation in paragraph (e) above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Section 1201.37(a) is amended by deleting the reference to ``&sect;1201.116'' and replacing it with ``&sect;1201.117.''
On June 16, 1994 (59 FR 30863), the Board published an amendment to its rules in this part that revised &sect;1201.115,
redesignated &sect;&sect;1201.116 through 1201.119 as &sect;&sect;1201.117 through 1201.120, respectively,
and added a new &sect;1201.116. Because the former &sect;1201.116 was redesignated as &sect;1201.117, the Board
is now making a conforming amendment to the cross-reference to that section in &sect;1201.37(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Section 1201.122(c) is amended by adding ``commercial overnight delivery'' as a method of filing and service.
On July 7, 1993 (58 FR 36345), the Board amended its rules in subparts B and C of this part to permit filing and service
of appeals and petitions for review by commercial overnight delivery. The Board is now amending &sect;1201.122(c)
to conform the method of filing and service requirements for Special Counsel complaints and proposed agency actions
against administrative law judges in subpart D of this part to those for appeals and petitions for review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Section 1201.163(c)(1) is amended to clarify that mixed case appeals governed by Reorganization Plan No. 1 of
1978 are to be filed with the appropriate Board regional or field office. See explanation in paragraph (e) above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) Section 1201.182(a) and &sect;1201.182(c) are amended to clarify that petitions for enforcement of orders issued
under the Board's appellate jurisdiction are to be filed with the appropriate Board regional or field office. See
explanation in paragraph (e) above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

or field office having geographic jurisdiction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

appeals made by the Board's amendment to its rules in this part on June 17, 1994 (59 FR 31109).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) On page 1, both ``WHEN TO FILE AN APPEAL'' and ``HOW TO FILE AN APPEAL'' have been revised to include ``commercial
overnight delivery'' as a method of filing an appeal, in accordance with the Board's amendment to its rules in this

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) On page 1, the final sentence under ``Public Reporting Burden'' has been revised to replace ``Office of Management
Analysis'' with ``Office of Planning and Resource Management Services'' to reflect the reorganization of the Board's
headquarters offices and, at the request of the Office of Management and Budget, to delete the requirement that comments
and suggestions be sent to OMB's Paperwork Reduction Project.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) On page 2, a sentence has been added in block 7 to put the appellant on notice that designating a representative in

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) On page 2, a check-off box for ``Foreign Service'' has been added in block 20 because career and career candidate
appointees in the Foreign Service now have the right to appeal reduction-in-force actions to the Board. See explanation

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) On page 4, in block 38, the phrase ``full 30-day notice'' has been replaced with ``the required number of days notice''
to reflect changes in statute and Office of Personnel Management regulations that now require at least 60 days advance
notice for most reduction-in-force actions, with provision for a longer notice period_at least 120 days_for some
Department of Defense actions, and shorter notice_less than 60 days but at least 30 days_under certain circumstances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) On page 6, in block 41.a, the material after ``Yes'' has been revised to clarify that the attachment requested

Management Division; see notice published September 15, 1994 (59 FR 47363), corrected October 18, 1994 (59 FR 52558).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(l) Appendix II is amended by adding information regarding the TDD (Telecommunications Device for the Deaf) capability
of facsimile numbers in the regional and field offices, by substituting the suite number for ``10th Floor'' in the
address of the Atlanta Regional Office, and by changing the address and facsimile number of the Denver Field Office
to reflect the relocation of that office effective December 1, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(m) Appendix III is amended by adding two approved hearing locations and deleting one under the Atlanta Regional Office,
by adding two under the Denver Field Office, by adding one under the New York Field Office, and by adding one under the

Pleadings may be served on parties by mail, by personal delivery, by facsimile, or by commercial overnight delivery.
Service by mail is accomplished by mailing the pleading to each party or representative, at the party's or representative's
last known address. Service by facsimile is accomplished by transmitting the pleading by facsimile to each party
or representative. Service by personal delivery or by commercial overnight delivery is accomplished by delivering
the pleading to the business office or home of each party or representative and leaving it with the party or representative,
or with a responsible person at that address. Regardless of the method of service, the party serving the document must
submit to the Board, along with the pleading, a certificate of service as proof that the document was served on the other
parties or their representatives. The certificate of service must list the names and addresses of the persons on whom
the pleading was served, must state the date on which the pleading was served, must state the method (i.e., mail, personal
delivery, facsimile, or commercial overnight delivery) by which service was accomplished, and must be signed by
the person responsible for accomplishing service.

 On March 30, 1994 (59 FR 14739), the Board published a revision to its rules at 5 CFR part 1201, appendix II and appendix
III, to reflect the realignment of its regional office structure into six regional and five field offices. In the ``SUPPLEMENTARY
INFORMATION'' explaining that revision, the Board stated in part: ``Appeals and related matters will continue to
be filed with either the regional or field office having geographic jurisdiction.'' The Board is now amending its
rules at 5 CFR part 1209 by adding ``or field'' after ``regional'' in &sect;&sect;1209.8, 1209.9, and 1209.10 to clarify
the place of filing requirement for stay requests of personnel actions allegedly based on whistleblowing.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In August 1991, the Board of Governors adopted the Uniform Rules of Practice and Procedure (Rules) (56 FR 38048, Aug.
9, 1991). The Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), Office of Thrift
Supervision (OTS) and National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) have also adopted the Rules (OCC, 56 FR 38024,
Aug. 9, 1991; FDIC, 56 FR 37968, Aug. 9, 1991; OTS, 56 FR 38302, Aug. 12, 1991; and NCUA, 56 FR 37762, Aug. 8, 1991). The
Board of Governors is amending one aspect of the Rules relating to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 communications to clarify that the Rules parallel the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act. The other
agencies have proposed or are considering proposing a similar amendment (FDIC, 59 FR 60921, Nov. 29, 1994; OTS, 59
FR 62354, Dec. 5, 1994). The Board of Governors issued this amendment as a proposed rule on November 22, 1994 (59 FR 60094,
Nov. 22, 1994). It is now adopting the rule in the form proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, &sect;263.9 of the Rules prohibits ``a party, his or her counsel, or another interested person'' from
making an 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
communication to the Board or other decisional official concerning the merits of an adjudicatory proceeding. When
the Rules were proposed and adopted in 1991, the joint notice of proposed rulemaking (56 FR 27790, 27793, June 17, 1991)
explained that the proposed rule regarding 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 communications ``adopts the rules and procedures set forth in the APA regarding 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 communications.'' There was no intention at that time to impose a rule more restrictive than that imposed by the APA
itself. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The APA contains two provisions relating to communications with agency decision-makers. The APA's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 communication provision restricts communications between ``interested person[s] 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
outside the agency
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' and the agency head, the administrative law judge (ALJ), or the agency decisional employees. 5 U.S.C. 557(d) (emphasis
added). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Intra-agency
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 communications are governed by the APA's separation of functions provision, 5 U.S.C. 554(d). That section prohibits
investigative or prosecutorial personnel at an agency from ``participat[ing] or advis[ing] in the decision, recommended
decision, or agency review'' of an adjudicatory matter pursuant to section 557 of the APA except as witness or counsel.
The same separation of function provision provides that the ALJ in an adjudicatory matter may not consult any party
on a fact in issue unless the other parties have an opportunity to participate. 5 U.S.C. 554(d)(1). The separation
of functions provision does not prohibit agency investigatory or prosecutorial staff from seeking the amendment
of a notice or the settlement or termination of a proceeding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule as proposed and adopted in 1991, however, did not mention the separation of functions concept explicitly,
and appeared to apply the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 communication prohibition to all communications concerning the merits of an adjudicatory proceeding between the
agency head, ALJ or decisional personnel on the one hand, and any ``party, his or her counsel, or another person interested
in the proceeding'' on the other. The Board of Governors does not interpret this provision as limiting agency enforcement
staff's ability to seek approval of amendments to or terminations of existing enforcement actions. As drafted, however,
the provision could be misinterpreted to expand the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 communication prohibition beyond the scope of the APA. The Board of Governors did not intend this result.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendment clarifies that the regulation is intended to conform to the provisions of the APA by limiting the prohibition
on 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 communications to communications to or from ``interested persons outside the agency,'' 5 U.S.C. 557(d), and by incorporating
explicitly the APA's separation of functions provisions, 5 U.S.C. 554(d). This approach is also consistent with
the most recent Model Adjudication Rules prepared by the Administrative Conference of the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board of Governors received two comments on the proposed rule, both of which supported it. One of the commenters
suggested that the Board explain the so-called ``Chinese wall'' that prevents those staff members involved in the
prosecutorial function from communicating with those who advise the Board on a particular matter. The amended rule
specifically sets out the APA's separation of function provision, which prohibits agency prosecutorial personnel
in one case from participating in the Board's decision on that or a factually related case. This provision clearly
prevents prosecutorial staff from communicating about the merits of a case with those staff members who advise the
Board regarding a final decision in the case. It is unnecessary to set out internal procedures implementing this statutory
prohibition in a formal rulemaking, and to do so could limit the Board's flexibility with respect to internal organization.

II. Regulatory Flexibility Act

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Board of Governors hereby certifies that the final
rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, a regulatory
flexibility analysis is not required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule makes a minor amendment to a rule of practice already in place, and affects intra-agency procedure exclusively.
Thus, it should not result in additional burden for regulated institutions. The purpose of the revised regulation
is to conform the provisions of the regulation to those imposed by statute.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Rolls-Royce, plc Spey series turbofan engines,
that requires a one-time inspection of stage 1 and stage 2 high pressure turbine (HPT) and low pressure turbine (LPT)
disks for cracks and corrosion pitting. This amendment is prompted by a report of a stage 7 high pressure compressor
disk found cracked due to corrosion. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent an HPT or LPT disk burst
due to cracking attributed to corrosion, which may result in an uncontained engine failure.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to Rolls-Royce, plc (R-R) Spey series turbofan engines was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 11, 1994 (59 FR 1500). That action proposed to require a one-time inspection of stage 1 and stage 2 high pressure
turbine (HPT) and low pressure turbine (LPT) disks for cracks and corrosion pitting once the disks have completed
at least 40% of their published Group ``A'' cyclic life limits as specified in the applicable overhaul manual. These
disks must be inspected in accordance with the applicable overhaul manual during the engine's next shop visit where
either the HPT or LPT disks are removed after the effective date of this AD. Accomplishment of this inspection will
allow stage 1 and stage 2 HPT and LPT disks to complete the remainder of their current published cyclic life limits.
The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with R-R Service Bulletin No. Sp72&hyph;1044, dated
September 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the one comment received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter concurs with the AD as proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the definition of shop visit has been clarified to eliminate the reference to next scheduled disk inspection
and include next disk removal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comment noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes described previously. The FAA has determined
that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 173 engines installed on aircraft of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD and that the average
labor rate is $55 per work hour. The FAA estimates that it will take no additional work hours per engine to accomplish
the required actions to the HPT's as the inspection is performed during regular turbine overhauls. Approximately
80% of the engines will require an additional 25 work hours of extra access, inspection, and rebuild time to perform
the required LPT inspection. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated
to be $189,750. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, Defense Nuclear Agency (DNA) is adopting a change to exempt a new system
of records, HDNA 011, entitled Inspector General Investigation Files, from certain provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a.
The exemption is intended to increase the value of the system of records for law enforcement purposes, to comply with
prohibitions against the disclosure of certain kinds of information, and to protect the privacy of individuals identified
in the system of records.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Director, Administration and Management, Office of the Secretary of Defense has determined that this Privacy
Act rule for the Department of Defense does not constitute `significant regulatory action.' Analysis of the rule
indicates that it does not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; does not create a serious inconsistency
or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; does not materially alter the budgetary
impact of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the right and obligations of recipients thereof; does
not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in Executive Order 12866 (1993).

The DNA Inspector General's Office performs as one of its principal functions under the Inspector General Act of 1978,
as amended by the Inspector General Act Amendment of 1988 (Pub. L. 95&hyph;452, as amended, 5 U.S.C. App.3) (IG Act),
investigations into and enforcement actions concerned with suspected violations. The DNA OIG is responsible for
promoting economy, efficiency, and effectiveness in the administration of DNA programs and operations and to detect
and prevent fraud, waste and abuse in such programs and operations.

The (k)(2) exemption reflects recognition that certain records in the system may be deemed to require protection
from disclosure in order to protect confidential sources mentioned in the files and avoid compromising, impeding,
or interfering with investigative and enforcement proceedings. The system would thus be exempt from sections 5 U.S.C.
552a(c)(3); (d)(1) through (d)(4); (e)(1); (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I); and (f). The proposed rule was published on August
15, 1994, at 59 FR 41739. No comments were received, therefore, the DNA is adopting the changes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reasons. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
From subsection (c)(3) because it will enable DNA to conduct certain investigations and relay law enforcement information
without compromise of the information, protection of investigative techniques and efforts employed, and identities
of confidential sources who might not otherwise come forward and who furnished information under an express promise
that the sources' identity would be held in confidence (or prior to the effective date of the Act, under an implied promise.)
From subsection (d)(1) through (d)(4) and (f) because providing access to records of a civil investigation and the
right to contest the contents of those records and force changes to be made to the information contained therein would
seriously interfere with and thwart the orderly and unbiased conduct of the investigation and impede case preparation.
Providing access rights normally afforded under the Privacy Act would provide the subject with valuable information
that would allow interference with or compromise of witnesses or render witnesses reluctant to cooperate; lead to
suppression, alteration, or destruction of evidence; and result in the secreting of or other disposition of assets
that would make them difficult or impossible to reach in order to satisfy any Government claim growing out of the investigation
or proceeding. From subsection (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I) because it will provide protection against notification
of investigatory material including certain reciprocal investigations and counterintelligence information,
which might alert a subject to the fact that an investigation of that individual is taking place, and the disclosure
of which would weaken the on-going investigation, reveal investigatory techniques, and place confidential informants
in jeopardy who furnished information under an express promise that the sources' identity would be held in confidence
(or prior to the effective date of the Act, under an implied promise).

 EPA is revoking a significant new use rule (SNUR) promulgated under section 5(a)(2) of the Toxic Substances Control
Act (TSCA) for the chemical substance described generically as an alkenyl ether of alkanetriol polymer, which was
the subject of premanufacture notice (PMN) P&hyph;93&hyph;458. EPA initially published this SNUR using direct
final rulemaking procedures. EPA received adverse comments on this rule. Therefore, the Agency is revoking this
rule, as required under the Expedited SNUR rulemaking process (40 CFR part 721 subpart D). In a separate notice of proposed
rulemaking published elsewhere in today's issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of October 4, 1993 (58 FR 51672), EPA issued several direct final SNURs including a SNUR for the substance described
generically as alkenyl ether of alkanetriol polymer, PMN P&hyph;93&hyph;458. As described in 40 CFR 721.160, EPA
is revoking the rule issued for P&hyph;93&hyph;458 under direct final rulemaking procedures because the Agency
received adverse comments. As required by &sect;721.160(a)(3)(iii), EPA is proposing the rule published elsewhere

to 40 CFR part 721 subpart D. The record for the direct final SNUR for this substance which is being revoked by this rule
was established at OPPTS&hyph;50612. That record includes information considered by the Agency in developing this
rule, and includes the adverse comments to which the Agency has responded with this revocation. The docket control
number for the revocation is OPPTS&hyph;50612C. For details, refer to the proposal published elsewhere in today's

 EPA is revoking a significant new use rule (SNUR) promulgated under section 5(a)(2) of the Toxic Substances Control
Act (TSCA) for the chemical substance described generically as polyalkylene polyamine which was the subject of premanufacture
notice (PMN) P&hyph;89&hyph;963. EPA initially published this SNUR using direct final rulemaking procedures.
EPA received adverse comments on this rule. Therefore, the Agency is revoking this rule, as required under the Expedited
SNUR rulemaking process (40 CFR part 721 subpart D). In a separate notice of proposed rulemaking published elsewhere
in today's issue of the

 This rule amends part 1607 of the Legal Services Corporation's (``LSC'' or ``Corporation'') regulations relating
to governing bodies of recipients of LSC funds. Many of the revisions are simply intended to clarify current Corporation
policy or to interrelate this part to other LSC regulations. However, a number of the revisions represent changes
in Corporation policy or interpretations with respect to issues that arise under the regulation. The final rule also
includes a number of technical revisions to make the rule easier to understand and apply.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Operations and Regulations Committee (``Committee'') of the LSC Board of Directors (``Board'') held public
hearings on April 15, 1994, in Washington, DC, and on May 13, 1994, in Atlanta, Georgia, to consider drafts of proposed
revisions to 45 CFR part 1607, LSC's regulation on recipient governing bodies. At the meeting in Atlanta, the Committee
approved a draft, which was published as a proposed rule for public comment at 59 FR 30885 (June 16, 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Twenty-two written comments were received and reviewed by the Corporation. The comments generally applauded the
proposed revisions, but there were some areas of disagreement and several suggestions for changes. On September
16 and 30, 1994, the Committee held public meetings to consider the written and oral comments on the proposed rule.
Based on those comments, the Committee made several revisions. The Committee met again on October 27, 1994, and voted
to recommend a final rule for adoption by the full Board. On November 5, 1994, the Board voted to adopt the rule as recommended
by the Committee for publication as a final rule in the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Corporation recognizes that legislation to amend the Legal Services Corporation Act and reauthorize appropriations
for the Corporation may be considered by Congress. If such legislation does become law, the Corporation's regulations
will be revisited and revised accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to amending 45 CFR part 1607, this rule is also intended to supersede part 1607's interpretive guideline
published at 48 FR 36820 (August 15, 1983). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Section 1607.2&blank;Definitions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most of the changes in this section are technical and clarifying in nature. The section has been reordered to put the
definitions in alphabetical order. Also, definitions found in other parts of the regulations but applicable to this
part are included here for easier reference. In addition, language found in other sections of this part that, in fact,
constitute definitions of terms are included here both for easier reference and to treat similar terms similarly.
A new definition was added and some of the language has been clarified to make it consistent with past and current LSC
interpretations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1607.2(a)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the definition of ``attorney member'' applies to attorneys who serve on any recipient board subject to this
part, it was added primarily to make it clear that board members of a national support center do not have to be admitted
to practice in a state where the center actually provides legal assistance. Because the ``service area'' of national
support centers is the entire nation, an attorney board member need be admitted to practice in only one of the 50 states.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment suggested that law professors who teach within a recipient's service area, but who are not members of the
bar in the recipient's service area, should be allowed to serve as an ``attorney member'' on the recipient's board.
Statutory requirements for recipient boards do not allow this option. However, such law professors may serve pursuant
to &sect;1607.3(d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1607.2(c)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The definition of ``eligible client member'' has been revised from the current definition. First, the language has
been changed to make it clear that client board members must be eligible at the time of their appointment to each term
of office. Thus, a client member who is financially eligible for services when first appointed to a recipient's board
may not be reappointed to a second or subsequent term if, at the time of reappointment, the client board member is no
longer financially eligible for LSC-funded services. However, nothing in the rule would require a client board member
to resign during the course of a term if the client became ineligible subsequent to appointment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some comments suggested a further change to the definition to clarify that eligibility is based on financial eligibility,
so that individuals who would be financially eligible to receive legal assistance, but who could not be served by the
recipient because of some other restriction on types of legal assistance or program priorities, could serve on recipient
boards. The Board agreed and revised the language to clarify that a member need only be financially eligible pursuant
to the requirements of LSC's financial eligibility guidelines, set out in 45 CFR part 1611, to qualify for board membership.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Language has also been adopted for this definition to clarify, in response to concerns raised in comments, that it
is the national rather than the local financial eligibility standard that is applicable. As long as a person would
qualify for services under Part 1611, the person would qualify for board membership, regardless of whether the recipient
has a lower financial eligibility threshold or regardless of whether the person would also qualify for other services
provided by the recipient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some comments suggested that the definition should be expanded to include individuals who are eligible for non-LSC-funded
but not LSC-funded services provided by the recipient. One such comment suggested the adoption of a proportionality
requirement, so that clients who are eligible for non-LSC-funded services, but not LSC-funded services, could serve
in proportion to the amount of overall funding from the non-LSC source. Several comments argued that it is more important
that client representatives be effective advocates for clients than that they be financially eligible for LSC-funded
services. Two comments suggested substantially different and more expansive definitions of eligibility for client
board membership. After consideration of these proposals, the Board decided not to expand the definition because
it wished to insure that the focus of the legal services program remains on the indigent population. The Board believes
that eligible client members are supposed to bring to the recipient a perspective of the community's needs, and that
can best be done by someone who is financially eligible for the recipient's LSC-funded services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The last major change to the definition is intended to clarify that it is the recipient that should decide how client
board member eligibility is determined, i.e., the recipient should decide whether it or a particular group should
make the determination. Thus, the recipient could decide that, for some groups, the recipient will make the determination
and for others it will leave the determination up to the appointing group. Two comments opposed the language that permits
client eligibility determinations to be made by the appointing groups, rather than the recipient, arguing that the
determination should not be delegated. No changes were made to the proposal, however, because it does not require
that the recipient delegate the decision; it merely gives the recipient the choice.

Section 1607.2(d)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule defined ``governing body'' so that it would have applied both to the governing bodies of recipients
who have as a primary purpose the provision of legal assistance to eligible clients and to the policy boards or bodies
established pursuant to the waiver provision in &sect;1607.6(d). However, in response to comments on the proposed
definition, the Board narrowed the definition so that it does not apply to the policy boards or bodies referred to in
&sect;1607.6(d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There was a concern expressed in a comment as to whether a body that does not have full authority to make all ``governing''
policy and administrative decisions for the LSC-funded project would fall within the rule's definition of ``governing
body.'' For example, one LSC recipient that receives very little of its funding from LSC has set up a ``policy board''
to oversee the LSC grant separate from its Board of Directors, which oversees all of its other activities. However,
the policy board does not have all the authority envisioned by this rule in the definition of ``governing body'' and
in &sect;1607.4, which deals with the functions of governing bodies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response, the Board decided to define ``governing body'' so that it does not apply to the policy boards or bodies
referred to in &sect;1607.6(d) and to make it clear that a governing body should have full authority over LSC grants
as envisioned in this rule. However, in certain special circumstances that are discussed at length in this commentary
on &sect;1607.6 on waivers, the President has the authority to grant waivers on board composition requirements.
As a condition of granting such a waiver, a recipient would be required to establish a special policy board or body,
rather than a governing board or body, to oversee the grant.

Section 1607.2(e)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A definition of ``policy body'' is added to this section to distinguish such a body from a governing body. As discussed

However, a policy body would be required to conform to the membership and appointment requirements of &sect;1607.3,
as well as the meeting requirements and compensation restriction in &sect;&sect;1607.4 and 1607.5, respectively,
and would be required to have full authority to set policy for the services and activities funded under the LSC grant.

This section is revised to require in paragraph (a) that all board members must be supportive of the purposes of the
LSC Act, and must be interested in and knowledgeable about the delivery of quality legal services to the poor. The current
regulation does not include any similar requirement for client board members, but does include similar, although
not identical, requirements for attorney and other board members. The rule removes the reference to the board's reflecting
``the characteristics'' of the client community, in part because it is not clear what that language means and in part
because it could be construed to be inconsistent with diversity requirements that are included in this section for
each category of board membership.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Three diversity provisions are added to the regulation in &sect;&sect;1607.3(b)(3), (c) and (d) to require that
board members reflect the diversity of the legal and client communities, including such factors as race, ethnicity,
gender, and other similar factors. In so doing, the regulation relocates the current section of the rule that relates
to diversity among attorney board members, revises the language to incorporate a more up-to-date statement of the
concerns addressed by the current subsection, and applies the requirement to all categories of board members. While
the language of this final rule specifically mentions race, ethnicity, and gender, it also includes a reference to
``other similar factors'' that may be relevant in a particular legal community and population of the area served by
the recipient, which may include, for example, age, physical abilities, and religious belief. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule did not have the word ``similar'' as a modifier in the phrase ``other factors.'' Some comments stated
that the diversity requirement was too broad and compliance would be difficult if, at the same time, a recipient did
not have the authority to select client board members. However, other comments suggested broader areas of diversity,
such as experience or expertise in poverty areas, such as housing, education, benefits, homelessness, etc. The Board
decided to revise the language to ``other similar factors'' instead of ``other factors.'' This revision is intended
to provide sufficient leeway for local programs to determine the appropriate types of diversity in their service
areas and to insure that their local boards ``reasonably'' reflect those types of diversity that are relevant to the
mission of legal services programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provision does not require mathematical precision, but sets out goals that recipients should strive to achieve.
In this regard, &sect;1607.3(h) will allow programs to consult with the appointing organizations to insure that
the appointments are made consistent with LSC guidelines. This seems to be a reasonable compromise between allowing
no recipient input and giving the recipient the authority to make all appointments. Finally, if necessary and appropriate,
the waiver provision in &sect;1607.6 could be utilized.

With respect to attorney board members, the rule revises the language of the current rule that is based on the requirements
of the McCollum Amendment in the act appropriating funds for the Corporation. The McCollum Amendment requires a majority
of the board members to be appointed by appropriate state, county and municipal bar associations. The revision clarifies
that the appointments can be made by one or more such bar associations, as long as those bar associations collectively
represent a majority of attorneys practicing law in the recipient's service area. If there are minority or gender-based
bar associations that represent attorneys practicing in a particular locality, those bar associations may be included
in the mix of bar associations that make appointments of attorneys to a recipient's board, especially if their inclusion
would help to insure that there is appropriate diversity among the attorney members of the board. In addition, although
the rule, consistent with the language of the McCollum Amendment, states that the appointments are to be made by the
``governing bodies'' of the bar associations, the Board recognizes that different bar associations should be free
to exercise their appointment responsibility in a manner consistent with their own policies, procedures and practices.
The McCollum Amendment does not direct LSC to impose any particular method of appointment on a bar association. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment objected to term limitations on attorney appointments imposed by a state bar and suggested that the rule
state specifically that any decisions on term limitations should be made by the recipient as part of its bylaws, rather
than by the appointing bar or other organization. The Board did not incorporate the suggested change, because it feels
that recipients should be allowed to work out those differences on a local level with the appointing organizations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule also adds language which is based on part of the McCollum Amendment to make it clear that national support centers
are not required to use the American Bar Association (``ABA'') or a collection of all state bars to appoint their attorney
members, simply because they provide service nationally. The rule also recognizes that some recipients, especially
Native American or migrant programs, may have offices in one state, but also provide services in one or more adjacent
or nearby states. The language is intended to permit those programs, if they so decide, to have the bar associations
of the other states in which they provide service make appointments as well as the bar of the state in which their principal
office is located. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the additional ten percent of the board members who must be attorneys, but who are not covered by the McCollum Amendment,
the final rule now explicitly states what is implicit in the language of the current regulation, i.e., that they may
be selected by the recipient's governing body, if it so chooses. The rule does change the current regulation with respect
to the additional ten percent of attorney board members in one respect, however. Under the current regulation, the
additional attorneys must be representatives of bar associations or other legal organizations, e.g., law schools.
This requirement is not contained in the LSC Act. Under this revised regulation, the recipient may select attorneys
who are not representatives of any particular bar or legal organization, or may select attorneys who are affiliated
with non-legal organizations, as long as they are admitted to practice in a state within the recipient's service area,
and as long as the organization has an interest in the delivery of legal services to the poor. Thus, the recipient may
select lawyers who represent the business community or the United Way and who could be helpful in fundraising, or lawyers
who provide substantial pro bono services to the client community and could be helpful in designing a recipient's
private attorney involvement program.

Section 1607.3(c)

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The rule includes a number of changes in the language that relates to client board members. The principal revision
addresses the ambiguity of the language of the current regulation that has caused problems for some LSC recipients.
This revision codifies the current LSC interpretation of the language to require that client board members be selected
by client groups that have been designated by the recipient. The revision also adds language that more accurately
reflects the kind of groups or organizations that would be appropriate client groups for purposes of selecting eligible
client members. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most comments applauded the language broadening the types of client organizations that may make appointments. Comments
were not uniform, however, on whether recipients or client groups should have authority to appoint client board members.
Numerous comments supported the clarification and the policy choice that it represented, while other comments stated
that it is very difficult, and sometimes impossible, to comply with the requirement that client members be appointed
by client organizations. According to these comments, often there are no organized client groups within the service
area and, even when there are, it is not necessarily true that client groups speak for the client community. Other comments
noted that recipients often come into contact with program clients or other financially eligible individuals who
would make good client board members but who, for one reason or another, are not involved with any client group. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No change was made by the Board in response to comments on the proposed language. With the addition of &sect;1607.3(h),
permitting consultation with the appointing organizations, and the waiver provisions in &sect;1607.6, the rule
attempts to strike a reasonable balance among these concerns by (1) giving local programs as much input as possible
into the selection of board members and (2) providing for waivers for special conditions.

With respect to the other board members, i.e., those that are neither attorney members nor eligible client members,
the rule makes it clear that recipient boards are permitted to fill these slots. This gives recipients flexibility
to include board members who can help them with fundraising, community relations, coordination with other social
service providers, or any other locally identified need. Law school professors who cannot count as ``attorney members''
because they are not admitted to practice in a state within the recipient's service area, could be selected for this
category of membership. Although there is no comparable language in the current regulation, this provision is consistent
with longstanding LSC interpretations.

This provision is revised by adding language to the ``domination'' provision in the current regulation to make it
clear that the provision is not intended to prevent recipients from designating a single regional or statewide client
council as the appointing organization for client board members, as long as that client council represents numerous
smaller client groups. One comment suggested that coalitions may not always be broad-based and that there might be
competing coalitions of client groups within a service area. The regulation, however, does not require that recipients
use coalitions as the appointing organizations; it merely gives recipients the choice.

Section 1607.3(g)

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section establishes a standard for dealing with recipient board vacancies by requiring recipients to make reasonable
and good faith efforts to insure that governing body vacancies are filled promptly. Implicit in this standard is a
recognition that recipients often have no control over the appointment process other than to change the groups that
they have designated to make the appointments if a particular group fails to make an appointment in a timely manner.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments generally favored this provision. One comment noted that the existence of a few vacancies on a large board
would have no influence on the ability of a recipient to conduct its business. Several cautioned, however, that recipients
``should be expected to exercise due diligence in the filling of board vacancies'' and others proposed specific timeframes
for compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Corporation retained the proposed language as a reasonable and realistic approach to problems with vacancies;
but the Corporation also recognizes that there are alternative approaches to deal with vacancies. For example, through
their own bylaws or board policies, recipients could take a number of actions when appointing organizations are slow
in making appointments, refuse to make them, or are unable to make them for whatever reason. Thus, a recipient board
could adopt bylaws that would permit its members to hold over until replacements are appointed, or could allow for
short-term interim appointments, if necessary, until regular appointments could be made.

Section 1607.3(h)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section has been revised from the proposed rule. It incorporates and amends the consultation provisions in the
proposed &sect;1607.3(f) and the provisions in the proposed &sect;1607.3(h) that would have explicitly permitted
a recipient to veto an appointee to its board. As adopted by the Board, this paragraph now states affirmatively that
recipients may recommend names to bar associations and other appointing groups and should consult with those groups
to insure that appropriate appointments are made. The Board adopted this consultation provision because it recognizes
that bar associations or other groups may wish to request information from recipients on who would make a good legal
services program board member and that appointing groups would benefit from recipient input in making their appointments.
Most comments, including those from several bar associations, approved of this proposal, as long as it is clear that
appointing bodies are to make independent judgments about whom to appoint to recipient boards. It is the intent of
the Board that appointing organizations are to make independent judgments and retain their status as the decision
makers for recipient board members. The consultation provision is meant to be an aid, not an impediment, to the appointing
organization's decision making process.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In light of comments from the Standing Committee on Legal Aid and Indigent Defendants (``SCLAID'') of the American
Bar Association, the Board chose not to adopt the provision authorizing a recipient to veto an appointee. SCLAID opposed
the provision because it could cause unnecessary controversy and has the potential to be misread or misunderstood.
SCLAID suggested that the consultation provision would obviate most problems at the outset and that local recipient
bylaw provisions or state laws would adequately resolve any problems that might arise. Although other bar associations
approved the concept of the veto provision, they advised building more specific checks and balances into the provision,
for safeguards. The Board agreed that there were problems with the veto provision and decided to incorporate the consideration
of individual or institutional conflict into the consultation provision. In addition, the Board noted that applicable
state law that deals with conflict issues of nonprofit boards and recipient bylaws should be consulted to determine
what mechanisms are available to deal with situations that cannot be resolved through the consultation process.
Accordingly, recipients could amend their bylaws to add provisions that deal with board membership conflicts as
long as the bylaws do not conflict with any requirements of the LSC Act or regulations. Then, when making recommendations
to appointing organizations, recipients may refer to their bylaws as part of the standards by which board members
should be appointed. It is recommended that such bylaws deal with situations where conflict issues are not resolved
by the consultation process and also make it clear that it should be the governing body rather than the recipient's
staff that determines whether there is a conflict.

This rule deletes the requirement for ``effective'' prior public notice, which has proven to be a difficult concept
to enforce and may be very fact-specific. The Board felt that truly effective public notice is virtually impossible
to achieve, even if a recipient spent huge amounts of money on advertising. The Corporation does not wish to promote
such wasteful expenditures or assume that the efforts were not ``effective'' simply because few members of the public
showed up at a board meeting. Instead, the standard should be that of ``reasonable'' prior public notice, so that recipients
would be required to do only what is reasonable under the specific local circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board also considered whether it should include within the regulation specific guidance as to what kinds of matters
were properly discussed in executive session. In response to comments that some boards do not give appropriate notice
of meetings, the Board revised the proposed language of &sect;1607.4(a) to require recipients to have written policies
that are adopted by their governing bodies, so that arbitrary or ad hoc decisions would not be made regarding these
matters. It also decided to recommend that recipients look to the kinds of matters described in the LSC bylaws and Sunshine
Act regulation (45 CFR part 1622), state Sunshine Act provisions, or other provisions in state nonprofit corporation
law for guidance as to the kinds of matters that might appropriately be discussed out of the public eye.

Section 1607.4(b)

New language is added to the rule to clarify that recipient governing bodies have, in addition to the specific functions
described in the regulation, the authority and responsibility inherent in their status as boards of nonprofit corporations.
The Board felt that the current regulatory language does not recognize that general authority, and the Board determined
that it should do so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Board added language to make the section consistent with ABA opinions on the role of governing bodies
of legal assistance programs under the American Bar Association's Model Rules of Professional Conduct, especially
with respect to the governing bodies' interference with an attorney's representation of a client or with the conduct
of any ongoing representation. The Board wished to make clear that while recipient board members were prohibited
from such interference, the board as a whole should be encouraged to adopt policies to guide the executive director's
actions when he or she discovers that the recipient has undertaken representation in a case that is inappropriate
under the restrictions of the LSC Act or regulations.

This new provision is intended to make it clear that it is up to recipients to design their own bylaws and that LSC approval
is no longer required. The Corporation would, of course, have authority to review a program's bylaws, as well as any
revisions that are made to them, to insure that they comply with the LSC Act and regulations. Several comments suggested
that the proposed language did not make it clear whether a recipient must submit its bylaws to the Corporation for approval.
Thus, paragraph (c) of the proposed rule was revised to clarify that LSC approval of original or amended bylaws is no
longer required. Recipients need only send the Corporation a copy of any changes to their bylaws within a reasonable
time after the bylaws are revised. Although the Board did not adopt a specific deadline, it noted that a reasonable
time would be approximately 30 days.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The revisions to this section clarify an interpretation of the current rule and make two significant changes dealing
with recipient board member compensation. First, this section has been revised so that the compensation restriction
applies only to attorney board members. Since the provision of the LSC Act that prohibits compensation applies only
to attorney board members, it is consistent with the Act to permit a recipient to pay compensation to a client or other
non-attorney board member for board service or other service to the recipient. Comments were mixed on this provision.
Some wanted to preserve the current rule because it relieves individual programs of the necessity to engage in debate
on the subject. Several comments, on the other hand, suggested that client board members should always be compensated,
and another stated that small stipends for client board members should be made in recognition of the effort that they
make in fulfilling their board responsibilities. The Board adopted the proposed revision, since the statutory language
is limited to the compensation of attorneys. The decision of whether to apply it to client members is purely a local
policy decision to be made by recipients.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second change made in this provision reverses the decision made by the LSC Board in 1988, which interpreted the
language of the LSC Act to prohibit a recipient board member from receiving compensation from any recipient, not just
the one on whose board the member sat. The effect of the 1988 revision was to prohibit field program staff from sitting
on state and national support center boards, and vice versa, and thus prevented support centers from being accountable
through their boards to the programs that they were intended to serve. This revision restores and clarifies the prior
LSC policy that was in existence from 1975 to 1988 and which reflects the intent of Congress. Both the Legal Services
Corporation reauthorization bill that passed the House in 1992 (H.R. 2039) and the bill that was approved by the Senate
Committee on Labor and Human Resources the same year (S. 2870) would have amended the LSC Act in a manner consistent
with this revision. All but one comment favored this revision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, this section clarifies that all board members may receive a per diem payment for expenses in lieu of actual
expense reimbursements, so long as such a payment is reasonable in light of actual average costs. Recipients are required
to have written procedures for such payments. Per diem payments may be easier for programs to administer and may encourage
board members to save money on items such as meals and lodging by setting the per diem at a relatively low rate. Language
in the current rule was deleted to make it clear that reimbursement could be made for expenses incurred by recipient
board members on the same terms and conditions that are applicable to non-board members, when such board members are
involved in other program activities not directly related to their board membership or service; e.g., attorney board
members who volunteered to drive a program client to a meeting or a hearing could receive reimbursement for automobile
expenses, or attorney board members who did pro bono work on behalf of the program could receive reimbursement for
travel expenses for attending an out-of-town settlement conference.

This section includes two new provisions that clarify how the compensation prohibition relates to a recipient's
private attorney involvement program. Paragraph (b) makes it clear that, for those rural programs that operate in
areas where there are so few attorneys that it is difficult or impossible to find attorneys willing to serve on program
boards, the Corporation could partially waive the compensation prohibition to allow partners and associates of
board members to participate in judicare or other compensated PAI activities. Comments generally favored this provision.
However, one comment cautioned that the waiver should be limited to those rural situations in which, essentially,
it would be otherwise impossible to recruit attorney board members. According to the comment, ``[t]here is a danger
that the delivery system could be skewed to direct resources towards associates or partners of board members and away
from the employees of the program.'' Most comments spoke of the problems of finding sufficient attorneys in rural
areas to participate in PAI programs. No changes were made to the proposed language in response to comments. However,
it is the intent of the Corporation that the waivers be used sparingly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c) was added to clarify that attorney board members can receive referrals of fee-generating cases and
participate freely in the recipient's pro bono PAI programs on the same terms as any other attorney. This is particularly
important for rural areas where there are few private attorneys.

There is no change in this waiver provision which was designed to cover those programs, primarily reservation-based
Native-American programs, that existed prior to the creation of the Corporation and had nonattorney majorities
on their boards. In lieu of attorneys, most of those programs include tribal advocates who practice in tribal courts.

Section 1607.6(b)

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This provision is added to permit the Corporation president to waive any of the provisions of this rule that are not
mandated by law, if the recipient demonstrates that it cannot comply with them because of the nature of the population,
legal community or area served or because of special circumstances, such as conflicting requirements of the recipient's
other major funding sources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule had a separate waiver provision for client board membership, but the LSC Board rejected the language.
The proposed waiver for client board membership was intended for recipients that are not statutorily required to
have clients on their boards to seek a waiver from the requirements of this rule. The rule applies to any recipient that
receives financial assistance from the Corporation pursuant to &sect;1006(a)(1)(A) of the LSC Act. The statutory
requirement for client membership, however, applies only to recipients organized solely for the provision of legal
assistance. Comments from client representatives persuaded the Board to continue the client board membership requirement
for any recipients that are subject to this rule. The Board agreed with the comments that any recipient funded by LSC
funds would benefit from the client input and that clients would be better served as a result of their ability to have
input into board policy decisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The language of (b)(1) has been amended to include a reference to ``legal community'' to make it clear that the nature
of the legal community, as well as requirements of state law, could be considered as a basis for a waiver. The Board recognized
that there may be programs, especially in rural areas, where there are peculiar problems or situations within the
legal community that may make it necessary or desirable to permit the recipient to have a governing board that varies
from the normal. An example would be for those programs that serve Native American populations and practice in tribal
courts. The president, through the waiver authority, could permit the recipient to substitute one or more tribal
advocates for attorney board members. In addition, this provision could be used as authority for partial waiver of
the compensation prohibition, to permit a recipient to adopt policies that would allow partners or associates of
a board member to participate in compensated PAI activities supported by the recipient.

Section 1607.6(d)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This new provision was added to require that as a condition of granting a waiver under paragraph (b)(2) of this section
from the requirements of &sect;1607.3, the president shall require that the recipient receiving the waiver have
a policy body to establish and enforce policy with respect to the LSC grant. This waiver provision might apply, for
example, to an organization that is not principally a legal assistance organization but gets an LSC grant for legal
assistance activities. The organization would be able to set up a policy board similar to those established for several
of the Delivery Systems Study programs during the late 1970's, to govern the activities covered by the LSC grant. The
Board intends that such a waiver would be given only in very unusual circumstances. Such a policy body would need to
comply with the appointment and membership requirements of &sect;1607.3 and the meeting requirements of &sect;1607.4(a),
and its members would be subject to the compensation prohibitions of &sect;1607.5. The Corporation wanted to make
clear that a policy board is not merely an advisory committee with limited authority to recommend policy to the recipient's
governing body. By definition, such a policy board would be required to have full authority to formulate and enforce
policy with respect to the services provided under the recipient's LSC grant or contract, although it may not necessarily
have any policy-making authority with respect to the recipient's non-LSC funded activities. This provision requires
the president to determine the powers and responsibilities of the policy body that are necessary to carry out its responsibilities
with respect to setting policy for the LSC-funded activities. Because the scope of the powers and responsibilities
of such policy bodies might be different than those of grantees not covered by the waiver, the reference in the proposed
rule to &sect;1607.4 has not been retained in this final rule.

Deletion of Section 1607.7&blank;Compliance
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The compliance section of the current regulation is no longer applicable, because it refers to the changes that were
made in the regulation in 1983. None of the revisions would require programs to change anything about their board structures
in order to come into compliance, although they would permit programs to make numerous changes and still remain in
compliance with the regulation. Therefore, the Corporation deletes the provisions on compliance. The Corporation
will insure compliance with the new regulation in the same manner that it insures compliance with the other regulations.

which advocate for or deliver services or resources to the client community served by the recipient. Recipients shall
designate groups in a manner that reflects, to the extent possible, the variety of interests within the client community,
and eligible client members should be selected so that they reasonably reflect the diversity of the eligible client
population served by the recipient, including race, gender, ethnicity and other similar factors.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Upon application, the president shall waive the requirements of this part to permit a recipient that was funded
under &sect;222(a)(3) of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 and, on July 25, 1974, had a majority of persons who were
not attorneys on its governing body, to continue such nonattorney majority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Upon application, the president may waive any of the requirements of this part which are not mandated by applicable
law if a recipient demonstrates that it cannot comply with them because of: (1) The nature of the population, legal
community or area served; or (2) Special circumstances, including but not limited to, conflicting requirements
of the recipient's other major funding source(s) or State law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The policy body shall have such specific powers and responsibilities as the President determines are necessary to
enable it to formulate and enforce policy with respect to the services provided under the recipient's LSC grant or
contract.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
). This final rule designates critical habitat for the delta smelt in the following geographic areas_areas of all
water and all submerged lands below ordinary high water and the entire water column bounded by and contained in Suisun
Bay (including the contiguous Grizzly and Honker Bays); the length of Goodyear, Suisun, Cutoff, First Mallard (Spring
Branch), and Montezuma sloughs; and the existing contiguous waters contained within the Delta, as defined in section
12220 of the California Water Code. Critical habitat designation for the delta smelt will provide additional protection
under section 7 of the Act with regard to activities that require Federal agency action.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Historically, the delta smelt is thought to have occurred from Suisun Bay upstream to the City of Sacramento on the
Sacramento River and the City of Mossdale on the San Joaquin River (Moyle 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1992). The delta smelt is a euryhaline species (tolerant of a wide salinity range) that spawns in fresh water and has
been collected from estuarine waters up to 14 grams per liter (equivalent to ppt) salinity (Moyle 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1992). For a large part of its annual life span, this species is associated with the freshwater edge of the mixing zone
(zone of mixing or entrapment at the saltwater-freshwater interface), where the salinity is approximately 2 ppt
(Ganssle 1966, Moyle 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1992, Sweetnam and Stevens 1993).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Shortly before spawning, adult delta smelt migrate upstream from the highly productive brackish-water habitat
associated with the mixing zone to disperse widely into river channels and tidally-influenced backwater sloughs
(Radtke 1966, Moyle 1976, Wang 1991).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Delta smelt spawn in shallow, fresh or slightly brackish water upstream of the mixing zone (Wang 1991), mostly in tidally-influenced

1992). Although delta smelt spawning behavior has not been observed in the wild (Moyle 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1992), the adhesive eggs are thought to attach to substrates such as cattails and tules, tree roots, and submerged
branches (Moyle 1976, Wang 1991). In the Delta, spawning is known to occur in the Sacramento River and in Barker, Lindsey,
Cache, Georgiana, Prospect, Beaver, Hog, and Sycamore sloughs (Wang 1991; Dale Sweetnam, pers. comm., 1993). Delta
smelt also spawn north of Suisun Bay in Montezuma and Suisun sloughs and their tributaries (Lesa Meng, pers. comm.,
1993; Dale Sweetnam, pers. comm., 1993).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The spawning season varies from year to year and may occur from late winter (December) to early summer (July and August).
Moyle (1976) collected gravid adults from December to April, although ripe delta smelt were most common in February
and March. In 1989 and 1990, Wang (1991) estimated that spawning had taken place from mid-February to late June or early
July, with the peak spawning period occurring in late April and early May. In 1993, a wet year, spawning may have occurred
as early as January and extended into June (Dale Sweetnam, pers. comm., 1994). Peak spawning occurred in April of that
year. In 1994, a critically dry year, peak spawning occurred at the end of April, and may have begun as early as late February
or early March (Dale Sweetnam, pers. comm., 1994).

In the laboratory, delta smelt eggs hatch in 10 to 14 days (Randy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mager, University of California, pers. comm., 1993). Laboratory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
observations indicate that delta smelt are broadcast spawners that spawn 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a current, usually at night, distributing their eggs over a local 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area (Lindberg 1992, Mager 1993). Eggs attach singly to the substrate, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and few eggs were found on vertical plants (Lindberg 1993). Lindberg 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1993) found that yolk-sac fry were positively phototactic and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negatively buoyant. After hatching, larvae are transported downstream 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toward the mixing zone where they are retained by the vertical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circulation of fresh and salt waters (Stevens 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1990). The pelagic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
larvae feed on phytoplankton until day 4, begin to feed on rotifers on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
day 6 and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Artemis nauplii
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on day 14 (Mager 1992). Juveniles feed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclusively on zooplankton. When the mixing zone is located in a broad 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
geographic area with extensive shallow-water habitat within the euphotic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
zone (depths less than 4 meters), high densities of phytoplankton and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
zooplankton are produced (Arthur and Ball 1978, 1979, 1980), and larval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and juvenile fish, including delta smelt, grow rapidly (Moyle 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1992, Sweetnam and Stevens 1993). When given the opportunity, delta 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smelt remain in Suisun Bay even after the 2 ppt isohaline has retreated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upstream (Herbold 1994). In general, estuaries are among the most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
productive ecosystems in the world (Goldman and Horne 1983). Estuarine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environments produce an abundance of fish as a result of plentiful food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and shallow, protective habitat for young. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the mixing zone is contained within Suisun Bay, young delta 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smelt are dispersed widely throughout a large expanse of shallow-water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and marsh habitat. Dispersal in areas downstream from the State and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal water pumps and in-Delta agricultural diversions protects young 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delta smelt from entrainment and distributes them among the extensive, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protective, and highly productive shoal regions of Suisun Bay. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contrast, when located upstream, the mixing zone becomes confined in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deep river channels, which are smaller in total surface area, contain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fewer shoal areas, have swifter, more turbulent water currents, and lack 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
high zooplankton productivity. Vulnerability to entrainment in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State and Federal pumping facilities and in-Delta diversions increases.

 (1950) collected young delta smelt near Sherman 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Island, at the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
July and August of 1948. In studies by the California Department of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fish and Game, California Department of Water Resources (DWR), and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bureau, larval and juvenile delta smelt were collected from Roe Island 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in Suisun Bay north to the confluence of the Sacramento and Feather 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rivers and east to Medford Island on the San Joaquin River (Wang 1991). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These studies were conducted during the months of April through mid-July 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in 1989 and 1990. Through these distribution surveys, Wang (1991) was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
able to document the movement of juvenile delta smelt from the Delta to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Suisun Bay in late June and early July. In 1990, young delta smelt were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taken at the Tracy Pumping Plant at the end of February (Wang 1991). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The delta smelt is adapted to living in the highly productive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sacramento-San Joaquin River Estuary (Estuary) where salinity varies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spatially and temporally according to tidal cycles and the amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
freshwater inflow. Despite this tremendously variable environment, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
historical Estuary probably offered relatively constant suitable habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions to delta smelt, which could move upstream or downstream with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the mixing zone (Peter Moyle, University of California, pers. comm., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1993). Since the 1850's, however, the amount and extent of suitable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat for the delta smelt has declined dramatically. The advent in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1853 of hydraulic mining in the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers led to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increased siltation and alteration of the circulation patterns of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Estuary (Nichols 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1986, Monroe and Kelly 1992). The reclamation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Merritt Island for agricultural purposes in the same year marked the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beginning of the present-day cumulative loss of 94 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Estuary's tidal marshes (Nichols 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1986, Monroe and Kelly 1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to this degradation and loss of estuarine habitat, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delta smelt has been increasingly subject to entrainment, upstream or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reverse flows of waters in the Delta and San Joaquin River, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constriction of habitat in the less productive, deep-water river 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
channels of the Delta (Moyle 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1992). These adverse conditions are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
primarily a result of the steadily increasing proportion of water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diverted from the Delta by the Federal and State water projects (Monroe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Kelly 1992). Water delivery through the Federal Central Valley 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Project (CVP) began in water year 1940. The State Water Project (SWP) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
began delivering water in 1968. However, the proportion of fresh water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being diverted has increased since 1983 and has remained at high levels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Moyle 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1992). A relationship has been found between the number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of juvenile delta smelt salvaged at the State and Federal pumps and both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the percent of inflow diverted and total Delta outflow (California 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department of Water Resources and Bureau of Reclamation 1994). The high 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proportion of fresh water exported has exacerbated the already harsh 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental conditions experienced by the delta smelt during the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recent 6-year drought (1987&hyph;1992). The March 5, 1993 (58 FR 12854), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rule listing the delta smelt as a threatened species describes in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detail the factors that have led to this species' decline.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the January 6, 1989 (54 FR 554), Animal Notice of Review, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service included the delta smelt as a category 1 candidate species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Category 1 includes species for which data in the Service's possession 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are sufficient to support proposals for listing. On June 29, 1990, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service received a petition dated June 26, 1990, from Dr. Don C. Erman, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
President-Elect of the California-Nevada Chapter of the American 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fisheries Society, to list the delta smelt as an endangered species and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designate its critical habitat. The Service made a 90-day finding that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial information had been presented indicating that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petitioned action may be warranted and announced this decision in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 24, 1990 (55 FR 52852). On October 3, 1991 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(56 FR 50075), the Service published a proposal to list the delta smelt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a threatened species and to designate critical habitat. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule constituted the 12-month petition finding in accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Critical habitat was proposed for areas of all water and all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submerged lands below ordinary high water and the entire water column 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bounded by and contained within Suisun Bay (including the contiguous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Grizzly and Honker Bays), the length of Montezuma Slough, portions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Sacramento River, portions of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portions of the San Joaquin River, and the contiguous water bodies in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between (a complex of bays, dead-end sloughs, channels typically less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than four meters deep, marshlands, etc.), contained in the State of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
California. The public comment period opened on the date of publication 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the proposed rule (October 3, 1991) and closed on January 31, 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 19, 1991 (56 FR 65877), the Service published a notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of public hearing on the proposed rule to be held in three locations in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
California. Public hearings were conducted on January 9, 1992, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sacramento; on January 14, 1992, in Santa Monica; and on January 16, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1992, in Visalia.

The final rule listing the delta smelt as a threatened species was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published on March 5, 1993 (58 FR 12854). In the final rule, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service postponed the decision on critical habitat designation. At that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time, the economic analysis necessary to determine critical habitat was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
still in progress. On March 16, 1993 (58 FR 14199), the Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reopened the public comment period until April 30, 1993, to allow the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service to consider any economic or biological information that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously had not been submitted.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service published a revision to the October 3, 1991, proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule to designate critical habitat for the delta smelt on January 6, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1994 (59 FR 852). The revision was based primarily on information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gathered by the California Department of Fish and Game (Dale Sweetnam, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
California Department of Fish and Game, pers. comm., 1993) and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
University of California, Davis (Lesa Meng, U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service pers. comm., 1993). This information showed that in 1993, delta 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smelt spawned in the Sacramento River, at least as far upstream as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
City of Sacramento and in tidally-influenced shallow freshwater sloughs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Dale Sweetnam, pers. comm., 1993). In 1991, when delta smelt had all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but disappeared from Suisun Marsh, relatively large numbers of delta 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smelt were caught in Suisun Slough, as far upstream as Suisun City (Lesa 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Meng, pers. comm., 1993). The revised rule proposed to expand the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
geographic extent of critical habitat to include additional areas now 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
known to constitute important spawning habitat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, in an April 23, 1993, letter received during the public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment period, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requested that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new scientific information presented in its draft proposed Bay/Delta 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water quality standards be considered in the Service's designation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical habitat. The water quality standards were to apply to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surface waters of the Sacramento River, San Joaquin River, and San 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Francisco Bay and Delta of the State of California (Bay/Delta) pursuant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to section 303 of the Clean Water Act (CWA). As a result of EPA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis respecting the number of days that low-salinity water was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
historically located at three locations in the Estuary, the Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refined the description of the constituent elements for the delta smelt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed critical habitat was revised therefore to encompass 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upstream spawning habitats and to better define constituent elements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to protect those areas essential to the recovery of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species. Comment on the revised proposal and its draft economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis was solicited. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the same date that the Service published its revised critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat rule, the Service proposed the Sacramento splittail 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pogonichthys macrolepidotus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) as a threatened species and EPA published 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its proposed rule to establish water quality standards for surface 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waters of the Sacramento River, San Joaquin River, and San Francisco Bay 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Delta pursuant to section 303 of the CWA. Those water quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards are meant to protect the estuary as a whole, and therefore 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contain more than the salinity criterion. EPA's water quality proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also includes salmon smolt survival criteria to protect fish migration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and cold freshwater habitat designated uses in the estuary in its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
January 6, 1994, rule, along with proposed striped bass spawning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Designation of critical habitat at this time is part of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coordinated effort between the Service, EPA, National Marine Fisheries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service (NMFS), and the Bureau of Reclamation (Bureau) (collectively, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Club Fed'') to protect and recover the delta smelt and the Estuary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ecosystem.

Relationship Between Fish and Wildlife Service and EPA Actions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service and EPA recognized that their proposed regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions (e.g., delta smelt critical habitat and EPA's water quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards) overlapped biologically and economically. As such, both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies worked closely to provide a comprehensive, ecosystem-based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approach for the protection of the fish and wildlife resources of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Estuary. This coordination has resulted in regulatory actions that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
integrated in both substance and timing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Biologically, the critical habitat designation for the delta smelt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the salinity criteria within EPA's water quality standards are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directly related. Specifically, salinities of 2 ppt in Suisun Bay were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified as a primary constituent element in the October 3, 1991, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical habitat proposal. Subsequent scientific publications indicate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that salinities associated with the distribution of delta smelt may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide the best basis for setting standards for many species that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected by freshwater discharge from the Estuary (Moyle 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1992; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
San Francisco Estuary Project 1993). Favorable conditions from February 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through June are important to the abundance and reproductive success of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
almost all species that live in or migrate through the upper Estuary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because EPA's water quality standards address the location of 2 ppt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
salinities from February to June, its standards will address certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical habitat (water quality) requirements for delta smelt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the text of the January, 6, 1994, proposed rule to designate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical habitat for the delta smelt, the Service identified specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
salinity criteria required to maintain habitat for delta smelt through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its entire life cycle. These criteria had been determined in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coordination with EPA in preparation of its proposed water quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards. Subsequent to publication of the critical habitat proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule, the Service received many comments objecting to the specificity of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the salinity criteria. During numerous discussions with interested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parties (and in the following response to comments), Service staff have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
explained that the detailed discussion within the text of the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule was meant to clearly describe the need for including a water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality criterion specific to salinity as one primary constituent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
element. The actual regulation that was proposed for publication in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Code of Federal Regulations, however, was much less specific as to allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
broad flexibility in implementation of the provisions of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, to clarify the Service's intent to preserve the flexibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inherent in implementation of the section 7 regulations, the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussion of the primary constituent elements necessary to define delta 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smelt critical habitat, is general in scope. However, the Service has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coordinated carefully and extensively with EPA to ensure that EPA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rule promulgating Water Quality Standards for Surface Waters of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Sacramento River, San Joaquin River, and San Francisco Bay and Delta 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the State of California affords sufficient protection to further the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery of the delta smelt. EPA's final rule is published in this same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, in a separate part. In its proposed rule, EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested that specific comments be submitted on several issues, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including the possibility of modifying the Sacramento River Index for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the purposes of developing the salinity criteria, alternative approaches 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the averaging period used in its proposed salinity criteria, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluation of the merits of the use of different forms of confidence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intervals with the proposed criteria. In developing this final rule, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Service has considered all such comments. These issues also were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussed with EPA in regard to the development of its water quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards and the Service's section 7 consultation with EPA on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promulgation of these standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 7 of the Act requires that all Federal agencies ensure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their actions do not jeopardize the continued existence of listed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species or adversely modify designated critical habitat. EPA's action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in promulgating water quality standards must comply with the section 7 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consultation requirement.

Critical habitat is defined in section 3(5)(A) of the Act as ``(i) the specific areas within the geographical area
occupied by the species at the time it is listed *&blank;*&blank;* on which are found those physical or biological
features (I) essential to the conservation of the species and (II) which may require special management considerations
or protection; and (ii) specific areas outside the geographical area occupied by the species at the time it is listed
*&blank;*&blank;* upon a determination *&blank;*&blank;* that such areas are essential for the conservation of
the species.'' The term ``conservation'', as defined in section 3(3) of the Act, means ``*&blank;*&blank;* to use
and the use of all methods and procedures which are necessary to bring an endangered species or threatened species
to the point at which the measures provided pursuant to this Act are no longer necessary.'' With recovery, no protection
from the Act is necessary. Therefore, areas designated as critical habitat must contain those physical or biological
features essential to recover a species to the point that it no longer requires protection under the Act and can be removed
from the list of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
endangered and threatened species. Section 3(c) further states that in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most cases the entire range of a species should not be encompassed within critical habitat. Areas outside the present
geographic range may be included as critical habitat if a species' present range would be inadequate to ensure conservation
of the species.

Role in Species Conservation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Use of the term ``conservation'' in the definition of critical habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicates that its designation should identify areas that may be needed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for a species' recovery and delisting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The designation of critical habitat will not, in itself, lead to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery, but is one of several measures available to contribute to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species' recovery. Critical habitat helps focus conservation activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by identifying areas that contain essential habitat features (primary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constituent elements) regardless of whether or not they are currently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occupied by the listed species, thus alerting the public to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importance of an area in the conservation of a listed species. Critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat also identifies areas that may require special management or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection. Critical habitat receives protection under section 7 of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act with regard to actions carried out, funded, or authorized by Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies. Section 7 requires that Federal agencies consult on actions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that may affect critical habitat to ensure that their actions are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
likely to destroy or adversely modify critical habitat. This additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection to a species' habitat may actually shorten the time needed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieve recovery. Aside from this added protection provided by section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7, the Act does not provide other direct forms of protection to lands 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designated as critical habitat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Designating critical habitat does not create a management plan, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establish numerical population goals, prescribe specific management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions (inside or out of critical habitat), nor does it have a direct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect on areas not designated as critical habitat. Specific management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommendations for critical habitat are more appropriately addressed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery plans, management plans, and section 7 consultations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Critical habitat identifies specific areas essential to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conservation of a species. Areas with one or more essential features 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but not currently containing all of the features and areas having the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capability to provide essential features in the future, may be required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the long-term recovery of the species. This may be so particularly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in certain portions of its range. However, not all areas containing all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
features of a listed species' habitat are necessarily essential to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species' recovery. Areas not included in critical habitat that contain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one or more of the essential elements are still important to a species' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conservation and may be addressed under other facets of the Act and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other conservation laws and regulations. All designated areas also may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be of considerable value in maintaining ecosystem integrity and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supporting other species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Designation of critical habitat may be reevaluated and revised, at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any time, when new information indicates that changes are warranted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service may revise critical habitat if management plans, recovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plans, or other conservation strategies are developed and fully 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implemented, reducing the need for the additional protection provided by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical habitat designation. For example, after the draft Delta Native 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fishes Recovery Plan (Recovery Plan) is finalized or the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promulgates more protective water quality standards for the Estuary than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are currently in place, land and water management agencies may provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increased protection for the delta smelt. If these protection measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are implemented, the Service may revise its critical habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designation.

Primary Constituent Elements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In determining which areas to designate as critical habitat, the Service considers those physical and biological
features that are essential to a species' conservation (50 CFR 424.12(b)). The Service is required to list the known
primary constituent elements together with a description of any critical habitat that is proposed. Such physical
and biological features (i.e., primary constituent elements) include, but are not limited to, the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Space for individual and population growth, and for normal behavior;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Food, water, air, light, minerals, or other nutritional or physiological requirements;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Cover or shelter;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Sites for breeding, reproduction, rearing of offspring, germination, or seed dispersal; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Generally, habitats that are protected from disturbance or are representative of the historic geographical
and ecological distributions of a species.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The primary constituent elements essential to the conservation of the delta smelt are physical habitat, water, river
flow, and salinity concentrations required to maintain delta smelt habitat for spawning, larval and juvenile transport,
rearing, and adult migration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The primary constituent elements are organized by habitat conditions required for each life stage. The specific
geographic areas and seasons identified for each habitat condition represent the maximum possible range of each
of these conditions. Depending on the water-year type (i.e., wet, above normal, normal, below normal, dry, critically
dry), each of the habitat conditions specified below requires fluctuation (within-year and between-year) in the
placement of the 2 ppt isohaline (a line drawn to connect all points of equal salinity) around three historical reference
points. These three historical reference points are the Sacramento-San Joaquin River confluence, the upstream
limit of Suisun Bay at Chipps Island, and in the middle of Suisun Bay at Roe Island. The actual number of days that the
2 ppt isohaline is maintained at the three points varies according to water-year type.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, to maintain habitat conditions necessary to achieve recovery of the delta smelt, the number of days at
each reference point must simulate a level of water project development equivalent to that which historically existed
in 1968. A 1968 level of development represents a period of time before Delta outflow was affected by the SWP and the
delta smelt was abundant. This year (1968) falls within the time period identified by the Delta Native Fishes Recovery
Team as having had appropriate hydrologic conditions that would allow recovery of the delta smelt. Additionally,
on June 15, 1994, the Regional Director signed an Interagency Statement of Principles among the Service, NMFS, and
EPA (Plenert, Fullerton, and Seraydarian, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1994) stating, in part, despite the effects of the water projects that were operating at that time, the Estuary ecosystem
and its anadromous and resident fisheries were relatively healthy during the years between 1960 and 1970.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, to maintain suitable habitat conditions for recovery of the delta smelt, the naturally-occurring variability
found in healthy estuarine ecosystems must be preserved for the following reasons_(1) temporal and spatial variability
of the 2 ppt isohaline will be the most effective deterrent to further invasion of newly introduced species and continued
competition by those that are already established, (2) placement of the 2 ppt isohaline in Suisun Bay will produce
the high phytoplankton and zooplankton densities that characterize most healthy estuarine ecosystems, and (3)
variability is needed to simulate natural processes and historical conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The primary constituent elements for the delta smelt are:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Spawning Habitat
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_Delta smelt adults seek shallow, fresh or slightly brackish backwater sloughs and edgewaters for spawning. To ensure
egg hatching and larval viability, spawning areas also must provide suitable water quality (i.e., low concentrations
of pollutants) and substrates for egg attachment (e.g., submerged tree roots and branches and emergent vegetation).
Specific areas that have been identified as important delta smelt spawning habitat include Barker, Lindsey, Cache,
Prospect, Georgiana, Beaver, Hog, and Sycamore sloughs and the Sacramento River in the Delta, and tributaries of
northern Suisun Bay. The spawning season varies from year to year and may start as early as December and extend until
July.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Larval and Juvenile Transport
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_To ensure that delta smelt larvae are transported from the area where they are hatched to shallow, productive rearing
or nursery habitat, the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers and their tributary channels must be protected from physical
disturbance (e.g., sand and gravel mining, diking, dredging, and levee or bank protection and maintenance) and flow
disruption (e.g., water diversions that result in entrainment and in-channel barriers or tidal gates). Adequate
river flow is necessary to transport larvae from upstream spawning areas to rearing habitat in Suisun Bay. Additionally,
river flow must be adequate to prevent interception of larval transport by the State and Federal water projects and
smaller agricultural diversions in the Delta. To ensure that suitable rearing habitat is available in Suisun Bay,
the 2 ppt isohaline must be located westward of the Sacramento-San Joaquin River confluence during the period when
larvae or juveniles are being transported, according to the historical salinity conditions which vary according
to water-year type. Reverse flows that maintain larvae upstream in deep-channel regions of low productivity and
expose them to entrainment interfere with these transport requirements. Suitable water quality must be provided
so that maturation is not impaired by pollutant concentrations. The specific geographic area important for larval
transport is confined to waters contained within the legal boundary of the Delta, Suisun Bay, and Montezuma Slough
and its tributaries. The specific season when habitat conditions identified above are important for successful
larval transport varies from year to year, depending on when peak spawning occurs and on the water-year type. The Service
identified situations in the biological opinion for the delta smelt (1994) where additional flows might be required
in the July&hyph;August period to protect delta smelt that were present in the south and central Delta from being entrained
in the State and Federal project pumps, and to avoid jeopardy to the species. The long-term biological opinion on CVP&hyph;SWP
operations will identify situations where additional flows may be required after the February through June period
identified by EPA for its water quality standards to protect delta smelt in the south and central Delta.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Rearing Habitat
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_Maintenance of the 2 ppt isohaline according to the historical salinity conditions described above and suitable
water quality (low concentrations of pollutants) within the Estuary is necessary to provide delta smelt larvae and
juveniles a shallow, protective, food-rich environment in which to mature to adulthood. This placement of the 2 ppt
isohaline also serves to protect larval, juvenile, and adult delta smelt from entrainment in the State and Federal
water projects. An area extending eastward from Carquinez Strait, including Suisun Bay, Grizzly Bay, Honker Bay,
Montezuma Slough and its tributary sloughs, up the Sacramento River to its confluence with Three Mile Slough, and
south along the San Joaquin River including Big Break, defines the specific geographic area critical to the maintenance
of suitable rearing habitat. Three Mile Slough represents the approximate location of the most upstream extent of
tidal excursion when the historical salinity conditions described above are implemented. Protection of rearing
habitat conditions may be required from the beginning of February through the summer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Adult Migration
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_Adult delta smelt must be provided unrestricted access to suitable spawning habitat in a period that may extend from
December to July. Adequate flow and suitable water quality may need to be maintained to attract migrating adults in
the Sacramento and San Joaquin River channels and their associated tributaries, including Cache and Montezuma sloughs
and their tributaries. These areas also should be protected from physical disturbance and flow disruption during
migratory periods.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To conserve the delta smelt, this final rule designates critical habitat in an area encompassing the specific habitat
conditions required by each life stage identified above. Accordingly, critical habitat is designated in the following
geographic area_areas of all water and all submerged lands below ordinary high water and the entire water column bounded
by and contained in Suisun Bay (including the contiguous Grizzly and Honker Bays); the length of Goodyear, Suisun,
Cutoff, First Mallard (Spring Branch), and Montezuma sloughs; and the existing contiguous waters contained within
the Delta. Thus, critical habitat for the delta smelt is contained within Contra Costa, Sacramento, San Joaquin,
Solano, and Yolo Counties, California. The ``Regulation Promulgation'' section provides a precise metes and bounds
description of critical habitat designated for the delta smelt.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since publication of the revised proposed rule, the Service has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined through section 7 consultations that the South Delta 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Temporary Barriers Project, deep water navigation channel dredging, Los 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Vaqueros Reservoir Project, and Phase 2 of the Coastal Aqueduct Project 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not jeopardize the delta smelt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule to revise the critical habitat designation did not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identify any proposed actions that might jeopardize the delta smelt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without adversely affecting critical habitat. In the revised proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule, the Service did identify (based on section 7 consultation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experiences) five activities that, depending on the season of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
construction and scale of the project, might result in the destruction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or adverse modification of critical habitat without necessarily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jeopardizing the continued existence of the delta smelt. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities were:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Sand and gravel extraction in river channels or marshes; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Diking wetlands for conversion to farmland and dredging to maintain these dikes; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Levee maintenance and bank-protection activities, such as riprapping, removal of vegetation, and placement
of dredged materials on levees of banks; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Operation of the Montezuma Slough Control Structure; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Bridge and marina construction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Construction and implementation of each of these five actions requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorization by the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) pursuant to section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 and section 404 of the CWA and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore are considered Federal actions. In a section 7 consultation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the Bureau and the California Department of Fish and Game, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
California Department of Water Resources (DWR), the Service reviewed the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation of the Montezuma Slough Control Structure for effects on delta 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smelt. As a result, DWR and the Bureau sponsored an investigation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the effects of the operation of the Structure on delta smelt, and DWR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
committed to operate the gates only as required to meet existing Suisun 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Marsh salinity standards. When not operating, the gates on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Structure will remain in the raised position. The effect of gate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation on delta smelt is currently being studied, and the Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will make a determination on the Structure's operations in the near 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
future. As to the other actions, the Service will consult with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Corps as these actions arise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On February 4, 1994, subsequent to the publication of the January 6, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1994, revised proposed rule to designate critical habitat, the Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transmitted to the Bureau a jeopardy biological opinion on the combined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation of the Federal and State Water Projects on the delta smelt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through February 1995. In the 1994 biological opinion, the Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined that the proposed operation of the Federal and State Water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Projects likely would jeopardize the continued existence of the delta 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smelt and would destroy or adversely modify proposed critical habitat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This one-year opinion did not recommend a reasonable and prudent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative that distinguished between the number of days of compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the 2 ppt criteria to avoid jeopardy and the number of days of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance that would have been required to avoid destruction or adverse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modification of proposed critical habitat. The Service acknowledges 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that such a distinction may be appropriate in future biological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opinions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any possible revisions to the biological opinion will recognize 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
three major initiatives that will shape the dynamics of future estuarine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions for delta smelt. First, in accordance with a Framework 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agreement (1994) between the Governor's Water Policy Council of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State of California (Council) and Club Fed, the State Board will seek 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement with DWR and the U.S. Department of the Interior to operate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the SWP and CVP to make an equitable contribution to meeting the revised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water quality standards beginning calendar year 1995. The Board will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seek this agreement while they are working on a water rights decision to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocate responsibility among water rights holders in the Bay-Delta 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
watershed. Second, section 7(a)(1) of the Act imposes an affirmative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obligation on Federal agencies to carry out programs for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conservation (recovery) of listed species. With the forthcoming 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issuance of a Delta Native Fishes Recovery Plan, currently in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparation, the Service expects that local, State, and Federal agencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will fulfill their responsibilities by assisting in the completion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tasks and objectives in the plan. Third, and related to number two, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scheduled renewal of water contracts (i.e., reopened or expired Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) licenses, expired CVP water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contracts) will provide an additional opportunity under sections 7(a)(1) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 7(a)(2) of the Act to implement Recovery Plan objectives and meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's water quality standards. Collectively, these initiatives likely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will result in a phased improvement to water quality based habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for the delta smelt. Accordingly, the Service anticipates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that adverse modification or destruction of critical habitat will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
avoided by operation of the CVP, SWP, and other water management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities with implementation of the above described initiatives.

Consideration of Economic and Other Factors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4(b)(2) of the Act requires the Service to consider economic and other relevant impacts of specifying any
particular area to be included within the critical habitat boundary. EPA, in coordination with the Service, included
an analysis of the effects of designation of critical habitat for the delta smelt in its draft Regulatory Impact Assessment
(RIA) for its proposed water quality standards. A summary of that analysis was provided in the revised proposed rule
designating critical habitat for the delta smelt (59 FR 852). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service stated in the revised proposed rule that if the final economic analysis substantially differed from the
draft analysis summarized in the revised proposed rule, a revised analysis would be made available for public comment.
No opportunity for public comment was afforded because the results of the final economic analysis do not substantially
differ from the results of the draft analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's economic analysis assumes that the economic impact of restricting activities associated with construction
and implementation of major water projects would be attributable to the jeopardy standard imposed by listing the
delta smelt as a threatened species, as opposed to designation of critical habitat. Specifically, the impacts of
designating critical habitat are in addition to the economic and other impacts attributable to (1) listing of the
species, (2) economic effects resulting from conservation actions taken by other Federal agencies under section
7(a)(1) of the Act, and (3) regulatory actions required by other laws.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 9 of the Act and Service regulations prohibit the taking of delta smelt without express authorization from
the Service. Under Service regulations, ``take'' may include significant habitat modification or degradation
that actually kills or injures protected species. In addition, Federal agencies must consult with the Service to
ensure that their actions are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the listed species. An action could
jeopardize the existence of a listed species if it destroys or modifies its habitat. This is so regardless of whether
that habitat has been designated as critical habitat. Therefore, the direct economic and other impacts resulting
from designation of critical habitat are relatively small because the Act provides substantial protection to habitat
through listing of the species itself. In general, designation of critical habitat supplements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the protection afforded a listed species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The RIA concluded that economic costs attributable to the designation of critical habitat for the delta smelt would
be relatively small. In the revised proposed rule, the Service determined that economic costs would be attributable
to five actions (i.e., sand and gravel extraction, diking wetlands, levee maintenance and bank protection activities,
operation of the Montezuma Slough Control Structure, and bridge and marine construction). In the final RIA prepared
by EPA (EPA 1994), the economic costs attributable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designation were from the same five actions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A synopsis of the economic impacts associated with the five activities identified by the Service includes: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sand and Gravel Operations
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_Four aggregate operators in the delta may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be affected by the designation of critical habitat. Two of the aggregate operations in the Delta are located in San
Joaquin County, which has a total of eleven aggregate sites. The estimated value of aggregate production for San Joaquin
County in 1986 was $13 million. The four aggregate operations in the Delta that could be affected by the regulation
produced a small percentage of California's aggregate in 1992, which had a total value of $473 million. The economic
impacts on the aggregate production industry resulting from the designation of critical habitat likely will be minor,
given the relatively small amount of sand and gravel production occurring in the Delta. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In many cases, minor changes to the timing of extraction to avoid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sensitive biological periods will minimize the economic effects on mining activities. Mitigation in the form of
habitat replacement might be required for operations that may result in the destruction or adverse modification
of critical habitat. Costs to restore 1 acre of wetlands range between $10,000 to $50,000. Mitigation costs could
be reduced if low-cost lands were acquired, and levees were breached to flood areas. For some tracts of land, the costs
associated with restoring wetlands may exceed the value derived from the agricultural activity, in which case the
cost attributable to critical habitat would be the loss in agricultural income.

Diking and Dredging for Agricultural Operations
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_Though designation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of critical habitat for the delta smelt may require implementation of best management practices and a 3:1 ratio of
permanently destroyed habitat in proposed project areas, the economic impacts of restricting diking and dredging
operations are expected to be minimal. For example, the regulatory costs (i.e., with critical habitat designated)
associated with converting the Little Holland Tract in the Delta to agricultural uses with critical habitat designated
would be the cost to replace 440 acres of habitat at a 3:1 ratio (EPA 1994). The expense of replacing habitat would likely
exceed the economic returns from agricultural production on this tract, which was historically planted for corn.
Foregone income from future agricultural production on the 1,300 arable acre tract would amount to $65,000 per year.

Levee Maintenance
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_Between 1981&hyph;1991, local agencies maintained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
536.6 miles of levee in the Delta, spending an average of $1.24 million 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
per mile (EPA 1994). Approximately 41% of the costs were financed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through State subventions. The costs of levee maintenance are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected to increase significantly due to this critical habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designation because Federal regulatory agencies currently have timing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and construction restrictions that generally avoid adverse effects to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the delta smelt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_The economic impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with the operation of the Montezuma Slough Control Structure could not be estimated by the time this final
rule was published. In response to a biological opinion issued by the USFWS to DWR and the Bureau on the Structure's
operation, an investigation of the effects of the Structure on delta smelt is being conducted, and will be completed
in the near future. The Structure's operations may be modified once the study is completed. The gates at this structure
are currently operated from November to March in accordance with current State salinity standards to maintain low-salinity
water in Suisun Marsh, but remain open the remainder of the year.

_The use of best management practices, time restrictions, and other construction restrictions similar to those
for levee maintenance and sand and gravel operations should preclude any substantial impact from designation of
delta smelt critical habitat on bridge and marina construction.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA's economic analysis evaluated the costs associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementing its water quality standards for the Bay/Delta. Since the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service identifies water quality (salinity) as a primary constituent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
element essential to conserve the delta smelt, an analysis of the water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs associated with implementing the salinity standards is included in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this final rule. Though the water costs associated with the water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality standards are attributable to EPA, the Service includes this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussion to make clear the approximate cost of implementing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
salinity standards alone. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The water costs associated with the salinity standards and fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
migration standards are reported in EPA's final RIA (EPA 1994). EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reports the water costs as the sum of costs associated with the salinity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards and fish migration standards. However, depending on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hydrologic conditions, approximately 35% to 73% of the water costs in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the EPA economic analysis can be attributed to the salinity criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alone, apart from the fish migration criteria (EPA 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The overall estimated water supply impacts of both the salinity and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fish migration water quality standards (change in total exports) over 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those associated with existing D&hyph;1485 State salinity standards and water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality requirements for winter-run chinook salmon under a NMFS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
biological opinion are 376 thousand acre-feet (taf) per year on average, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 577 taf during critically dry periods. However, the State's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation plan for EPA's water quality standards will substantially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affect the magnitude and distribution of the costs associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementing the water quality standards. A more detailed discussion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the water costs associated with different implementation scenarios 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appears in the final RIA (EPA 1994).

National Economic Costs

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Actions taken to preserve and recover threatened and endangered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species may result in the re-allocation of resources within the regional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and national economy. National economic costs, best described as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiency costs, include changes in the consumer and producer surplus, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and related employment impacts. These measures capture the net social 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gains and losses resulting from the resource allocation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The national economic cost of the five activities evaluated above 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(sand and gravel extraction, diking wetlands, levee maintenance and bank 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection activities, operation of the Montezuma Slough Control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Structure, and bridge and marina construction) is minimal since the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overall economic cost of those activities in the region is minimal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's economic analysis used the above described measures to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimate the costs and benefits of the water quality standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the results of EPA's economic analysis is identical to an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis done for national economic costs.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Conservation of the delta smelt with designation of its critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat will result in a wide range of benefits. Section 2(a)(3) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act recognizes that fish, wildlife, and plants are of aesthetic, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ecological, educational, historical, recreational, and scientific value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the Nation and its people. EPA (1994) categorizes the benefits of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promulgating water quality standards and designating critical habitat as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use, nonuse, and other benefits. A more detailed description of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uses are contained in the final RIA (EPA 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several use and nonuse benefits can be attributed to designating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical habitat for the delta smelt, apart from benefits attributable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to EPA's water quality standards. Generally, the designation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical habitat will prevent the further decline of estuarine health. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Benefits include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Reduced need in the future to list fish and wildlife species 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently in decline; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Increased biological production of commercially important 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species, such as waterfowl and salmon; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Increased protection to a wide variety of estuarine species, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
several of which are unique to the Estuary (e.g., winter-run chinook 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
salmon, Estuary population of longfin smelt, and Sacramento 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
splittail); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Curtailed establishment of newly introduced exotic species and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deterred explosion of the current population of already established 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exotic species; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Increased recreational fishing and hunting opportunities;

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(6) Increased opportunities for wildlife observation resulting from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restoration of riparian and tidal marsh habitat and ecosystem 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Improved commercial fishery harvest as a result of increased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
populations of fish. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA (1994) assigned a monetary value to several of the use benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The economic benefits of EPA's standards are broader than protection of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the delta smelt, since EPA's standards are expected to positively affect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all components of the food web. The total economic benefit of EPA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water quality standards and the designation of critical habitat for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delta smelt are reported as follows. The ecological benefits of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improved estuarine conditions are expected to generate at least $2.1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
million or more in net economic benefits to commercial and recreational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fisheries (particular salmon fisheries), and will have an associated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employment gain of approximately 145 full-time equivalent jobs (EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1994). Benefits to the ocean sport fishery for salmon is estimated at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about $708,000 annually (EPA 1994). This increase would result in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
positive employment effects on sport fishing-related industry, adding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately 70 jobs in this area. Annual benefits to the striped bass 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sport fishing industry is estimated to be $57,500 annually (EPA 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An important avoided cost is associated with further declines in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the recreational and commercial fisheries industry of the Bay/Delta, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which is valued at $200 million annually (EPA 1994). Other avoided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs include government costs associated with crop deficiency payments, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agricultural drainage costs, and costs associated with the potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction in property value.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to determine the specific extent of designation of critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat pursuant to section 4(b)(2) of the Act, the Service must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyze: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The benefits of excluding an area as critical habitat, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The benefits of including an area, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The effects of exclusions on the probability of species 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extinction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This process consists of (1) estimating the benefits of retaining or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excluding land and water areas contained within Suisun Bay or river 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reaches within the Delta and Montezuma, Goodyear, Suisun, Cutoff, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First Mallard (Spring Branch) sloughs; (2) weighing those benefits; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) determining if exclusion of an area or areas from critical habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will lead to the extinction of the species. If the exclusion of an area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or areas from critical habitat will result in eventual species 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extinction, then the exclusion would be prohibited under the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Extinction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Critical habitat consists of areas with habitat characteristics that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are essential to the conservation of a listed species. However, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclusion process focuses upon a threshold for species extinction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Conservation (recovery) and extinction are separate standards. Recovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and extinction are at opposite ends of a continuum, with the likelihood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a species' continued survival increasing the closer the species is to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the recovery end of the continuum. It may be more difficult to predict 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the point at which extinction would be inevitable than to determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where recovery may occur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The analysis to determine whether extinction will occur will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different for each species, depending on many variables, including a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species' geographic range. The exclusion analysis also may be related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to a number of factors, such as the number of individuals, amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat, condition of the habitat, and reproductive success. Extinction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of an annual species, like the delta smelt, most likely would occur when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rearing habitat conditions are poor enough for two consecutive years 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that some minimum number of fish fail to survive to reproduce. Habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions could become poor enough if pumping at Federal and State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water project facilities and private diversions significantly reduce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outflow from the Delta. If a sufficient number of delta smelt were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entrained in Federal and State water project facilities and private 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diversions so that a minimal number survived to reproduce, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population could decline. Extinction could result. The focus of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclusionary analysis was on those factors that pertain to these issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and included consideration of habitat condition, functioning of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Estuary ecosystem, and proximity of the delta smelt population to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal and State pumps during various life stages.

Criteria and Decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In evaluating the designation of critical habitat to determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether or not to exclude areas because of concerns over economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects, the Service used the following process: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Based upon the criteria described in this document, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
geographical area essential to the conservation of the species was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) An economic analysis was conducted to ascertain the anticipated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic consequences of designating areas as critical habitat, using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agricultural and urban sectors as the primary level of economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The Service balanced the costs and other impacts of designation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the benefits of designation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Exclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Using the above described process, the Service has determined that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no exclusions to critical habitat are appropriate. The entire 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
geographic area designated as critical habitat is essential to conserve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the delta smelt. Delta smelt are restricted to a limited geographic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area, and retaining land and water areas contained within Suisun Bay and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
river reaches within the Delta and Montezuma, Goodyear, Suisun, Cutoff, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and First Mallard (Spring Branch) sloughs is necessary to recover this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annual species. These areas provide habitat necessary for each life 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stage of the species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The economic consequences of designating the entire area as critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat are relatively small. Most economic costs can be avoided by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
project proponents by using timing and construction restrictions, and by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using best management practices. Designation of critical habitat will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduce the need in the future to list fish and wildlife species 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently in decline, and will improve the overall health of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Estuary. The benefits of designating the entire area outweigh the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefits of excluding any of the area from the designation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Available Conservation Measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the Act, as stated in section 2(b), is to provide a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
means to conserve the ecosystems upon which endangered and threatened 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species depend and to provide a program for the conservation of listed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species. Section 2(c)(1) of the Act declares that ''*&blank;*&blank;* all Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
departments and agencies shall seek to conserve endangered and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threatened species and shall utilize their authorities in furtherance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the purposes of this Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act mandates the conservation of listed species through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different mechanisms, such as: Section 7 (requiring Federal agencies to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further the purposes of the Act by carrying out conservation programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and insuring that Federal actions will not likely jeopardize the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continued existence of the listed species or result in the destruction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or adverse modification of critical habitat); section 9 (wildlife 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
research permits and habitat conservation planning on non-Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lands); section 6 (cooperative State and Federal grants), land 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acquisition, and research. Other Federal laws also require conservation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of endangered and threatened species, such as the National Forest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management Act and the National Environmental Policy Act, and various 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other State and Federal laws and regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Critical habitat is not intended as a management or conservation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan. Critical habitat is primarily intended to identify the habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that meets the criteria for the primary constituent elements. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there are benefits that result from the designation. Designation will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
help retain recovery options and reduce the near-term risk until a long-term conservation plan is implemented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Designation of critical habitat does not offer specific direction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for managing delta smelt habitat. That type of direction, as well as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any change in direction, will come through the administration of other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facets of the Act (e.g., section 7, section 10 HCP process, and recovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
planning). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Recovery Planning

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Recovery planning under section 4(f) of the Act is the ``umbrella''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that eventually guides all the Act's activities and promotes a species' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conservation and eventual delisting. Recovery plans provide guidance, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which may include population goals and identification of areas in need 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of protection or special management. Recovery plans usually include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management recommendations for areas proposed or designated as critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The delta smelt and six other fish species that depend on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Estuary for a significant segment of their life history are included in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Native Fishes Recovery Plan. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery plan is currently in draft form. The recovery plan will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include recovery criteria based on population abundance and geographic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution. Designation of critical habitat, along with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
biological opinion evaluating the effects of the Federal and State water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
projects on the delta smelt, is consistent with the plan's objective to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recover these fish species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 7(a)(2) of the Act requires Federal agencies to ensure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to destroy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or adversely modify critical habitat. This Federal responsibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accompanies, and is in addition to, the requirement in section 7(a)(2) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Act that Federal agencies ensure that their actions do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jeopardize the continued existence of any listed species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Jeopardy is defined at 50 CFR 402.02 as any action that would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected to appreciably reduce the likelihood of both the survival and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery of a species. Destruction or adverse modification of critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat defined at 50 CFR 402.02 as a direct or indirect alteration that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appreciably diminishes the value of critical habitat for both the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survival and recovery of a listed species. The regulations also clearly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
state that such alterations include, but are not limited to, alterations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adversely modifying any of those physical or biological features that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were the basis for determining the habitat to be critical. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Survival and recovery, mentioned in both the definition of adverse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modification and jeopardy, are directly related. Survival may be viewed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a linear continuum between recovery and extinction of the species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The closer one is to recovery, the greater the certainty in the species 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continued survival. The terms ``survival and recovery'' are, thus, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
related by the degree of certainty that the species will persist over a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
given period of time. Survival relates to viability. Factors that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
influence a species' viability include population numbers, distribution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
throughout the range, stochasticity, expected duration, and reproductive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
success. A species may be considered recovered when there is a high 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
degree of certainty for the species' continued viability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act's definition of critical habitat indicates that the purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of critical habitat is to contribute to a species' conservation, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by definition equates to recovery. Section 7 prohibitions against the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat apply to actions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that would impair survival and recovery of a listed species, thus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providing a regulatory means of ensuring that Federal actions within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical habitat are considered in relation to the goals and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommendations of a recovery plan. As a result of the link between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical habitat and recovery, the prohibition against destruction or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse modification of the critical habitat should provide for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection of the critical habitat's ability to contribute to a species' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Federal actions that may affect the delta smelt or its critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat include those authorized, carried out, or funded by the Corps, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department of the Navy, the Bureau, NMFS, FERC, the Service, and EPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Corps funds projects and issues permits for water pumping and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diversion facilities, levee construction or repair, bank protection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities, deep-water navigation channel dredging and dredge spoil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal projects, sand and gravel extraction, marina and bridge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
construction, diking of wetlands for conversion to farmland, and tidal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gate or barrier installation. The Corps also develops permits pursuant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to section 404 of the CWA to the Department of the Navy so the Navy may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dredge deep-water ship channels and dispose of dredge materials in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Suisun Bay, San Pablo Bay, and San Francisco Bay. The Corps also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducts such activities for the Navy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bureau and DWR construct, operate, and manage water export 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities. EPA reviews State water quality standards and promulgates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replacement standards, pursuant to the CWA, if the State standards are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found to be inadequate. FERC licenses water storage facilities on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tributaries to the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. In 1991, EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disapproved portions of the State Board's Water Quality Control Plan for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Salinity for the Estuary. Accordingly, EPA has prepared proposed and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finalized replacement standards for those portions of the State's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
salinity standards that were disapproved. Measures to protect the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
federally listed winter-run chinook salmon, for which NMFS has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jurisdiction under the Act, also may affect the delta smelt and may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require consultation with the Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service and the Bureau are jointly responsible for implementing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Central Valley Project Improvement Act (CVPIA). Activities under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the CVPIA include, but are not limited to, management of a portion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the CVP water supply dedicated for fish and wildlife protection, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restoration, and enhancement, acquisition of additional water supplies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the same purposes, and screening unscreened diversions in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sacramento-San Joaquin watershed. Both the Bureau and Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities under the CVPIA may affect delta smelt or its critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat, requiring consultation with the Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 4 of the Act, listing of the delta smelt provided a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement for the development of a recovery plan. The Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
convened the Delta Native Fishes Recovery Team to prepare a Recovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Plan for declining native fishes in the Estuary. The Recovery Plan, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently in draft form, will develop a framework for Federal, State, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and private entities to coordinate activities and cooperate with each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other in conservation efforts. The plan will set recovery priorities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and estimate the costs of various tasks necessary to accomplish recovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
goals. Site-specific management actions necessary to achieve survival 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and recovery of the delta smelt and other fishes native to the Estuary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ecosystem also will be described in this plan.

Summary of Comments and Recommendations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Designation of critical habitat for the delta smelt was first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed on October 3, 1991 (56 FR 50075), as part of the proposed rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to list the species. During the 4-month comment period following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
publication of the proposal, the Service received 360 written and oral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments from 348 individuals. Of the forty-four people who commented 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifically on critical habitat, thirty-four opposed and ten supported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the designation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 16, 1993 (58 FR 14199), the Service published a notice that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the public comment period on the original proposed critical habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designation for the delta smelt was reopened until April 30, 1993, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allow the Service to consider any information that previously had not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been submitted. In response, the Service received seven letters_two in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
support of critical habitat designation as proposed, four in opposition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and a letter from EPA requesting that the Service consider the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
biological and hydrological information described in EPA's draft 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule to promulgate Bay/Delta water quality standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On January 6, 1994 (59 FR 852), the Service revised the geographical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area and refined the primary constituent elements described in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
original critical habitat proposal. The public comment period for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revised proposed critical habitat designation was open from January 6, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1994, to March 7, 1994, and later extended to March 11, 1994 (59 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3829). During the 65-day comment period, the Service received written 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments from forty-three parties on both the critical habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designation and EPA's proposed water quality standards for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bay/Delta. Thirty-two commenters were opposed to critical habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designation, nine supported the decision, and two expressed no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preference. Several commenters either referenced or supported the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments of the California Urban Water Agencies (CUWA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four joint public hearings were held to solicit comments on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revised proposed critical habitat designation, the proposed threatened 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
status for the Sacramento splittail, and the proposed water quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards developed by EPA. A total of 125 people presented oral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testimony and submitted written comments at the hearings, primarily on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delta smelt critical habitat and Bay/Delta water quality standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issues. The Service received comments from elected officials, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interested persons, municipal and agricultural water districts and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associations, environmental organizations, business and industry owners 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and managers, fishing enthusiasts, farmers, agricultural commissions and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dairy interests, biologists, county and municipal officials, power 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency representatives, hospital and school district representatives, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and building industry spokespeople. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the February 23, 1994, hearing in Fresno, thirty-eight people 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presented oral testimony_thirty-six people opposed and two supported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical habitat designation. Nineteen people testified at the February 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
24, 1994, Sacramento meeting_fifteen people were opposed to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designation, three were in support, and one person was neutral. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Twelve people testified at the February 25, 1994, hearing in San 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Francisco_nine people supported and three opposed the critical habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designation. At the February 28, 1994, hearing in Irvine, fifty-six 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
people presented oral and written comments (fifty-one people testified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and five submitted only written comments)_fifty of the fifty-six 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters opposed critical habitat, five were neutral, and one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supported the designation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments addressing the issue of available scientific information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used to revise the proposed rule were addressed in the revised proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule of January 6, 1994 (59 FR 852). The Service addressed EPA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments, as well as comments provided by the State. All other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments are addressed below in this final rule. Because EPA can better 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respond to comments regarding the economic analysis and the assumptions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used to develop its Bay/Delta water quality standards, the Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refers to EPA's ``Response to Comments'' document for responses to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments specific to those issues. However, the Service will respond to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any comments regarding the relationship between EPA's water quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards and the biological requirements of the delta smelt in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section, and to comments regarding the economic analysis as it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with the critical habitat designation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are part of the administrative record and are available for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public review. Written comments and oral statements presented at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public hearings and received during the comment periods are covered in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the following summary. Comments of a similar nature or point are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grouped into a number of general issues. These issues, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service's response to each, are discussed below.

Comment 1: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter thought the Service should not adopt EPA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bay/Delta water quality standards as part of the designation of critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat for the delta smelt. The commenter asserted that because the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service had not described the biological relevance of the standards, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopting the standards would be ``throwing water at the problem''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter thought EPA's criteria were developed to serve non-habitat purposes, reasoning that their purpose
was to remove organisms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from risk of mortality at the pumps. Another commenter thought flow, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rather than salinity or the location of the entrapment zone, was a more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate parameter to protect the western Delta and Suisun Marsh. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter at the public hearings believed the Service should not have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selected such a strict standard of salinity (2 ppt) for the delta 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smelt's critical habitat.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service does not adopt EPA's water quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards in the designation of critical habitat for the delta smelt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service identifies water quality (salinity) as a primary constituent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
element to protect and recover the delta smelt. This point is described 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in detail in comment 27, below, and is clarified in the section entitled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Primary Constituent Elements'' in this final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has considered and discussed the biological relevance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's water quality standards. The biological relevance of providing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ample estuarine habitat for the delta smelt was first discussed in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
original proposed designation of critical habitat for the delta smelt in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1991. The biological significance of salinity in the Estuary was again 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussed in the sections entitled ``Revisions to the October 3, 1991, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Critical Habitat Proposal'', ``Habitat Requirements'', and ``Primary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Constituent Elements'' in the January 6, 1994, revised proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designation of critical habitat. These sections discuss the habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of the delta smelt, the need for temporal and spatial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variability of low-salinity waters in the Estuary, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identification of primary constituent elements essential for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery of the smelt.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As the above cited discussions illustrate, EPA's water quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards were developed to mimic historical habitat conditions and were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not developed to simply serve non-habitat purposes. The standards may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incidentally serve ``non-habitat'' purposes by removing organisms from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk of mortality at the pumps. This topic is discussed in this final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule in the ``Primary Constituent Element'' section for larval and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
juvenile transport.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requiring flows to maintain salinity at critical locations in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Delta will not be ``throwing water at the problem.'' The Service has used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the best scientific data available to prescribe conditions that will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilitate the recovery of the delta smelt, relying on scientific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence and testimony presented during the State Board's 1992 hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process, as well as information from the Service and the panel of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scientists who participated in the San Francisco Estuary Project (SFEP).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the Act and its regulations, the Service may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refer to either flow or salinity as water quality criteria when critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat is designated for the delta smelt. Because the Act is flexible, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Service may accomplish recovery in a variety of ways, so long as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listed species are recovered. With critical habitat defined, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service must identify the physical and biological features essential to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the conservation of the species, and which may require special 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management considerations or protection. A primary constituent element 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may include either water quality or water quantity. Special management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considerations include ``any methods or procedures useful in protecting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physical and biological features of the environment for the conservation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a listed species.'' (50 CFR 424.12(b); 424.02(j)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the best available information, the Service concludes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the criteria are necessary to protect and recover the delta smelt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Delta smelt are associated with the freshwater edge of the mixing zone, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where the salinity is approximately 2 ppt (Ganssle 1966, Moyle 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1992, Sweetnam and Stevens 1993). In most years, the majority of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delta smelt population lives at salinities of less than 2 ppt for most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the year (Moyle 1976, Ganssle 1966).

Comment 2: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although several water purveyors agreed with EPA that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there is a relationship between the average position of the 2 ppt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
isohaline and the health of the Estuary, they believed that the Roe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Island criterion was too protective and should be abolished. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
another commenter thought the water quality standards as proposed by EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were not protective enough of the delta smelt (addressed in comment 7). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters thought that requiring compliance at Roe Island may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) reduce the within-year variability in hydrology in Suisun Bay, thus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
having an adverse impact on the biology of the Estuary; (2) place the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entrapment zone too far downstream of Suisun Bay, thereby pushing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
phytoplankton and delta smelt out past Carquinez Strait into San Pablo 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bay; and (3) either greatly benefit or adversely affect native and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
introduced estuarine species by enhancing or adversely affecting habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quantity and quality.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To the extent feasible, maintenance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
near-historical water quality conditions at Roe Island is essential to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery of the delta smelt. Not only is it important to maintain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
low-salinity conditions at critical locations in the Estuary depending 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the life-stage of the delta smelt, but also to simulate year-to-year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
natural spring storm cycles so that natural processes and historical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions can be mimicked in the Estuary. The water quality standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developed by EPA, including criteria at Roe Island, Chipps Island, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Sacramento-San Joaquin River confluence, were developed to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both within-year and between-year variability in salinity levels, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characteristic of the Estuary in the late 1960's and early 1970's. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variability does not currently occur frequently enough in the Estuary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintain estuarine processes, because the construction of water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conveyance facilities in the Central Valley and Delta, as well as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation of diversions and upstream dams, have reduced and dampened 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annual fluctuations in Delta outflow.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A low-salinity reference point at Roe Island will provide within-year and year-to-year variability essential to
maintenance of a healthy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Estuary. Requiring salinity be maintained intermittently at Roe Island 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also will provide flows to carry juvenile fish from the Delta downstream 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to Suisun Bay, and will maximize nutrient inputs from Suisun Marsh and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the shallows of Suisun Bay into the mixing zone. Providing periodic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
low-salinity water at Roe Island will significantly increase the total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area of medium to low-salinity nursery habitat available for delta 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smelt. Spring storm events are also beneficial to aquatic resources of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Estuary, providing areas of flooded vegetation for the spawning of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some estuarine species.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, the 2 ppt isohaline is needed sporadically at Roe Island 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to mimic seasonal variability of Delta flow to deter the invasion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
introduced species. The lack of seasonal and yearly variability of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Delta outflows has contributed to the invasions of introduced species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because variable salinity is one of the dominant features of an estuary, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensuring natural variability in the Estuary can only benefit native 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estuarine species.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Providing low-salinity water at the Roe Island historical reference point will not put the mixing zone too far downstream
into the Carquinez Strait. Conversely, completely abolishing the Roe Island reference point and relying exclusively
on the Chipps Island and Sacramento-San Joaquin River confluence locations may leave an important area in the western-most
portion of Suisun Bay (which is included in critical habitat) outside the mixing zone (CCCWA/EDF 1987). The western
portion of Suisun Bay is important habitat for the delta smelt. Delta smelt were most abundant at the Western Suisun
Bay and Carquinez Strait sampling sites in the San Francisco Bay-Outflow Study in the years 1980&hyph;1988 (Stevens

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1990). Apart from the ship channel, the southwestern portion of Suisun Bay contains expansive shoal areas that are
less than 2 meters deep (Mortensen 1987). The best survival and growth of delta smelt larvae occur when optimum conditions
in the mixing zone occupy a large area that includes extensive shoal regions containing suitable rearing substrates
within the euphotic zone (depths less than 4 meters).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, because the Roe Island historic reference point was developed to mimic historical conditions in the Estuary,
requiring periodic low-saline waters at that location will not be an abnormal occurrence. Historically, delta smelt
have been flushed out into the Carquinez Strait and into Suisun Bay in high flow years, similar to what occurred in 1983
and 1993. The delta smelt is adapted to living in the Estuary, where salinity varies spatially and temporally according
to tidal cycles and the amount of freshwater inflow. Nonetheless, the historical Estuary probably offered relatively
constant suitable habitat conditions to delta smelt, which could move upstream or downstream with the entrapment
zone (Peter Moyle, University of California, pers. comm., 1993).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service does not believe EPA's Roe Island salinity criteria would be detrimental to native estuarine species.
A qualitative and graphic analysis of habitat preferences for Estuary species (including eggs and larvae, juveniles,
adults and spawning adults life stages) presented by a commenter which predicted that EPA's salinity criteria at
Roe Island would put some species at risk or greatly benefit others was overly broad and too simplistic. The commenter
included introduced species (e.g., inland silverside 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Menidia beryllina, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and marine species (e.g., several surfperches, English sole 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Parophrys vetulis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) in the analysis. Its analysis did not give any preference to species having protected status, or to species that rely
solely on estuarine habitat. Freshwater, marine and estuarine-dependent species were treated equally. The analysis
described habitat in terms of salinity alone, when other measures of habitat, such as temperature, turbidity, and
depth, are important for some estuarine-dependent species. Since the quantity of habitat available for a species
was described only by river kilometer, complex bathymetry was ignored in the investigation. The Service does not
intend to benefit or recover species outside the Estuary, nor does it intend to protect introduced estuarine species.
To comply with the Act, the Service must promote the recovery of the delta smelt. Impeding the establishment and success
of introduced species, and providing suitable habitat for delta smelt, are significant and complementary components
to recovering the species. The Service does not foresee a significant decline in other native estuarine species due
to critical habitat designation for the delta smelt. The Service expects the opposite to occur and has evaluated the
impacts of EPA's water quality standards through section 7 consultations.

Comment 3: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter thought the Roe Island criteria would not benefit the delta smelt because the relationship between
the 2 ppt isohaline location and the abundance indices of delta smelt become uncertain as the entrapment zone moves
downstream from Chipps Island.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Service Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service need not show statistical significance between the location of the mixing zone and fishery abundance
to include variable, low-salinity habitat as a primary constituent element. Under the Act, the Service must base
a critical habitat designation on the best scientific information available. A statistical correlation between
a primary constituent element and its effect on species recovery is not required. The complexity of the Delta ecosystem
and the numerous factors contributing in time and space to the species' decline make it highly unlikely that any one
factor would show a direct correlation with its potential recovery.

affect winter-run salmon temperature requirements.

 The Service is addressing, in recovery planning efforts and in section 7 consultations, the concern that compliance
with Roe Island criteria will cause reductions in carryover storage in upstream reservoirs. Recovery planning recommendations
for winter-run chinook salmon will be included in the delta smelt recovery plan process through coordination of the
respective recovery teams for these species. Section 7 consultations will address any competing needs for winter-run

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter thought that the State Water Project and the Central Valley Project reservoirs located upstream of
the Delta lacked the capacity to release enough controlled outflow to regulate salinity at Roe Island on a continuous
basis, when recreational safety, flooding, travel time and upstream riparian right constraints are taken into account.

Service Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Service notes the isohaline need not be located at Roe Island on a continuous basis, since EPA's Roe Island standard
is triggered only when uncontrolled runoff has placed the 2 ppt isohaline seaward of Roe Island. The SWP and CVP reservoirs
have the capacity to release outflow to meet the Roe Island criteria once the criteria are triggered.

 The Service addressed the concerns regarding data bias in the final rule to list the delta smelt as a threatened species
(58 FR 12856), noting that the Service is obliged under the Act to use the best available scientific and commercial
information in making a listing determination. The Service also must use the best available information in designating
critical habitat, and must take into consideration the economic impact, and any other relevant impact, of specifying
any particular area as critical habitat (section 4(b)(2)).

Comment 7:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter thought the salinity standards as proposed by the EPA were not protective enough of the delta smelt,
and recommended that_(1) additional days be added to the Roe Island standard in below normal to critically dry years
to buffer against years when storm flows or reservoir releases place the 2 ppt isohaline at Roe Island for the first
time late in the year, (2) a stipulation be added for an eleventh-hour invocation'' of the 2 ppt standard if it appears
that the 2 ppt requirement will fail to be invoked at all, and (3) the Service include a Middle Ground standard in addition
to the Roe Island standard, having the Middle Ground standard implemented independently of any type of trigger or
stipulation. The commenter thought water quality criteria at Middle Ground were necessary not only to provide rearing
habitat immediately west of Chipps Island (since habitat in that area is positively correlated with delta smelt abundance),
but also would allow delta smelt to access the expansive shoals of Grizzly Bay through Honker Bay. Another commenter
worried that simply reproducing historic habitat conditions would not be sufficient to recover the delta smelt.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Service Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Service believes that EPA's water quality standards, as proposed, will afford protection and promote recovery
of the delta smelt. Adding additional independent (i.e., no trigger) criteria at Middle Ground location (between
Roe Island and Chipps Island) would defeat the purpose of the Roe Island standard by dampening any variability in the
yearly pattern of outflow as discussed in the preceding response.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Use of the term ``conservation'' in the definition of critical habitat indicates that its designation should identify
areas that may be needed for a species' recovery and delisting. However, when critical habitat is designated at the
time a species is listed, the Service frequently does not know exactly what may be needed for recovery. In this regard,
critical habitat serves to preserve options for a species' eventual recovery. The Service will address the cause(s)
and remedies for delta smelt decline in the recovery planning process and in future section 7 consultations as new
information develops.

Comment 8:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter suggested a mechanism for phased compliance be developed for EPA's water quality standards. Another
commenter suggested that the standards be set aside in critically dry years until their exact utility in recovering
the delta smelt and the estuary is quantified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Service Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One of the purposes of designating critical habitat is to identify areas that may be needed for a species' recovery
and delisting so that options can be retained for the realization of this goal. The Service recognizes that the degradation
of delta smelt critical habitat has occurred over more than a century and that, as a result, it is unreasonable to expect
that recovery will be achieved in a relatively short timeframe. Please refer to ``The Effects of Critical Habitat''
section above for a detailed discussion on how the Framework Agreement (1994), the section 7(a)(1) mandate, and CVP
water contract renewals will, in essence, allow compliance with EPA's water quality standards to be phased in.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the Act does not permit the protections provided by critical habitat to be delayed in ways that may result
in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat, such as what may occur in drier water years. Having
threatened status under the Act means that the delta smelt is likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future
throughout all or a significant portion of its range. Designating critical habitat will facilitate the recovery
(i.e., delisting) of the delta smelt, rather than allowing the species to continue declining into endangered status.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Water quality (salinity) in the Estuary has been identified by the Service as a primary constituent element essential
to the conservation of the delta smelt. A significant modification to EPA's water quality standards, or a substantial
delay or break in designating critical habitat for the delta smelt, would not only postpone recovery of the species
but could adversely impact the species. The delta smelt's pelagic life history, dependence on pelagic microzooplankton,
1-year life span, limited geographic range, and low fecundity make it susceptible to decimation if its reproductive
or larval nursery areas are disturbed for more than two years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In formulating the basis for the economic impact analysis, the Service assumed that destruction or adverse modification
of critical habitat would not occur in any given water year, provided that Federal and State agencies and other parties
comply with flows required in biological opinions interim to the State Board's implementation of water quality standards,
and that Federal and State agencies are making satisfactory progress towards implementing recovery plan objectives.

Comment 9:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Agricultural interests and municipal representatives making comments in the public hearings felt the designation
of critical habitat for the delta smelt and EPA's estuarine standards would cause water allocation in California
to be inflexible, especially in light of expanding municipal water needs for population growth, natural disasters
(e.g., earthquakes and fires) and expanding industry. One commenter was concerned that by designating critical
habitat for the delta smelt, construction of new Delta water conveyance facilities would be prevented.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Service Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Designating critical habitat for the delta smelt will not cause water allocation in California to be inflexible.
Section 7 of the Act requires Federal agencies to consult on actions that may affect delta smelt to ensure that their
actions are not likely to destroy or adversely modify critical habitat. The Service provides advisory recommendations
under section 7 by consulting with other Federal agencies to identify and help resolve conflicts between listed species,
their critical habitat, and proposed actions. Management actions designed to provide protection for delta smelt
through formal consultation or the section 10 incidental take permit process can be achieved in a variety of ways by
considering a range of project alternatives or measures. The consultation and permitting processes are flexible,
designed to identify solutions on either a project-by-project or regional basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A critical habitat designation will not necessarily preclude the construction of new Delta water conveyance facilities.
The Service's economic analysis for designating critical habitat assumed that construction of water facilities
for future economic growth is more affected by application of the jeopardy standard, rather than critical habitat
designation. Nonetheless, these economic assumptions do not constrain the Service's review of future water project
proposals. The construction of a new Delta water conveyance facility may or may not jeopardize the continued existence
of the delta smelt, and may or may not result in the destruction or adverse modification of its critical habitat, depending
on numerous elements, including the facilities' design, location and operations criteria.

Comment 10:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters believed that implementation of EPA's water quality standards will only remedy one factor contributing
to the delta smelt's decline. Commenters suggested that over-fishing, habitat modification, and the introduction
of toxics and heavy metals to the Estuary have contributed to the decline of the delta smelt. Numerous respondents
stated that introduced species in the Delta, such as the yellowfin goby (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Acanthogobius flavimanus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), striped bass and inland silversides are the real cause of the delta smelt's decline. Special concern was expressed
over the effects that two species of exotic zooplankton and a species of the exotic Asian clam, (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Potamocorbula amurensis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) had on the Estuary ecosystem.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Service Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Regardless of other related effects, the best available information indicates that diminished water quality and
quantity are major factors contributing to the decline of the delta smelt. EPA's water quality (salinity) standards
will contribute to the recovery of the delta smelt.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Act, the Service may list species and designate critical habitat even though the interaction of many causes
of the species' decline masks the relative contribution of any single factor. Critical habitat preserves options
for a species' recovery. As such, designation of critical habitat preserves habitat conditions within which implementation
of recovery actions can occur. As stated in the final rule to list the delta smelt, continuing studies may shed light
on the causes of decline, and lead to recovery or management actions that may be of benefit to the species.

Comment 11:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter was concerned that water users could comply with EPA's water quality standards early in the February-June
compliance period, hence adequate salinity would not be provided in later months if the delta smelt were to spawn late
in June or early July. The same commenter suggested that a year-round standard might be a better and more reasonable
approach.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Service Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Service generally agrees with this comment and recognized in the revised proposed rule that delta smelt may spawn
as late as July. Providing water quality (salinity) to conserve the delta smelt and its critical habitat is not limited
to a defined time period as EPA's standards are to the February through June period. As the ``Primary Constituent Elements''
section outlines, critical habitat for the delta smelt will be focused on the habitat needs of a particular life stage
that may be affected by a project. Additional flows may be required after the February through June period to protect
delta smelt present in the south and central Delta from being entrained in the State and Federal projects, and to avoid
jeopardy to the species.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Though Grizzly Bay and lower Suisun Bay are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
important areas of delta smelt habitat, habitat conditions elsewhere in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Suisun Bay and upstream in the Estuary are just as important for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spawning, larval and juvenile transport, rearing and adult migration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Habitat for each life stage is essential for the recovery of the species 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and is contained in this designation.

Comment 13: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter thought additional flow requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not be needed in July or August to protect larval and juvenile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delta smelt from being entrained in the State and Federal water projects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
since delta smelt remain in particular locations despite flow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Service Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service recognizes that juvenile and adult 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delta smelt, when given the opportunity, may remain in especially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
productive areas such as Suisun Bay, after the mixing zone has moved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upstream. However, flows may be required in the July-August period to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protect delta smelt present in the south and central Delta from being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entrained in the State and Federal projects, and to avoid jeopardy to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the species.

Comment 14: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One respondent noted that the distribution of delta 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smelt is not determined by flow alone. The commenter cited 1993 tow-net 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and fall midwater trawl collections that found delta smelt upstream of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the mixing zone near Decker Island, and found delta smelt considerably 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
downstream of the mixing zone in Suisun Bay. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Service Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service agrees that the distribution of delta 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smelt is not based exclusively on flow. When delta smelt are located in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suitable, productive habitat, they may not travel with the mixing zone 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as it moves upstream, or downstream. After being transported to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
productive rearing habitat, delta smelt may remain and take advantage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safe and productive nursery areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Delta smelt do not become ``trapped'' in the mixing zone, but may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remain in particular areas. In the text of the final rule, the Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clarifies this point by referring to the salt and freshwater mixing area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as the ``mixing zone,'' rather than the ``entrapment zone,'' to clear any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
misconception that delta smelt and other estuarine species are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated exclusively or somehow become trapped within the vertical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circulation currents created by the saltwater-freshwater interface. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This type of circulation pattern is important because it mixes nutrients 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the ocean and inland areas, resulting in a productive estuarine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ecosystem. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The pattern of delta smelt distribution described by the commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is consistent with distribution patterns in earlier years when dispersal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of delta smelt was greater following wetter springs (Sweetnam and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Stevens 1993). In 1993, about half the delta smelt population remained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in Suisun Bay throughout the summer, even though the 2 ppt isohaline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retreated upstream (Herbold 1994).

Comment 15: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter objected to the Service's use of EPA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed water quality standards as the factual and scientific basis for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the delta smelt's critical habitat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Service Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service has not based critical habitat for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the delta smelt on EPA's water quality standards. Space requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for delta smelt population growth, cover, and shelter, as well as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
salinity, were described in detail and were included as primary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constituent elements in the proposed rule to designate critical habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the delta smelt in 1991, well before EPA promulgated its proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards. Since 1991, the EPA and the Service have been working 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
together to coordinate each agencies' actions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment 16: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another commenter thought the Service simply identified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the delta smelt's entire geographic range as critical habitat without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considering whether the designation was essential to the conservation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the species. Other respondents believed the Service did not distinguish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between areas of critical habitat that are essential and nonessential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the conservation of the delta smelt, thereby including marginal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas not necessary for delta smelt recovery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Service Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service agrees that critical habitat is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited to the specific areas within the geographic area that contain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the physical and biological features needed by the species. As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussed in more detail at comment 37, below, the Service has described 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
river, channel, slough and bay water habitats essential for the recovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the smelt. Without these areas of habitat, the delta smelt cannot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survive or reproduce, rear, or be transported between other suitable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Neither the Act or its regulations requires the Service to rank or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identify areas of habitat that are more ``essential'' than others when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical habitat is designated. In the ``Primary Constituent Elements''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section of this rule, the Service has specifically described the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importance of habitat for each life stage of this annual species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Without adequate habitat for each of these life stages, the delta smelt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not survive or recover. The Service may highlight and propose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific management actions to protect and rehabilitate certain areas in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the recovery planning process, such as areas in Cache Slough and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lower Sacramento River complex identified by one commenter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Service did not simply designate critical habitat based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the entire geographic range of the delta smelt. At the time the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service expanded the critical habitat boundary in 1994, larval delta 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smelt had been located as far north as the confluence of the Sacramento 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
River with the Feather River. This area was not included in the revised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed critical habitat boundary. Based on recent unpublished data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(and brought to our attention in a comment), delta smelt in these most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upstream observations may have been misidentified as pond smelt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Hypomesus nipponensis, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
or wakasagi). Portions of San Pablo Bay, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Napa River, and western Suisun Marsh known to support the species are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not included in the critical habitat designation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, California Department of Fish and Game biologists 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contacted the Service with new information that in 1993, delta smelt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were found spawning as far upstream as Sacramento. Based on this new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information and the importance of this spawning habitat in some years, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Service expanded critical habitat in the 1994 proposal to extend to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these important areas.

Designation of critical habitat for the delta

smelt is justified even though the 1992 and 1993 summer tow-net and fall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
midwater trawl abundance indices show increased abundance levels. Based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the best available information, the delta smelt has not recovered, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and remains vulnerable to a variety of threats. Delta smelt were listed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as threatened because the species was likely to become an endangered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portion of its range. A species has recovered if the status of the

species, based on the best scientific and commercial data available,

indicates listing is no longer appropriate under the criteria of the Act

(50 CFR 402.02, 424.11(d)(2)). Listing remains appropriate under the

Act until long-term population abundance indices remain at high levels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the population is widespread throughout the Estuary for a number of

years. One or two years of high abundance levels is not sufficient to

ensure recovery of an annual species such as the delta smelt. Specific

Several commenters were concerned with the Service's

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's water quality standards, having been based on eight estuarine

smelt recovery would be coordinated with the recovery of other

Designation of critical habitat and identifying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water quality (salinity) as a primary constituent element for protection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the delta smelt may incidentally benefit other native estuarine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species. Providing variable salinity regimes will facilitate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery of the Estuary to its natural state. The Service does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
foresee a significant decline in other native estuarine species due to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this critical habitat designation, or due to the implementation of EPA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water quality standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Delta smelt recovery will be coordinated with the habitat and water

quality needs of other fish and other marsh and wetland species in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Estuary. The Delta Native Fishes Recovery Team was formed in 1993 to

address the Estuary native fishes in general. The recovery team will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider the population decline of delta smelt and other native Estuary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fishes that ultimately may require active management to restore 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sustainable populations. The recovery team has developed a draft 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recovery Plan that has analyzed the needs and recommended management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions for the delta smelt, longfin smelt, Sacramento splittail, green 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sturgeon, spring-run chinook salmon, late fall-run chinook salmon and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
San Joaquin fall-run chinook salmon. Winter-run chinook salmon also was

One respondent commented that delta smelt spawn north 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Suisun Bay in Montezuma Slough, Suisun Slough and their tributaries, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and believed this fact contradicted the Service's assertion that delta 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smelt spawn upstream of the mixing zone.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Montezuma Slough, Suisun Slough, and their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tributaries are upstream of the area where mixing between freshwater and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
salt water occurs in wetter water years. In dryer water years, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entrapment zone may move upstream as far upstream as the City of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sacramento in late summer, and these sloughs may become saline. If 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delta smelt were to spawn late (i.e., July or August), they would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
probably seek areas other than the sloughs to spawn in freshwater.

Comment 22: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters at the public hearings suggested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the Service use hatcheries to produce enough delta smelt to make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the population stable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service believes using hatcheries to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
propagate fish, including delta smelt, should not be a substitute for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat protection and restoration. Dr. Moyle presented testimony in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1992 (Natural Heritage Institute 1992) summarizing the work of Hilborn 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1992), which explained several reasons why hatcheries are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beneficial to the long-term maintenance of fisheries. His points 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included (1) though initially successful, hatchery effectiveness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decreases after a few years; (2) hatchery fish often do poorly in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wild; (3) artificial production poses a threat to the maintenance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wild fish; (4) hatchery fish dilute the naturally adapted genes of wild 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fish; and (5) hatcheries provide an excuse for habitat loss. Assuming 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hatcheries could be used to stabilize delta smelt populations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
propagated fish would require an environment that provides ample food, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
low levels of toxic compounds, and low entrainment losses (Moyle and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Herbold 1989). Reliance on hatcheries would not adhere to one of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
primary purposes of the Act, which is to conserve the ecosystem(s) upon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which listed species depend (16 USC 1531(b)).

One commenter asked why the Service stated that delta 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smelt are more likely to be entrained in river channels than when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
downstream of the Sacramento-San Joaquin River confluence, when there is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no relationship between salvage and subsequent delta smelt abundance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter noted that entrainment also occurs in Pacific Gas and

Electric (PG &amp; E) cooling water diversions downstream from the

DWR (1994) states that Federal and State pumps 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entrain delta smelt. A relationship has been found between the number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of juvenile delta smelt salvaged at the State and Federal pumps and both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the percent of inflow diverted and total Delta outflow (DWR 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whether or not there is a statistical relationship between the number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delta smelt entrained at the State and Federal water project pumps and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsequent delta smelt abundance, water quality (salinity) is essential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the conservation of the delta smelt. Adequate salinity and flow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide the delta smelt with suitable habitat for all life stages, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will transport delta smelt away from major points of entrainment. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service recognizes and has stated in previous rules that delta smelt are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taken downstream of the Sacramento-San Joaquin River confluence in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
numerous agricultural, municipal and industrial diversions. Delta smelt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are also taken upstream from the confluence in numerous (over one-thousand) agricultural diversions.

One commenter thought the Montezuma Slough Control

delta smelt within Suisun Marsh.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Service Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the best available evidence, the Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintains that operation of the Montezuma Slough Control Structure may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service is required by section 4(b)(8) of the Act to identify public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or private activities that

may

 result in destruction or adverse

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Control Structure may provide valuable habitat to delta smelt, its

operation for other purposes may interfere with the distribution of

delta smelt to spawning and rearing habitat within Suisun Marsh. The

Some respondents believe humans are the real endangered

species, and that neither delta smelt nor any other animal species 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be considered more important than humans. Similarly, one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter thought humans could survive just fine without delta smelt, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but could not survive without farmers.

The Act recognizes that species of fish, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wildlife, and plants are of aesthetic, ecological, educational, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
historical, recreational, and scientific value to the Nation and its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
people (section 2(a)(3)). Delta smelt possess these attributes. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delta smelt is the only smelt endemic to California and one of only two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
native estuarine smelt species (the other being longfin smelt) found in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Estuary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the Act is to protect species in danger of becoming 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extinct in the immediate or foreseeable future. Humans are not in such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
danger. The number of humans has increased in the last century at a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rapid rate. As pointed out in a report submitted by one commenter, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
total farm-related employment (agricultural services, food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers, and agricultural chemicals) increased between 1977 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1989 (Carter and Goldman 1992). Agricultural services provided 89,908 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jobs in California in 1989, adding some 45,000 jobs and more than 4,000

Congressman Gary Condit and several other commenters

As required by the Act, the Service has

Comment 27: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter was concerned that efforts by the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies to manage the Bay/Delta were uncoordinated. On the other hand, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one commenter presumed that the Service adopted EPA's water quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards wholesale, and thought the Service had no authority to do so 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because the Service designates critical habitat under the narrow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes of the Act, while the EPA promulgates water quality standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the framework of the Clean Water Act. Similarly, another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter thought the Service would, in effect, be interposing or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substituting EPA's regulatory judgment for its own if the Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporated EPA's water quality standards in its designation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical habitat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Service Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule does not incorporate EPA's water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality standards 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
per se
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, although implementation of these standards may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be a means to promote recovery of the delta smelt. The January 6, 1994, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revised critical habitat proposal for the delta smelt included a list of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat conditions and a description of water quality primary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constituent elements. These elements were developed in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the requirements of the Act and its regulations. The Service's proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also reflects the coordinated approach provided by the Club Fed process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service participated with the Bureau, NMFS, and EPA in guaranteeing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the January 6, 1994, critical habitat and water quality proposals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were based on the best available scientific and technical information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another priority was for the proposals to take into account the goals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and concerns of the agencies and public and private interests affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the agencies' programs and activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The preservation of rare and endangered species is a substantive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
link between the proposals of the Service and the EPA. The EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promulgated the Bay/Delta standards because they disapproved provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the 1991 Bay/Delta plan developed by the State Board. The EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined that the State had not adopted criteria sufficient to protect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designated uses of the Estuary, including the ``Preserv[ing] Rare and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Endangered Species'' designated use. Similarly, in discussing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Relationship Between Fish and Wildlife Service and EPA Actions,'' the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service wrote_``*&blank;*&blank;* [T]he Clean Water Act requires protection of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most sensitive use within each category of designated uses. `Protection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Endangered and Threatened Species' is considered a designated use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the meaning of the Clean Water Act; therefore, a species listing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the Endangered Species Act provides one method to identify the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most sensitive use within the designated uses of a water body.'' (59 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
854). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Biologically, the proposed critical habitat for the delta smelt and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the salinity criteria that constituted EPA's proposed water quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards are directly related. ``*&blank;*&blank;* EPA's proposed water quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards address the location of 2 ppt salinities from February to June 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and, therefore, address both critical habitat requirements for delta 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smelt and a range of interrelated parameters that affect other species 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that rely on estuarine habitat.'' (59 FR 854) Based on the common legal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and biological underpinnings of the critical habitat designation and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed water quality standards, the Service's treatment of salinity as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a primary constituent element and the textual references to the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
salinity standards were appropriate and fully consistent with the goal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of assuring substantive consistency between the two proposals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the designation of critical habitat and EPA's proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bay/Delta standards have common elements, the critical habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designation must address the standards, and, at a minimum, must not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inconsistent with them, and vice versa. The January 6, 1994, critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat proposal did not incorporate specific salinity standards into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the regulatory designation of habitat, as was the case with the initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical habitat proposal published in 1991. Rather, the 1994 proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designated water quality as a primary constituent element, stating_``salinity concentrations [as] required to
maintain delta smelt habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for spawning, larval and juvenile transport, rearing, and adult 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
migration.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The coordinated Federal effort and the substantive consistency of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the EPA and Service proposals are a direct reflection of the agencies' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intent to address Bay/Delta issues in an effective and responsible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manner. The coordinated Club Fed process is intended to address 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerns expressed by the State of California of a perceived lack of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coordination among the Federal agencies.

Comment 28: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter thought designation of critical habitat was not prudent at this time, since critical habitat would
not provide the delta smelt any more protection than the listing of the species had already provided. Another commenter
thought designating critical habitat at the present time would interfere with the delta smelt recovery planning
process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Service Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Designation of critical habitat is prudent at this time because the designation will provide substantive benefits
to the delta smelt beyond those already resulting from its status as a threatened species. Critical habitat serves
to preserve options for a species' eventual recovery. A critical habitat designation contributes to species conservation
primarily by identifying important geographic areas, and by describing the features within the areas that are essential
to the species. The designation puts public and private entities on notice that the area is important habitat. Section
7 of the Act requires Federal agencies to ensure that any action they authorize, fund, or carry out is not likely to destroy
or adversely modify designated critical habitat. This section requires parties to consult with the Service to avoid
jeopardy and destruction or adverse modification to important habitat areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A designation of critical habitat provides a clearer indication to Federal agencies as to when consultation under
section 7 is required, particularly in cases where the action would not result in direct mortality or injury to individuals
of the listed species (e.g., an action occurring within the critical area when a migratory species is not present).
The critical habitat designation, describing the essential physical or biological features of the habitat, also
assists parties in determining which activities conducted outside the designated area are subject to section 7 consultation
(i.e., activities that may affect primary constituent elements of the designated area).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Designating critical habitat also assists private, State, and Federal agencies in planning future actions, since
the designation establishes, in advance, those habitats that will be given special consideration in section 7 consultations
and section 10 incidental take activities. With the designation of critical habitat, potential conflicts between
projects and endangered or threatened species can be identified and possibly avoided early in the agency's planning
process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Designating critical habitat will not interfere with recovery planning efforts now in progress. A recovery plan
would be prepared for the delta smelt pursuant to the Act whether or not critical habitat was designated for the species.

Comment 29:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter thought Club Fed could not restore natural resources to levels existing during times of significantly
fewer people under current California law. Another respondent believed the Service may not refer to EPA's water quality
standards because the estuarine standards are based on historical conditions, rather than on ``existing conditions''
now occurring in the Estuary. The respondent claims there is a temporal element in the definition of critical habitat,
stating that critical habitat is defined in the Act in terms of existing conditions, and the Service must look to specific
areas which contain physical and biological features essential to the conservation of the species at the time it is
listed. The commenter went on to say that critical habitat may only consist of those areas that currently contain essential
physical and biological features.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Service Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The definition of critical habitat does not require that all primary constituent elements necessarily be conditions
existing at the time critical habitat is designated. Conditions existing historically in the Estuary are required
to recover the delta smelt. Conditions now occurring in the Estuary have resulted in the decline of the delta smelt
population, because the Estuary currently does not contain all of the physical and biological features (e.g., habitat
requirements and salinity) necessary for each of the species' life stages. Critical habitat for the delta smelt identifies
areas needed to conserve the species, so it may recover and, ultimately, be delisted. In order to accomplish recovery,
it is necessary that critical habitat encompass conditions that are superior to existing conditions, so that all
of the physical and biological features necessary for the delta smelt are present in the Estuary. The Delta Native
Fishes Recovery Team has identified 1968 as a time when the Estuary had appropriate hydrologic conditions that would
allow recovery of the delta smelt. An interagency Statement of Principles (Plenert, Fullerton, and Seraydarian,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1992) among the Service, NMFS and EPA have found that the Estuary ecosystem and its anadromous and resident fisheries
were relatively healthy during the years between 1960&hyph;1970. The Service recognizes no significant conflict
with managing toward historic conditions for all primary constituent elements as a conservation strategy for the
delta smelt.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service notes that the 1994 revised proposed critical habitat for the delta smelt contains the physical and biological
features essential for the conservation of the delta smelt. Using equations developed by Kimmerer and Monismith
(1992) to calculate salinity, DWR (1993) determined that the isohaline was located downstream of the Roe Island historic
reference point 124 days, and was between Roe Island and Chipps Island habitat 14 days between February 1 and June 31
in 1993 (DWR 1993). Therefore, conditions for spawning, larval and juvenile transport, rearing and adult migration
was, in fact, available for all life stages as recently as 1993. However, these physical and biological features do
not occur frequently enough, and are not protected during critical periods in February through June, especially
in drier water years. The mixing zone was pushed out beyond Roe Island during this period because 1993 was a wet year.
Water quality criteria are necessary to ensure habitat suitable for the delta smelt are available at critical times
in all water-year types.

A critical habitat designation need not, and should not, include specific management plans or recovery goals. Designating
critical habitat for a species does not result in a management or recovery plan. Critical habitat simply identifies
areas where conservation efforts should be concentrated. Designating critical habitat alone will not dictate how
the delta smelt should be protected, nor will it require identification of goals to measure the success of the designation.
Plans, goals, and directives will be identified and set in motion during the recovery planning process. Section 4(f)(1)
of the Act specifies what should be included in a recovery plan. Criteria for downlisting or delisting are contained
in recovery plans, which function as goals to achieve species conservation. The Delta Native Fishes Recovery Team
has developed a draft Recovery Plan for the delta smelt and other estuarine fish species, and will include recovery
and delisting criteria for the delta smelt. The public will have the opportunity to comment on a draft delta smelt Recovery
Plan before it is approved as a final plan as required by section 4(f)(4) of the Act.

Senator Phil Wyman and The California Farm Bureau were disappointed with the quality of the public hearings held in
Fresno because only the Service and the EPA attended the meeting to hear testimony and answer questions. The Senator
and the Farm Bureau believed the Bureau and NMFS should have been at the hearing, since the issues involved ``Club Fed''.
Moreover, several of the participants in Fresno felt the hearings were simply a ``going-through-the-motions''
exercise.

Section 4(b)(5)(E) of the Act requires the Service to hold a public hearing if one is requested within 45 days of the
publication of a proposed rule. The Service received such a request, and held hearings in Fresno, Irvine, Sacramento,
and San Francisco to accept public comment on two proposals by the Service and on one proposal by EPA_the proposed critical
habitat designation for the delta smelt, listing of the Sacramento splittail, and Bay/Delta water quality standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The hearings are not a ``going-through-the-motions'' event. Service staff review all oral comments presented at
the public hearings from the hearing transcripts. Oral comments are given the same weight and consideration as are
comments submitted in written form.

These commenters thought the Service should assess the environmental and social impacts that may occur in or near
the Estuary, and outside the Estuary area as a result of designating critical habitat for the delta smelt. Commenters
identified potential environmental impacts, including groundwater overdraft and subsequent land subsidence,
sagging canals and leaking rivers, fugitive dust, warming of reservoir water, impacts on regional water quality
control plans, increased energy use, impacts on listed and candidate species, loss of water for wetlands, loss of
open-space habitat provided by farms, and impacts on regional recreational use at reservoirs.

the Act, and is not legally required.

Comment 33:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter thinks the Service violated the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) because it relied on scientific
information developed by the San Francisco Estuary Project (SFEP) in developing the revised critical habitat designation.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Service Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4(b)(2) of the Act specifies that ``The Secretary shall designate critical habitat *&blank;*&blank;* on
the basis of the best scientific data available *&blank;*&blank;*.'' When the Service identifies critical habitat,
it relies on scientific data in published literature, data gathered as a result of status reviews, data received during
the public comment periods, and information communicated in conversations with biologists, economists and other
specialists. A summary of the findings of the SFEP (1993) was included in the body of information that the Service used
to revise the proposed rule to designate critical habitat.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Critical habitat for the smelt was first proposed in October, 1991. The Service revised the critical habitat boundaries
in 1994, relying on the best scientific information available from California Department of Fish and Game biologists,
Service biologists, and new scientific information received during the public comment period from the EPA and other
commenters. Included in this information were the findings and recommendations of the SFEP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Had the Service not used SFEP information, the Service would not have complied with section 4(b)(2) of the Act, which
requires use of the best scientific evidence available. SFEP was created in 1988 as part of EPA's National Estuary
Program. The SFEP is an Environmental Management Program of EPA, the State of California and the Association of Bay
Area Governments. The Service has participated in the SFEP extensively over the past several years. The SFEP developed
recommendations for estuarine standards, and complied with FACA when they conducted workshops and meetings, and
when they chose participants to work on the standards.

Comment 34: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter thought the critical habitat designation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is defective since the data supporting the expansion of critical habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the delta smelt was based on personal communications not available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the public review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Service Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service relied on information that has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available to the public by contacting the California Department of Fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Game, EPA or the Service. The administrative record for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical habitat designation is and has been available for public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection since publication of the initial proposed rule in 1991.

Comment 35: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter urged the Service and the EPA to exhaust 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all possible remedies to recover the delta smelt (e.g., by using the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Delta Protection Act) before more burdens were placed on California's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water users with the designation of critical habitat.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 50 CFR 424.12, the Service must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designate critical habitat unless it is not prudent to do so. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service has not concluded that it is not prudent to designate critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat. Further, critical habitat is determinable. Therefore, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement at section 4(b)(6)(c)(ii) to publish a final designation by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not more that one year after listing applies.

In this rulemaking, the Service first proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical habitat for the delta smelt in 1991. It revised its proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in 1994 after public comment indicated that the Service had not included 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
important spawning habitat for the species. These facts are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significantly different from those of the case cited by the commenter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As such, the Service does not apply the holding in that case to this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking effort.

Comment 37:

Under sections 7 and 10 of the Act, the Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assesses the merits of project proposals on a case-by-case basis. In a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formal section 7 consultation, the Service evaluates the effects of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action, creating an environmental baseline (50 CFR 402.14(g)(3)). This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
baseline includes the past and present impacts of all Federal, State, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
private actions and other human activities in the action area, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anticipated impacts of all proposed Federal projects in the action area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that have already undergone formal or early section 7 consultation, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the impact of State or private actions which are contemporaneous with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the consultation in process (50 CFR 402.02). Conservation actions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed by project proponents can be considered as suitable measures to

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The economic analysis is described and its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results are summarized in this final rule. The Service believes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic analysis is sufficient in that it adequately and appropriately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identifies costs of designating critical habitat. As such, it enables 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary to exclude areas from critical habitat designation if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefits of an exclusion are found to outweigh the benefits of including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an area as critical habitat.

Comment 39: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters accused the Service of incorrectly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimizing the economic impacts in the delta smelt critical habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designation since the impacts associated with the critical habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designation were separated from the economic impacts attributable to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listing of the species.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Service Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4(b)(2) of the Act requires the Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to consider the economic and other relevant impacts of designating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical habitat. It does not direct the Service to assess the economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impacts of both listing the species and designating its critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat. Section 4(b)(1)(A) of the Act explicitly precludes the Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from considering the economic impacts of listing a species as threatened 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or endangered. The congressional intent behind inclusion of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statutory provision was to ensure that only relevant biological criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are used to assess the ecological status of a species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1994 revised proposed critical habitat designation for the delta 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smelt explained the economic impacts attributable to listing and to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical habitat designation. Subsequent to listing and prior to this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final critical habitat designation, protective measures for the delta 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smelt (e.g., as provided through section 7 consultation with the Bureau) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been in place and created economic impacts not associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical habitat designation. In a comprehensive economic analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepared by the EPA and other economists for the Service, the economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impacts attributed to designating critical habitat have been evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has not limited the examination of economic impacts so as to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimize the economic effects of designating critical habitat.

One commenter thought that the Service could not begin

to define critical habitat until it fully considered the economic

impacts of the designation. The commenter thought a proposed rule for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical habitat could not be drafted until an economic analysis was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducted, and an opportunity to comment on the analysis was provided to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interested parties. Another commenter thought the public should be able 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to comment on a revised critical habitat designation in the event the

Service Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service has not defined critical habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prematurely for the delta smelt because the Act does not require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completion of an economic analysis before the Service can propose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical habitat areas. In a critical habitat rulemaking conducted in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with the Act and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service defines and proposes critical habitat boundaries, conducts an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic impact analysis, takes public comment on the proposed critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat designation and the economic analysis, makes exclusions, if any, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to critical habitat boundaries, and promulgates a final rule. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary, through the Service, has the discretion to exclude critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat areas based on economics, in accordance with the section 4(b)(2) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard. The section allows the Secretary to exclude any area from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical habitat if he determines that the benefits of such exclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outweigh the benefits of specifying such area as part of critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat, provided that exclusion will not result in extinction of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species. The Service has properly conducted critical habitat rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the delta smelt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Neither the Act, nor its regulations, require the Service to allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public comment on revised critical habitat designations where the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary has excluded areas of proposed critical habitat. The standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking process requires preparation of a proposed rule followed by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rule. Publishing a draft final rule is not required. The Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acknowledges that the public was allowed to comment in the above 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described manner in the critical habitat designation for the Northern 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Spotted Owl, however, the opportunity for public comment was a policy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision made specifically for that rulemaking and is not required by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has provided ample opportunity for the public to comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the delta smelt critical habitat designation proposals and on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic analysis during prescribed comment periods from October 3 to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
February 3, 1992; March 16 to April 30, 1993, and again from January 27 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

comments on the revised proposed critical habitat designation.

Comment 41: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter thought the critical habitat designation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was flawed since the economic analysis could not properly analyze 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic impacts likely to arise from the proposed designation, because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Service failed to present any focused or concrete indication of what 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific management measures would be pursued. The commenter thought 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the public was not able to effectively comment on the critical habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designation due to this inadequacy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Service Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Designating critical habitat does not result in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management plan. Specific management measures are identified in a draft 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recovery Plan that currently is being prepared by the Service, and need 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not be identified in a proposed critical habitat designation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As described in the above comment, the Service believes the public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was given an opportunity to effectively comment on the critical habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designation and the draft economic analysis. The draft RIA was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is deficient because the Service failed to analyze the potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic impacts of any particular portion of the Delta.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4 of the Act requires the Secretary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
take into consideration ``The economic impact *&blank;*&blank;* of specifying any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular area as critical habitat.'' The Service may exclude any area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from critical habitat if it is determined that the benefits of such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclusion outweigh the benefits of specifying such areas as part of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical habitat, unless failure to designate such area will result in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the extinction of the species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service believes it has adequately analyzed the potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic impacts of the Estuary ``area.'' The Act does not require an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency to analyze potential economic impacts for any specific or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular ``area.'' An ``area'' is not limited to particular reaches of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
river, or particular areas of a species' habitat.

Comment 43: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Army thought the Service did not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficiently analyze the economic impacts of designating critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat, and did not include adequate economic data. They thought the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service should have included channel dredging activities and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintenance of flood control levees in the economic analysis, including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the economic impacts of potential failure and flooding since maintenance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
might be limited due to critical habitat designation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Service Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service believes the economic impacts of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designating critical habitat have been sufficiently addressed, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include discussion of dredging and levee maintenance. As discussed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the final rule to list the delta smelt, and in the revised proposed rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to designate critical habitat for the species, the Service determined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the economic impact of restricting activities associated with deep 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water navigation channel dredging were attributable to the jeopardy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard imposed by the listing of the delta smelt as a threatened 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species. Hence, the economic impacts of these activities can not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with designating critical habitat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service did determine that levee maintenance may adversely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modify critical habitat without necessarily jeopardizing the delta 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smelt. The economic impacts of restrictions associated with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
construction and implementation of these projects have been analyzed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine the economic cost or benefit of critical habitat designation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Properly scheduling maintenance and construction activities to avoid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
periods critical to a species can allow projects to go forward without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incurring large economic impacts.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment and/or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an Environmental Impact Statement, as defined under the authority of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, need not be prepared in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
connection with regulations adopted pursuant to section 4(a) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A notice outlining the Service's reasons for this determination was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of the Interior has determined that the proposed rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Based on the information discussed in this rule, significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic impacts will not result from the critical habitat designation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, no direct costs, enforcement costs, information collection, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recordkeeping requirements are imposed on small entities by this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designation. Further, the rule contains no recordkeeping requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as defined by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service has analyzed the potential takings implications of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designating critical habitat for the delta smelt in a Takings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implications Assessment prepared pursuant to requirements of Executive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Order 12630, ``Governmental Actions and Interference with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Constitutionally Protected Property Rights.'' The Takings Implications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assessment concludes that the designation does not pose significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
takings implications.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS transfers 5&blank;metric tons (mt) of bluefin tuna from the longline-south Incidental subcategory to the longline-north
Incidental subcategory. NMFS has determined that the fisheries landing bluefin under the longline-south Incidental
subcategory will not achieve the full 1994 quota allocation. This action is being taken to extend the season for the
longline-north Incidental subcategory, which will assure additional collection of biological assessment and
monitoring data and increase the economic benefits from this fishery without contributing significantly to additional
bluefin mortality. In addition, this action will prevent waste of bluefin tuna that might otherwise be discarded
dead.

 Bluefin tuna are currently leaving the fall feeding grounds in New England and migrating along the Mid-Atlantic waters,

<!-- PJG 0253 grid5678 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 N. lat. Once the quota is reached for this northern subcategory, any bluefin tuna incidentally taken by longline vessels
must be discarded at sea. In order to prevent waste of bluefin tuna, which would otherwise be discarded dead, NMFS is
transferring an additional 5 mt of quota from the southern to the northern subcategory. With the addition of this 5
mt, the total annual allocation to date for the Incidental subcategory longline-north will be 33 mt. This amount should
be sufficient to account for incidental take of bluefin by the northern subcategory for the remainder of this year
while any unharvested balance for the southern subcategory will be added to the 1995 quota. After the transfer of this
5 mt, approximately 12 mt remains available in the longline-south Incidental subcategory. Based on reported catches,
bluefin taken from the southern subcategory will not exceed the 12 mt remaining of that quota.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule replaces the Interim Rule dated April 26, 1991, and implements the provisions of section 6 of the Real
Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA). Most recently, the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement
Act of 1994 provides alternate methods for disclosure of mortgage servicing history. Section 6 also sets forth procedures
regarding the transfer of mortgage servicing for any federally related mortgage loan, as defined in section 3 of RESPA
and the definition is refined in the implementing regulation for RESPA and 24 CFR 3500.2. Although RESPA was extended
by section 908 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 to subordinate liens, in this rule the Secretary
has exempted from RESPA's mortgage servicing coverage all federally related mortgage loans that are not secured
by a first lien. In addition, the Department has adopted conforming amendments to 24 CFR part 203, the FHA Single Family
Mortgage Insurance program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is also publishing a conforming amendment to its final rule on escrow accounting procedures, published
on October 26, 1994 (59 FR 53890). This amendment will update a cross-reference in another section of part 3500 that
references enforcement of escrow accounting provisions.

Justification for Final Rulemaking_Part 203 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, the Department publishes a rule for public comment before issuing a rule for effect, in accordance with
its own regulations on rulemaking, 24 CFR part 10. However, part 10 does provide for exceptions from that general rule
where the agency finds good cause to omit advance notice and public participation. The good cause requirement is satisfied
when prior public procedure is ``impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.'' (24 CFR 10.1)
The Department finds that good cause exists to publish for effect without first soliciting public comment the sections
of this rule that pertain to 24 CFR part 203, and that prior public procedure is unnecessary because those portions
of this rule merely conform part 203 to the provisions of Section 6 of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974
(12 U.S.C. 2605) that have been developed through notice and comment rulemaking.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 941 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act (Pub. L. 101&hyph;625, approved November
28, 1990) amended the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974, 12 U.S.C. 2601 et seq. (RESPA), by adding a new
section 6, which addresses mortgage servicing requirements (i.e., the right to collect mortgage payments for principal,
interest, and any escrow account items). Section 6 (12 U.S.C. 2605) requires disclosure to certain mortgage loan
applicants of historical data regarding the transfer of mortgage servicing, as well as estimates regarding the potential
transfer of servicing pertaining to the applicant's mortgage loan and other mortgage loans. Section 6 was further
amended on April 10, 1991, by Dire Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act (Pub. L. 102&hyph;27), to create a transition
period during which lenders and servicers would not be liable for violations of the Act. This amendment also directed
HUD to publish implementing regulations effective no later than April 20, 1991. On April 26, 1991, the Department
published an Interim Rule implementing Section 6 (56 FR 19505). That rule remains in effect until it is replaced by
this final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 6 requires that, at the time of application for federally related mortgage loans, applicants be given information
in a disclosure statement (hereafter called ``Servicing Disclosure Statement'') concerning the likelihood that
the servicing of their mortgage may be transferred and information regarding the history of mortgage servicing transfers
of the person making the loan. Section 6 sets forth additional notice requirements at the time of a servicing transfer
(hereafter called ``Notice of Transfer'') and other rights for borrowers, and provides for the collection of damages
and costs by borrowers from servicers for noncompliance. Finally, section 6 preempts any State law or regulation
regarding notice to borrowers at the time of application or servicing transfer, as long as the lender or servicer complies
with the relevant provisions of section 6. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD originally complied with the requirements to promulgate a model disclosure statement and applicant's acknowledgement
by publication of a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on March 20, 1991 (56 FR 11886). These requirements were restated in an Interim Rule of April 26, 1991 (56 FR 19505).
HUD encourages persons covered by this new rule to implement its provisions earlier than its effective date. (The
Department also recently published a related rule on escrow accounting procedures under section 10 of RESPA (59 FR
53890, October 26, 1994).

Comments on Interim Rule and Responses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the interim rule the Department requested comments on the provisions of the rule. The following is a summary of comments
received and HUD's position on the issues in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Business day.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 There were two comments about the definition of ``business day.'' Both recommended that the definition be put in &sect;3500.2,
so that it would apply to the entire regulation, and that it be the same definition in Regulation X and Regulation Z (Truth
in Lending). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The current RESPA rule defines a ``business day'' utilizing language conforming with the definition in Regulation
Z, which implements the Truth in Lending Act. Section 6 of RESPA does not specifically define ``business day'', but
in certain provisions excludes public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays from references to ``days''. To assure uniform
statutory construction, as well as to continue uniformity with related Federal regulatory statutes, the Department
is applying the ``business day'' definition of the Regulation X in this rule. Therefore, business day means a day on
which the offices of the business entity are open to the public for carrying on substantially all of the entity's business
functions. If a day is not specified as a business day in this rule, the reference is to a calendar day.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Effective date of transfer.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 There were three comments on this definition. One commenter approved of the definition because the date was pinpointed.
Another commenter disagreed and considered the date indefinite, particularly as it relates to delinquent mortgages.
The third thought the effective date of transfer should be the date the contract between the parties states that the
transfer takes place.

HUD response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The term ``effective date of transfer'' is defined in Section 6 of the Act as the date on which the mortgage payment of
a borrower is first due to the transferee servicer (new servicer) pursuant to the assignment, sale, or transfer of
the servicing of the mortgage loan. The statute controls and HUD does not have discretion to consider the suggested
alternatives.

Mortgage servicing loan.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department received several comments regarding the extent and limitations of coverage under this rule. The term
``federally related mortgage loan'' was the starting point for delineating coverage and is defined in &sect;3500.2,
subject to the exemptions in &sect;3500.5. Pursuant to section 19(a) of RESPA, at this time the Secretary has exempted
from the requirements of this rule any subordinate lien federally related mortgage loans and has excluded all open-end
lines of credit (home equity plans), whether secured by a first or subordinate lien, that are covered under the Truth
in Lending Act and Regulation Z. The penalty provisions of the Truth in Lending Act are similar to those of Section 6
of RESPA, and the error resolution section of Regulation Z (12 CFR 226.13) provides protections similar to Section
6 of RESPA. Any other federally related mortgage loan secured by a first lien and not exempted under &sect;3500.5,
is covered by these requirements and called a ``mortgage servicing loan.''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Four commenters asked for definitions of additional terms. One commenter suggested that ``loans made'' be distinguished
from ``loans originated'', and that ``servicing transfer'' be defined.

HUD response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The terms ``loans made'' and ``loans originated'' are synonymous, but the Department agrees that consistent use
of terminology would avoid confusion and, therefore, has eliminated the term ``loans made.'' HUD considers a ``servicing
transfer'' to be a sale, assignment, or transfer of servicing to a person or legal entity other than the maker of the
loan named in the legal documents. Also, as discussed more fully later in this preamble, a servicing transfer occurs
as part of a table-funding (defined in &sect;3500.2) between the mortgage broker, as transferor, and the funding
lender, as transferee.

Refinancing Transactions

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department received 18 comments relating to refinancing transactions. Seven commenters recommended that refinancing
be defined. Three commenters questioned the statutory authority for covering refinancing transactions. Since
HUD received these comments, the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 amended RESPA to state specifically
that refinancing transactions are covered. A definition of refinancing was added to part 3500 in revisions published
on February 10, 1994 (59 FR 6505, concerning subordinate liens), and is applicable to this section. The impact of this
definition is that transactions specifically excluded from the definition of refinancing do not require new disclosures.

Questions Involving State Law Preemption
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter asked about the effect of Section 6 on State laws. While Section 18 of RESPA (12 U.S.C. 2616) sets forth
general provisions regarding preemption, Section 6 contains its own preemption provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes that one of the significant achievements of Section 6 was the elimination of perceived difficulties
in the marketing of servicing rights for mortgage loans originated in various States. In part, Section 6 constituted
a recognition of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 national market for mortgages and mortgage servicing and represented an attempt to facilitate such a market by establishing
uniform standards. Therefore, Section 6 is determinative of the information required for the Servicing Disclosure
Statement and the Notice(s) of Transfer; any other similar State requirements are preempted. Other provisions of
State laws, such as those requiring additional notices to insurance companies or taxing authorities are not preempted
by Section 6 or this rule. If permitted under State law, such additional information may be added to a notice prepared
under this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Requests for Exemption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Nine commenters requested that their institutions be exempted from providing Servicing Disclosure Statements,
either because they were not institutions that transferred servicing or because they were chartered to make certain
public purpose loans. Another commenter wanted an exemption for lenders that always transfer loans at closing; three
commenters requested an exemption for lenders that do not sell the servicing rights. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 While the Secretary has the authority to create classes of exemptions under Section 19 of RESPA, no commenter advanced
a reason that would justify an exempted class. The Servicing Disclosure Statement is particularly appropriate when
a lender always transfers loans at closing. When a servicer never sells servicing rights, it can simply state that
fact. In any event, the information relating to complaint resolution must be provided, although lenders that do not
transfer servicing may incorporate this information into the HUD&hyph;1 or HUD&hyph;1A. HUD amended the Servicing
Disclosure Statement to include a sentence in the heading suggesting that a borrower save the statement if a loan is
approved and to include alternate language regarding the history of mortgage servicing transfers that is allowed
under the 1994 amendments of Section 6. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In the event a lender changes its policy and begins to sell the servicing, a commenter suggested that these lenders
have to follow the rule within six months after beginning sale of servicing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 When a lender determines that it will sell servicing, the lender will be subject to the requirement that it furnish
to the borrower a 15-day Notice of Transfer. The lender may also be required to revise its Servicing Disclosure Statement
at the next calendar year revision. There is no obligation to send an amended Servicing Disclosure Statement for previously
closed loans at the time of the sale of servicing; the 15-day Notice of Transfer provides the required information.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Three commenters suggested that mortgage brokers should be exempt from furnishing the Servicing Disclosure
Statement, because furnishing the Statement is the obligation of the funding lender. However, another commenter
suggested that a face-to-face meeting with the mortgage broker should satisfy the face-to-face meeting requirement
for a lender. Two other commenters stated that the time (3 business days) should begin to run after the lender receives
the written application from another party. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The general rule is that the Servicing Disclosure Statement shall be provided within 3 days of receipt of the borrower's
written loan application, unless the application for credit is turned down within that time. If an application is
received by a mortgage broker that will close the loan in its own name using table funding, the table funding mortgage
broker is to provide the Servicing Disclosure Statement, using the ``we do not service mortgage loans'' optional
language in &sect;3500.21(b)(4). Similarly, for first-lien dealer loans, the dealer should provide the Servicing
Disclosure Statement, using the ``we do not service mortgage loans'' optional language. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A commenter questioned whether a Servicing Disclosure Statement is required when the mortgage servicing function
is transferred to an affiliated entity. A question was also posited as to how to treat a circumstance when a lender had
a program that always sold servicing and another where no servicing was required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A Notice of Transfer generally is required when there is a transfer of servicing between or to affiliates, unless there
are no substantial changes in the way the borrower makes payments (see discussion below). However, the information
regarding affiliate or subsidiary transfers is not required to be included in the statistical computations found
in the Servicing Disclosure Statement. In the interest of full disclosure, this information may be provided voluntarily;
the model format allows for this disclosure. If the lender is providing the historical data, the lender should indicate
whether the Servicing Disclosure Statement includes assignments, sales or transfers to affiliates or subsidiaries.
When the lender has a variety of programs, some of which sell servicing and some of which do not, information may be added
to the model format to allow the servicer to describe this situation, or some variation of this situation. Further,
while the use of the acknowledgment is mandatory, the use of the model format is not, and the incorporation in a footnote
or otherwise of reasonable additional information, to describe situations that do not fit conveniently into the
format is anticipated and expected. Sample language describing other alternative situations has been included
with the model format.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(5) Several commenters discussed proposed variations to the Servicing Disclosure Statement. These variations
included permitting a lender to: (i) state its reasons for servicing or not servicing loans; (ii) identify the types
of loans it services and, by the percentages of each type of loan transferred, the types of loans it sells; and (iii)
advise the borrower of the new servicer, if any, at settlement. One commenter suggested that &sect;3500.21(c) contain
a statement that the use of the sample language in the appendices be considered as compliance with the disclosure requirements
of that paragraph. Fifteen commenters recommended that lenders should not be required to obtain written acknowledgements
of the Servicing Disclosure Statement from loan applicants whose applications are rejected or withdrawn. One commenter
recommended that actual percentages be used rather than rounding to the nearest quartile. Commenters also requested
that HUD permit longer than 31 days to calculate the percentage after the end of the calendar year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The elements contained in the rule and Servicing Disclosure Statement comply with the Secretary's mandate under
Section 6 of RESPA. The Secretary is required to develop a disclosure statement that would notify applicants for federally
related mortgage loans about the servicing procedures, transfer practices and requirements, and the available
complaint resolution process. In addition, the Secretary must develop an acknowledgement that the disclosure has
been read and understood, as evidenced by signatures of the applicants when such a statement appears in the application.
As in the interim rule, the Secretary has determined that is in the applicant's best interest for the signature to be
at the end of the Servicing Disclosure Statement, because this directs the applicant's attention particularly to
the servicing transfer issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the precise wording of the Servicing Disclosure Statement is left to the lender's discretion, HUD presumes
that lenders will use the sample language in developing their own forms. However, HUD will not give blanket approval
to forms that it has not seen; the lender must determine the appropriate language to make proper disclosure to the borrower.
Only the language in the model Applicant's Acknowledgement is mandatory and must be followed precisely. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even though the Department believes that most lenders will use the simpler alternative language allowed by the Riegle
Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;325, approved September 23, 1994),
the Department has adopted the suggestion of permitting a longer time for computation of the previous year's percentages.
The final rule allows the lender to calculate the percentages no later than the end of the first quartile in the next
calendar year (March 31). Under his Section 19 authority, the Secretary has also created an exemption to the disclosure
requirement, including the signed acknowledgment, if an applicant is turned down for credit within three business
days of receipt of the application. This exemption makes all the mortgage servicing notice provisions consistent
with good faith estimate amendments in section 951 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Several commenters asked various questions as to what disclosures were necessary when a servicer buys another
servicer, with or without changing the servicer's name, or merges one servicer into another servicer. In addition,
two comments concerned the functions of ``master servicers'' and ``subservicers.'' The entity holding servicing
rights is frequently called the ``master servicer,'' and the entity performing the actual servicing is called the
``subservicer''. Two situations were posited: first, the rights to servicing are sold, but the subservicer remains
the same. Second, the subservicer changes, but the master servicer remains the same. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The controlling consideration in whether a Notice of Transfer must be delivered for a sale, transfer, or assignment
is whether there is a significant change of servicing that potentially affects the borrower. In ordinary transfers
of servicing between distinct entities, the Notice of Transfer is always required. In certain other situations_e.g.,
transfers between affiliates, transfers because a servicer or subservicer is bought or merged into another entity,
and transfers between master servicers when the subservicer stays the same and when the subservicer changes_a Notice
of Transfer is required unless there is no change in the payee, the collection address, account number, or the amount
of the payment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Six commenters suggested that when there are multiple applicants, it should be sufficient for the lender to give
the Servicing Disclosure Statement to one of the co-applicants in a face-to-face interview. One commenter requested
that a co-signer not be considered as a person who applies for a loan, therefore obviating the need for the co-signer
to receive a Servicing Disclosure Statement. Another commenter asked how long a lender must keep co-signers' signatures
on file. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Delivery of a single Servicing Disclosure Statement in a face-to-face meeting with one or more applicants is acceptable,
and the Acknowledgement may be signed at that time. For each applicant or co-applicant who is not present, the Servicing
Disclosure Statement may be delivered on his or her behalf to an applicant who is present, or may be mailed within 3 business
days by first class mail, postage prepaid. While a co-signer might be an integral party to the transaction, a co-signer
is primarily interested in timely payments of the mortgage, not in who holds the mortgage servicing. Therefore, a
co-signer's acknowledgment is not required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The signed acknowledgments are to be in the loan package. Consistent with other record-retention requirements of
part 3500, the lender must keep the signed acknowledgments for five years after the date of settlement of the loan unless
the lender disposes of its interest in the loan and does not service the mortgage. In this case, the Servicing Disclosure
Statement would be part of the transferred loan file.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) One comment suggested that requiring prepaid, first-class postage for a Servicing Disclosure Statement that
is mailed is unnecessary, costly, and inconsistent with the disclosure mailed in compliance with the Truth in Lending
and Equal Credit Opportunity Acts. If the transaction is handled by mail, one commenter suggested, the period of three
business days should begin only after the lender receives a written application from the borrower. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The use of prepaid, first-class mail is common business practice. The practice reasonably assures that the borrower
will receive the Servicing Disclosure Statement and, thus, affords protection to those responsible for delivering
the statement. The 3-business day period begins only when the application is received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Four commenters suggested that lenders be permitted to include in the Servicing Disclosure Statement a statement
that ``the loan cannot be funded unless the acknowledgements are signed and returned.'' One commenter asked that
no follow-up correspondence be required if the lender has provided the Servicing Disclosure Statement to the borrower
and the borrower has not returned a signed Acknowledgement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department has deleted in this final rule the provision that no loan should be funded unless the signed Acknowledgement
was contained in the loan package. HUD has determined that there is sufficient oversight by regulators and secondary
market purchasers, and no overriding reason to highlight the Servicing Disclosure Statement over any other required
statement. However, the Acknowledgement is still required to be a part of the loan package. The Department has also
eliminated the mandatory follow-up requirement that was included in the interim rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) One commenter stated that if the servicing is always sold, transferred, or assigned, there is not a ``present servicer''
or a ``new servicer'' at the time of application for the loan. The model language of the Notice of Transfer indicates
that the borrower will be informed about the servicer, but the language fails to state when and in what format the borrower
will receive this information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department disagrees with the content of this comment. Whoever sells, transfers, or assigns a federally related
mortgage loan is considered the present servicer and is called the ``transferor servicer'' in this rule. The servicer
that buys, is transferred, or is assigned the mortgage servicing function is the new servicer and is called the ``transferee
servicer.'' A mortgage broker that closes a table-funded transaction in its own name is in the position of a transferor
servicer. A dealer in a first lien dealer loan situation is also a transferor servicer. Appendix B of the interim rule
presented sample language for the Notice of Transfer; the language is retained in substantial degree in this final
rule. As with the Servicing Disclosure Statement, discretion is allowed concerning the exact wording of the Notice
of Transfer, but the various elements that the notice must contain are detailed in &sect;3500.21(e). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Two commenters requested clarification about who bears the primary responsibility for notifying the borrower
of a transfer of servicing when the transferor and transferee choose to notify the borrower in a single, joint Notice
of Transfer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD believes that in normal business transactions, the timing and issuance of Notices of Transfer would be resolved
as part of the purchase and sale agreement. If a joint notice is not feasible, both notices will be required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Several commenters were concerned about the impact of the requirements on the servicer's ability to administer
collection practices consistent with investor requirements. A commenter questioned whether a late payment could
be assessed prior to the 60-day period if the payment had not been made to the transferee. Also, two commenters asked
whether late fees due prior to the transfer could be assessed.

If within the 60-day period the borrower has mistakenly mailed a payment to the transferor instead of the transferee,
a late fee may not be imposed. However, if neither the transferor nor the transferee has received a regularly scheduled
payment within the 60-day period, or any longer applicable grace period, late payment charges may be assessed in accordance
with the servicer's established practices. Late charges due from the borrower before the effective date of transfer
of servicing are not covered by RESPA or this rule.

Questions Relating To Qualified Written Requests
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Two comments addressed the type of information that HUD permits a borrower to include in a ``qualified written
request.'' One commenter wished to limit the requirements to those inquiries asserting errors that have been caused
by the transfer of servicing on a mortgage account. The other commenter wanted clarification on whether the requirements
were limited to inquiries on payments and account balances. Another question concerned the length of time a servicer
has to respond to qualified written requests after a loan is paid off or after servicing has been transferred.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The statute encompasses all information relating to the servicing of a mortgage loan and does not restrict the subject
matter to questions concerning the transfer of servicing, installment payments, or account balances. For example,
a written inquiry concerning a collection for or disbursement from an escrow account would be a qualified written
request if the correspondence contains the required identifying elements. In &sect;3500.21(f)(2), the Department
establishes a 1-year period in which a qualified written request is valid after the date of loan pay-off or mortgage
servicing transfer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Three commenters were concerned about how written requests were received. One said that the regulations should
state that ``a qualified written request'' must be mailed to an address supplied by the servicer in the coupon book
or written correspondence and not the address for the mortgage payment. Another wanted to disregard requests that
lacked the account number or were attached to the borrower's check, as distinguished from being placed in the same
envelope. The third suggested that the regulations should specifically disqualify written inquiries that the borrower
includes with the loan payment. A commenter suggested that the Department require a servicer to provide to the borrower
information identifying the name and telephone number of a representative or the office or department of the servicer
through which the borrower will receive assistance after submitting a qualified written request.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) This rule does not require that a servicer establish an office to handle borrowers' complaints. It does, however,
allow the servicer to do so. In the event the servicer establishes such an office and complies with all the necessary
notice provisions of this rule, then the borrower must deliver its request to that office in order for the inquiry to
be a ``qualified written request'' (see the optional language in Appendix MS&hyph;2 to part 3500).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the servicer determines that a borrower's correspondence does not constitute a qualified written request
(the most likely disqualification would be writing the inquiry on the payment coupon), the servicer should retain
sufficient information to support its determination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A commenter sought clarification of when the Department considers an inquiry to be resolved.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

An inquiry is resolved when the servicer supplies the requested information or corrects an error. See, for example,
Regulation Z, 12 U.S.C. 226.13(e) and (f) for similar complaint resolution provisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Eight commenters discussed the protection of the borrower's credit rating during a dispute. Most commenters
asked whether a lender could provide payment information to a consumer reporting agency prior to the end of the 60-business
day period if the dispute was resolved. Two commenters noted that a servicer would be in an unfair position if the servicer
has previously reported a borrower's loan as past due and then is not allowed to report the payment. The commenters
suggested that the servicer be permitted to advise the credit agency that the servicer is prohibited by law from providing
additional information at that time. As a benefit to the borrower, one comment suggested that the servicer be allowed
to report prior to the 60-business day period to clear a borrower's record. One commenter raised a question about whether
a lender should assume that a third party is acting as the borrower's agent, or should require proof from the borrower
of this delegation of authority. Furthermore, the commenter asked if the 20-business day time-frame, in which the
borrower must receive a written acknowledgement from the servicer, is calculated from when the request is received
or when the servicer confirms that the third party is the borrower's agent.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD interprets the statute to mean that no adverse information relating to a borrower's overdue payment information
may be provided to a credit reporting agency within the 60-day period after the servicing function is transferred,
assigned, or sold or after the servicer receives a qualified written request for information. The statute is implemented
by this rule in a manner that does not prohibit a servicer from reporting an improvement (such as a payment found or received)
in the borrower's record within the 60 day period. It is the servicer's responsibility to determine whether it has
sufficient information that a third party is acting as the borrower's agent or the borrower should verify the agent's
representative capacity. When the servicer is in doubt as to the status of the third party, the written acknowledgement
can also be mailed to the borrower to ask that the borrower verify the status of the third party.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) One comment asked for clarification of whether the servicer was prohibited from reporting delinquencies unrelated
to a dispute.

HUD response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A servicer may report a delinquency to a credit reporting agency provided that the report does not concern a pending
qualified written request, which questions the correctness of the account, or a loan payment sent by the borrower
to the transferor, rather than the transferee, within 60 days after the servicing of the loan is transferred.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) One commenter hypothesized a situation in which a borrower sends a qualified request in September concerning
a late charge assessed on the March payment, yet the borrower has not made his April through August payments. Is the
servicer prohibited from reporting these delinquencies in September, although they are unrelated to the March dispute?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD position. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The receipt of a qualified written request by the servicer determines when the 60-business day period begins. If the
April through August delinquencies are caused by the problem or issue identified by the borrower in the request, adverse
information related to all of these delinquencies may not be submitted or resubmitted, if previously reported. In
this instance, the 60-business day period begins when the qualified written request is received in September. However,
there is nothing in RESPA that prohibits the servicer from initiating foreclosure action, or taking other remedial
actions under the applicable mortgage documents, against the mortgaged property based on the delinquent payments
in March through August. The servicer's timing on initiating foreclosure action is governed by the provisions of
the borrower's mortgage document.

Servicing Involving Certain Government-Related Agencies or Enterprises
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 6 provides that certain government or government-sponsored entities that have oversight or other relationships
with servicers are not themselves servicers for purposes of Section 6. These entities include the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) in connection with assets acquired, assigned,
sold, or transferred pursuant to section 13(c) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act or as receiver or conservator
of an insured depository institution. Section 6 also makes provisions for certain circumstances involving mortgage
servicing loans when government or government-sponsored entities have to deal with the termination for cause of
the contract for servicing a loan or with the commencement of proceedings for bankruptcy of the servicer in a program
involving such entity. In addition, in giving the transfer notice the statute also allows a delay of up to 30 days after
the transfer of servicing. HUD believes that Congress exempted these entities from most mortgage servicing transfer
requirements so as not to interfere with the fiduciary responsibilities of the entities with regard to protective
actions needed to be taken by such entities, and not to create for such governmental entities potential liability
that could inhibit the orderly transfer of servicing. Also, imposition of standard business requirements in troubled
situations involving a fiduciary could adversely affect the underlying value of the related mortgage servicing.
Because the rationales discussed above apply equally well to other Federal entities not specifically enumerated
in Section 6(i)(2) of the Act, the Secretary has exercised his authority under Section 19(a) of RESPA and has added
certain other Federal agencies (HUD, including FHA; VA; NCUA; and FmHA) that might also be in a fiduciary position
or need to protect a borrower in an otherwise covered mortgage loan situation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, under Section 19 the Secretary has exempted FHA from having to provide the Notice of Transfer in those
instances where the mortgage has been assigned (along with the servicing) to FHA for the payment of the mortgage insurance
benefits pursuant to section 230 of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1715u). Under the assignment program, the
mortgagor actively provides information to both the mortgagee and FHA in order to show that the mortgagor meets certain
eligibility criteria. The assignment of the mortgage to FHA is not a business decision. Rather, it is a means by which
eligible mortgagors can avoid foreclosure and keep their homes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mortgagors are aware early on in the process that, if deemed eligible, HUD will become their mortgagee and servicer.
HUD also accepts assignment of other single-family insured mortgage loans under certain specialty programs. These
assignments are not comparable to the normal sale and purchase transactions that the mortgage servicing transfer
provisions of Section 6 were designed to address. Thus, requiring HUD to provide the notice of transfer in cases where
mortgages are assigned to HUD would not serve the purposes of Section 6, and these assignments have been exempted under
the Secretary's authority in Section 19.

Damages and Costs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The statute provides that whoever fails to comply with any provision of Section 6 shall be liable to the borrower.
These damages include actual damages and, in an action brought by an individual, up to $1,000 for a pattern of noncompliance;
in a class action, the additional damages may not exceed the lesser of $500,000 or 1% of the servicer's net worth.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter noted that ``actual damages'' should be clarified. If a servicer reported a debt to a credit bureau within
the 60-business day proscribed period, and the borrower alleges that the reporting resulted in the borrower's inability
to obtain credit, the servicer could be liable for damages, even if the report was correct. Therefore, the commenter
suggested that to prove actual damages the borrower must show:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The servicer made the report to a credit company within the proscribed period;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The borrower was correct, the dispute was resolved in the borrower's favor; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The borrower would have otherwise been approved for the credit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD position. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a servicer violates &sect;3500.21(g) by reporting information on a borrower to a credit agency relating to a dispute
regarding the borrower's payments within 60 business days of receiving a qualified written inquiry from the borrower,
that servicer will be liable for all proven actual damages that the borrower suffered because of the servicer's action.
Further, if a pattern of noncompliance can be established, the servicer may be liable to that borrower for additional
damages not to exceed $1,000. The costs of the action and attorneys fees also can be recovered. The statute requires
no qualifying criteria that the borrower must meet before actual damages may be sought from the servicer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) One commenter suggested that the date on the Servicing Disclosure Statement was unnecessary. Another commenter
noted that the Acknowledgment Form requires the applicant to state that he has read and ``understands'' its contents;
however, the commenter stated, this might create potential legal complications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the servicer is liable for damages and costs, it is in the servicer's own interest to note, by dating the form,
when the Servicing Disclosure Statement was given (or placed in the mail) to the borrower. In any event, the requirement
is statutory and has been retained in the final rule. Similarly, the language concerning the applicant's understanding
of the disclosure statement reflects the statute and follows common business practice.

Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the undersigned hereby certifies that this rule will not have
a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. HUD finds that there are no anticompetitive
aspects of the interim rule that are discriminatory with regard to small entities nor are there any unusual procedures
that would need to be complied with by small entities. In any event, by statute, the requirements of this rule must be
adhered to by all lenders and servicers.

At the time of publication of the interim rule, a finding of no significant impact with respect to the environment was
made in accordance with HUD regulations in 24 CFR part 50 that implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332). This final rule does not make changes to the interim rule that are significant in
this context. Accordingly, the initial finding of no significant impact remains applicable, and is available for
public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the office of the Rules Docket Clerk at the above address.

of this rule will preempt State law requirements dealing with identical subject matter. Given the lack of discretion
pertaining to the preemption issue by the statute, further analysis of the federalism implications of the rule would
serve no purpose.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Servicing Disclosure Statement and Applicant Acknowledgement; requirements. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) At the time an application for a mortgage servicing loan is submitted, or within 3 business days after submission
of the application, the lender, mortgage broker who anticipates using table funding, or dealer who anticipates a
first lien dealer loan shall provide to each person who applies for such a loan a Servicing Disclosure Statement. This
requirement shall not apply when the application for credit is turned down within three business days after receipt
of the application. A format for the Servicing Disclosure Statement appears as Appendix MS&hyph;1 to this part. Except
as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the specific language of the Servicing Disclosure Statement is not
required to be used, but the Servicing Disclosure Statement must include the information set out in paragraph (b)(3)
of this section, including the statement of the borrower's rights in connection with complaint resolution. The information
set forth in Instructions to Preparer on the Servicing Disclosure Statement need not be included on the form given
to applicants, and material in square brackets is optional or alternative language.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Applicant's Acknowledgement portion of the Servicing Disclosure Statement in the format stated 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
is mandatory. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Additional lines may be added to accommodate more than two applicants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The Servicing Disclosure Statement must contain the following information, except as provided in paragraph
(b)(3)(ii) of this section:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Whether the servicing of the loan may be assigned, sold or transferred to any other person at any time while the loan
is outstanding. If the lender, table funding mortgage broker, or dealer in a first lien dealer loan does not engage
in the servicing of any mortgage servicing loans, the disclosure may consist of a statement to the effect that there
is a current intention to assign, sell, or transfer servicing of the loan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The percentages (rounded to the nearest quartile (25%)) of mortgage servicing loans originated by the lender
in each calendar year for which servicing has been assigned, sold, or transferred for such calendar year. Compliance
with this paragraph (b)(3)(ii) is not required if the lender, table funding mortgage broker, or dealer on a first lien
dealer loan chooses option B in the model format in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, including in square brackets
the language ``[and have not serviced mortgage loans in the last three years.]''. The percentages shall be provided
as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) This information shall be set out for the most recent three calendar years completed, with percentages as of the
end of each year. This information shall be updated in the disclosure no later than March 31 of the next calendar year.
Each percentage should be obtained by using as the numerator the number of mortgage servicing loans originated during
the calendar year for which servicing is transferred within the calendar year and, as the denominator, the total number
of mortgage servicing loans originated in the calendar year. If the volume of transfers is less than 12.5 percent,
the word ``nominal'' or the actual percentage amount of servicing transfers may be used.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) This statistical information does not have to include the assignment, sale, or transfer of mortgage loan servicing
by the lender to an affiliate or subsidiary of the lender. However, lenders may voluntarily include transfers to an
affiliate or subsidiary. The lender should indicate whether the percentages provided include assignments, sales,
or transfers to affiliates or subsidiaries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) In the alternative, if applicable, the following statement may be substituted for the statistical information
required to be provided in accordance with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section: ``We have previously assigned,
sold, or transferred the servicing of federally related mortgage loans.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The best available estimate of the percentage (0 to 25 percent, 26 to 50 percent, 51 to 75 percent, or 76 to 100 percent)
of all loans to be made during the 12-month period beginning on the date of origination for which the servicing may be
assigned, sold, or transferred. Each percentage should be obtained by using as the numerator the estimated number
of mortgage servicing loans that will be originated for which servicing may be transferred within the calendar year
and, as the denominator, the estimated total number of mortgage servicing loans that will be originated in the calendar
year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) If the lender, mortgage broker, or dealer anticipates that no loan servicing will be sold during the calendar year,
the word ``none'' may be substituted for ``0 to 25 percent.'' If it is anticipated that all loan servicing will be sold
during the calendar year, the word ``all'' may be substituted for ``76 to 100 percent.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) This statistical information does not have to include the estimated assignment, sale, or transfer of mortgage
loan servicing to an affiliate or subsidiary of that person. However, this information may be provided voluntarily.
The Servicing Disclosure Statements should indicate whether the percentages provided include assignments, sales
or transfers to affiliates or subsidiaries.

Disclosure Statements to each applicant for mortgage servicing loans. Each applicant or co-applicant must sign
an Acknowledgement of receipt of the Servicing Disclosure Statement before settlement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) In the case of a face-to-face interview with one or more applicants, the Servicing Disclosure Statement shall

Statement on behalf of the other applicants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If there is no face-to-face interview, the Servicing Disclosure Statement shall be delivered by placing it in

If the terms of any mortgage servicing loan require the borrower to make payments to the servicer of the loan for deposit
into an escrow account for the purpose of assuring payment of taxes, insurance premiums, and other charges with respect
to the mortgaged property, the servicer shall make payments from the escrow account in a timely manner for the taxes,
insurance premiums, and other charges as the payments become due, as governed by the requirements in &sect;3500.17(k).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A lender who makes a mortgage servicing loan or a servicer shall be considered to have complied with the provisions
of any State law or regulation requiring notice to a borrower at the time of application for a loan or transfer of servicing
of a loan if the lender or servicer complies with the requirements of this section. Any State law requiring notice to
the borrower at the time of application or at the time of transfer of servicing of the loan is preempted, and there shall
be no additional borrower disclosure requirements. Provisions of State law, such as those requiring additional
notices to insurance companies or taxing authorities, are not preempted by Section 6 of RESPA or this section, and
this additional information may be added to a notice prepared under this section, if the procedure is allowable under
State law.
