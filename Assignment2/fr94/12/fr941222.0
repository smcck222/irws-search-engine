'' on the right hip, and that certain steers imported into the United States from Mexico be marked with a permanent,
legible ``M'' on the right hip, rather than on the jaw. These marking requirements are necessary to ensure that all
steers and spayed heifers imported into the United States from Mexico, except those imported directly to slaughter
or in-bond for feeding and return to Mexico, are clearly identifiable as being of Mexican origin. These marking requirements
will facilitate the disease surveillance and traceback activities conducted in the United States under the National
Cooperative State-Federal Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Program.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations in 9 CFR part 92 prohibit or restrict the importation of certain animals into the United States to prevent
the introduction of communicable diseases of livestock and poultry. Subpart D of part 92 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(&sect;&sect;92.400 through 92.435), referred to below as the regulations, pertains to the importation of ruminants.
Sections 92.424 through 92.429 of the regulations contain specific provisions regarding the importation of ruminants,
including cattle, from Mexico. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of the diseases addressed by the regulations is bovine tuberculosis (referred to below as tuberculosis). Tuberculosis
is a serious communicable disease of cattle, bison, and other species, including humans, caused by 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Mycobacterium bovis. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Tuberculosis in animals causes weight loss, general debilitation, and sometimes death. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each year, approximately 1 million cattle are imported into the United States from Mexico. The vast majority of those
cattle_about 99 percent_are young steers; the remaining 1 percent consists of spayed heifers and intact cattle (i.e.,
calves, bulls, and unspayed females). The steers and spayed heifers are, with few exceptions, consigned to pastures
or feedlots for finish feeding prior to slaughter. Most intact cattle are integrated into herds in the United States
for breeding purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The period between 1982 and 1992 saw a significant increase in the number of Mexican-origin cattle found at slaughter
in the United States to be infected with tuberculosis. In 1982, 78 samples submitted from slaughtered Mexican-origin
cattle showed evidence of tuberculosis; that number rose to 613 in 1992. In 1982, 33 percent of the tuberculosis investigations
at slaughter involved Mexican origin cattle; in 1992, that number rose to 81 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
That increase in the incidence of tuberculosis in Mexican-origin cattle led the Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service (APHIS) to publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 12, 1993 (58 FR 59963&hyph;59965, Docket No. 93&hyph;006&hyph;1), a proposed rule to amend the regulations
to require that spayed heifers and intact cattle (i.e., calves, bulls, and unspayed female cattle) imported into
the United States from Mexico be branded with an ``M'' on the jaw using a hot iron, which was the same requirement that
applied to most steers imported from Mexico. Based on the comments we received from individuals and organizations
opposed to that proposal, as well as public concern that branding on the jaw caused unnecessary distress to cattle,
we withdrew the November 12, 1993, proposed rule referenced above and replaced it with an alternative proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the alternative proposal, which was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on August 24, 1994 (59 FR 43506&hyph;43508, Docket No. 93&hyph;006&hyph;2), we proposed to amend the regulations
to require that certain spayed heifers imported into the United States from Mexico be marked with a permanent, legible
``M
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' on the right hip, and that certain steers imported into the United States from Mexico be marked with a permanent,
legible ``M'' on the right hip, rather than on the jaw. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We solicited comments concerning our alternative proposal for a 60-day period ending October 24, 1994. We received
more than 12,000 comments by that date. They were from private citizens, animal rights organizations, a member of
Congress, cattle industry associations, ranchers, representatives of State governments, and a veterinary medical
association. We carefully considered all of the comments we received. They are discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters did not address the specific provisions of the proposed rule; rather, they either demanded that APHIS
discontinue face branding or stated that they supported APHIS' proposal to discontinue face branding of steers.
We have, therefore, taken such comments to support that aspect of the proposal that would change the location of the
``M'' brand on steers from the jaw to the right hip. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters objected to the proposed rule in its entirety because they felt that APHIS should conduct its disease
surveillance activities as it sees fit and should not capitulate to outside pressure to change its methods. We have
made no changes in this final rule based on such comments because we believe that the provisions of the proposed rule
and this final rule do not negatively affect APHIS' ability to conduct its disease surveillance activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters felt that moving the brand from the face to the hip was no improvement, and that all M-branding should
be discontinued. We have made no changes in this final rule based on such comments because we continue to believe, for
the reasons discussed below, that some type of permanent marking is necessary to identify cattle imported into the
United States from Mexico. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter urged APHIS to keep the location of the brand on the jaw because branding on other locations can markedly
reduce the value of the hide. While it is true that marking methods such as hot-iron branding and freeze branding do
damage the hides of cattle and would likely result in some loss of value, many private entities such as cattle owners
and feedlots routinely brand cattle on areas of the hide that would have trimmed to produce a ``clean'' hide. Moreover,
we do not believe that the economic considerations associated with the placement of the brand on the hip are significant
enough to warrant such a change in this final rule, especially given the degree of public support for our proposal to
relocate the brand from the jaw to the hip. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters stated that the location of the brand should remain on the jaw, which has been set aside by some State
livestock agencies for ``government'' brands. They argued that brands on the hip would be less visible and could be
easily confused with registered ownership brands_a number of which are similar to the ``M'' or ``M
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' mark has been used by APHIS for the placement of ``S'' brands under the brucellosis regulations in 9 CFR part 78 since
1983, and we are unaware of any identification problems resulting from that requirement. In terms of the visibility
of the ``M'' or ``M

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

will be able to readily discern the mark when necessary. Therefore, we have made no changes in this final rule as a result
of those comments.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter stated that the anatomical reference point specified for location of the brand on the hip_between the
fourth to seventh coccygeal vertebrae_is on the moveable part of the tail and could not accommodate a 2- to 3-inch brand.
Although the regulatory text of the proposed rule called for the placement of the ``M'' or ``M
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' mark on the ``right hip, high on the tailhead,'' the anatomical reference point specified for the placement of the
mark was, as pointed out by the commenter, incorrect. To remedy that error, we have changed the specific anatomical
reference point to ``over the junction of the sacral and first coccygeal vertebrae'' in the regulatory text of this
final rule. Another commenter stated that the specified area is concave on thin cattle, which would result in incomplete,
unreadable brands on such cattle. We do not believe that the concavity of the area near the tailhead on most cattle would
be pronounced enough to result in an appreciable number of unreadable brands. Additionally, if an animal were to be
offered for importation with an unreadable ``M'' or ``M
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' mark, that animal would be refused entry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stated that the placement of the brand on the hip would make it possible for a person to modify the brand
by, for example, branding an additional line or symbol close to the ``M'' or ``M
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
''; having done that, the person could attempt to portray the modified brand as an ownership brand in order to disguise
the animal's Mexican origin. Certainly an ``M'' or ``M
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' mark could be altered, just as any private or regulatory brand could be altered. However, because we are requiring
that the ``M'' or ``M
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' mark be placed in a specific location that is not likely to be used for marking by private entities, we do not believe
that the commenter's concerns will be a problem. As mentioned above, the ``S'' brands applied to brucellosis-exposed
cattle under the regulations in 9 CFR part 78 are placed in the same location near the tailhead as the ``M'' and ``M
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' marks are to be placed, and we are unaware of any attempts to modify those ``S'' brands during the 11 years they have
been used. Additionally, we believe that State brand registries and State animal identification regulations will
help to discourage persons from taking the actions envisioned by the commenter. We have, therefore, made no changes
in this final rule as a result of that comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter urged APHIS to expand the scope of the marking requirements to include intact Mexican cattle because
such cattle are often integrated into domestic herds for breeding purposes, thus heightening the potential for the
Mexican-origin cattle to expose domestic cattle to disease. As we explained in the proposed rule, we believe that
the small number of intact cattle imported into the United States from Mexico each year, plus the fact that the interstate
movement of intact cattle is regulated under the brucellosis regulations in 9 CFR part 78, make it significantly easier
for APHIS to trace the movement of Mexican-origin intact cattle following their entry into the United States. Therefore,
we do not believe that it is necessary to permanently identify such cattle as being of Mexican origin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter urged APHIS to expand the scope of the marking requirements to include cattle imported from Mexico in
bond for feeding and return to Mexico under &sect;92.427(e) of the regulations because such cattle are not always
returned to Mexico since the U.S. Customs Service stopped collecting the bond as a result of the North American Free
Trade Agreement. We are aware of the potential problems with the in-bond program and are currently reconsidering
the regulations governing the program. We do not, however, believe that expanding the marking requirements to include
in-bond cattle is necessary at this time. If, at some point, we determine that such a change is necessary, the change
would be proposed as part of a separate rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters pointed out that APHIS currently has two proposed rules that have not yet been finalized that would
render most M-branding unnecessary. The first proposed rule, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 9, 1994 (59 FR 23810&hyph;23817, Docket No. 93&hyph;014&hyph;1), would establish comprehensive quarantine
and surveillance requirements for Mexican cattle offered for importation into the United States. The second proposed
rule, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 12, 1993 (58 FR 59959&hyph;59962, Docket No. 93&hyph;084&hyph;1), would require the individual identification
on a health certificate of imported Mexican-origin cattle being moved interstate. The commenters noted that the
quarantine measures, movement restrictions, and documentation requirements contained in those proposed rules
are similar to the restrictions currently placed on cattle imported from Mexico for slaughter in accordance with
&sect;92.429 of the regulations or in bond for temporary entry in accordance with &sect;92.427(e) of the regulations.
The commenters argued that if APHIS believes that it is not necessary to brand in-bond and immediate slaughter cattle,
then it should not be necessary to brand Mexican cattle affected by the two proposed rules. Both of the proposed rules
mentioned by the commenter are still being considered by APHIS and have not been finalized. Because the provisions
of those two proposals have not been promulgated in final regulations, they have no regulatory effect; we cannot make
any changes in this final rule that are based on the provisions of other proposed regulations. However, a similar comment
was received in response to the May 1994 proposed rule mentioned above (Docket No. 93&hyph;014&hyph;1), so the suggestion
of exemptions from the branding requirement for cattle affected by the provisions of that proposed rule will be considered
and discussed in any final rulemaking related to that proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stated that branding is unnecessary because the official Mexican Ministry of Agriculture and Water
Resources (SARH) blue eartag required by the regulations in &sect;92.427(d) can be used to identify Mexican-origin
cattle. We agree that the blue SARH eartag is an important identification tool, but we remain concerned that eartags
can be lost or removed. With the an ``M'' or ``M
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' mark present, we could still determine an animal's country of origin if its eartag were lost or removed. Additionally,
we believe that it is less likely that someone would remove the SARH tag from an ``M'' or ``M
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' marked animal in an attempt to conceal the animal's Mexican origin, so the SARH tag, with its value as a traceback
tool, is more likely to remain on the animal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters stated that because APHIS has acknowledged that freeze branding can be used to identify cattle imported
from Mexico, APHIS should respond to the public opposition to hot-iron branding by prohibiting hot-iron branding
and requiring the use of freeze branding. Similarly, another commenter felt that freeze branding should be the standard
identification method and hot-iron branding should be allowed only if the exporter has submitted a written justification
for using hot-iron branding. Although we acknowledge that freeze branding can work as a means of identifying cattle
imported from Mexico, we also recognize that freeze branding has its limitations. First, a freeze brand takes 18 to
21 days to become visible, and there may be some exporters of cattle for whom branding that far in advance of offering
their cattle for entry into the United States is not a viable option. Second, freeze brands are not visible on white
or light-colored hair, and there will certainly be cattle offered for importation that have white or light-colored
hair at the location specified for the placement of the ``M'' or ``M
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' mark. Because APHIS will not allow cattle with unreadable brands into the United States, requiring the use of freeze
branding would have the effect of prohibiting the importation of certain cattle based on their coloring. Therefore,
we believe that hot-iron branding should remain an option for exporters of cattle from Mexico. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter stated that freeze branding will not be an effective means of identifying Mexican-origin cattle
because so many of those cattle have light-colored hair or white spots. As discussed above, we acknowledge that freeze
branding is not going to be an option for all cattle in all cases. The regulations require a distinct, permanent, and
legible ``M'' or ``M
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' mark on certain cattle offered for entry; we believe that it is reasonable to expect that the exporter of the cattle
will keep that requirement, as well as the advantages and limitations of hot-iron branding and freeze branding, in
mind when selecting a marking method.

Many commenters stated that APHIS should discontinue branding in favor of using microchips to individually identify
Mexican-origin cattle. Some of the commenters pointed to studies that indicated that microchip technology would
be well-suited to APHIS' stated goals of disease surveillance and traceback. We agree that microchips are useful,
but several factors prevent us from changing the regulations to require their use. We continue to believe that an identification
method must be distinct, permanent, and legible; microchips fail to fully satisfy those three criteria. In terms
of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distinctness, we believe that the identification should be readily visible, which microchips, clearly, are not.
In terms of permanence, a microchip implanted in an animal could be removed or could migrate to other parts of the body.
In terms of legibility, information can be readily stored on and retrieved from microchips, but there is no universal
chip reader that can access the information stored on chips produced by different manufacturers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the many suggestions that APHIS use microchips to identify Mexican-origin cattle, numerous commenters
offered other alternatives to M-branding. Those commenters suggested that APHIS use: Stickers, bells, ribbons,
tail cropping, ear notching, tags, ear tags, magic markers, paint, indelible dye, stamps on the tails, and rings on
the tails. As is the case with microchips, none of these suggested identification meets our criteria for distinctness,
permanence, and legibility. Paints, dyes, stamps, and markers can fade or be obscured; stickers, bells, ribbons,
and rings can be lost or removed; and notching or cropping, although permanent, are not readily and distinctly visible
or legible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter noted that the proposed new text of &sect;92.427(c)(2) makes no mention of freeze branding, even though
it eliminates the requirement for hot-iron branding. The commenter asked that freeze branding be mentioned, even
encouraged, in the revised regulatory text of &sect;92.427(c)(2) in order to inform persons who have read only the
regulations, and not the supplementary information provided in the proposed rule and this final rule, that freeze
branding may be used to identify cattle imported into the United States from Mexico. We agree that the marking methods
acceptable to APHIS should be set forth in the regulations and have changed the regulatory text in this final rule to
explicitly state that the ``M'' or ``M
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' mark may be applied with a freeze brand or hot iron. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter noted that although the proposed rule would allow the use of freeze branding or hot-iron branding to
mark spayed heifers, an unpublished APHIS ovariectomy protocol that requires the M-branding of certain spayed heifers_even
though that requirement is not published in the regulations_appears to require that a hot iron be used to apply the
brand. The protocol states that the ``M
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' mark on spayed heifers must be a ``distinct, permanent mark which is legible on the right side of the tailhead as defined
in Title 9, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 78.'' The commenter stated that there is no definition of ``distinct,''
``permanent,'' or ``mark'' in those regulations, but there are definitions of different types of brands associated
with the APHIS brucellosis eradication program that describe the brands exclusively, or predominantly, as being
applied with a hot iron. The commenter felt that the protocol should be reworded to make it clear that freeze branding
and other methods may be used to apply the ``M
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' mark on spayed heifers. The protocol to which the commenter is referring is part of the cooperative services agreement
between APHIS and a private sector veterinarian that provides for APHIS veterinary medical officers to monitor ovariectomies
performed on heifers located in Mexico prior to their importation into the United States. The protocol does not state
that hot-iron branding must be used or that freeze branding may not be used; the ``distinct, permanent mark'' language
was meant to allow both methods without specifying either. The revised text of &sect;92.427(c)(2) now clearly states
that either freeze branding or hot-iron branding may be used, so even if the protocol were construed to prohibit freeze
branding, the regulations would preempt the protocol and freeze branding would be allowed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters stated that APHIS should develop faster, more accurate tests for the diagnosis of tuberculosis and
work to eradicate tuberculosis in Mexico, which would eliminate the need to brand cattle from Mexico. We agree that
eradicating tuberculosis in Mexico would eliminate the need for branding cattle from Mexico, but that goal has not
yet been attained. Researchers from APHIS, other Federal agencies, and private entities are constantly working
to develop better ways to diagnose and prevent the spread of diseases, including tuberculosis. Additionally, APHIS
and the Mexican Government, along with the livestock industries in the United States and Mexico, are cooperating
in a joint effort to eradicate tuberculosis in Mexico. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters felt that since APHIS proposed to end the face branding of cattle from Mexico, it should also change
the provisions of its regulations in 9 CFR parts 50, 51, 77, 78, and 80 that allow or require face branding. We have received
similar requests and are giving them serious consideration. However, any changes to those regulations would have
to be part of a separate rulemaking proceeding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters had the impression that APHIS knowingly allowed tuberculosis-infected cattle to be imported from
Mexico and was using the M-brand to identify and track those cattle. Those commenters felt that APHIS should test all
cattle offered for importation into the United States from Mexico for tuberculosis before allowing the cattle into
this country. Other commenters understood that APHIS does indeed require cattle offered for importation from Mexico
to be tested or, in the case of cattle imported for immediate slaughter under &sect;92.429, accompanied by a certificate
stating that they have been examined and found free from evidence of communicable disease, before allowing the cattle
into this country. Those commenters did, however, state that APHIS should do a better job of testing or alter its methods
to include a 60-day pre-entry quarantine followed by a tuberculosis test for cattle offered for importation into
the United States from Mexico. As mentioned above, we are considering rulemaking that would establish additional
quarantine and testing requirements similar to those mentioned by the commenter. Until such time as additional quarantine
and testing requirements are put in place, we will continue to utilize the available tools and methods in our efforts
to prevent the entry into the United States of tuberculosis from Mexico.

One commenter stated that while APHIS has said that M-branding is necessary to facilitate the disease eradication
and surveillance objectives of the National Cooperative State/Federal Tuberculosis Eradication Program, it has
failed to establish how M-branding actually serves those objectives. Because of that failure, it follows that there
is no rational basis to support the expansion of M-branding to spayed heifers and those provisions of the proposed
rule dealing with the branding of spayed heifers should be withdrawn. We believe that we have established the need
for M-branding in previous rulemakings. The permanence of branding is perhaps the key factor in our reliance on M-branding;
other identification methods can be lost, removed, or obscured. As we have stated before, M-branding is the only permanent,
readily visible means we have to identify cattle imported into the United States from Mexico. We believe that the higher
incidence of tuberculosis in Mexico makes it necessary for us to be able to identify such cattle when searching for
the origin of a tuberculosis-infected animal. If we can determine that a diseased animal originated in Mexico, we
will not waste time and effort searching for its herd of origin in the United States. Conversely, if the animal is not
M-branded, we can concentrate our disease traceback efforts to those cattle that are more likely to be of U.S. origin.
We continue to believe that M-branding serves the needs of our tuberculosis eradication efforts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the comments discussed above, some of the commenters raised issues that are not within the scope of the
proposed rule and, in some cases, are not within APHIS' regulatory purview. Those issues related to: The treatment
of calves by veal producers, the treatment of geese by fois gras producers, the treatment of chickens by poultry producers,
horse roping for sport in Mexico, rodeos in Mexico and the United States, the use of bovine growth hormone in dairy herds,
banning shetitah (the slaughtering of animals for food in the manner prescribed by Jewish law), conditions at zoos
in the United States, government spending to promote fur exports, the transportation of farm animals and the care
of animals injured during movement, ``factory farming,'' and the welfare of laboratory animals. Because such comments
are outside the scope of the proposed rule, no changes have been made in this final rule as a result of those comments.
Any regulatory changes related to those issues within APHIS' regulatory purview would have to be proposed as part
of a separate proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the proposed rule and in this document, we are adopting the provisions
of the proposal as a final rule, with the changes discussed in this document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The rule has been determined to be not significant for the
purposes of Executive Order 12866 and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cattle imported from Mexico account for about 1 percent of the total U.S. cattle population, which in 1991 stood at
99.4 million head. The average price per head for cattle from Mexico in 1991 was $350, with the total value of imported
Mexican cattle exceeding $361 million for the year. During 1991, approximately 1 million live cattle were imported
into the United States from Mexico. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are amending the animal importation regulations to require that certain spayed heifers imported into the United
States from Mexico be marked with a permanent, legible ``M
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' on the right hip, and that certain steers imported into the United States from Mexico be marked with a permanent,
legible ``M'' on the right hip, rather than on the jaw. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three primary considerations led APHIS to conclude that the marking requirements contained in this rule will not
have an economic impact on any U.S. entities, large or small. First, all steers imported into the United States from
Mexico, except those steers imported for immediate slaughter or in-bond for feeding and return to Mexico, were already
required to be identified with an M-brand. For these steers, which represent 99 percent of the cattle imported into
the United States from Mexico, only the location of the ``M'' has changed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second consideration follows from the first: That is, although there had been no provisions in the regulations
requiring spayed heifers to be permanently identified as being of Mexican origin, spayed heifers represent less
than 1 percent of the cattle imported into the United States from Mexico. Thus, requiring certain spayed heifers to
be marked with an ``M
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' prior to arriving at the U.S. port of entry will have an insignificant effect on exporters or importers of spayed
heifers from Mexico. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third consideration is that the cost of marking the cattle, which is negligible, will be borne by the Mexican exporter
of the cattle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, we expect this rule will have no significant economic impact on any large or small entities because its
provisions will not significantly increase or decrease their cost of doing business. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are adopting as a final rule, without change, an interim rule that amended the regulations by adding Portugal to
the list of countries where bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) exists, because the disease has been detected
in native cattle in that country. The interim rule prohibited or restricted the importation of certain fresh, chilled,
and frozen meat, and certain other animal products and animal byproducts from ruminants which have been in Portugal.
The interim rule was necessary to reduce the risk that BSE could be introduced into the United States.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 218(a) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (NWPA) includes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the following directive: ``The Secretary [of the Department of Energy (DOE)] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall establish a demonstration program in cooperation with the private 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sector, for the dry storage of spent nuclear fuel at civilian nuclear reactor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
power sites, with the objective of establishing one or more technologies that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the [Nuclear Regulatory] Commission may, by rule, approve for use at the sites 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of civilian nuclear power reactors without, to the maximum extent practicable, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the need for additional site-specific approvals by the Commission.'' After 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsequent DOE technical evaluations and based on a full review of all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available data, the Commission approved dry storage of spent nuclear fuel in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rule published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 18, 1990 (55 FR 29181). The final rule established a new Subpart K within 10 CFR Part 72 entitled ``General License
for Storage of Spent Fuel at Power Reactor Sites.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Irradiated reactor fuel has been handled under dry conditions since the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mid-1940s when irradiated fuel examinations began in hot cells. Light-water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactor fuel has been examined dry in hot cells, since approximately 1960. Irradiated reactor fuel has been stored
continuously at hot cells under dry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions for approximately two decades. The NRC's experience with storage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of spent fuel in dry casks is extensive as described in the proposed rule to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establish 10 CFR Part 72, Subpart K (May 5, 1989; 54 FR 19379). Further, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
United States has extensive experience in the licensing and safe operation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
independent spent fuel storage installations (ISFSIs). By the end of 1994, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
six site-specific licenses for dry cask storage will have been issued: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Virginia Power's Surry Station, issued July 2, 1986; Carolina Power and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Light's (CP&amp;L) HB Robinson Station, issued August 13, 1986; Duke Power's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Oconee Station, issued January 29, 1990; Public Service of Colorado's Fort 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
St. Vrain facility, issued November 4, 1991; Baltimore Gas and Electric's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(BG&amp;E) Calvert Cliffs Station, issued November 25, 1992; and Northern States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Power's (NSP) Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant, issued October 19, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1993. All except NSP have commenced operation and loaded fuel. At the end of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1994, dry storage spent fuel inventories of these utilities are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
500 assemblies at Virginia Power, 60 assemblies at CP&amp;L, 530 assemblies at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Duke Power, 1480 fuel elements at Public Service of Colorado, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
190 assemblies at BG&amp;E. NSP plans to begin storing fuel soon. In May 1993, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consumers Power's Palisades Station commenced operation and loaded fuel under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the provisions of the general license in 10 CFR Part 72, Subpart K. At the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
end of 1994, approximately 168 assemblies are stored at Palisades.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a result of the growing use of dry storage technology, the NRC has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gained over 35 staff years of experience in the review and licensing of dry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spent fuel storage systems. In addition, the NRC draws upon the knowledge and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experience of outside scientists and engineers recognized as experts within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their respective fields in the performance of the independent safety analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the system and component designs submitted by applicants for dry cask 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licenses or certification. Reviews of numerous applications seeking site- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific licenses, certificates of compliance, or approvals of topical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reports, have been conducted over the past eight years. More recently, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
June 2, 1994 (59 FR 28496), which proposed to amend 10 CFR 72.214 to include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one additional spent fuel storage cask (i.e., the VECTRA Technologies, Inc., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standardized NUHOMS Horizontal Modular Storage System) on the list of approved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spent fuel storage casks that power reactor licensees may use under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions of a general license issued by NRC in accordance with 10 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part 72, Subpart K. The Standardized NUHOMS consists of two systems: (1) The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NUHOMS&hyph;24P holds 24 specified pressurized-water reactor spent fuel assemblies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and (2) The NUHOMS&hyph;52B holds 52 specified boiling-water reactor spent fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assemblies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequent to the expiration of the 75-day public comment period on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
August 16, 1994, NRC received a request, dated August 11, 1994, for a 6-week 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extension of the comment period from Connie Kline of the Sierra Club on behalf 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 12 citizen groups. The extension request asserted that several proprietary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documents related to this rulemaking were not available to the public for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately 2 weeks at the beginning of the comment period. The NRC granted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the request on August 29, 1994 (59 FR 44381) by extending the public comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period to September 30, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
VECTRA Technologies, Inc. (formerly Pacific Nuclear Fuel Services, Inc.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted to the NRC a Safety Analysis Report (SAR) entitled ``Safety Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Report for the Standardized NUHOMS Horizontal Modular Storage System for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Irradiated Nuclear Fuel,'' NUH&hyph;003, Revision 2, dated November 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequently, VECTRA Technologies, Inc. provided additional information to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC related to the SAR. In March 1994, the NRC issued a draft Safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Evaluation Report (SER) entitled ``Safety Evaluation Report of Pacific Nuclear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fuel Services, Inc. Safety Analysis Report for the Standardized NUHOMS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Horizontal Storage System for Irradiated Nuclear Fuel'' approving the SAR. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC issued a draft Certificate of Compliance by letter to Mr. Robert D. Quinn 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from Mr. Frederick C. Sturz dated April 28, 1994. These documents are part of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the docket and record that support the proposed rule published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
on June 2, 1994 (59 FR 28496). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The objective of 10 CFR Part 72 is to protect the public health and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety by providing for the safe confinement of the stored fuel and preventing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the degradation of the fuel cladding. The review criteria used by the NRC for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review and approval of dry cask storage under 10 CFR Part 72 consider the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following factors: siting, design, quality assurance, emergency planning, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training, and physical protection of the fuel. Phenomena such as earthquakes, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
high winds, tornados, tornado driven missiles, lightning, and floods are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in the review of a specific system, either for a certificate of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance or a site-specific license. In addition, applicants must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrate to NRC's satisfaction that their proposed dry cask system will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resist man-made events such as explosions, fire, and drop or tipover 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accidents.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on further NRC review and analysis of public comments, both the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SER and Certificate of Compliance for the Standardized NUHOMS were modified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section M contains a description of changes to the SER and Certificate of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compliance in response to public comments. The NRC finds that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standardized NUHOMS, as designed and when fabricated and used in accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the conditions specified in its Certificate of Compliance, meets the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of 10 CFR Part 72. Thus, use of the Standardized NUHOMS, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approved by the NRC, will provide adequate protection of the public health and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety and the environment. With this final rule, the NRC is approving the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of the Standardized NUHOMS under the general license in 10 CFR Part 72, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subpart K, by holders of power reactor operating licenses under 10 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part 50. Simultaneously, the NRC is issuing a final Certificate of Compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be effective on January 23, 1995. A copy of the Certificate of Compliance is available for public inspection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the proposed addition of the Standardized NUHOMS, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
239 comments in 27 letters with one supplement were received from individuals, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public interest groups, an environmental group, an association, industry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representatives, a city, states, and one Federal agency. One commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
withdrew his comments. Many of these letters contained similar comments that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been grouped together and addressed as a single issue. All comments have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been grouped into 15 broad issues designated A through O. A summary of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments and an NRC analysis and response to those comments is included for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each broad issue. The NRC has identified and responded to 89 separate issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that include the significant points raised by each commenter.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of comments were related to the disposal of high-level waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the use of dry cask storage technology in general, rather than to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptability of this particular cask. Examples of these comments include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_The Federal Government's failure to resolve questions about the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permanent storage of nuclear waste leaves both the plant and public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with limited options: additional storage in pools, additional storage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in dry casks, or plant shutdown. The Federal Government has an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obligation to resolve the issue of permanent or interim storage. It 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be difficult to overstate the need for dispatch in doing so, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hundreds of American communities will eventually face this problem. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_It is not fair to the public of Ohio to link Toledo Edison Company's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attempts to continue the safe storage of its nuclear fuel with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insistence by others that the NRC shut down Davis-Besse and every other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nuclear plant in the country. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Only dry storage casks that are compatible with future DOE interim or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permanent storage operation, including transportation, should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approved for use under the general license and listed in 10 CFR 72.214.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These comments deal with broad policy and program issues relating to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage and disposal of high-level radioactive waste, including the DOE's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repository program and as such are beyond the scope of this rule. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there is a summary of relevant information on many of these broad issues in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Group G. Many comments were directed at the Standardized NUHOMS&hyph;24P with only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a few comments being specific to the Standardized NUHOMS&hyph;52B. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters discussed topics that were not the subject of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking and thus were not specifically addressed by the NRC staff as a part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this final rule action. These comments express opposition to the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dry cask storage and included the following suggestions and topics: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Nuclear plants generating radioactive waste should be shut down. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The production of radioactive waste should be stopped when the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing spent fuel pool (and off-load-reactor capacity) is full. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A formal hearing should be required at each site using dry storage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
casks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The Davis-Besse plant should be shut down. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The use of nuclear power should be stopped and existing sites 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cleaned up. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Palisades experienced problems in using the VSC&hyph;24 cask. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Alternative forms of power should be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, many commenters expressed concern over the ability of dry cask 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage designs, presumably including the Standardized NUHOMS, to store spent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel safely. The following responses to these comments reflect a small but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
important portion of the NRC's review of health, safety, and environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aspects of the Standardized NUHOMS to ensure that the cask is designed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide protection of the public health and safety and environment under both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
normal conditions and severe, unlikely but credible, accident conditions. Dry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cask storage systems are massive devices, designed and analyzed to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shielding from direct exposure to radiation, to confine the spent fuel in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safe storage condition, and to prevent releases of radiation to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment. They are designed to perform these tasks by relying on passive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heat removal and confinement systems without moving parts and with minimal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reliance on human intervention to safely fulfill their function for the term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of storage. The NRC staff has concluded that the methods of analysis are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conservative and assure that the design has appropriate margins of safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under both normal and accident conditions.

Analysis of Public Comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A. A number of commenters raised issues relating to cask handling and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the ability of the cask to withstand drop and tipover accidents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A.1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters wanted the transfer cask containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Dry Storage Canister (DSC) to be analyzed for the maximum possible drop, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regardless of whether that drop can occur inside or outside the spent fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
building. One commenter alleged that a drop of the transfer cask into the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spent fuel pool would damage fuel assemblies in the pool. Another commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was concerned about jamming the transfer cask in the spent fuel pool. What 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would happen to the cask if jammed fuel could not be extricated? Would the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entire 40 ton transfer cask be left in the fuel pool? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Use of the Standardized NUHOMS inside the fuel handling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
building would be conducted in accordance with the 10 CFR Part 50 reactor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operating license. These cask handling operations, including loading, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retrieval, and training, must be evaluated by the general licensee as required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by 10 CFR 72.212(b)(4) to ensure that procedures are clear and can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducted safely. Load handling activities and possible load drop events with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
structural and radiological consequences related to transfer cask drops inside 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the spent fuel building are subject to the provisions of 10 CFR 50.59. Thus, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the licensee must determine whether the activities involve any unreviewed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility safety question or any change in facility technical specifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The transfer cask and DSC designs were evaluated by the NRC against the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria for controlling heavy loads that are found in NRC's NUREG&hyph;0612,
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Control of Heavy Loads at Nuclear Power Plants,'' and American National 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standards Institute (ANSI) N14.6, ``Special Lifting Devices for Shipping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Containers Weighing 10,000 Pounds or More.'' The lifting yoke associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the transfer cask is a special purpose device designed to ANSI N14.6 criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to ensure that the yoke can safely lift the wet transfer cask containing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DSC out of the spent fuel pool and can safely lift the dry transfer cask and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DSC to the transport trailer. Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.59, for those reactor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plants with a shipping cask drop analysis, the licensee must verify that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shipping cask drop analysis adequately describes the consequences of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
postulated transfer cask drop and that no unreviewed safety question exists. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For those reactor plants that may lack a shipping cask drop analysis, each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licensee must perform a transfer cask drop analysis pursuant to 10 CFR 50.59.

Specific requirements for lifting the transfer cask are contained in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certificate of Compliance and SER. However, movement of the transfer cask in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the spent fuel pool building must, as required by 10 CFR 72.212(b)(4), be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluated by the licensee pursuant to 10 CFR 50.59. The possibility of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jamming a transfer cask while in the spent fuel pool is one of many issues to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be evaluated under 10 CFR 50.59. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A.2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter asked why the transfer cask with the DSC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can be lifted to 80 inches outside the spent fuel pool building when it has to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be unloaded and inspected for damage if it drops from above 15 inches. Why 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not limit the height to 15 inches? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The transfer cask with the DSC rides on the transport 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trailer at a height of greater than 15 inches and therefore was analyzed for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drop from that height (80 inches). A drop from a height between 15 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
80 inches does not pose a public health and safety hazard. However, to ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety the NRC requires the DSC to be unloaded and inspected for damage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A.3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter asked about the tipover analysis or drop 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis result. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The tipover, end drops, and horizontal drop analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
form part of the structural design basis for the Standardized NUHOMS design. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The designer, VECTRA, described these drop and tipover analyses in SAR, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 8.2.5. The NRC's evaluation of the vendor's analyses is described in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SER, Section 3.2.2.3E. The NRC found the results of these analyses to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfactory, because the calculated stresses were all within the allowable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Code. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A.4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters, citing Section 1.1.1 of the draft 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certificate of Compliance, requested that the postulated cask drop accident in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the plant fuel handling area be included in the list of parameters and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyses that will need verification by the system user (for the 10 CFR 50.59 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety evaluation). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated in Section 1.1.1 of the draft Certificate of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compliance, a holder of a 10 CFR Part 50 license before use of the general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
license under 10 CFR Part 72, must determine whether activities related to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage of spent fuel involve any unreviewed facility safety issues or changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in facility technical specifications as provided under 10 CFR 50.59. Fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handling including the possible drop of a spent fuel cask is among the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities that are required to be verified. Fuel handling operations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including spent fuels and fresh fuels, are routine within the nuclear power 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plant and are subject to NRC regulation under 10 CFR Part 50. A holder of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 CFR Part 50 license is required to establish operating procedures for spent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel handling and to provide emergency planning to address a potential cask 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drop accident in the reactor's fuel handling area (Certificate of Compliance, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1.1.4). Therefore the NRC considers it clear that the spent fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation in the nuclear power plant should be evaluated to verify that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible drop of a spent fuel cask does not raise an unreviewed safety issue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or require a facility technical specification change appropriately regulated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under 10 CFR Part 50. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A.5. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter stated that there is no place to unload 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the spent fuel in the event of a canister breach. There is no indication that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the canister, the canister lifting mechanism, or the transport mechanism to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
move the canister into the cask, are nuclear grade equipment or have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designed to prevent a single failure from breaching the canister and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumventing the protection provided by the sole barrier provided by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
canister wall itself. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
According to 10 CFR 72.122(1), storage systems must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designed to allow ready retrieval of the spent fuel in storage. A general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licensee using an NRC-approved cask must maintain the capability to unload a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cask. Typically, this will be done by maintaining the capability to unload a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cask in the reactor fuel pool. Other options are under consideration that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would permit unloading a cask outside the reactor pool.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With respect to canister equipment and design, the DSC or canister is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designed to the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (BPVC), Section III, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsection NB. The DSC provides a containment boundary for the radioactive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
material and the cladding of the fuel rods provides confinement of fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pellets. Only intact fuel assemblies (rods) with no known cladding defects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greater than pin holes and hairline cracks are permitted to be stored. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approach assures the structural integrity of the fuel to confine the fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pellets and its retrivability. In the unlikely event of a breach that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required the canister to be unloaded, the canister can be returned to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactor spent fuel pool. Therefore, it is incorrect to assert that there is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no place to unload a canister. The Horizontal Storage Module (HSM) is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designed to American Concrete Institute (ACI) 349, which is the required code 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for nuclear structures made of reinforced concrete. The transfer cask is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designed according to the ASME BPVC, Section III, Subsection NC; ANSI-N14.6 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for heavy loads; ANSI&hyph;50.9 for load combinations; and NUREG/CR 1815 for impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing. Because the cask itself is required to meet such exacting standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of construction, the transport mechanism and the trailer that move the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
canister into the HSM are not considered to be important to safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the design that meets industry standards is sufficient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. A number of commenters raised issues relating to releases of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
radioactivity from surface contamination and leakage from the casks under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
normal and accident conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B.1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter pointed out that the Certificate of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compliance Surveillance Requirement 1.2.12 does not have a section stating the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action that is to be taken when the contamination level in the transfer cask 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceeds limits after the DSC has been transferred to the concrete HSM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Certificate of Compliance Surveillance Requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in Section 1.2.12 has been modified to clarify that decontamination of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transfer cask is required if the surface contamination limit is exceeded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B.2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter, who was concerned with the seismic events at the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station, stated that a displacement
pulse of 60 cm, as observed in the Lander's quake in the Mojave Desert northeast of Los Angeles, would completely destroy
the HSM and allow a substantial release of radioactivity from the fuel within. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The potential for a seismic event is not the same at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
every reactor site in the United States. For Davis-Besse, the maximum ground 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
displacement has been calculated to be 3.33 inches (8.46 cm), corresponding to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a 0.15g maximum ground acceleration. This is substantially less than the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
displacement observed in the Lander's quake and appears to be well within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design of the Standardized NUHOMS. Each general licensee using the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standardized NUHOMS, including Davis-Besse is required to document their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluations to determine that the reactor site parameters, including seismic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
events, envelope the cask design basis, as specified in its SAR and SER. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B.3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter, citing a Wisconsin Public Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commission draft environmental impact statement (EIS) for Point Beach, asked 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for an explanation of why NUHOMS and metal casks have a greater potential to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spread contamination than the Pacific Sierra Nuclear Associates ventilated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage cask (VSC) system, VSC&hyph;24 cask.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The specific rationale that forms the basis of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement in the Wisconsin Public Service Commission's draft EIS for Point 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Beach was not documented. The decontamination requirements for the two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designs are comparable. The VSC&hyph;24 DSC is loaded into the ventilated concrete 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cask (VCC) forming the VSC. The VSC is then transported from inside the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactor auxiliary building to the storage pad. During moving and storage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the VCC, the exterior surface remains clean because it has not been exposed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contamination in the spent fuel pool. The NUHOMS DSC is moved in the transfer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cask from the reactor building to the horizontal storage module in the field. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the transfer cask has been in the spent fuel pool, it may have small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amounts of external contamination that have the potential to spread during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transit. However, any potential contamination of this type could not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant. The NRC requires that the limits for surface contamination, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
workers' dose, and environmental dose must all be met for the operation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ISFSI, including during any transfer operations. Each 10 CFR Part 50 licensee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must have a radiation protection program to monitor operations to ensure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surface contamination and worker and public exposure to radiation are below 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptable levels and as low as is reasonably achievable (ALARA). Past 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation of the NUHOMS shows that the doses are well below all NRC limits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B.4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter ``is concerned that heat generated by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fission product decay may provide the driving force, the presence of free 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
moisture in water-logged fuel may, in a non-mechanistic way, provide a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transport mechanism for fission product release and the ambient air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circulating through the cask concrete structure may provide (an unmonitored) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pathway to the biosphere.'' One commenter remained concerned about the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possibility of insufficient drying of the fuel before placement in the DSC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter, citing the Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratory Report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PNL&hyph;5987 on the removal of moisture from degraded fuel during vacuum drying, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contends that the mechanism for free moisture and radionuclide release that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pertain in normal or upset conditions, such as conditions caused by sabotage, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have not been simulated adequately. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The DSC is a closed vessel. There is no path available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for release of fission products from inside the DSC to the atmosphere. During 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
normal operation, the circulating air, as it passes through the HSM and around 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the outside of the DSC to remove the heat, never comes in contact with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fission products and therefore, could not remove these products from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cavity of the DSC. Moreover, design basis accidents under upset conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were postulated and analyzed in the SAR and SER. These analyses show that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heat generated from fission product decay is not capable of breaching the DSC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and could not provide the driving force for a release of radioactivity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, it is not expected that any significant amount of moisture will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remain in the fuel after it is loaded into the DSC. The fuel is dried after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it has been loaded into the DSC and the topcover plate seal welded to the DSC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shell. The Certificate of Compliance requires two pump-downs to a vacuum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pressure of less than 3 mm Hg each with a holding time of greater than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30 minutes. A stable vacuum pressure of less than 3 mm Hg further assures that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all liquid water has evaporated in the DSC cavity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The safeguards issue of radiological sabotage of storage casks has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reviewed previously and assessed in the 1989 proposed rule to add Subparts K 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and L to 10 CFR Part 72 (54 FR 19379). The NRC has determined that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standardized NUHOMS is sufficiently robust such that the effects of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
successful attack would have low health consequences and are similar to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results presented in the 1989 proposed rule. (see also response to comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
N.1)

C. A number of comments were received that focused on monitoring, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveillance, and inspection activities associated with dry cask storage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spent fuel, particularly as they relate to the Standardized NUHOMS.

Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter stated that there are neither active nor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
passive systems in place to mitigate barrier breaches, nor are there active 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
radiation monitors that would indicate a breach has occurred. There are no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitored drains and sumps nor are there retention basins. The commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stated that the cask is insufficient to be relied upon for the health and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety of Ohioans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Certificate of Compliance (Section 1.3) for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standardized NUHOMS includes surveillance and monitoring requirements that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more than sufficient to detect cask degradation in time to ensure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequate corrective actions can and will be taken. In addition, radiation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring and environmental monitoring programs would detect any radiation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
leak in excess of NRC limits from an NRC-approved cask. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In some instances, the NRC has required continuous monitoring where it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is needed to determine when corrective action needs to be taken. Under a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general license, to date, the NRC has accepted continuous pressure monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the inert helium atmosphere as an indicator of acceptable performance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mechanical closure seals for dry spent fuel storage casks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the NRC does not consider continuous monitoring for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standardized NUHOMS double-weld seals to be necessary because:

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) There are no known long-term degradation mechanisms which would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cause the seal to fail within the design life of the DSC; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The possibility of corrosion has been included in the design (see 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SER Section 3.2.2.5). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These conditions ensure that the internal helium atmosphere will remain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stable. Therefore, an individual continuous monitoring device for each HSM is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not necessary. However, the NRC considers that other forms of monitoring, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including periodic surveillance, inspection and survey requirements, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application of preexisting radiological environmental monitoring programs of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 CFR Part 50 during the use of the canisters with seal weld closures can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequately satisfy NRC requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the use of instrumentation and control systems to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitor systems that are important to safety, the user of the Standardized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NUHOMS will, as provided in Chapter 14 of the SER and in Section 1.3.2 of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certificate of Compliance, be required to verify, the cask thermal performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on a daily basis by a temperature measurement, to identify conditions that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threaten to approach cask design temperature criteria. The cask user will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also be required to conduct a daily visual surveillance of the cask air inlets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and outlets as required by Chapter 12 of the SER and Section 1.3.1 of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certificate of Compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the HSM and DSC are considered components important to safety, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they are not considered operating systems in the same sense as spent fuel pool 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooling water systems or ventilation systems that may require other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instrumentation and control systems to ensure proper functioning. Due to this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
passive design, temperature monitoring and surveillance activities are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate and sufficient to assure adequate protection of the public health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and safety for this design. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the Standardized NUHOMS DSC is welded closed and has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decontaminated before being placed in a HSM, there is no routine radioactive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liquid generation that would require a retention basin or sump. Water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entering the storage area has no mechanism of becoming contaminated because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the DSC is enclosed within the HSM and is expected to be dried by the heat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generated during storage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter expressed concern over the possible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
external corrosion of the stainless steel DSC because of exposure to water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
over decades. Another commenter expressed concern about corrosion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stainless steel under conditions of indefinite duration, stating that while 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stainless steel corrodes less rapidly than carbon steel, even the plumbing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fixture industry is finding unexpected stainless steel pitting and corrosion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under conditions far less intense than those in a DSC. Another commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stated that the system is not designed for remote inspection of the DSC for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrosion while it is in the HSM and that the only way to inspect the DSC is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to return it to the spent fuel pool. Periodic inspection of the DSC is needed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to preclude or identify gradual canister deterioration by unknown mechanisms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter inquired about a checking system for the NUHOMS in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
future. How will corrosion be evaluated on the canister (DSC) and the support 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rails inside the HSM? Is it possible for them to accumulate moisture and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrode together over possibly many years of storage? What check is required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the possibility that the canister couldn't be removed at the end of cask 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
life?

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The DSC is enclosed within the HSM and is not exposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to external water. Laboratory experiments have indicated a general corrosion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate of less than 0.00001 inches per year for similar stainless steels. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC believes these experiments more accurately bound DSC corrosion than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experiences in unrelated industries. For the 50-year design life of the DSC, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the expected corrosion would therefore not result in exceeding a corrosion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
depth of 0.0005 inches. This will not affect the DSC performing its intended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety functions. Because of the low corrosion rates expected for stainless 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
steel, periodic inspections for deterioration of the DSC are not considered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary. Therefore, inspections are not required. The support rails for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the DSC have an extremely hard-alloy steel applied to the sliding surface, are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ground to a smooth finish, and are coated with a dry film lubricant to prevent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrosion and to reduce the coefficient of friction. Furthermore, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment inside the HSM is protected from rain and it is kept dry by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heat load from the DSC. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that corrosion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between the stainless steel and the hard alloy steel surface of the support 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rail will occur to any significant extent. These conclusions and analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding the very small likelihood of corrosion indicate that there is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonable assurance that the DSC can be removed from the HSM when required.

Comment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter questioned whether the screens between the casks, which are essential to cooling, will remain clear
of debris and how 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they can be cleaned if they become partially clogged. Another commenter was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerned about how the roof screen was inspected, stating that it seems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
likely that insects, animals, and birds will be attracted to the warm air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coming from the outlet vents. Several commenters remained concerned about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vent blockage that can completely cover and block screening and vents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particularly from insects such as paper wasps, that build huge nests, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
swarms of midges that are common to the Great Lakes. How are the screens 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attached?

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As stated in the Certificate of Compliance, a licensee using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Standardized NUHOMS must conduct a daily visual surveillance of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exterior of air inlets and outlets (front wall and roof bird screen). In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, the licensee must perform a daily close-up inspection to ensure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no material accumulates between the modules to block the air flow. If the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveillance shows blockage of air vents, the licensee is required to clear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the vent blockage by following procedures developed by each user of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standardized NUHOMS. If the screen is damaged, the licensee must replace the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
screen. The required daily surveillance and temperature measurements should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
readily detect blockage of the vents or screens by insects, animals, or birds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a timely manner, leading to the removal of the obstruction before damage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occurs from high temperatures. The bird screen is made of stainless steel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wire cloth tack-welded to stainless steel strips, which are attached to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HSM with stainless steel wedge anchors.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter expressed concern about the presence of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burrowing and other nuisance animals that have posed problems at other waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sites. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Burrowing and other nuisance animals are not expected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to pose problems for the Standardized NUHOMS. Because of the robust system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design, animals will not be able to get to the radioactive material or cause 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
damage such that water could cause movement of the radioactive material. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Burrowing under the concrete pad would not cause damage to safety-related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
components. Further, large-scale burrowing would likely be detected by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
daily surveillance or other activities related to the operation of the storage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter wanted additional radiation monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because of the calculated higher dose rates over previous NUHOMS designs. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter stated that these higher dose rates are not consistent with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
objective of maintaining occupational exposures ALARA, and that site-specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications should provide detailed procedures and plans to meet ALARA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidelines and 10 CFR Part 20 requirements with respect to operation and

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 No additional radiation monitoring has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifically identified or required for the Standardized NUHOMS. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 CFR Parts 20, 50, and 72 require that licensees comply with ALARA. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, 10 CFR 72.212(b)(6) requires each licensee to review its radiation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection program to determine that their effectiveness is not decreased by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of the Standardized NUHOMS. Further, 10 CFR 72.212 (b)(9) requires each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licensee to conduct storage activities in accordance with appropriate written 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures. If the results of these licensee activities indicate that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional procedures are required then the licensee is required to implement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the procedures.

 One commenter was concerned about the optical survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment used to align the transfer cask with the HSM before transfer. What 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
checks are made on this optical equipment and what regulations apply?

Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The optical equipment used to align the transfer cask 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the HSM is optional and is an operational convenience. However, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licensee must meet Technical Specifications 1.2.9 in the Certificate of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compliance. Therefore, only appropriate calibrations or checks to assure

compliance with this technical specification are appropriate.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter wants to know who evaluates the insertion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or retrieval of the DSC for excessive vibration and what is the result of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excessive vibration. Would this allow crud to be released? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC Certificate of Compliance, Section 1.2.9 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides that the cask user observe the transfer system during DSC insertion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or retrieval to ensure that motion or excessive vibration does not occur. It 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also prescribes certain follow-up actions to be taken by the cask user in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
event that alignment tolerances are exceeded and excessive vibration occurs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is possible that excessive vibration could dislodge crud. However, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
crud would be contained within the DSC and would not be released to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
atmosphere because the DSC is a sealed vessel. Any opening of the DSC will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under controlled conditions that should safely contain the crud and prevent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its release to the environment.

Several commenters wanted the NRC to set definite 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methods for the required surveillance and monitoring of NUHOMS, including the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
daily temperature measurements, so that data are uniform and standardized for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
future reference on different modules at different reactor locations.

Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC Certificate of Compliance for the Standardized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NUHOMS has required temperature measurements. However, the licensee or vendor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has latitude in determining how the performance-based temperature requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be met. The NRC is not convinced that the possible benefits of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uniform, but prescriptive, surveillance and monitoring system or technique 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would outweigh the costs of curtailing the freedom of cask users to design an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation scheme suited to their individual needs. The collection of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uniform data for possible future use, but without a specific regulatory need 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could lead to additional exposure to workers, or adversely affect safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without any offsetting benefit.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the concrete module at a specific time and be opened?

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The design life of the Standardized NUHOMS is 50 years 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as described in the SAR. The Certificate of Compliance has a 20-year approval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period that can be renewed by NRC for another 20 years following a safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reevaluation. It is expected, that at the end of operation, the canister will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be removed from the concrete module and will be opened in the spent fuel pool 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility or an adequate dry environment alternative. The fuel will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transferred to an NRC-approved shipping cask for off-site transportation and

Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters wanted, in the interest of ALARA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principles, the capacity for approximately 24 kW heat removal to be verified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by using an artificial heat load. One commenter suggested that the NUHOMS be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tested with a full heat load at a testing site such as Idaho National 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Engineering Laboratory (INEL), and not at each reactor site that may load it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with a higher heat generation rate fuel. Another commenter cited the ALARA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
philosophy of loading the oldest fuel first even though design basis fuel is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on site. Several commenters wanted deletion of the requirement (a literal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interpretation of draft Certificate of Compliance) to calculate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature rise for each HSM loaded with canisters producing less than the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design limit of 24 kW for the following reasons: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Users are not normally provided the vendor's analytical models for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this calculation,

(3) Because 24 kW is the limit, virtually all the HSMs will be

A licensee is not required by NRC to load the oldest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel first but, in the interest of ALARA, it may do so. However, each time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hotter fuel is loaded up to the maximum allowed in a DSC, the licensee would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
need to verify the heat removal performance of the system. For fuel producing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less heat than the design limits of the system, the heat removal capacity of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the system determined by calculation must be verified by temperature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurements. This process must be repeated each time a DSC is loaded with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hotter fuel until the maximum-system designed heat load is reached. When 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loaded with spent fuel producing 24 kW heat, the system may not have an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ambient and vent outlet temperature difference of more than 100 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F for fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooled equal to or more than 5 years. This verification process is required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to confirm that the as-built system of each licensee is performing as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designed. A licensee could use an artificial heat source to test an initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cask at a bounding heat load of 24 kW before loading fuel. However, this test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would only verify the spent fuel heat removal capacity of the system. It 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not verify as-built performance. Experience has shown that adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
verification testing can be performed at the reactor site. Therefore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performing the verification at a testing site like INEL would not provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional safety margins.

Several commenters pointed out possible conflicting

statements about temperature measurements in the surveillance requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In discussions about the heat removal capacity test, temperatures are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined only during the test period. Daily temperature measurements on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each HSM are required to verify thermal performance.

These two temperature measurement programs have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different objectives. Temperature measurements by licensees to verify the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heat capacity calculations need only be done until equilibrium is reached. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The daily temperature measurements by licensees are intended to demonstrate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continued safe operation within specified limits over the life of the HSM and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may not be the same type of measurement done in the initial period to verify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heat removal capacity.

Regulatory requirements for general licensee users of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dry storage casks are contained in 10 CFR 72.212(b). Each user must verify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the following conditions are not exceeded at their reactor site for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standardized NUHOMS: the maximum average yearly temperature with solar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incidence is 70 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F; the average daily temperature is 100 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->

temperature is 125 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->

As required by the regulations, the licensees are

required to develop detailed procedures. NRC in its regulatory oversite role 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has the opportunity to review the adequacy of the procedures. The requirement

cited by the commenter is a requirement for the licensee to verify a

temperature measurement of the thermal performance for each HSM, not the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combined performance of adjacent modules. A cautionary statement is included 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the basis of the specification to ensure that licensee measurements of air

not the combined performance of adjacent modules.

 One commenter wanted to know how the temperature

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For the first HSM to be emplaced, the user is required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to measure the air inlet and air outlet temperature difference of the system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at equilibrium. This measurement is to ensure that the heat capacity of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system will not be exceeded and that the concrete temperature criteria will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not be exceeded. For the Standardized NUHOMS, this maximum heat capacity is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
24 kW. The 24 kW heat load is the design maximum and is the basis for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thermal hydraulic calculations for the cask. The temperature distribution for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
various parts of the HSM have been calculated (i.e., the roof, walls, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
floor) by the cask vendor. Temperature differences causing thermal stresses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the concrete were evaluated and are duly reported in both the SAR and SER. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These calculations were reviewed by NRC as a part of the overall process for

 One commenter stated that daily temperature measurements are not necessary to ensure convective air flow, given
the requirement to verify that the inlets and outlets are not obstructed. Site-specific NUHOMS require temperature
measurements when the DSC is placed into the HSM, 24 hours later, and again at 1 week after loading to ensure adequate
thermal performance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The NRC disagrees with this comment. The HSM and DSC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are considered components important to safety in the Standardized NUHOMS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Daily temperature measurements of the thermal performance by the licensee are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to provide additional assurance that thermal limits are not exceeded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the general license. This requirement was imposed on the first cask of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this type approved by the NRC and listed in 10 CFR 72.214 for use by a general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licensee, the VSC&hyph;24 cask (58 FR 17967; April 7, 1994) and is now applied to

 Several commenters expressed concern that in the event 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of problems and the need to off-load fuel (as in the recent situation at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Palisades), a transfer cask may not be available in a timely manner because of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inclement weather or because the transfer cask itself has experienced problems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or is being used elsewhere. One commenter expressed concern at having to have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a transfer cask on site within 40 hours of vent blockage to prevent concrete 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
damage. If the transfer cask is leased from VECTRA and is not at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licensee's site, who is liable if something happens that would require the use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a transfer cask?

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The NRC has analyzed all design basis accidents from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the operation of an ISFSI and concluded that there will be no release of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
radioactive material to the environment. The 40-hour limit on vent blockage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is intended to prevent concrete degradation that might occur over a long 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period of storage. A vent blockage accident would not result in the release 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of radioactive material because the DSC would not be breached. Therefore, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC believes that the potential risk to the public health and safety is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extremely small during the time needed to obtain the use of a transfer cask. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, there is no requirement that a transfer cask be at an ISFSI site all the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time.

 Both the vendor's SAR and NRC staff's SER address the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects of tornado winds and missiles during movement of the transfer cask 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with a loaded canister. These analyses show that, for tornado winds, there is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a safety factor of 1.5 against overturning when subjected to Design Basis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tornado winds (a safety factor greater than 1 will generally be adequate for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public protection). The transfer cask stability, tornado missile penetration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resistance, and shell and end plate stresses were calculated and shown to be

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Safety analyses by NRC and the cask vendor show the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standardized NUHOMS can withstand floods and will continue to perform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptably. With regard to the Davis-Besse site, the licensee changed site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
topography during plant construction. Specifically, the area was built up and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some dikes were added. The plant structure's ground floor elevation is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
585 feet International Great Lakes Datum (IGLD), which is also the elevation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the pad. The licensing design basis for maximum probable static water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level on the site is 583.7 feet IGLD. As noted, the HSM and DSC were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluated for flood conditions as required by 10 CFR 72.122(b). The HSM can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
withstand a maximum water velocity of 15 feet per second and a static head of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
50 feet of water. The DSC can withstand a static head of 50 feet of water. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any site that intends to use a Standardized NUHOMS design must evaluate the

Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several comments related to the fuel to be stored in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standardized NUHOMS. One commenter wanted control components contained in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assemblies addressed in the SAR and SER citing DOE acceptance criteria. One 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter questioned how 55,000 MWD/MTU burnup fuel now being used in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pressurized water reactors will be handled since the Standardized NUHOMS&hyph;24 is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rated to handle only 40,000 MWD/MTU burnup fuel. Another commenter, citing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions of current site-specific licensees for other NUHOMS designs, stated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that higher burnup should be allowed if the decay heat and radiological source 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terms are within limits. Another commenter asserted that increased fission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products from higher enriched fuel may potentially increase embrittlement of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fuel cladding and that this needs to be evaluated in the SER. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter further alleged that this would increase the probability of more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defective fuel being loaded into dry casks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The vendor designed the cask system for storage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pressurized water or boiling water reactor fuel assemblies meeting certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifications. By limiting the use of the cask system to assemblies meeting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these specifications, the vendor made a decision that may partially restrict 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the use of the cask. However, the NRC does not require that a cask be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
universal for all types of fuel or be usable at every reactor site. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
example, none of the casks previously listed in 10 CFR 72.214 is usable for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
boiling water reactor spent fuel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, the 55,000 MWD/MTU burnup fuel and fuel with initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrichments of greater than 4% will have to remain in the spent fuel pool 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because dry spent fuel cask designs to store fuel with this higher burnup and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initial enrichment or related to DOE acceptance criteria have not yet been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reviewed and evaluated by the NRC.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several comments were related to criticality safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis. One commenter questioned the conservatism of using 7.5-year cooled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spent fuel when 5-year-cooled fuel is the minimum specified and when older 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel may also be stored in the cask. Another inquired about criticality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety if the original basket geometry were compromised, as might be the case 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for brittle failure of a spacer disk. In the compromised basket geometry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
case, the commenter also asked about the difference in criticality safety for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a helium atmosphere rather than a borated water medium. The commenter, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
referring to July 24, 1992, meeting minutes, inquired why all parties agreed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not to spend any resources to make these criticality safety calculations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Standardized NUHOMS nuclear criticality safety analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is based on the following: (1) Babcock and Wilcox 15 &times; 15/208 pin fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assemblies with initial enrichments up to 4.0 wt% of U-235 and (2) General 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Electric 7 &times; 7 fuel assemblies with initial enrichments up to 4.0 wt% of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U-235, for the Standardized NUHOMS&hyph;24P and NUHOMS&hyph;52B designs respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The age of the fuel that will actually be stored is not relevant in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criticality safety analysis because the analysis assumes storage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unirradiated fresh fuel that is more reactive than cooled spent fuel. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standardized NUHOMS&hyph;24P system has administrative controls that limit the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
irradiated fuel reactivity to less than or equal to 1.45 wt% of U-235 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalent unirradiated fuel (Certificate of Compliance Section 1.2.1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The possibility of a criticality accident caused by the brittle failure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the basket should not be a significant concern. No lifting or handling of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the DSC outside the spent fuel pool building is permitted if the basket 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature is lower than 0
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F. If the user does not determine the actual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basket temperature, the ambient temperature must be used conservatively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under these temperature restrictions, the basket materials will not behave in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a brittle fashion. Consequently, the basket geometry would not be compromised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by brittle failure. As for the criticality safety consideration related to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
helium atmosphere versus a borated water medium, the k
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
eff
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of the fuel in a helium atmosphere is much less than the k
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
eff
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in borated water. Therefore, criticality calculations for the borated water are sufficient because they are more
conservative and therefore would bound calculations using a helium atmosphere.

assessments for the Standardized NUHOMS. One commenter believed that using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10-year-cooled fuel for the dose assessment was nonconservative when 5-year-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooled fuel is needed to load the DSC to produce 24 kW of heat. Another, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
referring to an NRC meeting with Pacific Nuclear Fuel Services, Inc. (PNFSI), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wanted clarification of an NRC request to delete a clause allowing the utility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to perform site-specific shielding calculations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The cask vendor presented dose assessment results in the SAR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for both 5- and 10-year-cooled fuel. However, for this rulemaking, NRC used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the dose assessment for 5-year-cooled fuel for the shielding analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
radiation source term and for accidental releases of radionuclide material. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC's use of the 5-year-cooled fuel assessment is conservative and bounding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure safe storage of spent nuclear fuel in NRC-approved casks, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC specifies, in Section 1.2.1 of the Certificate of Compliance a number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel acceptance parameters. These parameters, which may include burnup, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initial enrichment, heat load, cooling time, and radiological source term, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
define the properties of those assemblies that can be stored in a cask. One 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such parameter of interest for the Standardized NUHOMS is the radiological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
source term that forms the basis of the shielding analyses. For this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameter, the vendor proposed an alternative approach. Specifically, for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel assemblies that fall outside the specified source term parameters but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfy all other parameters, the vendor proposed to allow licensees to do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual cask shielding calculations to show compliance with the design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis dose rates. This could result in more assemblies in a licensee's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inventory that would be eligible for dry storage. In the instance noted in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the comment, the NRC did not agree with the vendor proposal. The Certificate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Compliance dose rate specifications provide a simple check to ensure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DSCs are not inadvertently loaded with the wrong fuel. The dose rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifications are based on the shielding analyses provided by the vendor in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its SAR. Because of differences in non-fuel components in the ends of some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assemblies, dose rates higher than those evaluated by NRC in the SER may occur 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the ends of casks than were assumed in the shielding analysis. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certificate of Compliance specifications allow for this possibility and permit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the licensee to store such fuel provided the licensee verifies proper cask 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fabrication, conformance with all other fuel parameters, and compliance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
radiation protection requirements. The site-specific calculations referred to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the comment are not shielding calculations, but rather are the licensee's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
written evaluations (or dose assessments) required by 10 CFR 72.212(b)(2)(iii) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to establish that the radiation criteria for ISFSI in 10 CFR 72.104 have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
met. The Certificate of Compliance also requires that the licensee submit a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
letter report to the NRC summarizing its actions in this type of case.

Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters were concerned with fuel clad 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
integrity issues. Particularly, they were concerned with potential problems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that may arise because of differences between vertical and horizontal storage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter noted that it was essential to inspect the cladding carefully 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the minute hairline cracks which would allow the radioactivity inside to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
escape. Another commenter wanted it made clear that for fuel to be eligible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for storage it doesn't need to be specifically inspected nor require special 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handling or storage provisions within the spent fuel pool. The commenter also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asserted that pinhole leaks in fuel rod cladding do not constitute gross 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
breaches. The commenter wanted fuel cladding integrity clarified. Another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter claimed that horizontal storage of fuel rods will lead to cladding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deterioration that would challenge the technical specifications of the NUHOMS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cask. Another commenter was concerned about the possibility of fuel rod 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bowing that could result in weighted contact between the fuel cladding/crud 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the DSC guide sleeve, with the potential for eventual bonding of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials over the duration of the storage period. One commenter, noting that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some of the fuel in the spent fuel pools could be nearly 20 years old, was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerned that the fuel will not be tested for leaks using specific techniques 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such as penetrating dyes, eddy current, sipping, or ultrasound before canister 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loading. A commenter wanted all fuel with known defects and all water-logged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel retained in the spent fuel pool until the cask integrity under operating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions is fully demonstrated. Another wanted to know how ``grossly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
breached'' fuel will be ultimately handled and shipped off site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the Standardized NUHOMS, PWR fuel rods are stored in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
horizontal orientation and do not normally deflect in the middle of any span 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
so that the rods contact the DSC guide sleeve. However, the possibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exists that a bowed rod may come in contact with the guide sleeve. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to storage of BWR fuel, the fuel channel that surrounds the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel bundle (rods) provides a barrier to separate coolant flow paths, to guide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the control rod, and to provide rigidity and protection for the fuel bundle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during handling. Therefore, the BWR fuel rods inside the channel do not come 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in contact with the guide sleeves. Even if there were contact with either PWR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or BWR fuel rods, the interaction would not present a significant concern 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because the guide sleeve material is stainless steel, which has a very low 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate of corrosion, and the DSC cavity is evacuated and back-filled with inert 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
helium, which further reduces the likelihood of any corrosion or bonding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involving the guide sleeve and fuel rods.

The Certificate of Compliance requires that the fuel have no known or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suspected gross cladding breaches to ensure the structural integrity of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel. Known or suspected failed fuel assemblies (rods) and fuel with cladding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defects greater than pin holes and hairline cracks are not authorized in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standardized NUHOMS. Fuel meeting this specification will be safely stored 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and will remain intact in storage because the dry inert atmosphere and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relatively low temperature will prevent deterioration of the cladding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Grossly breached fuel will be handled in site-specific license applications.

Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Quite a few comments related to the structural stability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the HSM, particularly its response to earthquakes. Commenters questioned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the possibility of vertical storage of the Standardized NUHOMS and suggested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that it would be very difficult to restrain the HSM if the DSC were in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vertical position. One commenter wanted dry storage casks constructed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Building Officials Code Administrators (BOCA) National Building Code (and Ohio 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrative Code) for structures in use group H&hyph;4, high hazard use, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
includes radioactive materials. Commenters questioned whether ground 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceleration as used by the NRC in its evaluation could adequately describe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all potential earthquakes east of the Rocky Mountain Front and suggested that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a ground acceleration of 2.5g would not be realistic for all sites, despite 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proximity to fault lines. Another commenter alleged a number of seismic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
events in the midwest which had some effect in the Ohio area could cause a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complete failure of the cask and requested that the NRC insist that the cask, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containment structure, and foundation pad be designed to substantially exceed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all earthquakes with a potential for 0.60g. One commenter wanted to know if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the module had been analyzed for earthquake events at all United States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactor sites, according to Laurand Findmun Seismic Hazard Curves. Other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters expressed various concerns about the integrity and reaction of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standardized NUHOMS components under earthquake conditions and asked the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following questions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Could the casks crash against each other as the ground moves beneath 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
them? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Could the module shift, crack, or move off the pad? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
How are the rail support holdings evaluated? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Could the DSC be knocked off the rails? and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Could the module roof crack and fall on the canister? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Standardized NUHOMS design described in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vendor's applications for approval and the SAR does not address vertical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage. Consequently, NRC neither evaluated nor approved vertical storage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the system. Therefore, it may not be stored vertically. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC reviewed the Standardized NUHOMS for compliance with design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria that are more stringent than those of the BOCA National Building Code 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(NBC) (see response to Comment A.5). These more stringent criteria are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in national standards that more closely represent the use of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standardized NUHOMS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part 72 specifies a design basis maximum ground acceleration of 0.25g 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for areas east of the Rocky Mountain Front that are not in areas of known 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seismic activity. All HSMs and DSCs are designed to withstand a 0.25g 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
earthquake. Any reactor licensee who intends to use the Standardized NUHOMS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must verify that the maximum displacements at the cask's location on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactor site are within the design criteria for the system. The Standardized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NUHOMS is free standing and not dependent on the pad for safety. Failure of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the pad caused by seismic events will not cause the Standardized NUHOMS to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fail. Therefore, cask safety does not require the pad to be designed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
withstand a seismic event.

Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before using the Standardized NUHOMS, the general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licensee must evaluate them to ensure the site is encompassed by the design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bases of the approved cask. The events listed in the comment are among the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
site-specific considerations that must be evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The site evaluation for a nuclear plant considers the effects of nearby 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transportation and military activities. It is incumbent upon the user of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cask to determine if the SER for the facility encompasses the design basis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis performed for the Standardized NUHOMS or any certified cask. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
great majority of the aircraft are single-engine propeller airplanes which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
typically weigh on the order of 1,500 to 2,000 pounds. The cask's inherent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design will withstand tornado missiles and other design loads and also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides protection from the collision forces imposed by these light general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aviation aircraft without adverse consequences. NUREG&hyph;800, Section 3.5.1.6 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Standard Review Plan for Light Water Reactors,'' contains methods and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptance criteria for determining if the probability of an accident 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involving larger aircraft (both Military and civilian) exceeds the acceptable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criterion. It is incumbent upon the licensee to determine whether or not the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactor site parameters are enveloped by the cask design basis as required by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 CFR 72.212(b)(3). These would include an evaluation demonstrating that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of 10 CFR 72.106 have been met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Turbine missile analyses typically show a very low probability of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
turbine missile breaking the turbine casing. The site's turbine missile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyses must be considered as part of the facility's analysis of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suitability of the storage location. External fires are handled by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established fire control programs. Explosions are prevented by control of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combustibles under the licensee's fire protection program. Sabotage is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered under the criteria for security programs that each licensee must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implement. (See also response to comment N.1).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters raised issues about the pad and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
foundation for the Standardized NUHOMS. One commenter referred to a previous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking that stated that the NUHOMS casks required site-specific approvals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because they are constructed in place. Other commenters, concerned with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seismic events at the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station and soil stability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issues similar to cask use at the Palisades Plant, asserted that there was a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary relationship of the Standardized NUHOMS cask or module to the pad at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a specific site and that evaluation of it could not be based on the reactor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
site seismic analysis. Each site required singular seismic and soil analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for dynamic loads and not just static loads. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NUHOMS design referred to in the July 18, 1990, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
55 FR 29181, rulemaking includes the site-specific pad as an integral part of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the concrete HSM and therefore it is important to safety. The Standardized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NUHOMS considered in this rulemaking have the HSMs as free-standing units; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that is, they have no structural connections to the pad. The Standardized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NUHOMS does not rely on the pad to perform a safety function to protect public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health and safety. The vendor analyzed the HSM containing the DSC for peak 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ground accelerations of 0.25g caused by earthquakes and found that it would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neither slide nor overturn. NRC evaluated the Standardized NUHOMS under a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wide range of site conditions that could diminish cask safety. Further, under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the NRC general license, before using the Standardized NUHOMS a licensee must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
verify that reactor site parameters are within the envelope of conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reviewed by NRC for the cask approval. If potential conditions exist at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactor site (including potential erosion, soil instability, or earthquakes) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that could unacceptably diminish cask safety by any credible means, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licensee's analysis must include an evaluation of the potential conditions to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
verify that impairment of cask safety is highly unlikely. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC's regulations do not explicitly require a licensee using a cask 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under a general license to evaluate the cask storage pad and foundation under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such site conditions for erosion or earthquakes. If conditions at the reactor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
site could unacceptably diminish cask safety by affecting the stability of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supporting foundation so as to put the cask in an unsafe condition, the cask 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may not be used unless the foundation is appropriately modified or a suitable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
location at the reactor site is found. Implicitly, therefore, the pad and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
underlying foundation materials must be analyzed under site conditions that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include erosion, soil instability, and earthquakes, even though the pad has no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
direct safety function and the cask is designed to retain its integrity even 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assuming the occurrence of a range of site conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee has the responsibility under the general license to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluate the match between reactor site parameters and the range of site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions (i.e., the envelope) reviewed by NRC for an approved cask. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Typically, the licensee will have a substantial amount of information already 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assembled in the Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR) for the nuclear reactor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the envelope for the approved cask is identified in the NRC SER 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Certificate of Compliance and in the cask vendor's SAR for the cask. Of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
course, the licensee should consider whether the envelope evaluated by NRC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequately encompasses the actual location of the cask at the reactor site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee should also consider whether there are any site conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with the actual cask location that could affect cask design and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that were not evaluated in the NRC safety evaluation for the cask.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The vendor analyzed the DSC and the HSM for rigid body response (i.e., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sliding and overturning) to seismic accelerations. The resultant peak 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
horizontal ground acceleration is 0.37g and the peak vertical acceleration is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
0.17g. The margin of safety against sliding is 1.35. Similarly, the design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seismic force will not cause the HSM to tip over because the stabilizing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
moment of the HSM is greater than the seismic overturning moment. The margin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of safety against overturning is 1.26. Thus, no sliding or overturning of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HSM or DSC will occur from the design earthquake. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the pad is not considered a safety-related item, a specific pad 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design is not being approved in this rulemaking for the Standardized NUHOMS.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A few commenters had questions pertaining to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation of and procedures for the Standardized NUHOMS. One commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inquired whether just one module of the Standardized NUHOMS could be purchased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by a utility, or whatever number of modules desired could be procured and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
easily added like singular casks. One commenter expressed concern about snow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removal procedures to prevent blockage of the bottom vents by drifting snow. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter wanted NRC to establish a procedure and criteria for dose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Several commenters noted that a procedure for opening a storage cask and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removing the fuel has not been tried before nor documented in the rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
They were also concerned that unloading of a cask would place workers at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
higher risk.

The NRC Certificate of Compliance does not permit or limit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the number of NUHOMS modules that may be purchased by a general license. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC does not regulate the commercial arrangements between the cask vendor and the users including any provisions
on the number of casks that can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purchased or added to the Standardized NUHOMS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Certificate of Compliance, Section 1.3, the user of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standardized NUHOMS (general licensee) is required to conduct a visual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveillance of the exterior of air inlets and outlets. If the surveillance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shows blockage of air vents, they must be cleaned in accordance with proper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures. These procedures will minimize the potential impact to the health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and safety of workers. The daily temperature measurements indicate proper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thermal performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Certificate of Compliance requires each licensee to develop 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures to implement the dose criteria prescribed on pages A&hyph;15 and A&hyph;16. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On page A&hyph;15 of the Certificate of Compliance, Section 1.26, the dose rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria to be met is equal to or less than: (a) 200 mrem/hr. at the top 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shield plug surface at centerline with water in the cavity; and (b) 400 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mrem/hr. at the top cover plate surface at centerline without water in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cavity. On page A&hyph;16 of the Certificate of Compliance the dose rate criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is less than or equal to: (a) 400 mrem/hr. at 3 feet from the HSM surface; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 100 mrem/hr. outside of the HSM door on center line of the DSC; and (c) 20 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mrem/hr. at the end shield wall exterior. Each licensee is required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
develop its own procedures to implement these criteria. In addition, each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licensee must develop operational procedures for the ISFSI for workers' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
radiation exposure to be ALARA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the Standardized NUHOMS, removal of spent fuel from the DSC is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addressed in Chapter 5 of the SAR and in Chapter 11 of the SER. The process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is essentially the reverse of loading operations and would be performed under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the reactor license radiation protection program. The Certificate of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compliance requires each user to develop written procedures for these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations and includes precautions to be considered for unloading. ALARA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to be addressed by 10 CFR Part 20. Specification 1.1.6 of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certificate of Compliance requires that pre-operational testing and training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exercises include the opening of a DSC and returning the DSC and transfer cask 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the spent fuel pool. The Certificate of Compliance also requires the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training program to include off-normal events.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter, citing the May 1993 study prepared for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the NRC by the Center for Nuclear Waste Regulatory Analyses of San Antonio, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Texas, questioned the relatively higher temperature consequences of dry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage on fuel cladding. The report states that, ``the dry environment has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the potential of producing such problems as further fuel cladding oxidation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increased cladding stresses, and creep deformation as a result of rod internal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pressure *&blank;*&blank;*. These possible spent fuel and cladding alteration modes could be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quite accelerated under dry storage conditions, since temperatures are much 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
higher than in wet storage.'' The commenter does not believe that NRC is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fulfilling its obligation in 10 CFR 72.122(h) to see that ``spent fuel cladding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be protected during storage against degradation that leads to gross 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rupture.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The May 1993 study addresses the long-term geological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal of high-level waste (spent fuel) and is not directed to the short-term interim storage of spent fuel at nuclear
power plants. The report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluates processes over 10,000 years of repository performance for geological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal. The conclusions of the report are not applicable for the interim 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage period of a 20-year cask certificate during which spent fuels stored 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the DSC have to meet the NRC's criteria to ensure that cladding is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protected. Under normal operation of the ISFSI, leakage of radionuclides is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not expected to occur. The design and the double-seal welding of the DSC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
covers are checked and tested to provide structural integrity throughout the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approved storage period. During normal storage conditions, the licensee is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to conduct a radiation monitoring program to ensure protection of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
workers and the safety of the general public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
G. A number of comments were related to broad policy and program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issues in connection with the storage and disposal of high-level radioactive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste, including the DOE repository program. Some commenters questioned the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of dry cask storage and technology in general. Some commenters stated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that only dry storage casks that would be compatible with DOE interim or final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repository operations, including transportation, should be approved for use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under a general license.

. One commenter does not want any more casks approved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
until a permanent Federal repository is opened. The wet fuel pool is a proven 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technology that has been successful in containing radioactivity. Another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter stated that dry storage is dangerous. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The NRC, in implementing the Nuclear Waste Policy Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 1982, has an obligation to review dry storage technologies and to determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether to approve the use of these technologies for the storage of spent fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if they meet applicable safety requirements. The July 18, 1990, 55 FR 29181, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking found that spent fuel stored in dry storage casks designed to meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the NRC regulatory requirements can safely contain radioactivity. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking adds one cask design that meets the safety requirements previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developed to the list of approved casks. The previous responses to comments, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as well as the detailed safety and environmental analyses underlying this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking (and described elsewhere in this notice), all reveal that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standardized NUHOMS will conform to the NRC requirements and that its use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should not pose the potential for significant environmental impacts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE is required by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 to accept spent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel for ultimate disposal. Moreover, the Commission made a generic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination in its waste Compliance Decisions (September 18, 1990, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
55 FR 38474 and August 31, 1994, 49 FR 34658) that safe disposal is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technically feasible and will be available within the first quarter of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
21st century. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dry cask storage has significant advantages over wet storage in that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system is passive and requires minimal human intervention. No pumps, filters, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or water quality monitoring are needed to maintain the conditions necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for wet storage. The only monitoring required for the Standardized NUHOMS is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
daily temperature monitoring and visually checking inlet and outlet vents.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Consistent with the applicable procedure, the NRC does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not intend to hold formal trial-type public hearings on the Standardized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NUHOMS rule or separate hearings at each reactor site before the use of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dry cask technology approved by the Commission in this rulemaking. Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures, used by the NRC for generic approval of the Standardized NUHOMS, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including the underlying NRC staff technical reviews and the opportunity for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public input, are more than adequate to obtain public input and assure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection of the public health and safety and the environment. In this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking, the NRC has taken additional steps to elicit and fully consider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public comments on the Standardized NUHOMS technology. These steps included 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC participation in public meetings near Davis-Besse and extension of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public comment period by 45 days in response to public requests. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extension provided a total public comment period of almost 4 months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 133 of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 authorizes the NRC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to approve spent fuel storage technologies by rulemaking. When it adopted the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generic process in 1990 for the review and approval of dry cask storage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technologies, the Commission stated that ``casks *&blank;*&blank;* [are to] be approved 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
by rulemaking
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and any safety issues that are connected with the casks are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properly addressed in that rulemaking rather than in a hearing procedure'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(July 18, 1990; 55 FR 29181). Rulemaking under NRC rules of practice, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described in 10 CFR 2.804 and 2.805, provides full opportunity for expression 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of public views but does not use formal trial-type hearings of the kind 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested by commenters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this proceeding, rulemaking clearly provided adequate avenues for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
members of the public to provide their views regarding NRC's proposed approval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Standardized NUHOMS, including the opportunity to participate through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the submission of statements, information, data, opinions and arguments. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this connection, technical evaluations for Standardized NUHOMS and detailed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documented findings of compliance with NRC safety, security, and environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements were prepared by the NRC staff for public examination. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
November 1993, the NRC staff reviewed the Standardized NUHOMS and approved the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design for the purpose of initiating this rulemaking to grant a generic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval of the design. In addition, the NRC staff conducted a second review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in response to the public comments on the Standardized NUHOMS in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking, again finding compliance with NRC requirements as discussed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to reviewing systematically and in depth the technical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issues important to protecting public health and safety, and the environment, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the NRC has taken extra steps to obtain and fully consider public views on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standardized NUHOMS technology and has made every effort to respond to public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerns and questions about the Standardized NUHOMS compliance with NRC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety, security, and environmental requirements. The initial public comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period opened on June 2, 1994, and was scheduled to close on August 16, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 29, 1994, the public comment period was extended to September 30, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1994. The NRC also participated in an earlier meeting near the Davis-Besse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under these circumstances, formal hearings would not appreciably add to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC's efforts to ensure adequate protection of public health, safety, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment and they are unnecessary to NRC's full understanding and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration of public views on the Standardized NUHOMS.

. One commenter stated that because there is not now and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there may not be a permanent high-level radioactive waste (HLWR) repository 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for commercial reactor fuel, and since the NUHOMS 24P and 52B casks are non- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transportable, any distinction between so called ``temporary storage'' and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``permanent disposal'' of this waste is moot. Because of the lack of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permanent repository or Monitored Retrievable Storage (MRS) in the foreseeable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
future, a case of a serious spill and the resultant contamination at an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmentally unsuitable site like Davis-Besse where ``short and long-term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse impacts associated with the occupancy and modification of (a) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
floodplain *&blank;*&blank;* potential release of radioactive material during the lifetime of the ISFSI *&blank;*&blank;*
(and location) over an aquifer which is a major water resource'' have been inadequately dealt with.

. This rulemaking to certify the Standardized NUHOMS is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for interim storage of spent fuel in an approved cask for 20 years. It does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not authorize or approve the ultimate disposal in a permanent HLRW repository, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which is under the responsibility of the DOE. During interim storage, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
user (holder of a Part 50 license) must protect the spent fuel against design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis threats, and against environmental conditions and natural phenomena such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as tornadoes, tornado missiles, earthquakes, and floods. In regard to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flooding, the Certificate of Compliance has a provision (see A&hyph;2 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certificate of Compliance) for flood condition analysis to ensure that there 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is no release of radioactive material from flooding.

One commenter stated that projected future uses of land 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time this waste may remain on site and the options for both cask and reactor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
license renewal beyond 20 and 40 years, respectively, and the fact that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
known man-made structure can last for the length of time that this waste must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be isolated from humans and the environment. If an MRS or repository ever 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
become available, this waste may have to be repacked. Each handling of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste increases the likelihood of an accident, spill, contamination, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
worker and public exposures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Projected future land and water use can be made based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the continued safe operation of a reactor and its associated dry cask 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage facility. The continued operation of these facilities should have no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greater impact on land and water use in the future than they do today. As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously noted, the NRC Waste Confidence decisions concluded there is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonable assurance that safe disposal of spent fuel by the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Government will be available by the year 2025. Therefore, the spent fuel will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not remain at a reactor site for the length of time it must be isolated from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
humans and the environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should be noted that the absence of significant environmental impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from dry cask storage at a reactor site is the conclusion of NRC's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental assessment for the Standardized NUHOMS and for previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approved dry casks analyzed in earlier rulemakings addressing 10 CFR Part 72, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as well as in the Commission's Waste Confidence decisions in 1984 (August 31, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1984; 49 FR 34658) and 1989 (September 29, 1989; 54 FR 39765). In the 1984 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Waste Confidence decision, the Commission concluded there was reasonable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assurance that spent fuel can be safely stored at reactor sites, without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant environmental impacts, for at least 30 years beyond expiration of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC reactor operating licenses. The 1989 Waste Confidence decision review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reaffirmed earlier Commission conclusions on the absence of significant

environmental impacts.

One commenter questioned whether the NUHOMS canister 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will fit the conceptual design for the DOE multi-purpose canister (MPC). If 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE chooses to use vertical casks (like the VSC) at the MRS, will the NUHOMS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inner canister fit into the vertical outer concrete shell in the MPC design? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If local reactors choose the VSC&hyph;24 or the NUHOMS, will either inner metal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
canister fit into the overpacks for DOE, or will they have to be opened after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage, returned to the pool, the fuel put in a new canister, and the old one

discarded as radioactive waste?

The Certificate of Compliance for the Standardized

to conform to, and has not been evaluated by NRC for conformance with, the

conceptual design for the DOE MPC. DOE has not yet made final decisions

add Subparts K and L to Part 72 indicated that the 20-year period represents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
what the Commission believes to be an appropriate increment for cask design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approvals. The application for design reapproval would have to demonstrate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the cask's ability to perform the necessary safety functions for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reapproval period. The application would be evaluated by NRC against the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commission's regulatory requirements. If a cask design is not reapproved, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licensee would have to remove casks from service as the 20-year approved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage life expired. This could mean removal of the spent fuel and storing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it elsewhere.

One commenter wanted to discuss the need for an

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 218(a) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(NWPA) provides the following directive: ``The Secretary [of DOE] shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establish a demonstration program in cooperation with the private sector, for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the dry storage of spent nuclear fuel at civilian nuclear reactor power sites, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the objective of establishing one or more technologies that the [Nuclear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory] Commission may, by rule, approve for use at the sites of civilian 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nuclear power reactors without, to the maximum extent practicable, the need 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for additional site-specific approvals by the Commission.'' After subsequent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE technical evaluations and based on a full review of all available data, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Commission approved dry storage of spent nuclear fuel in a final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 18, 1990 (55 FR 29181). The final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule established a new Subpart K within 10 CFR Part 72, entitled ``General 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
License for Storage of Spent Fuel at Power Reactor Sites.'' Therefore, there 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is a need for casks to be approved by NRC to implement the NWPA to meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demand of the interim dry cask storage of spent fuels in the nuclear power 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plants. However, the variety of cask designs submitted by vendors for NRC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review and approval is mostly dictated by economic reasons that do not involve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC.

H. A number of commenters wanted site-specific analyses done for each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of the Standardized NUHOMS despite the fact that each licensee must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine that the site parameters are enveloped by the cask design specified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the SAR, SER, and Certificate of Compliance. The intent of Subpart K of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 CFR Part 72 was to grant a general license to licensees of power reactors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to use NRC-approved dry storage casks listed in 10 CFR 72.214 without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional licensing review by NRC.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of commenters wanted site-specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Environmental Impact Statements (EIS). Several commenters stated that an EIS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be required on any waste facility that may be permanent along the Great 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lakes fresh water system. To say that this will have no adverse effect on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public health and safety is a prediction most of the public does not accept. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter believes that the generic ruling to use a dry cask storage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design at any reactor site is impossible and should be discarded. By relying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on environmental evaluations done in the 1970s before Davis-Besse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
construction, the NRC was remiss in its responsibility to protect the people 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Ohio from harm by its licensee. Another commenter wants the NRC to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepare, at a minimum, an Environmental Assessment (EA) for each site, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including information on sensitive ecosystems, wildlife, demography, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meteorology, and geology. The EA should discuss the cask's capability to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
withstand weather conditions and potential catastrophic events. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The potential environmental impacts of utilities using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Standardized NUHOMS (or any of the other spent fuel casks approved by NRC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10 CFR 72.214)) have been fully considered and are documented in a published 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Environmental Assessment (EA) covering this rulemaking. Further, as described 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
below, the EA indicates that use of the casks would not have significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental impacts. Specifically, the EA notes the 30-plus years of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experience with dry storage of spent fuel have shown that the previous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extensive NRC analyses and findings that the environmental impacts of dry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage are small and succinctly describes the impacts, including the non-radiological impacts of cask fabrication
(the impacts associated with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relatively small amounts of steel, concrete, and plastic used in the casks are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected to be insignificant), the radiological impacts of cask operations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(the incremental offsite doses are expected to be a small fraction of and well 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the 25 mrem/yr limits in NRC regulations), the potential impacts of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible dry cask accident (the impacts are expected to be no greater than the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impacts of an accident involving the spent fuel storage basin), and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential impacts from possible sabotage (the offsite dose is calculated to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about one rem). All of the NRC analyses collectively yield the singular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conclusion that the environmental impacts and risks are expected to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extremely small. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC EA's for previously approved dry casks also concluded there was an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
absence of significant environmental impacts from dry cask storage at a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactor site when they were analyzed in earlier rulemakings addressing 10 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part 72 as well as in the Commission's Waste Confidence decisions in 1984 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(August 31, 1984; 49 FR 34658) and 1989 (September 29, 1989; 54 FR 39765). In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 1984 Waste Confidence decision, the Commission concluded there was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonable assurance spent fuel can be safely stored at reactor sites, without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant environmental impacts for at least 30 years beyond expiration of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC reactor operating licenses. The 1989 Waste Confidence decision review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reaffirmed earlier Commission conclusions on the absence of significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental impacts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the Commission's specific consideration of environmental impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of dry storage and the absence of any new information casting doubt on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conclusion that these impacts are expected to be extremely small and not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmentally significant, the NRC is not convinced that meaningful new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental insights would be gained from either a new site-specific EIS or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EA for each site using dry storage methods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EA covering the proposed rule, as well as the finding of no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant impact (FONSI) prepared and published for this rulemaking, fully 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comply with the NRC environmental regulations in 10 CFR Part 51. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commission's environmental regulations in Part 51 implement the National 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and give proper consideration to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidelines of the Council of Environmental Quality (CEQ). The EA and FONSI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepared as required by 10 CFR Part 51 conform to NEPA procedural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements. Further analyses are not legally required.

The regulation 10 CFR Part 72, Subpart K, already authorizes dry cask 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage and approves dry casks for use by utilities to store spent fuel at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactor sites. See 10 CFR 72.214 for a listing of information on Cask 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certificate Nos. 1000 through 1003, 1005, and 1007. The purpose of this final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule is to add one more cask to the list of casks already approved by NRC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The cask added to the list in &sect;72.214 by this final rule complies with all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable NRC safety requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, this final rulemaking applies to the use of this cask by any

 One commenter stated that the January 30, 1994, reply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from NRC's Robert Bernero to Mr. Adamkus, EPA, is completely inadequate, as is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the March 1994 ``Draft Environment Assessment and Finding of No Significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Impact'' because no consideration is given to the site's unsuitability even for LLRW per NRC's own admission, and
``new information which could alter the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
original site evaluation findings'' is ignored. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule does not provide any site-specific NRC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval or address site-specific parameters that are peculiar to a particular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactor site. The rule only adds one cask design, the Standardized NUHOMS, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the list of approved casks available for use by a power plant licensee in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with the conditions of the general license in Part 72. Pursuant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those conditions, each licensee must determine whether or not the reactor site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameters (including earthquake intensity and tornado missiles) are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
encompassed by the cask design bases considered in the cask SAR and SER. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EA and FONSI for this rule are limited in scope to the Standardized NUHOMS in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a generic setting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unlike interim storage prescribed in 10 CFR Part 72, the in-ground 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal of radioactive material, whether high-level or low-level waste (HLW 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or LLW), must take into account the geologic, hydrologic, and geochemical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characteristics of the site or region to isolate the radioactive waste from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the accessible environment. Site criteria for in-ground disposal of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
radioactive wastes enable an applicant to choose an appropriate site, one with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a combination of favorable conditions that will be a natural barrier to retard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or attenuate the migration of any leaked radioactive material over a long 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period to control releases within acceptable limits. The disposal period for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
LLW is on the order of 500 years, and for HLW it is greater than 10,000 years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, site characteristics are investigated and assessed for interim 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spent fuel storage under Part 72, not to determine their suitability as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
barrier to release of radioactive material, but rather to determine the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequency and the severity of external natural and artificial events that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could affect the safety of an ISFSI. Unlikely, but credible, severe events 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are considered to determine the safety of the storage cask design.

 One commenter stated that the NRC has not approved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technologies for the use of spent fuel at the sites of *&blank;*&blank;* without the need for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional site reviews. If that were so, no additional site review would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been necessary at Palisades, nor would an SAR revision or a Certificate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The approval and use of dry storage technologies under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the provisions of the general license are relatively new. Questions were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
raised by members of the public about the possible effects of earthquakes and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
erosion at the Palisades site on the safe storage of spent fuel in the VSC&hyph;24 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dry casks. As the agency which is responsible for questions about compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with regulatory requirements, which oversees such matters as the ``cop on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beat,'' the NRC began an independent assessment to more closely examine the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
behavior of the pad at Palisades under normal conditions, under the long-term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects of erosion, and under conditions of a postulated earthquake that might 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cause the sand below or around the pad to move. The results of NRC's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment were documented in the NRC Final Safety Assessment of Independent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Spent Fuel Storage Installation (ISFSI) Support Pad (TAC No. M88875). As is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the case at all sites, NRC requires the cask user to determine if the design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis for the storage technology being considered encompasses the site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameters at the location where the fuel is to be stored. The review at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Palisades confirmed this to be the case. As experience with use of this new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design is gained, modifications to the design described in the SAR are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected and allowed under the provisions of 10 CFR 72.48.

 This rulemaking does not cover site-specific NRC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licensees; however, the NRC is not ignoring them. Under NRC regulations, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
utility has two options in using dry cask storage of spent fuel: (1) The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licensee may apply for a site-specific license from NRC; or (2) the licensee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may use an NRC-approved cask under the general license provisions of Subpart K 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 10 CFR Part 72. However, not all licensees may be able to use the general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
license provisions, either because the fuel type they possess is not storable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in any cask listed in 10 CFR 72.214 or because none of the cask designs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
envelope the reactor site parameters. The NRC is also not ignoring site-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific license considerations relating to modifying cask designs. Quite the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contrary, the criteria that apply to modifications of an NRC-approved cask 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such as the Standardized NUHOMS are the same as the criteria that apply to

modifications of site-specific ISFSIs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A utility's use of the Standardized NUHOMS, for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage of spent fuel in casks at a reactor site, would not have a significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact on the environment. This finding is supported by the NRC safety and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental evaluations for the Standardized NUHOMS, including the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicant's demonstration of compliance of the cask with NRC requirements, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
well as by the 1990 rulemaking on dry cask storage and the 1984 and 1989 waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confidence proceedings. Because the Standardized NUHOMS can only be used by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licensee if the site parameters are enveloped by the cask design basis, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In this rulemaking, the NRC reviewed the cask vendor's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed means for transporting the Standardized NUHOMS canister and transfer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cask outside the reactor buildings to the on-site storage pad under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage requirements of 10 CFR Part 72. This on-site movement occurs within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an owner-controlled area where access can be limited and where operations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be safely managed by the general licensee. The NRC did not review the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standardized NUHOMS for transport off-site, for example to a DOE MRS or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repository. Generally, off-site transport of spent fuel occurs in public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
places where the shipper has fewer access restrictions and limited control of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the surroundings. Off-site spent nuclear fuel shipments must be made in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transportation cask approved by the NRC pursuant to NRC's regulations found in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 CFR Part 71, ``Packaging and Transportation of Radioactive Material,'' and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must also comply with pertinent Department of Transportation (DOT) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. At this time, the NRC is approving the Standardized NUHOMS for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage only.

Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter wanted to know the relationship between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Standardized NUHOMS and the NUHOMS MP187 now applying for a Certificate of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compliance. Is the MP187 transportable? Will the canister of all models fit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into the transport overpack? Wouldn't a utility be better off waiting for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transportable cask rather than choosing a storage only cask that may have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compatibility problems with an MPC system? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The MP&hyph;187 transportation overpack uses a canister 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
similar to the Standardized NUHOMS. However, it is the subject of a separate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC review as part of a site-specific licensing application. Both the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standardized NUHOMS and the MP&hyph;187 share many common design features. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, they are separate applications, and the NRC has not been asked by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cask vendor to review whether the Standardized NUHOMS can be transported in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the NUHOMS MP187 transportation overpack. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The issue of whether a utility should consider the transportability of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dry storage casks is beyond the scope of this rulemaking.

Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter cited a report given at the HLW Conference at Las Vegas, in 1990, ``Integrated Spent Fuel Storage and
Transportation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Systems using NUHOMS,'' by PNFSI (page 671): ``While subsequent transfer of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intact DSC from a NUHOMS on-site transfer cask directly to an OCRWM rail/barge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is feasible, this method of transfer is not preferred since the assemblies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be oriented top down and the DSC bottom shield plug and grapple ring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assembly would be orientated top up, thus complicating the canister opening 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and fuel handling process at the MRS or geologic repository following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shipment.'' Has NRC evaluated this situation? Has it been rectified? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Because the cask vendor applied for certification of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Standardized NUHOMS only as a storage cask under 10 CFR Part 72, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transportation of this cask is not a subject of this rulemaking. Therefore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the NRC review of the standardized NUHOMS did not consider the particular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transportation problem described in the comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
J. Several commenters supported the rule stating that it is beneficial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the NRC and licensees, and it is consistent with NRC's direction to avoid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unnecessary site-specific licensing reviews. Others disagreed and asked 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific questions about NRC's approval and oversight process.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter stated that the NRC statement, ``The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule will not have adverse effect on public health and safety,'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cannot be guaranteed and, therefore, even though it may be convenient for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nuclear industry and the NRC to avoid site-specific approvals, in this case 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these are essential for maintaining public safety. Another commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following the same theme questioned how the following determination was made: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``this cask, when used in accordance with the conditions specified in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certificate of Compliance and NRC regulations, will meet the requirements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 CFR Part 72; thus, adequate protection of the public health and safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be ensured.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Dry storage casks approved by the NRC for use under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general license are of a robust design that relies on generic cask features to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure protection of the public health and safety. Additional NRC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
site-specific approvals are unnecessary. NRC oversight and inspections are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient to ensure that general licensees implement NRC conditions on cask 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use. If specific concerns are raised, the NRC also has the authority to look 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into them and respond as necessary to protect public health and safety. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC has established specific requirements in 10 CFR Part 72 that must be met 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in order to obtain a Certificate of Compliance for a cask. The details of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review and the bases for the NRC concluding that the cask meets the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of 10 CFR Part 72 are provided in the SER. The goal of dry cask 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage technology is to store spent fuel safely. That goal, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectiveness of the technology, have been demonstrated empirically and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experimentally. Different cask designs may require different types of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis to demonstrate their safety. Therefore, different review methods may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be appropriate to reach that conclusion. In each case, the level of review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performed is that needed to provide assurance of adequate protection of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public health and safety.

Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters expressed concern over the exemption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to 10 CFR 72.234(c) granted to VECTRA to begin transfer cask fabrication (but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not use) ``to have the necessary equipment available for use by Davis-Besse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nuclear Power Station (DBNPS) in mid-1995, and thus enable DBNPS to maintain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complete full-core off-load capability in its spent fuel pool following the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refueling outage scheduled for early 1996.'' One commenter said that seeking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public comment and providing comments is an exercise in futility because cask 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval seems to be a fait accompli. Another commenter wants no exemptions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for fabrication before certification to be allowed, stating that problems have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developed when all these exemptions are allowed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The NRC granted VECTRA's request for an exemption to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fabricate the transfer cask before issuance of the Certificate of Compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under its NRC-approved quality assurance program. NRC's exemption decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made a special effort to clarify that fabrication was entirely at VECTRA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial risk and did not ensure favorable consideration of VECTRA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application. The NRC's finding, based on the SAR for the Standardized NUHOMS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the NRC's SER, concluded that beginning fabrication before the issuance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Certificate of Compliance would pose no undue risk to public health and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety. Use of the transfer cask is dependent on satisfactory completion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC's certification process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC staff carefully considers the public comments received in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemakings to determine whether changes are needed to the proposed rule. As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noted elsewhere in this notice, several public comments received in this and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other cask-approval rulemakings have resulted in changes to the SER and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certificate of Compliance. For this reason, the public comments provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
useful inputs to the NRC's safety approval process.

divested itself of any ownership or relationship to the VSC design in January

 The key individual involved in the design and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development of the VSC&hyph;24, who was also involved in the design and development 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the NUHOMS design, left Pacific Nuclear and formed a new company, Pacific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sierra Nuclear, for the commercial manufacture and marketing of the VSC&hyph;24 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage system. The NRC has experienced no difficulty obtaining the required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety information, including proprietary information or answers to its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
questions from either firm, either before or after divestiture. The NRC is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not aware of any relationship between the vendors. In addition, the NRC fully 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reviewed the health and safety aspects of each vendor's cask design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
independently. The NRC did not rely on any assumed relationship between the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two vendors. Concerning their relationship to the DOE MPC system, each vendor

has to establish its own relationship with DOE.

The NUHOMS&hyph;52B has not been used yet. Pre-operational testing of the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter stated that even though dry cask storage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
passes all NRC rules and is one of the least expensive methods, it would seem 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a different location or more expensive storage method is worth lives, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resources, and property. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on numerous NRC reviews and growing experience 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with dry cask storage technologies, the NRC has concluded that spent fuel can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be safely stored in dry casks without significant risk to the public health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and safety. More expensive storage techniques or alternative storage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
locations would not provide any significant additional public protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the storage location is a matter of Congressional policy as reflected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in Section 218(a) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, which includes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following directive: ``The Secretary [of DOE] shall establish a demonstration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program in cooperation with the private sector, for the dry storage of spent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nuclear fuel at civilian nuclear power reactor sites, with the objective of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishing one or more technologies that the [Nuclear Regulatory] Commission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may, by rule, approve for use at the sites of civilian nuclear power reactors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without, to the maximum extent practicable, the need for additional site-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific approvals by the Commission.'' Section III(a) also finds that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generators of the spent fuel have the primary responsibility to provide for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the interim storage of the spent fuel until it is accepted by the DOE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The type of spent fuel stored in the dry cask storage systems is one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factor that allows the cost of the systems to be lower. Because the fuel has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooled a number of years, passive cooling can be used rather than active 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooling as is required for fuel just removed from the reactor. Passive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooling reduces the cost by not having active components such as pumps, heat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exchanger, water filters, and the maintenance required for these components.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter opposed licensing any dry cask storage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system other than the DOE multi-purpose canister (MPC) because it minimizes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handling individual fuel assemblies, standardizes compatibility between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage sites and DOE, and reduces cost. Multiple cask designs lead to less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expertise in production, operation, and accident management. Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations need to be amended to mandate only the use of the MPC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The DOE MPC system will not be available for general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use until well after 1997. In the meantime, additional storage capacity is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needed now at several reactor sites. Once the MPC is available for general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use, most utilities might use it. However, given the demonstrated and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediate need of some reactors for an additional storage capacity, and given 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC's responsibility to implement dry cask storage under a general license 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pursuant to NWPA of 1982, it would not be prudent for NRC now to require use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of MPC designs that not even DOE has yet approved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC does not agree that the number of cask designs has a significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect on the level of expertise available because standard engineering and

Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter, citing the draft SER, stated that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decommissioning and decontamination of reactors and reactor sites remain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uncertain at best. ``At this time, it is not known whether demolition and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removal of the HSM can be performed by conventional methods *&blank;*&blank;*. The reinforced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
structure of the HSM, for example, will require considerable effort to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demolish.'' The commenter continues by indicating that in its typical fashion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of putting off until tomorrow what it cannot deal with today, the NRC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considers ``ease of decommissioning (a) secondary consideration.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The demolition of the HSM will be more difficult than a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
typical building because of the large amount of reinforced steel it contains. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, it is technically feasible and represents a likely level of effort 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
similar to that required to demolish a bank vault. Bank vaults are routinely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demolished without extraordinary effort. The HSM may become slightly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
radioactive from being exposed to a neutron radiation field during the spent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel storage period, which would require some containment during demolition to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prevent the spread of contamination. Recognizing this, the NRC considers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decommissioning a secondary consideration compared to the safety afforded by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage of spent fuel in dry casks.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter questioned how, where to, and when the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spent fuel and casks will go? How does the decommissioning of NUHOMS affect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the reactor decommissioning plan if no repository is sited and the pool must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remain open? Another commenter expressed concern that after the operating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility has been decommissioned, the spent fuel pool may not be available for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use in recovery of a breached DSC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission determined in the Waste Confidence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decisions that sufficient repository capacity will be available, in the first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quarter of the 21st century, to accept spent fuel that is already in storage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or that will be generated during the lifetime of the reactor licensed by NRC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Commission determined that spent fuel can be safely stored at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactors until it is disposed. The bases for these determinations are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extensively discussed in the Waste Confidence decisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(54 FR 39765; September 28, 1989 and 49 FR 34658; August 31, 1984) and remain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable today. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To operate the dry spent fuel storage area under the provisions of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general license, a license to possess or operate a nuclear power reactor under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 CFR Part 50 is required. If the reactors were decommissioned and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
license terminated, and if the spent fuel were to remain on site, a specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
license issued under 10 CFR 72.40 would be required. At the time of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application for a specific license and before the Part 50 license was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terminated, the licensee would have to address the subject of how the fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be repackaged for shipment to an MRS or repository. (None of the casks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
now listed in 10 CFR 72.214 are approved for transportation). Decommissioning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and termination of a Part 50 license for a given reactor site must take into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
account the proper disposal of any spent fuel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
L. A number of positive and negative comments were received about the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application of 10 CFR 72.48 or Item 9 of the Certificate of Compliance to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general licensees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
L.1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters questioned the application of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 CFR 72.48 to Certificate of Compliance holders for use by a general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licensee. Some commenters believe that this regulation is being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inappropriately applied to general licensees and cask vendors. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters believe that the regulation was intended to apply to site-specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licenses issued under 10 CFR 72.40 only. One commenter cited the parallel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application of 10 CFR 50.59 to 10 CFR Part 50 licensees. Any changes to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certificate of Compliance and the supporting SAR and SER need public input 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using the rulemaking process. Who would make the decisions in using the terms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``unreviewed safety questions,'' ``significant increase,'' and ``significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental impact''? Other commenters liked this addition, stating that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-safety-significant changes can be made in a timely and cost effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manner. Several commenters supported the incorporation of item number 9 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(in 72.48 type language) in the draft Certificate of Compliance. One 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter wanted similar provisions made for general license holders with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recordkeeping requirements applicable to the general license rather than the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certificate holder. Changes requiring an amendment to the certificate should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be initiated by the certificate holder only. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC will not allow changes in the Certificate of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compliance under 10 CFR 72.48. However, the general licensee may make changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the SAR under 10 CFR 72.48, unless it involves an unreviewed safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
question, a significant increase in occupational exposure, or a significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unreviewed environmental impact. The general licensee must make the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determinations, in the first instance, that are necessary for application of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 CFR 72.48. The licensee must also retain its evaluations on its records 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(which are subject to NRC review). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Supporting this application of 10 CFR 72.48 to the general license are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the words of 10 CFR 72.48(a)(1) which provides as follows: ``The holder of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
license issued under this part may: (i) Make changes in the ISFSI *&blank;*&blank;* 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described in the Safety Analysis Report, *&blank;*&blank;* (iii) *&blank;*&blank;* without prior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commission approval, unless the proposed change, test or experiment involves a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change in the license conditions incorporated in the license, an unreviewed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety question, a significant increase in occupational exposure, or a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant unreviewed environmental impact.'' Also supporting the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interpretation is 10 CFR 72.210 which provides as follows: ``A general license 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is hereby issued for the storage of spent fuel in an independent spent fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage installation at power reactor sites to persons authorized to possess 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or operate nuclear power reactors under Part 50 of this chapter.'' The NRC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
staff is considering a rulemaking to amend NRC regulations to explicitly state 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that 10 CFR 72.48 applies to general licensees.

Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter stated that the CFR is silent on how a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vendor can change a cask SAR and certificate after the final rule. It should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be made clear for the vendor that this cask SAR (CSAR) is generic for all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
United States sites. All seismic, control component, distance, changes in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
length and weight, changes in transfer devices, etc., need to be clearly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defined in the proposed rulemaking for the cask and the CSAR before public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment. Who would be liable if a utility requested the vendor to change a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certified cask design?

Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The cask vendor can apply to the NRC for a change to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the cask certificate and SAR after the final rule is published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The vendor must propose the generic revisions to the certificate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and SAR and request NRC review of the proposed revision. The NRC will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluate the proposed revision in an SER, and if appropriate, prepare a draft 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revised Certificate of Compliance. These documents would then be placed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the NRC Public Document Room and a proposed rule would be published requesting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public comments on the proposed revised Certificate of Compliance. After 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration of public comments (and assuming an appropriate basis exists), a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rule would be published incorporating the revision in the revised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certificate of Compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SAR (CSAR) is not necessarily generic for all United States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operating reactor sites as the comment appears to suggest. The SAR is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pertinent for those sites that have parameters that are incorporated by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cask design bases analyzed in the SAR. From a practical standpoint, it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difficult for a cask vendor to foresee all possible combinations of seismic, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control component, distance, changes in length and weight, changes in transfer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
devices, etc. Revisions are expected when the vendor submits its initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application for approval. The vendor is responsible for the certified cask 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design.

One commenter wanted an explanation for not allowing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
buyer substitution of material for a Certificate of Compliance and that these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
references should be deleted from fabrication specifications and drawings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Does this mean that no changes in any materials are allowed once the design is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certified? If so, explain this in reference to new models of the VSC&hyph;24 as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
far as materials, coatings, etc.?

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under 10 CFR Part 72, the licensee is permitted to make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes in the ISFSI as described in the SAR provided the changes do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involve an unreviewed safety question. The licensee and cask certificate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
holder must have a quality assurance (QA) program that provides control over 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities affecting quality of the identified structures, systems, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
components to an extent commensurate with the importance to safety and to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure conformance with the approved design. The NRC does not want buyers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(who may not be the licensee or certificate holder) of cask materials to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
automatically be able to substitute material without the necessary safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluations. Rather, the licensee, through the cask certificate holder, has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the ultimate responsibility for approving any changes to ensure conformance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the approved design. For structures, systems, and components identified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as important to safety, if alternative materials are desired to be used and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those specific materials form the basis of the safety evaluation, it would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate to identify those materials in the cask application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternatively, the certificate holder may seek an amendment to the SAR and, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary, a change to the Certificate of Compliance. For other structures, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems, or components that are needed for the design to be used or are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
otherwise prudent, but do not perform a safety function and were not relied 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upon in the basis for design approval, appropriate changes may be permitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided the licensee and the Certificate of Compliance holder document the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate evaluations and use their quality assurance programs to implement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the change. New models of the VSC&hyph;24 casks are not the subject of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking.

One commenter questioned how the draft Environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact would remain valid if changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to cask design and procedures can be made. Tests or experiments could be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducted under draft Certificate of Compliance Item No. 9 (see also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 CFR 72.48) leading to the use of a cask that does not meet the conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified in the Certificate of Compliance. These changes may adversely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact site-specific public health, safety, and the environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Given the limiting criteria of 10 CFR 72.48, it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unlikely that any change would materially change the environmental analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee's authority under 10 CFR 72.48 does not permit any changes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involve unresolved safety issues, changes to the conditions for cask use in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Certificate of Compliance, significant increase in occupational exposure, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or significant environmental impact. In the Environmental Assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supporting this rulemaking to approve the Standardized NUHOMS, the NRC staff 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluated various types of accidents that could happen to the ISFSI facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC staff's evaluation encompassed design basis accidents and concluded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that no radioactive material will be released to the environment. The NRC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
staff also evaluated a worst-case accident and found that the environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact is insignificant. Therefore, it is unlikely that the potential impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from changes to cask design or tests or experiments under the control of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licensee would introduce new environmental considerations or impacts that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
differ from or exceed those as analyzed in the Environmental Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Changes in environmental impacts, as a result of changes to the cask design or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures, must be evaluated by the licensee. The licensee's evaluations are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available for inspection by the NRC.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Apparently in reference to a December 4, 1991, letter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from PNFSI that stated ``The NUHOMS Certification Safety Analysis Report (CSAR) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was *&blank;*&blank;*,'' one commenter believed that the use of the term CSAR was a good idea 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and should have been used by the NRC. The utility SAR should be called SAR as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it was and the vendor SAR should be called CSAR just as NUHOMS did in 1990. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, the acronyms topical report (TR), TSAR, and SAR are being used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interchangeably and they need clear definition. This would eliminate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confusion on the issue by those involved.

One commenter wanted the draft Certificate of Compliance

clarified as to who is responsible for the use of seismic restraints at each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactor site, the vendor or the utility, citing the ambiguous term

``certificate holder.''

Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters stated that the limits on both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neutron and gamma emission rates as well as neutron and gamma spectra 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Attachment A, Section 1.2.1 of draft Certificate of Compliance) result in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excluding some fuel assemblies that would actually produce lower dose rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The problem for fuel qualification stems from the fact that the neutron dose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate does not decrease as rapidly as the gamma dose rate during cooling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because of the longer lived isotopes. Thus, a high burned fuel assembly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excluded on the basis of high neutron source term may remain excluded, even 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
though with extra cooling time the combined neutron/gamma dose rate could be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less than the design basis case. Some fuel may not qualify because it exceeds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the spectra requirements, even though the energy groups exceeding the limits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may not be significant contributors to the dose rates. Combined neutron/gamma 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dose rates are the real concern; it is recommended that the limits on source 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
term be replaced by limits based on dose equivalence. The fuel specification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should allow other combinations of fuel enrichment, burnup, and cooling time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that would not result in exceeding the fuel cladding temperature or dose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rates.

The NRC staff agrees that alternative fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifications could be beneficial. However, this commenter did not provide a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific alternative, and the NRC staff has not evaluated any other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative at this time because VECTRA did not include this approach in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SAR. Therefore, no other approach is considered for this rulemaking.

follows: ``Visually inspect placement of top shield plug. Re-install or

adjust position of top shield plug if it is not properly seated.'' The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 One commenter wanted draft Certificate of Compliance, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Attachment A, Section 1.2.6, Action d deleted. The user should be permitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to analyze and document higher dose rates under 10 CFR 72.48, which is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available for NRC review. Another commenter wanted the complete Section 1.2.6 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Attachment A to the draft Certificate of Compliance deleted. Given that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HSM dose rates are specified, a specification for DSC dose rates is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary because only the workers involved in the canister closure operations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are affected by them and they are already covered by the reactor radiation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection program. One commenter wanted draft Certificate of Compliance, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Attachment A, Section 1.2.11 deleted. Given that HSM dose rates are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified, a specification for transfer cask dose rates is not necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because only the workers involved are affected, not the general public. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter also stated that if Section 1.2.11 cannot be deleted the action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement should be revised to read as follows: ``If specified dose rates are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceeded, place temporary shielding around the affected areas of the transfer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cask or implement other ALARA actions, as appropriate. Review the plant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records of the fuel assemblies which have been placed in the DSC to ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they conform to the fuel specifications of Section 1.2.1. The report to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC should be deleted with the user being able to analyze and document the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
higher dose rates under 10 CFR 72.48, which is available for NRC review.''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The dose rate limits are for design purposes. The dose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate is limited to ensure that the DSC has not inadvertently been loaded with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel not meeting the vendor/applicant spent fuel specifications. The NRC will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require reporting if the specified dose limits are exceeded. For these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasons, the NRC will not grant the above requests.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter stated that the requirement for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dissolved boron concentration in the DSC of 2000 ppm is in excess of the 1810 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ppm site-specific license. The 1810 ppm dissolved boron is sufficient to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure reactivity below 0.95 K-eff (95/95 tolerance level with uncertainties) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assuming 24 fresh fuel assemblies. For the unlikely worst case with water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
density of 0.2 to 0.7 gm/cc (a condition not achievable for fresh fuel), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactivity remains below 0.98 K-eff. The pool dissolved-boron verification- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurement frequency should be changed from not to exceed 48 hours to once 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
per month to be consistent with 10 CFR Part 50 requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter stated that the NUHOMS&hyph;24P canister was designed using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burnup credit, the basis for licensing is ``credit for soluble boron.'' The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burnup-enrichment curve requirement (Figure 1&hyph;1, draft Certificate of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compliance) should be removed until the NRC accepts burnup credit and the pool 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
boron specification (Section 1.2.15, draft Certificate of Compliance) is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC has not yet approved the use of burnup credit in criticality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyses for spent fuel storage and transportation casks. The applicant did, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
however, analyze credit for burnup as an alternative design acceptance basis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the NUHOMS&hyph;24P DSC, pending further consideration of burnup credit by NRC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in the SER, the NUHOMS&hyph;24P DSC criticality safety is approved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on, among others, the key assumptions of loading with irradiated fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assemblies with equivalent enrichment &lt;1.45 wt% U&hyph;235, misloading unirradiated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel with maximum enrichment of 4.0 wt% U&hyph;235, and soluble boron in water for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wet loading and unloading. The NRC considered the use of the burnup- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrichment curve, Certificate of Compliance, Figure 1&hyph;1, as a fuel selection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria, to be prudent. Its use adds additional unanalyzed conservatism in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the criticality safety margin. It is comparable to previous NUHOMS&hyph;24P 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approvals. Its use would also be consistent with the requirement that storage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cask designs be, to the extent practicable, compatible with removal of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stored spent fuel from the reactor site, transportation, and ultimate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposition by DOE. Therefore, the NRC disagreed with the commenter's request 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to allow Standardized NUHOMS&hyph;24P users the option of using these burnup- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrichment curve.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The comment appears to refer to the use of a NUHOMS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
24P associated with a site-specific license. The ``standardized NUHOMS 24P and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with a site license. The SER for this rulemaking is clear about conditions

Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter citing the first paragraph of page A&hyph;27 of the draft Certificate of Compliance states that the
postulated adiabatic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heatup would result in concrete temperatures being exceeded in approximately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 hours. As a result, it is appropriate and conservative to perform the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
visual surveillance to verify no vent blockage on a daily basis to ensure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a blockage existed for less than 40 hours. The last sentence in the first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph should reflect that the module needs to be removed from service if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it cannot be established that the blockage is less than 40 hours, not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
24 hours. A 24-hour surveillance interval will adequately verify this. One 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter cited an inconsistency in Section 3 of the draft Certificate of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compliance. Section 3.1 indicates that a module must be removed from service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if a vent blockage is in existence for longer than 24 hours. Surveillance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1.3.2 indicates that a module must be removed from service if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concrete accident temperature criterion has been exceeded for more than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
24 hours. A vent blockage of less than 24 hours would not cause the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature limit to be exceeded, as explained in Section 1.3 and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
objective for the 24-hour frequency required by surveillance 1.3.1. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apparent conflict between Section 1.3 and the action for Surveillance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requirement 1.3.2 should be resolved. It appears that Surveillance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requirement 1.3.2 actions are appropriate.

 One commenter stated that Section 1.2.14 to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Attachment A of the draft Certificate of Compliance is unnecessary because the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time to transfer the DSC from the transfer cask to the HSM would normally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require less than 8 hours. During this time, even with temperatures above 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
100
<!-- PJG 0377 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F without the solar shield, any increase in fuel clad temperature and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neutron shield temperature would be small and therefore not detrimental. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the transfer cask is open to the atmosphere and would not

pressurize.

 The vendor, VECTRA, has proposed this limiting

on the cladding or neutron shield, should the ambient conditions involve

NUREG&hyph;0459, ``Generic Adversary Characteristics Summary Report.'' Another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter made reference to an experiment with balloons which failed. Yet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
another commenter questioned the degree of protection in the spent fuel pool 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
versus dry cask storage. Will the cask be in a vital area? Will safeguards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be reviewed as part of the security plan? What is the effect on the security 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of these casks?

Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC reviewed potential issues related to possible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
radiological sabotage of storage casks at reactor site ISFSIs in the 1990 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking that added Subparts K and L to 10 CFR Part 72 (55 FR 29181; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
July 18, 1990). NRC regulations in 10 CFR Part 72 establish physical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection and security requirements for an ISFSI located within the owner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controlled area of a licensed power reactor site. Spent fuel in the ISFSI is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by 10 CFR 72.212(b)(5) to be protected against the design basis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threat for radiological sabotage using provisions and requirements as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified in 72.212(b)(5). Each utility licensed to have an ISFSI at its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactor site is required to develop security plans and install a security 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system that provides high assurance against unauthorized activities that could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constitute an unreasonable risk to the public health and safety. The security 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems at an ISFSI and its associated reactor are similar in design features 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to ensure the detection and assessment of unauthorized activities. Alarm 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annunciations at the ISFSI are monitored by the security alarm stations at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactor site. Response to intrusion is required. Each ISFSI is periodically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspected by NRC and annually audited by the licensee to ensure that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
security systems are operating within their design limits. The validity of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the threat is continually reviewed, with a formal evaluation every six months 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the NRC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC is currently conducting a study into the consequences of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle bomb detonated in the vicinity of an ISFSI. Following completion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this study the NRC will make a determination as to whether additional physical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection is warranted. In the interim, the NRC staff believes that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inherent nature of the fuel, along with the degree of protection provided by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the approved storage means for spent fuel, provides adequate protection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
against a vehicle bomb. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter wanted the emergency plan updated to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include initiating events caused by unnatural occurrences, such as sabotage, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particularly for this fuel storage option. The commenter believes that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC should determine if upgraded or new security barriers are necessary for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the David-Besse site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under 10 CFR 72.212 requirements, each general licensee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must protect the spent fuel against the design basis threat of radiological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sabotage. Also, 10 CFR 72.212 requires each general licensee to review the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactor emergency plan to determine whether its effectiveness is decreased, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and if so, to prepare the necessary changes and obtain the necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approvals. Therefore, the comment is already essentially incorporated into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
O. Several commenters had fabrication, quality assurance, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection concerns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
O.1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter raised questions about NRC oversight and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for proper cask fabrication by licensees. This is based on tests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the faulty welds at the Palisades plant conducted in July 1994 just before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the cask was filled, but the test was not reviewed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ultimate responsibility to ensure proper cask 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fabrication belongs to the user of the cask. Each Part 50 licensee (general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licensee) must have its own quality assurance (QA) program in place to oversee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vendor activities. The QA requirements apply to design, purchase, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fabrication, handling, inspection, testing, operation, maintenance, repair, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modifications of structures, systems and components, and decommissioning that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are important to safety. In addition, certified cask vendors have NRC-approved QA programs that control the implementation
of these quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities in a manner appropriate to the safety significance of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities. In turn, the general licensee reviews, approves, and oversees its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vendor's QA programs and activities. The NRC inspects both the general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licensee and the subtiered vendors for compliance with the respective QA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program requirements and for the adequacy of the activities performed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The faulty welds at Palisades in a loaded cask happened because the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
radiographs were not read initially. If the radiographs were read in a timely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manner, the cask should not have been loaded without corrective action first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being taken. NRC oversight and involvement in the process contributed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
timely detection of the defective cask weld. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
O.2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter wants clarification of the quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assurance program. NRC should have a regulatory guide for vendors with strong 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria for audits and subcontractors, and NRC inspection reports of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fabricating facilities need to be put in the PDR. How will a subcontractor of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NUHOMS vendor be checked by NRC in the future? If a vendor is going to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuously change subcontractors, the NRC should inspect each cask and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carefully inspect the vendor QA manual. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Chapters 11 or 13 of Regulatory Guides 3.62 and 3.61, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respectively, provide guidance on acceptable quality assurance programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These chapters state that a QA program meeting the requirements of Appendix B 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 10 CFR Part 50 or Subpart G of 10 CFR Part 72 will be accepted by NRC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both Parts 50 and 72 require an audit program. An NRC Branch Technical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Position titled ``Quality Assurance Programs for an Independent Spent Fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Storage Installation (ISFSI) 10 CFR 72,'' implements the NRC review of quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assurance programs submitted by applicants. NRC inspection reports are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
routinely placed in the PDR except for reports containing sensitive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information. Inspection reports of NUHOMS fabrication are available in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PDR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

O.3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter wanted to know if any nonconformances have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been discovered in inspection reports of any fabrication of the NUHOMS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
canister. If so, what? How was this resolved? How has the QA program for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NUHOMS been reviewed? Is there a manual? How will contractors and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subcontractors be checked? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A notice of nonconformance is documented in NRC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Inspection Report No. 721004/93&hyph;07 dated August 23, 1993. The NRC staff 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducted inspections in three phases at Duke Power Company, its contractor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Pacific Nuclear Fuel Services, Inc.) and subcontractor (Rancor, Inc.), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerning the QA activities with regard to the NUHOMS&hyph;24P dry spent fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage canisters. The NRC staff found that implementation of Duke Power 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Company QA Program was satisfactory, in general. However, certain NRC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements under Subpart G of 10 CFR Part 72 were not met. QA activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cited in the inspection report were documentation of nonconforming materials, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parts, or components; quality assurance records; control of purchased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
material, equipment, and services; control of measuring and test equipment; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructions, procedures, and drawings; licensee inspection; and audits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nonconformance corrective actions were taken and documented by Duke Power 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Company. The NRC staff found these corrective actions acceptable and so 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stated in letters dated January 13, 1994, and April 4, 1994. The corrective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions taken and the implementation of the QA Program are reviewed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
periodic inspections by the NRC staff. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The latest version of the QA manual is ``VECTRA Technologies, Inc., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Quality Assurance Manual,'' Revision 1, transmitted July 25, 1994, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflects the corporation's new name and organization and includes additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes to update the manual and clarify QA recordkeeping commitments. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC staff found Revision 1 acceptable and so stated in its letter dated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
August 23, 1994. In its review, the NRC staff compared Revision 1 of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
VECTRA QA Manual with Revision 3, Edition 2, of the PNSI QA manual, which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC staff found acceptable by letter dated January 28, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Contractors and subcontractors of cask vendors (or licensees) are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to periodic QA inspections performed by the NRC staff. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

O.4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter wanted to know if there is a possible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
problem, and if there was, how it was resolved, with a material defect in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Swagelok tube fittings for NUHOMS? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC is not aware of any material defect problem 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with Swagelok tube fittings on NUHOMS designs. There is no reliance on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Swagelok fittings as part of the confinement boundary for the NUHOMS canister. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fittings are covered by a metal plate that is welded on after the canister 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is vacuum dried. Therefore, if there is a failure in the fitting it would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the responsibility of the licensee to repair or replace it so that the DSC can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be loaded properly, but its failure would not cause a public health and safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concern.

Finding of No Significant Environmental Impact: Availability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has determined under the National Environmental Policy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act of 1969, as amended, and the Commission's regulations in Subpart A of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 CFR Part 51, that this rule is not a major Federal action significantly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affecting the quality of the human environment and therefore an environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact statement is not required. This final rule adds an additional cask to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the list of approved spent fuel storage casks that power reactor licensees can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use to store spent fuel at reactor sites without additional site-specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approvals from the Commission. The environmental assessment and finding of no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant impact on which this determination is based are available for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection at the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW. (Lower Level),

impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule affects only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licensees owning and operating nuclear power reactors and cask vendors. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
owners of nuclear power plants do not fall within the scope of the definition

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board or Federal Reserve) is revising its capital adequacy guidelines
for state member banks and bank holding companies to establish a limitation on the amount of certain deferred tax assets
that may be included in (that is, not deducted from) Tier 1 capital for risk-based and leverage capital purposes. The
capital rule was developed in response to the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (FASB) issuance of Statement
No. 109, ``Accounting for Income Taxes'' (FAS 109). Under the final rule, deferred tax assets that can only be realized
if an institution earns taxable income in the future are limited for regulatory capital purposes to the amount that
the institution expects to realize within one year of the quarter-end report date_based on its projection of taxable
income_or 10 percent of Tier 1 capital, whichever is less.

A. Characteristics of Deferred Tax Assets
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Deferred tax assets are assets that reflect, for financial reporting purposes, benefits of certain aspects of tax
laws and rules. Deferred tax assets may arise because of specific limitations under tax laws of different tax jurisdictions
that require that certain net operating losses (e.g., when, for tax purposes, expenses exceed revenues) or tax credits
be carried forward if they cannot be used to recover taxes previously paid. These ``carryforwards'' are realized
only if the institution generates sufficient future taxable income during the carryforward period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Deferred tax assets may also arise from the tax effects of certain events that have been recognized in one period for
financial statement purposes but will result in deductible amounts in a future period for tax purposes, i.e., the
tax effects of ``deductible temporary differences.'' For example, many depository institutions and bank holding
companies may report higher income to taxing authorities than they reflect in their regulatory reports
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 because their loan loss provisions are expensed for reporting purposes but are not deducted for tax purposes until
the loans are charged off.

State member banks are required to file quarterly Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (Call Reports) with
the Federal Reserve. Bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $150 million or more file quarterly
Consolidated Financial Statements for Bank Holding Companies (FR Y&hyph;9C reports) with the Federal Reserve.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Deferred tax assets arising from an organization's deductible temporary differences may or may not exceed the amount
of taxes previously paid that the organization could recover if the organization's temporary differences fully
reversed at the report date. Some of these deferred tax assets may theoretically be ``carried back'' and recovered
from taxes previously paid. On the other hand, when deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences
exceed such previously paid tax amounts, they will be realized only if there is sufficient future taxable income during
the carryforward period. Such deferred tax assets, and deferred tax assets arising from net operating loss and tax
credit carryforwards, are hereafter referred to as ``deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable
income.''

B. Summary of FAS 109
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In February 1992, the FASB issued Statement No. 109, ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Accounting for Income Taxes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' which supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 11 and FASB Statement No. 96. FAS 109 provides guidance
on many aspects of accounting for income taxes, including the accounting for deferred tax assets. FAS 109 potentially
allows some state member banks and bank holding companies to record significantly higher deferred tax assets than
previously permitted under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and the federal banking agencies'
prior reporting policies.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Unlike the general practice under previous standards, FAS 109 permits the reporting of deferred tax assets that are
dependent upon future taxable income. However, FAS 109 requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reduce
the net deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not (i.e., a greater than 50 percent likelihood) to be
realized.

The federal banking agencies consist of the Federal Reserve Board (Board), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
(FDIC), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) (hereafter,
the ``agencies''.)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FAS 109 became effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 1992. The adoption of this standard has
resulted in the reporting of additional deferred tax assets in Call Reports and FR Y&hyph;9C reports that directly
increase institutions' undivided profits (retained earnings) and Tier 1 capital.

C. Concerns Regarding Deferred Tax Assets That Are Dependent Upon Future Taxable Income
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Reserve has certain concerns about including in capital deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future
taxable income. Realization of such assets depends on whether a banking organization has sufficient future taxable
income during the carryforward period. Since a banking organization that is in a net operating loss carryforward
position is often experiencing financial difficulties, its prospects for generating sufficient taxable income
in the future are uncertain. In addition, the condition of and future prospects for an organization often can and do
change very rapidly in the banking environment. This raises concerns about the realizability of deferred tax assets
that are dependent upon future taxable income, even when an organization may be sound and well-managed. Thus, for
many organizations such deferred tax assets may not be realized, and for other organizations there is a high degree
of subjectivity in determining the realizability of this asset. Furthermore, while many organizations may be able
to make reasonable projections of taxable income for relatively short periods and actually realize this income,
beyond a short time period, the reliability of the projections tends to decrease significantly. In addition, unlike
many other assets, banking organizations generally cannot obtain the value of deferred tax assets by selling them.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, as an organization's condition deteriorates, it is less likely that deferred tax assets that are dependent
upon future taxable income will be realized. Therefore, the organization is required under FAS 109 to reduce its deferred
tax assets through increases to the asset's valuation allowance. Additions to this allowance would reduce the organization's
regulatory capital at precisely the time it needs capital support the most. Thus, the inclusion in capital of deferred
tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income raises supervisory concerns.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of these concerns, the agencies, under the auspices of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council
(FFIEC), considered whether it would be appropriate to adopt FAS 109 for regulatory reporting purposes. On August
3, 1992, the FFIEC requested public comment on this matter, and on December 23, 1992, after consideration of the comments
received, the FFIEC decided that banks and savings associations should adopt FAS 109 for reporting purposes in Call
Reports and Thrift Financial Reports (TFRs) beginning in the first quarter of 1993 (or the beginning of their first
fiscal year thereafter, if later). Furthermore, the Board decided that bank holding companies should adopt FAS 109
in FR Y&hyph;9C Reports at the same time.

D. Proposal for the Treatment of Deferred Tax Assets
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FFIEC, in reaching its decision on regulatory reporting, also recommended that each of the agencies amend its
regulatory capital standards to limit the amount of deferred tax assets that can be included in regulatory capital.
In response to the FFIEC's recommendation, on February 11, 1993, the Board issued for public comment a proposal to
adopt the recommendation of the FFIEC in full, as summarized below (54 FR 8007, February 11, 1993). The FFIEC recommended
that the agencies limit the amount of deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income that can be
included in regulatory capital to the lesser of:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
i. the amount of such deferred tax assets that the institution expects to realize within one year of the quarter-end
report date, based on its projection of taxable income (exclusive of net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards
and reversals of existing temporary differences), or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. 10 percent of Tier 1 capital, net of goodwill and all identifiable intangible assets other than purchased mortgage
servicing rights and purchased credit card relationships (and before any disallowed deferred tax assets are deducted).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Deferred tax assets that can be realized from taxes paid in prior carryback years and from future reversals of existing
taxable temporary differences would generally not be limited under the proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Public Comments on the Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The comment period for the Board's proposal ended on March 15, 1993. The Board received nineteen comment letters including
ten from multinational and large regional banking organizations, and three community banks. In addition, the Board
received four comment letters from bank trade associations and two from finance companies. Sixteen commenters offered
support for the Board's proposal to require banking organizations to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
report, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
for regulatory purposes, deferred tax assets in accordance with FAS 109. In addition, fifteen commenters indicated
that it would be preferable for the Board to place no limit on the amount of deferred tax assets allowable in capital.
These commenters indicated that, in their view, embracing FAS 109 in its entirety would achieve consistency between
regulatory standards and GAAP as well as maintain consistency with the intent of Section 121 of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA) of 1991. Commenters asserted that the criteria set forth in FAS 109
to recognize and value deferred tax assets is sufficiently conservative to limit any exposure to the bank insurance
fund and that an arbitrary or mechanical formula, such as the ones proposed, would not provide a more accurate or reliable
result.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While preferring no capital limit on deferred tax assets, some commenters noted that the proposal represented a compromise
and a step forward from prior regulatory policies that permitted little or no inclusion in regulatory reports or capital
of deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income. Two commenters generally supported the proposal
or expressed their understanding of the regulator's concern regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets
and one commenter indicated the capital treatment should be consistent with the capital treatment for identifiable
intangible assets.

A. Responses to the Board's Questions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Question 1: (Gross-up of Intangible Assets) Nine commenters responded to the Board's first question regarding whether
certain identifiable intangible assets acquired in a nontaxable business combination accounted for as a purchase
should be adjusted for the tax effect of the difference between the market or appraised value of the asset and its tax
basis. Under FAS 109, this tax effect is recorded separately in a deferred tax liability account, whereas under preexisting
GAAP, this tax effect reduced the amount of the intangible asset. This change in treatment could cause a large increase
(i.e., gross-up) in the reported amount of certain identifiable intangible assets, such as core deposit intangibles,
which are deducted for purposes of computing regulatory capital.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seven commenters indicated that banking organizations should be permitted to deduct the net after-tax amount of
the intangible asset from capital, not the gross amount of the intangible asset. These commenters argued that FAS
109 will create artificially high values for intangible assets and the related deferred tax liability when a banking
organization acquires the assets with a carryover basis for tax purposes but revalues the asset for financial reporting
purposes. The commenters generally indicated that, under FAS 109, the balance sheet will not accurately reflect
the value paid for the intangibles. Furthermore, commenters indicated that the increased value of the intangible
posed no risk to institutions, because a reduction in the value of the asset would effectively extinguish the related
deferred tax liability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other hand, two commenters indicated that the pretax (gross) value of intangible assets should be deducted
for regulatory capital purposes in this situation. This organization contended that intangible assets should be
treated similarly to other assets, which are not reduced by any related liability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Question 2: The Board's second question inquired about (i) the potential burden associated with the proposal and
whether a limitation based on projections of taxable income would be difficult to implement, and (ii) the appropriateness
of the separate entity method for deferred tax assets and tax sharing agreements in general.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Methodology Based on Income Projections. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board received eleven letters from commenters who responded directly to this aspect of the question. Four commenters
supported using income projections and stated that calculating deferred tax asset limitations for capital purposes
based on projected taxable income would not be difficult to implement and would not impose an additional burden because
many banking organizations already forecast taxable income in order to recognize their deferred tax assets. One
commenter added that these calculations should not pose any problems, provided they are done on a consolidated basis.
In addition, one commenter suggested that the Board clarify the term ``realized within one year'' so that readers
understand that the phrase means the amount of deferred tax assets that could be used to offset income taxes generated
in the next 12 months, and not the amount of deferred tax assets that actually will be used.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four commenters specifically opposed an income approach, citing the additional burden that would be created by the
detailed calculations. One commenter specifically favored implementing the percentage of capital method since
it is certain and exact and does not involve as many estimations or fluctuations as the income approach.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Five commenters supported an approach based on the financial condition of the institution, some of whom also offered
support or opposition to the income or percentage of capital approach. One commenter suggested that ``healthy''
institutions be permitted to include deferred tax assets in regulatory capital in an amount based on a specified percentage
of Tier 1 capital. Another commenter supported an approach that excluded ``well capitalized'' banks from the limitation.
On the other hand, one commenter did not support using an approach for calculating the capital limitation based upon
the perceived ``health'' of the institution, stating that this method could lead to arbitrary and inconsistent measures
of capital adequacy.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Separate Entity Approach. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Twelve commenters specifically addressed this part of the question. Under the Board's proposal, the capital limit
for deferred tax assets would be determined on a separate entity basis for each state member bank so that a bank that
is a subsidiary of a holding company would be treated as a separate taxpayer rather than as part of the consolidated
entity. All of the commenters opposed the separate entity approach. They argued that the separate entity approach
is artificial and that tax-sharing agreements between financially capable bank holding companies and bank subsidiaries
should be considered when evaluating the recognition of deferred tax assets for regulatory capital purposes. Commenters
also stated that the separate entity method is unnecessarily restrictive and that any systematic and rational method
should be permitted for the calculation of the limitation for each bank.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter based its opposition for the separate entity approach on the view that the limitation is not consistent
with the Board's 1987 ``Policy Statement on the Responsibility of Bank Holding Companies to Act as Sources of Strength
to Their Subsidiary Banks'' which, in some respects, treats a controlled group as one entity. Another commenter contended
that the effect of a separate entity calculation would be to reduce bank capital which is needed for future lending
which would be inconsistent with the March 10, 1993, ``Interagency Policy Statement on Credit Availability''. The
same commenter also noted that the regulatory burden and cost of calculating the deferred tax asset on a separate entity
basis would be substantial for both bankers and regulators.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Question 3: The Board's third question addressed three specific provisions of the proposal. These provisions included
(i) requiring tax planning strategies to be part of an institution's projection of taxable income for the next year,
(ii) requiring organizations to assume that all temporary differences fully reverse at the report date, and (iii)
permitting the grandfathering of amounts previously reported if they were in excess of the proposed limitation.

Inclusion of Tax Planning Strategies.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two commenters addressed this issue. Both commenters stated that they support including tax planning strategies
in an institution's projection of taxable income. One commenter stated that the proposal should be modified to permit
institutions to consider strategies that would ensure realization of deferred tax assets within the one-year time
frame. The proposal provided that organizations should consider tax planning strategies that would realize tax
carryforwards or net operating losses that would otherwise expire during that time frame.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Four commenters specifically addressed this aspect of the question, and all agreed that it is appropriate to require
the assumption that all temporary differences fully reverse as of the report date. One commenter noted that this assumption
would eliminate the burden of scheduling the ``turnaround'' of temporary differences.

Grandfathering.

Five commenters discussed the proposal's provision on grandfathering which would allow the amount of any deferred
tax assets reported as of September 1992 in excess of the limit to be phased out over a two year period ending in 1994.
Four commenters offered support for grandfathering but argued that excess deferred tax assets should be grandfathered
until the underlying temporary differences reversed, rather than be phased out over two years. The other commenter
disagreed with the grandfathering proposal and stated that such provisions would be inconsistent with the proposal's
capital adequacy objectives.

A. Limitation on Deferred Tax Assets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistent with the FFIEC's recommendation and the Board's proposal, the Board is limiting in regulatory capital
deferred tax assets that are dependent on future taxable income to the lesser of: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. The amount of such deferred tax assets that the institution expects to realize within one year of the quarter-end
report date, based on its projection of taxable income (exclusive of net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards
and reversals of existing temporary differences), or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. 10 percent of Tier 1 capital, net of goodwill and all identifiable intangible assets other than purchased mortgage
servicing rights and purchased credit card relationships (and before any disallowed deferred tax assets are deducted).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Deferred tax assets that can be realized from taxes paid in prior carryback years and from future reversals of existing
taxable temporary differences are generally not limited under the final rule. The reported amount of deferred tax
assets, net of its valuation allowance, in excess of the limitation would be deducted from Tier 1 capital for purposes
of calculating both the risk-based and leverage capital ratios. Banking organizations should not include the amount
of disallowed deferred tax assets in weighted-risk assets in the risk-based capital ratio and should deduct the amount
of disallowed deferred tax assets from average total assets in the leverage capital ratio. Deferred tax assets included
in capital continue to be assigned a risk weight of 100 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To determine the limit, a banking organization should assume that all existing temporary differences fully reverse
as of the report date. Also, estimates of taxable income for the next year should include the effect of tax planning
strategies the organization is planning to implement to realize net operating losses or tax credit carryforwards
that will otherwise expire during the year. Consistent with FAS 109, the Board believes tax planning strategies are
carried out to prevent the expiration of such carryforwards. Both of these requirements are consistent with the proposal.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The capital limitation is intended to balance the Board's continued concerns about deferred tax assets that are dependent
upon future taxable income against the fact that such assets will, in many cases, be realized. This approach generally
permits full inclusion of deferred tax assets potentially recoverable from carrybacks, since these amounts will
generally be realized. This approach also includes those deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable
income, if they can be recovered from projected taxable income during the next year. The Board is limiting projections
of future taxable income to one year because, in general, the Board believes that organizations are generally capable
of making projections of taxable income for the following twelve month period that have a reasonably good probability
of being achieved. However, the reliability of projections tends to decrease significantly beyond that time period.
Deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income are further limited to 10 percent of Tier 1 capital,
since the Board believes such assets should not comprise a large portion of an organization's capital base given the
uncertainty of realization associated with these assets and the difficulty in selling these assets apart from the
organization. Furthermore, a 10% capital limit also reduces the risk that an overly optimistic estimate of future
taxable income will cause the bank to significantly overstate the value of deferred tax assets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Banking organizations already follow FAS 109 for regulatory reports and accordingly, are making projections of
taxable income. Banking organizations already report in regulatory reports the amount of deferred tax assets that
would be disallowed under the proposal. In addition, the 10 percent calculation of Tier 1 capital is straightforward.
Therefore, the Board believes that banking organizations will have little difficulty implementing this final rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Guidance on Specific Implementation Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the comments received and after discussions with the other agencies, the Board is providing the following
guidance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Originating Temporary Differences_Consistent with the Board's proposal, the final rule does not specify how the
provision for loan and lease losses and other originating temporary differences should be treated for purposes of
projecting taxable income for the next year. Banking organizations routinely prepare income forecasts for future
periods and, in theory, income forecasts for book income should be adjusted for originating temporary differences
in arriving at a projection of taxable income. On the other hand, requiring such adjustments adds complexity to the
final rule. Furthermore, deductible originating temporary differences, such as the provision for loan and lease
losses, generally would lead to additional deferred tax assets. Thus, arguably, such temporary differences should
not be added back to book income in determining the amount of deferred tax assets that will be realized. Accordingly,
the Board is permitting each institution to decide whether or not to adjust projected book income for originating
temporary differences. While the Board is not specifying a single treatment on originating temporary differences
in the final rule, institutions should follow a reasonable and consistent approach.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Gross-up of Intangibles_As noted above, FAS 109 could lead to a large increase (i.e., gross-up) in the reported amount
of certain intangible assets, such as core deposit intangibles, which are deducted for purposes of computing regulatory
capital. Commenters stated that the increased value of an intangible posed no risk to institutions, because a reduction
in the value of the asset would effectively extinguish the related deferred tax liability. The Board concurs with
this position and, consequently, will permit, for capital adequacy purposes, netting of deferred tax liabilities
arising from this gross-up effect against related intangible assets. To ensure this benefit is not double counted,
a deferred tax liability netted in this manner could not also be netted against deferred tax assets when determining
the amount of deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income. Netting will not be permitted against
purchased mortgage servicing rights (PMSRs) and purchased credit card relationships (PCCRs), since only the portion
of these assets that exceed specified capital limits are deducted for capital adequacy purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Leveraged Leases_While not expected to significantly affect many banking organizations, one commenter stated
that future net tax liabilities related to leveraged leases acquired in a purchase business combination are included
in the valuation of the leveraged lease and are not shown on the balance sheet as deferred tax liabilities. This artificially
increases the amount of deferred tax assets for those institutions that acquire a leveraged lease portfolio. Thus,
this commenter continued, the future taxes payable included in the valuation of a leveraged lease portfolio in a purchase
business combination should be treated as a taxable temporary difference whose reversal would support the recognition
of deferred tax assets, if applicable. The Board agrees with this commenter and, therefore, banking organizations
may use the deferred tax liabilities that are embedded in the carrying value of a leveraged lease to reduce the amount
of deferred tax assets subject to the capital limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tax Jurisdictions_Unlike the proposal, the final rule does not require an institution to determine its limitation
on deferred tax assets on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. While such an approach may theoretically be more
accurate, the Board does not believe the greater precision that would be achieved in mandating such an approach outweighs
the complexities involved and its inherent cost to institutions. Thus, banking organizations may make projections
of their taxable income on an organization-wide basis and use a combined tax rate for purposes of calculating the one-year
limitation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Timing_Institutions may use the future taxable income projections for their current fiscal year (adjusted for any
significant changes that have occurred or are expected to occur) when applying the capital limit at an interim report
date rather than preparing a new projection each quarter. Several commenters requested this treatment because it
reduces the frequency with which banking organizations are required to revise their estimate of future taxable income.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Available for Sale Securities_Under FASB Statement No. 115, ``Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities'' (FAS 115), ``available-for-sale'' securities are reported in regulatory reports at market value,
and unrealized gains and losses on such securities are included, net of tax effects, in a separate component of stockholders
equity. These tax effects may increase or decrease the amount of deferred tax assets an institution reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board has recently decided to exclude from regulatory capital the amount of net unrealized gains and losses on
available for sale securities (except net unrealized losses of available-for-sale equity securities with readily
determinable fair values) (59 FR 63241, December 8, 1994). Thus, excluding for capital adequacy purposes deferred
tax effects arising from reporting unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale securities is consistent
with the regulatory capital treatment for such gains and losses. On the other hand, requiring the exclusion of such
deferred tax effects would add significant complexity to the capital guidelines and in most cases would not have a
significant impact on regulatory capital ratios. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, when determining the capital limit for deferred tax assets, the Board has decided to permit, but not require,
institutions to adjust the reported amount of deferred tax assets for any deferred tax assets and liabilities arising
from marking-to-market available-for-sale debt securities for regulatory reporting purposes. This choice will
reduce implementation burden for institutions not wanting to contend with the complexity arising from such adjustments,
while permitting those institutions that want to achieve greater precision to make such adjustments. Institutions
must follow a consistent approach with respect to such adjustments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Separate Entity Method_The proposed capital limit was to be determined on a separate entity basis for each state member
bank. Use of a separate entity approach on income tax sharing agreements (including intercompany tax payments and
current and deferred taxes) is generally required by the Board's 1978 Policy Statement on Intercorporate Income
Tax Accounting Transactions of Bank Holding Companies and State Member Banks, and similar policies are followed
by the other banking agencies. Thus, any change to the separate entity approach for deferred tax assets would also
need to consider changes to this policy statement, which is outside the scope of this rulemaking. The Board notes that
regulatory reports of banks are generally required to be filed using a separate entity approach and consistency between
the reports would be reduced if the Board permitted institutions to use other methods for calculating deferred tax
assets in addition to a separate entity approach. Thus, while a number of the commenters suggested that the Board consider
permitting other approaches, the Board will generally require the separate entity approach.

State member banks should project taxable income for the bank, generally on a consolidated basis including subsidiaries
of the bank. Bank holding companies should project taxable income for the holding company, generally on a consolidated
basis including bank and non-bank subsidiaries of the holding company.

As proposed, the final rule contains an exception to the separate entity approach when a state member bank's parent
holding company does not have the financial capability to reimburse the bank for tax benefits derived from the bank's
carryback of net operating losses or tax credits. In these cases, the amount of carryback potential the bank may consider
in calculating the capital limit on deferred tax assets is limited to the lesser amount which it could reasonably expect
to have refunded by its parent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Grandfathering_The proposal would grandfather any deferred tax assets reported as of September 1992 in excess of
the proposed limit, but would require that such excess amounts be phased out over a two year period ending in 1994. Since
all grandfathered amounts are now fully amortized, the Board's final rule does not include any grandfathering provision.

IV. Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board does not believe that the adoption of this final rule will have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small business entities (in this case, small banking organizations), in accordance with the spirit and
purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.). In this regard, the vast majority of small banking
organizations currently have very limited amounts of net deferred tax assets, which are the subject of this proposal,
as a component of their capital structures. In addition, this final rule, in combination with the adoption by the Board
of FAS 109 for regulatory reporting purposes, allows many organizations to increase the amount of deferred tax assets
they include in regulatory capital. Moreover, because the risk-based and leverage capital guidelines generally
do not apply to bank holding companies with consolidated assets of less than $150 million, this proposal will not affect
such companies. The Board did not receive any comment letters specifically addressing regulatory flexibility concerns,
and therefore, no alternatives to the proposal were considered to address regulatory flexibility.

V. Paperwork Reduction Act and Regulatory Burden 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board has determined that this final rule will not increase the regulatory paperwork burden of banking organizations
pursuant to the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

Section 302 of the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;325, 108
Stat. 2160) provides that the federal banking agencies must consider the administrative burdens and benefits of
any new regulation that impose additional requirements on insured depository institutions. Section 302 also requires
such a rule to take effect on the first day of the calendar quarter following final publication of the rule, unless the
agency, for good cause, determines an earlier effective date is appropriate.

Deductions of holdings of capital securities also would not be made in the case of interstate ``stake out'' investments
that comply with the Board's Policy Statement on Nonvoting Equity Investments, 12 CFR 225.143 (Federal Reserve Regulatory

by other banking organizations but taken in satisfaction of debts previously contracted would be exempt from any
deduction from capital. The Board intends to monitor nonreciprocal holdings of other banking organizations' capital
instruments and to provide information on such holdings to the Basle Supervisors' Committee as called for under the

Deferred tax assets.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The amount of deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income, net of the valuation allowance for
deferred tax assets, that may be included in, that is, not deducted from, a bank's capital may not exceed the lesser
of: (i) the amount of these deferred tax assets that the bank is expected to realize within one year of the calendar quarter-end
date, based on its projections of future taxable income for that year,
<FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>
 or (ii) 10 percent of tier 1 capital. For purposes of calculating this limitation, Tier 1 capital is defined as the sum
of core capital elements, net of goodwill and all identifiable intangible assets other than purchased mortgage servicing
rights and purchased credit card relationships (and before any disallowed deferred tax assets are deducted). The
amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized from taxes paid in prior carryback years and from future reversals
of existing taxable temporary differences and that do not exceed the amount which the bank could reasonably expect
to have refunded by its parent (if applicable) generally are not limited. The reported amount of deferred tax assets,
net of any valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, in excess of these amounts is to be deducted from a bank's core
capital elements in determining tier 1 capital.

Projected future taxable income should not include net operating loss carryforwards to be used during that year or
the amount of existing temporary differences a bank expects to reverse within the year. Such projections should include
the estimated effect of tax planning strategies that the organization expects to implement to realize net operating
losses or tax credit carryforwards that would otherwise expire during the year. Institutions may use the future taxable
income projections for their current fiscal year (adjusted for any significant changes that have occurred or are
expected to occur) when applying the capital limit at an interim report date rather than preparing a new projection
each quarter. To determine the limit, an institution should assume that all existing temporary differences fully
reverse as of the report date.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
a. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has adopted a minimum ratio of tier 1 capital to total assets
to assist in the assessment of the capital adequacy of state member banks.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 The principal objective of this measure is to place a constraint on the maximum degree to which a state member bank can
leverage its equity capital base. It is intended to be used as a supplement to the risk-based capital measure.

Supervisory risk-based capital ratios that related capital to weighted-risk assets for state member banks are outlined
in Appendix A to this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
b. The guidelines apply to all state member banks on a consolidated basis and are to be used in the examination and supervisory
process as well as in the analysis of applications acted upon by the Federal Reserve. The Board will review the guidelines
from time to time and will consider the need for possible adjustments in light of any significant changes in the economy,
financial markets, and banking practices.

II. The Tier 1 Leverage Ratio
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
a. The Board has established a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
minimum 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
level of tier 1 capital to total assets of 3 percent. An institution operating at or near these levels is expected to
have well-diversified risk, including no undue interest-rate risk exposure; excellent asset quality; high liquidity;
and good earnings; and in general be considered a strong banking organization, rated composite 1 under CAMEL rating
system of banks. Institutions not meeting these characteristics, as well as institutions with supervisory, financial,
or operational weaknesses, are expected to operate well above minimum capital standards. Institutions experiencing
or anticipating significant growth also are expected to maintain capital ratios, including tangible capital positions,
well above the minimum levels. For example, most such banks generally have operated at capital levels ranging from
100 to 200 basis points above the stated minimums. Higher capital ratios could be required if warranted by the particular
circumstances or risk profiles of individual banks. Thus for all but the most highly rated banks meeting the conditions
set forth above, the minimum tier 1 leverage ratio is to be 3 percent plus an additional cushion of a least 100 to 200 basis
points. In all cases, banking institutions should hold capital commensurate with the level and nature of all risks,
including the volume and severity of problem loans, to which they are exposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. A bank's tier 1 leverage ratio is calculated by dividing its tier 1 capital (the numerator of the ratio) by its average
total consolidated assets (the denominator of the ratio). The ratio will also be calculated using period-end assets
whenever necessary, on a case-by-case basis. For the purpose of this leverage ratio, the definition of tier 1 capital
for year-end 1992 as set forth in the risk-based capital guidelines contained in Appendix A of this part will be used.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 As a general matter, average total consolidated assets are defined as the quarterly average total assets (defined
net of the allowance for loan and lease losses) reported on the bank's Reports of Condition and Income (Call Report),
less goodwill; amounts of purchased mortgage servicing rights and purchased credit card relationships that, in
the aggregate, are in excess of 50 percent of tier 1 capital; amounts of purchased credit card relationships in excess
of 25 percent of tier 1 capital; all other intangible assets; any investments in subsidiaries or associated companies
that the Federal Reserve determines should be deducted from tier 1 capital; and deferred tax assets that are dependent
upon future taxable income, net of their valuation allowance, in excess of the limitation set forth in section II.B.4
of this Appendix A.

At the end of 1992, Tier 1 capital for state member banks includes common equity, minority interest in the equity accounts
of consolidated subsidiaries, and qualifying noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. In addition, as a general
matter, Tier 1 capital excludes goodwill; amounts of purchased mortgage servicing rights and purchased credit card
relationships that, in the aggregate, exceed 50 percent of Tier 1 capital; amounts of purchased credit card relationships
that exceed 25 percent of Tier 1 capital; all other intangible assets; and deferred tax assets that are dependent upon
future taxable income, net of their valuation allowance, in excess of certain limitations. The Federal Reserve may
exclude certain investments in subsidiaries or associated companies as appropriate.

c. Whenever appropriate, including when a bank is undertaking expansion, seeking to engage in new activities or otherwise
facing unusual or abnormal risks, the Board will continue to consider the level of an individual bank's tangible tier
1 leverage ratio (after deducting all intangibles) in making an overall assessment of capital adequacy. This is consistent
with the Federal Reserve's risk-based capital guidelines an long-standing Board policy and practice with regard
to leverage guidelines. Banks experiencing growth, whether internally or by acquisition, are expected to maintain
strong capital position substantially above minimum supervisory levels, without significant reliance on intangible
assets.

Deductions of holdings of capital securities also would not be made in the case of interstate ``stake out'' investments
that comply with the Board's Policy Statement on Nonvoting Equity Investments, 12 CFR 225.143 (Federal Reserve Regulatory
Service 4&hyph;172.1; 68 Federal Reserve Bulletin 413 (1982)). In addition, holdings of capital instruments issued
by other banking organizations but taken in satisfaction of debts previously contracted would be exempt from any
deduction from capital. The Board intends to monitor nonreciprocal holdings of other banking organizations' capital
instruments and to provide information on such holdings to the Basle Supervisors' Committee as called for under the
Basle capital framework.

Deferred tax assets.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The amount of deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income, net of the valuation allowance for
deferred tax assets, that may be included in, that is, not deducted from, a banking organization's capital may not
exceed the lesser of: (i) the amount of these deferred tax assets that the banking organization is expected to realize
within one year of the calendar quarter-end date, based on its projections of future taxable income for that year,
<FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>
 or (ii) 10 percent of tier 1 capital. For purposes of calculating this limitation, tier 1 capital is defined as the sum
of core capital elements, net of goodwill and all identifiable intangible assets other than purchased mortgage servicing
rights and purchased credit card relationships (and before any disallowed deferred tax assets are deducted). The
amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized from taxes paid in prior carryback years and from future reversals
of existing taxable temporary differences generally are not limited. The reported amount of deferred tax assets,
net of any valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, in excess of these amounts is to be deducted from a banking organization's
core capital elements in determining tier 1 capital.

Projected future taxable income should not include net operating loss carryforwards to be used during that year or
the amount of existing temporary differences a bank holding company expects to reverse within the year. Such projections
should include the estimated effect of tax planning strategies that the organization expects to implement to realize
net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards that will otherwise expire during the year. Banking organizations
may use the future taxable income projections for their current fiscal year (adjusted for any significant changes
that have occurred or are expected to occur) when applying the capital limit at an interim report date rather than preparing
a new projection each quarter. To determine the limit, a banking organization should assume that all existing temporary
differences fully reverse as of the report date.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain Airbus Industrie Model A300, A300&hyph;600, A310, and A320 series airplanes, that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires inspection of certain landing gear brakes for wear and replacement if the wear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limits prescribed in this AD are not met, and incorporation of the specified wear limits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into the FAA-approved maintenance inspection program. This amendment is prompted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by an accident in which a transport category airplane executed a rejected takeoff (RTO) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and was unable to stop on the runway due to worn brakes; and the subsequent review of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowable brake wear limits for all transport category airplanes. The actions specified by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this AD are intended to prevent the loss of brake effectiveness during a high energy RTO.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to certain Airbus Industrie Model A300, A300&hyph;600, A310, and A320 series airplanes was
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on February 15, 1994 (59 FR 7228). That action proposed to require inspection of certain landing gear brakes for wear
and replacement if the wear limits prescribed in this AD are not met, and incorporation of the specified wear limits
into the FAA-approved maintenance inspection program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter supports the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter, BFGoodrich, requests that the tables contained in the proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that list maximum brake wear limits for the affected airplanes be revised. BFGoodrich 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicates that the airplane model/series listed for BFGoodrich series 2&hyph;1526 brake part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
numbers should be ``A320,'' instead of ``A320&hyph;220'' and ``A320&hyph;200.'' The commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also indicates that three additional part numbers for BFGoodrich brakes should be listed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the tables for Model A320 series airplanes: Part numbers 2&hyph;1526, 2&hyph;1526&hyph;5 (both with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximum wear limits of 1.97
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;), and 2&hyph;1572 (with a maximum wear limit of 2.68
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the FAA agrees with the commenter's remarks, inclusion of the three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional part numbers specified by the commenter would necessitate (under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act) reissuing the notice, reopening the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period for public comment, considering additional comments received, and eventually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issuing a final rule; the time required for that procedure may be as long as four additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
months. In the interest of issuing this final rule, and in consideration of the amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time that has already elapsed since issuance of the original notice, the FAA has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined that further delay of this final rule action is not appropriate. However, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAA may consider further rulemaking on this issue to address the three additional part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
numbers discussed by the commenter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, on behalf of one of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
members, suggests that measuring the maximum length of the wear pin may not be as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective as measuring the total length of the wear pin or controlling the carbon thickness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the brake. The commenter points out that, due to human error, it is possible to have a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thinner disc with the same amount of wear pin length showing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA does not concur. The FAA infers from the commenter's remarks that it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is referring to controlling the carbon thickness of the brakes by direct measurement of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thickness of the brake stack. The FAA finds that measuring the thickness of the brake 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stack would only be useful when specifying the brake assembly configuration and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thicknesses of new, refurbished, or overhauled individual discs. Otherwise, a brake disc 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that is too thin also could be installed in a brake stack having a wear limit that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controlled by measuring the stack thickness. Further, it would not be practical to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
routinely measure the brake stack on the airplane as all of the wheels attached to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brakes would have to be removed to allow access to accomplish the measurement. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAA considers that this would pose an unwarranted burden on operators. Currently, only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the wear pin must be monitored while the brake is installed on the airplane. If an operator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduces the wear limit, the pin could be shortened or the operator could devise a method 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of accounting for the reduced wear using the existing wear pin as opposed to removing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the wheel and measuring the brake stack. (Thus, the wheels would not have to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removed from the airplane since the wear pin can still be used to monitor brake wear.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The wear limits specified in this AD, which are used to establish wear pin lengths, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are interdependent with the brake configuration and minimum disc and stack thicknesses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The stack and disc thicknesses are specified for new, refurbished, or overhauled brakes in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the airplane maintenance manual (AMM), the component maintenance manual (CMM), a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service bulletin, or the brake manufacturer's assembly drawings. These minimum brake 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stack and disc thicknesses have been established by tests and in-service wear data and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis such that monitoring a wear pin should not allow the stack or disc minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limits to be exceeded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ATA also questions the need for the proposed AD, and requests that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision be included in paragraph (a)(2) of the AD to state that the AD would no longer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be applicable to operators that have acceptably revised their maintenance programs, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that operators choosing this provision could use an alternative recordkeeping method in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lieu of that required by &sect;&sect;91.417 or 121.380 of the Federal Aviation Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(14 CFR 91.417 or 121.380). The FAA would be defined as the cognizant Principal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Maintenance Inspector (PMI) for operators electing this alternative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ATA states that if its suggested provision is not included, confusion will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
always exist as to what records should be maintained for the duration A300/A320 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations. The ATA maintains that once an operator incorporates the criteria (brake 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wear limits) specified in the proposal into the maintenance program, the AD should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
signed off as complete, since such incorporation is the stated purpose of the AD. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATA is aware of an FAA concern that the proposed type of rule must continue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indefinitely because operators may otherwise escalate intervals through their reliability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs. The ATA states that adjustments to operators' programs are accomplished 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with substantiation and with the approval of FAA Flight Standards District Offices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(FSDO). The ATA maintains that FAA FSDO's have sufficient authority to ensure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operators maintain the brakes on their Model A300/A320 series airplanes once the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed criteria (brake wear limits) have been incorporated into an operator's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintenance program.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA does not concur. The intent of this AD is that operators incorporate maximum brake wear limits into the FAA-approved
maintenance inspection program, and that all brakes be inspected once for wear and replaced, if necessary. Once an
operator has complied with the requirements of this AD, the FAA does not intend that operators subsequently record
the accomplishment of this AD each time a brake is inspected or overhauled in accordance with that operator's FAA-approved
maintenance inspection program. ``NOTE 2'' has been added to paragraph (a) of the final rule to clarify this intent.
Operators should coordinate recordkeeping for accomplishment of the actions required by this AD with the cognizant
Principal Maintenance Inspector (PMI). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One ATA member requests that carbon brakes be excluded from the applicability of the proposed rule. Airbus adds its
concurrence with the ATA member's request, and has advised the ATA that all carbon brakes installed on airplanes manufactured
by Airbus are capable of sustaining a maximum energy rejected takeoff (RTO) in a 100 percent worn brake configuration.
Airbus also states that no unsafe condition has been identified for airplanes having carbon brakes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Airbus also indicates that issuance of an AD to require implementation of existing CMM limits would impose unnecessary
inspections (with associated costs) and would create an unnecessary paperwork burden on operators. Airbus states
that, if the proposed rule is adopted, then an inspection would be required for all airplanes, not just the 28 airplanes
specified in the economic impact information of the proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA does not concur. As discussed in the preamble of the proposal, this AD, as well as other previously issued AD's
to mandate specific maximum brake wear limits on transport category airplanes, was prompted by an accident in 1988
involving worn brakes on a McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;10 series airplane. During the process of promulgating
those AD's, the FAA became aware that not all operators were following the manufacturer's recommended brake wear
limits. The FAA acknowledges that the wear limits for carbon brakes have not changed. However, the purpose of this
AD is simply to establish the correct brake wear limits for the affected airplanes, including those on which carbon
brakes having unchanged brake wear limits, are installed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA acknowledges that operators of airplanes having carbon brakes will be required to confirm that inspections
are being accomplished and to record compliance with this AD. However, if an operator already operates in accordance
with the wear limits specified in this AD, as implied by ATA and Airbus, then only the costs associated with confirming
compliance with the AD and recording such compliance are necessary. The economic impact information specified below
addresses 46 airplanes that will be required to accomplish the inspection specified in this AD. (This number, 46,
has been revised from the 28 airplanes specified in the proposal; the FAA's latest information is that 46 airplanes
will be affected by the inspection requirement.) However, carbon brakes may be installed on some of those airplanes;
therefore, some of the 46 airplanes addressed in this AD already may be operated in accordance with its provisions.
Therefore, the actual total cost impact of this AD on U.S. operators may be less than the cost reflected in the cost estimate
information, below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requests that the brake wear limit specified in the proposed rule for brake part numbers 2&hyph;1526&hyph;3
and 2&hyph;1526&hyph;4 should be revised to read 2.68
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; (68 mm), rather than 1.97
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; (50 mm). The commenter indicates that the maximum brake wear limit of 1.97
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; (50 mm) is already standard for brake part numbers 2&hyph;1526&hyph;1 and 2&hyph;1526&hyph;2, whereas
a wear limit of 2.68
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; (68 mm) is specified in the CMM for brake part numbers 2&hyph;1526&hyph;3 and 2&hyph;1526&hyph;4 due to a
different configuration that allows greater wear pin length and still maintains RTO performance at the maximum wear
limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA finds that no change to the final rule is necessary in this regard. The proposed rule, as published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on February 15, 1994, specified the correct brake wear limit of 2.68
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; (68 mm) for brake part numbers 2&hyph;1526&hyph;3 and 2&hyph;1526&hyph;4. That same brake wear limit is
contained in this final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined
that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has recently reviewed the figures it has used over the past several years in calculating the economic impact
of AD activity. In order to account for various inflationary costs in the airline industry, the FAA has determined
that it is necessary to increase the labor rate used in these calculations from $55 per work hour to $60 per work hour.
The economic impact information, below, has been revised to reflect this increase in the specified hourly labor rate.
In addition to the number of affected airplanes of U.S. registry that will be required to accomplish the inspection
(as discussed previously), the FAA has updated the total number of airplanes of U.S. registry and the number of affected
U.S. operators to reflect the latest information available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 165 Model A300, A300&hyph;600, A310, and A320 series airplanes of U.S. registry and 7 U.S. operators
will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 20 work hours per operator, at an average labor rate of $60
per work hour, for each operator to incorporate the revision of its FAA-approved maintenance inspection program.
Based on these figures, the total cost impact of that requirement on U.S. operators is estimated to be $8,400, or $1,200
per operator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA also estimates that it will take 15 work hours per airplane, at an average labor rate of $60 per work hour, to accomplish
the required inspection. The cost of required parts to accomplish the change in wear limits for these airplanes (that
is, the cost resulting from the requirement to change the brakes before they are worn to their previously approved
limits for a one-time change) will be approximately $2,236 per airplane. The FAA estimates that 46 of the 165 affected
airplanes of U.S. registry will be required to accomplish the inspection. Based on these figures, the total cost impact
of that requirement on U.S. operators of these airplanes is estimated to be $144,256, or $3,136 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no affected operator has accomplished all
of the requirements of this AD action, and that no affected operator would accomplish all of those actions in the future
if this AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) is adopting a policy statement setting forth the elements
of what generally constitutes appropriate ratemaking treatment of sulfur dioxide emissions allowances in coordination
transactions under the Federal Power Act. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101&hyph;549, Title IV,
104 Stat. 2399, 2584 (1990), require issuance of emissions allowances as a means to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions
levels. The Commission also is issuing an interim rule that implements the guidelines set forth in the policy statement.

 requesting issuance of a Policy Statement regarding the ratemaking treatment of emissions allowances in coordination
transactions under the Federal Power Act. The acid rain control title (Title IV) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of
1990, Pub. L. No. 101&hyph;549, Title IV, 104 Stat. 2399, 2584 (1990) (CAAA), provides for the issuance of emissions
allowances as a means to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions levels. EEI proposes that emission allowances be included
in rates at the allowance's incremental cost
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 with customers having the choice of two options to compensate the seller of allowances. Either the customer may return,
or transfer, emissions allowances in kind or it may compensate the seller for its incremental cost of emissions allowances.
EEI proposes that the seller be allowed to use a particular price index selected by the seller or an average of several
price indices to determine the current cost to replace an allowance. EEI requests issuance of the Policy Statement
by January 1, 1995, when Phase I of the CAAA becomes effective.

According to EEI, the ``incremental cost'' of an emissions allowance in a coordination sale is the spot market price
at the time of the power sale, as opposed to the inventory value on the company's books.

The Commission agrees with EEI that issuance of a Policy Statement on the ratemaking treatment of emissions allowances
in coordination transactions is necessary at this time. The primary goal of the allowance trading program is to encourage
utilities to implement the lowest overall cost actions to comply with the cap on sulfur dioxide emissions contained
in the CAAA. The development of a national and open allowance trading market, the Commission believes, depends in
part upon regulators sending public utilities a clear signal on how allowance trades and CAAA compliance costs will
be treated for ratemaking purposes. Accordingly, the Commission hereby issues a Policy Statement adopting EEI's
proposal, with various modifications discussed below. The Commission also hereby issues an Interim Rule implementing
the guidelines set forth in this Policy Statement.

II. Public Reporting Burden 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Policy Statement and Interim Rule would clarify how existing filing requirements apply to utilities filing amendments
to coordination rate schedules to provide for the recovery of emissions allowance costs and to recover them in a timely
fashion. Because this Policy Statement and Interim Rule only clarify how existing requirements are to be implemented,
the public reporting burden for these information collections (including the time for reviewing instructions,
searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection
of information) is not estimated to increase the number of hours per response for each utility currently involved
in the filing of rate schedule amendments. Send comments regarding these burden estimates or any other aspect of these
collections of information, including suggestions for reducing the burden, by contacting the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission, 941 North Capitol Street, NE, Washington, DC 20426 [Attention: Michael Miller, Information Services
Division, (202) 208&hyph;1415], and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and

The CAAA and Allowance Trading 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The acid rain control title of the CAAA sets forth a comprehensive regulatory mechanism designed to control acid rain
by limiting sulfur dioxide emissions by electric utilities. The CAAA require reductions in sulfur dioxide emissions
in two phases. Phase I begins on January 1, 1995, and applies to 110 mostly coal-fired utility plants containing about
260 generating units specifically listed in the statute. These plants are owned by about 40 jurisdictional utility
systems that are expected to reduce annual sulfur dioxide emissions by as much as 4.5 million tons. Phase II begins
on January 1, 2000, and applies to virtually all existing steam-electric generating utility units with capacity
exceeding 25 megawatts and to new generating utility units (generally those commencing operation after November
15, 1990) of any size. Phase II permanently caps sulfur dioxide emissions at 9 million tons annually. The Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) issues to the owners of generating units allowances (defined as an authorization to emit,
during or after a specified calendar year, one ton of sulfur dioxide)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 equal to the number of tons of sulfur dioxide emissions authorized by the CAAA. EPA does not assess a charge for the allowances
it awards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The allowances are not unit-specific and can be sold or traded. Utilities have incentives to reduce sulfur dioxide
emissions so that they can use allowances to cover load growth, to make additional off-system sales or to sell or trade
allowances on the open market, offsetting the costs of compliance. Utilities that reduce the amount of sulfur dioxide
emitted below their authorized level (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, by switching to a lower sulfur coal, switching to a new fuel, installing scrubbers, repowering a unit, or using demand
side management (DSM)) may bank their allowances (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, hold and use them in another year) or sell or trade them to other utilities that expect to exceed their authorized emission
level or other allowance market participants such as marketers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress created the allowance trading system in Title IV of the CAAA to enable sulfur dioxide emissions reductions
to occur at the lowest cost, by creating a national market for emissions allowances. Basically, the emissions allowance
trading system works in the following manner. Title IV of the CAAA established guidelines for the EPA to implement
a system for issuing, recording and tracking allowances.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Allowance usage at each affected unit is recorded by EPA quarterly. There is a national cap on the total number of allowances
issued by EPA each year.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
7
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 After the end of each year, EPA determines whether companies have the right number of emissions allowances of appropriate
vintage on hand for each ton of sulfur dioxide emitted during the year. The penalty for not having the requisite number
of allowances on hand is $2,000 per ton plus surrender of an emissions allowance equivalent in the following year,
plus other possible punishments depending on the degree of violation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
8
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The CAAA also require EPA to withhold for direct sale and auction 2.8 percent of the annual allowance allocations.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

9
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

, Order No. 552, III FERC Statutes and Regulations, Regulations Preambles &para;30,967, 58 FR 17982 (April 7, 1993),
the Commission amended its Uniform Systems of Accounts for public utilities, licensees and natural gas companies
to establish uniform accounting requirements for allowances for the emission of sulfur dioxide under the CAAA, and
to establish generic accounts to record assets and liabilities created through the ratemaking actions of regulatory
agencies. While acknowledging the need for the eventual development of a ratemaking framework for allowances, the
Commission declined to expand the scope of the accounting rule to address rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issues.

The Commission stated that the accounting rules were intended to be ``rate neutral,''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
they were not intended to prescribe ratemaking treatment for allowances and would not bar regulatory commissions
(including this Commission) from adopting any particular ratemaking treatment. The Commission observed that the
bulk of the cost of allowances and compliance will be within the ratemaking jurisdiction of the various States and
not this Commission, and found that there was not likely to be a single ratemaking framework appropriate in each and
every ratemaking jurisdiction for utilities subject to this Commission's accounting jurisdiction. III FERC Statutes

is urgently needed in view of the imminent onset of Phase I. EEI states that the allowance market is rapidly evolving,

EEI Petition, Appendix A.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EEI requests the Commission to: (1) Provide for costing emissions allowances at their incremental cost in coordination
rates, determined on the basis of a leading index or combination of indices of the current price of emissions allowances,
such index or combination of indices to be selected by the seller of the power; (2) compensate coordination sellers
by permitting power purchasers at their option either: (a) To transfer or return emission allowances in kind
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
14
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 or (b) compensate the seller for its incremental cost of emission allowances, and (c) declare that purchasers who
provide emissions allowances do not need to make filings with the Commission; (3) find that the cost of emissions allowances
may be recovered under provisions in coordination rate schedules as ``out-of-pocket'' costs; (4) give utilities
up to 45 days after the Commission issues a policy statement to file amendments to rate schedules to allow recovery
of emissions allowance costs beginning January 1, 1995, provided that each utility gives its customers notice of
the emission allowance recovery methodology it will be using when energy is scheduled (the Commission would reserve
the ability, as a condition of making the policy effective January 1, 1995, to order refunds); (5) clarify that the
transfer of emission allowances is not subject to a Section 205 filing and determine that sales of emissions allowances
are not jurisdictional under Section 203 or 205 of the FPA;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
15
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and (6) declare that the ratemaking treatment of emissions allowances endorsed in this Policy Statement does not
preclude other approaches proposed by individual utilities on a case-by-case basis.

EEI argues that such option will: (a) Allow a power purchaser to optimize its economic position if it can purchase allowances
at a price below the seller's declared price; (b) prevent a seller from dictating the allowance price; (c) reward a
power purchaser who seeks the lowest cost emissions allowances; and (d) promote an active allowance market that enhances
the savings in compliance costs envisioned by the CAAA and also promotes the FPA's purpose to provide for reasonable
rates. None of the intervenors and commenters oppose this proposal.

In particular, EEI asks the Commission to find that emissions allowances are not ``facilities'' under Section 203,
and, therefore, the sale or transfer of such allowances does not require the Commission's authorization. We address
EEI's request for a jurisdictional determination in a separate order.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EEI notes that use of incremental costs as a basis for emission allowance costing is consistent with the cost basis
used for other variable expenses (

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

existing rate schedules that include specific provisions allowing the tracking of incremental costs.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

be required to supplement their rate schedules with specific details regarding the recovery of the incremental cost
of emissions allowances in their rates.

EEI does not explain what procedure would be followed by utilities that have coordination rates on file that do not
expressly provide for the recovery of all incremental costs, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
a coordination rate schedule that provides for recovery of incremental fuel, but is silent with respect to other types
of variable costs; coordination rate schedules that include stated rates; or coordination rate schedules that do
not adopt incremental cost pricing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since there may be different ways of determining the incremental cost of emissions allowances, EEI proposes that
utilities be required to submit the following company-specific details. First, EEI suggests that utilities should
be required to choose a leading national index or combination of indices to determine the incremental cost of emission
allowances at the time of the allowance's consumption and be required to use that index until they identify some other
acceptable index in a filing with the Commission. Second, EEI suggests that each utility be required to explain the
method of calculating its emission allowance dispatch value. EEI indicates that the use of incremental costing for
emissions allowances should be consistent with the use of incremental costing for economic dispatch decisions.
EEI proposes that any differences between the incremental costing for coordination sales of emissions allowances
and dispatch decisions regarding emissions allowances be explained and reconciled. Third, EEI suggests that utilities
be required to explain how they will quantify the amount of emission allowances attributable to each transaction.
Fourth, EEI suggests that, with respect to longer-term transactions, utilities be required to specify the timing
of opportunities for buyers to stipulate whether they will purchase or provide the emissions allowances.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
18
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Fifth, EEI suggests that utilities be required to identify any other factors that could impact pricing, such as rates
tied to units other than the incremental unit used for the sale. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
While EEI's argument on this point is unclear, we believe EEI's position is that, for longer-term transactions, buyers
of emissions allowances should have the same timing opportunities as allowance sellers. Because sellers do not have
to have the required emissions allowances until January 30 of the year subsequent to the calendar year, or the first
business day subsequent to January 30 if January 30 is not a business day (hereinafter EPA reporting date), 40 CFR 72.2
and 73.35(a)(2) (1994), they are able to delay purchasing allowances in order to possibly obtain a less expensive
allowance price. By providing flexibility as to the time within which buyers can transfer allowances, buyers might
be able to save money as well.

Positions of Intervenors and Commenters
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
CG&amp;E, PSI, Entergy Services, IPAA and Cleveland take no position on the merits of EEI's proposal. The Washington
Commission, the Indiana Commission, PEPCO, and Southern generally express support for the proposal. The remainder
of the intervenors and commenters indicate concerns with various aspects of the proposal, as discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The California Commission supports EEI's request that alternative proposals for emissions allowance ratemaking
treatment not be precluded and that such proposals be considered on a case-by-case basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA supports EEI's request for incremental pricing for allowances and use of an index to establish the incremental
price. However, EPA requests the Commission to address ratemaking for all wholesale transactions at this time. EPA
also seeks a uniform approach for costing and rate treatment of allowances. Thus, EPA requests that the Commission
adopt one index option for use by all public utilities. EPA suggests that its auction presently provides the most reliable
price index. EPA also raises concerns about EEI's proposal to allow alternate ratemaking proposals on a case-by-case
basis. EPA states that utilities should bear the burden of showing that any different approach is justified and will
not result in an unfair competitive advantage in electric power markets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Emissions Exchange, Clean Air and Cantor Fitzgerald state that EPA auction prices have consistently been artificially
low and that the EPA auction price is not representative of the open market because the auction is held just once a year
and does not track the current price and availability of allowances. Emissions Exchange asks that the Commission
refrain from dictating use of any particular price index. Instead, Emissions Exchange proposes that this Commission
permit each utility to choose its market price index from a list which includes, but is not limited to, the allowance
price indicators published by Cantor Fitzgerald.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the problems it sees with the EPA auction, Clean Air maintains that commercial bulletin board services
are also unreliable sources for allowance price information. It argues that bulletin board bid/ask prices may not
reflect actual allowance transactions and could subject market participants to inaccurate price signals, gaming
and manipulation. Clean Air opposes allowing the selling utility to cost emissions allowances at a market index of
its own choosing because this presents the danger of the selling utility picking a price based on the highest-cost
index, with no demonstration that this price reflects the realities of the market. Clean Air also opposes the selection
of a single index by the Commission, stating that the Commission would risk sending misleading price signals. Clean
Air suggests that, in addition to requiring sellers of allowances to inform buyers of the price of allowances and the
number of allowances to be provided, the seller should notify the buyer that there is a third party who will provide
the allowances at a stated price. Clean Air also proposes that the Commission require sellers to report the volume
of allowances transferred, their price and the name of any third parties supplying the allowances. Clean Air states

The Consumers' Counsel and Tellus state that this Commission should expand the scope of this proceeding to include
the ratemaking treatment of allowances for all wholesale transactions. The Consumers' Counsel also states that
it would be more efficient for a policy statement to recognize other valuation methods in addition to incremental
costs, such as a cost-of-compliance approach, and to specify when that method would be more appropriate.

for allowances and should develop a standard method of allocation of EPA-granted allowances between wholesale and
retail customers and between affiliates.

Wisconsin Electric argues that EEI's pricing policy is contrary to the CAAA because it will cause generation to shift
from Phase I units to non-Phase I units. This is because a requirement that utilities charge the full incremental cost
of allowances will result in an increase in the operating cost of Phase I units and result in those units being underutilized.
It is possible, Wisconsin Electric argues, that if a Phase I unit is not utilized at ``baseline'' (1985&hyph;1987)
levels, the utility may be required by the CAAA to forfeit allowances.

 For these reasons, Wisconsin Electric suggests, the Commission, in its Policy Statement, should allow utilities
with Phase I units the flexibility to charge ``up to'' the incremental cost of a Phase I allowance. Wisconsin Electric
argues that achieving least cost dispatch, in light of complexities such as reduced utilization of Phase I units,
may require use of a dispatch emissions value that differs from incremental cost.

According to Wisconsin Electric, it cannot be assumed that an allowance on a Phase I unit that is underutilized (thereby
subjecting the allowance to possible surrender under the CAAA) has an opportunity cost equal to incremental costs
since an allowance that is surrendered may not be consumed or traded by the utility.

APPA argues that the proposed policy statement would grant excessive discretion to utilities and would open the door
to inconsistent ratemaking treatment. APPA complains that EEI's proposal contains no clear requirement that the
selling utility be consistent in its ratemaking treatment on simultaneous transactions and does not require a utility
to adhere to any particular methodology once adopted. Further, APPA argues, EEI's petition does not define how the
revenues from emissions allowances included in rates will be credited to various customer classes. Moreover, APPA
argues, EEI's proposal that this Commission allow utilities with existing incremental cost rate provisions to file
emission allowance pricing information without revising their rate schedules will authorize utilities to redefine
contract terms unilaterally. APPA contends that EEI's proposal does not clearly define the scope of transactions
to which the Policy Statement will apply. APPA maintains that the Commission should afford affected parties the opportunity
to challenge application of whatever policy is adopted in this Policy Statement on a case-by-case basis. APPA also
believes that this Commission should establish a standard market price for allowances or provide a forum for review
to ensure the justness and reasonableness of indices or methodologies to be used by a selling utility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tellus also states that since several utilities recently have filed differing proposals for emissions allowance
cost recovery in affiliated transactions, this Commission must act promptly to establish generic ratemaking policies
for each type of wholesale arrangement. Tellus further urges the Commission, either in this or in a separate proceeding,
to address the ratemaking treatment of costs of compliance with the CAAA, in addition to allowance costs. Tellus suggests
that this Commission establish its own monthly market index price for emissions allowances, determine how the profits
should be credited to and among wholesale and retail customers, develop a standard method for allocating allowances
obtained from EPA at no cost between wholesale and retail customers, and establish generic policies regarding the
adequacy and appropriateness of current wholesale rate designs for passing CAAA costs through to wholesale customers.
Tellus suggests that average inventory costs might be a valid basis for determining the cost of emissions allowances.

EEI, in reply, again urges issuance of a policy statement by January 1, 1995. EEI argues that the policy guidance requested
is appropriately limited to coordination transactions. EEI argues that coordination transactions are a distinct
category of voluntary transactions and that the treatment it proposes is consistent with Commission precedent for
other out-of-pocket costs incurred in such transactions. EEI submits that the guidance it requests here, while appropriate
for coordination transactions, cannot accommodate the varying circumstances and cost allocation issues involved
in wholesale requirements service or transactions among affiliated companies. EEI also notes, in reply, that the
Commission, in Regulation of Electricity Sales for Resale and Transmission Service, Notice of Inquiry, IV FERC Stats.
and Regs. &para;35,518 at 35,628 (1985), order terminating docket, 61 FERC &para;61,371 (1992), defined the term

The Commission therein defined coordination transactions as ``sales or exchanges of specialized electricity services
that allow buyers to realize cost savings or reliability gains that are not attainable if they rely solely on their
own resources. For sellers, these transactions provide opportunities to earn additional revenue, and to lower customer
rates, from capacity that is temporarily in excess to native load capacity requirements. Transactions are voluntary
and the seller's obligation is limited.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requirements service was defined as ``a long-term supply of firm power to meet all or part of the buyer's load requirements,
including load-growth. Sellers undertake a relatively open-ended commitment to provide service. Utilities must
plan and build generation and transmission capacity to meet this commitment. From the seller's perspective, requirements
service is essentially the same as retail service with the primary difference being that delivery is typically made
at transmission voltages. Requirements customers are considered part of the seller's native load. Buyers are typically
municipally or cooperatively owned distributors that resell the power to end-use customers.''

EEI opposes case-by-case treatment of rate recovery of emissions allowances in coordination transactions. It argues
that a case-by-case approach would unduly burden the Commission with hundreds of virtually identical proceedings
that can be more efficiently addressed through the policy statement approach it advocates here. EEI maintains that
it is not seeking to expand the meaning of defined contract terms, but simply to include in existing contract terms
costs that are reasonable and contractually permissible. EEI recognizes the need for special treatment of generating
units subject to the requirements of reduced utilization in the CAAA, and that exceptions to the use of the full incremental
costs of emissions allowances associated with those generating units may take place. However, EEI believes that
its proposal adequately responds to Wisconsin Electric's concerns in this area because it allows exceptions to full
incremental costs as long as dispatch criteria and the coordination rates are consistent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EEI further states that the Commission should not designate any specific index because such action would hinder market
competition in allowance trading. It characterizes as unnecessary and burdensome Clean Air's proposals that energy
sellers certify an unaffiliated third party to provide allowances to a power purchaser, and that utilities be required
to report the volume and price of allowance trades for publication by this Commission. Finally, EEI argues that this
is not the appropriate proceeding to specify particular revenue credit treatment of allowance-related revenues.
EEI submits that revenue credits with respect to coordination transactions are specified either in agreements between
retail and wholesale customer groups and utility companies or are required under the retail and wholesale practices
of state commissions or this Commission. Thus, EEI argues, revenue credits are appropriately dealt with in rate cases,
rather than in a policy proceeding.

Use of Incremental Costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We will allow the recovery of incremental costs of emission allowances in coordination rates whenever the coordination
rate also provides for recovery of other variable costs on an incremental basis. EEI's proposal that the incremental
cost of emissions allowances be recovered in coordination rates will ensure, under many coordination rate schedules,
consistency with the way in which other costs (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, fuel) are recovered and with dispatch decisions. In response to APPA's concern that the scope of the transactions
affected by the Policy Statement is not clearly defined in EEI's proposal, the Commission wishes to make clear that
the policy adopted here will apply only when a coordination rate expressly provides for the recovery of incremental
costs or if stated rates are designed to recover incremental costs. If a coordination rate does not reflect incremental
cost pricing for other costs (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, coordination transactions that are designed as unit sales where the rates track the costs of a particular unit or
coordination rates that are designed to recover average costs), the Commission will require the seller to propose
an alternative costing method for emissions allowances, or demonstrate that any inconsistency between the proposed
costing method and the coordination rate does not produce unreasonable results. The Commission finds that the cost
to replace an allowance is an appropriate basis to establish incremental cost.

Use of Indices

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We will adopt EEI's proposal that sellers be permitted to choose their own index or a combination of indices. Because
the emission allowance markets are still developing, the Commission cannot, at this time, conclude that any particular
index should be utilized. Our primary concern in allowing the selling utility to choose the index or indices is that,
if there are variations in the available indices, the seller will select the one with the highest price at the time of
the transaction, rather than the index that best reflects the incremental cost. EEI's proposal guards against this
practice because it provides the customer with the option to supply its own allowances rather than purchase allowances
from a selling utility.

Dispatch 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EEI's proposal is based on sellers' use of the same index for pricing coordination sales and making dispatch decisions.
If the seller does not use the same index for both purposes, EEI proposes that the seller be required to reconcile the
differences. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission will adopt this proposal. The purpose of any dispatch criterion is to meet each increment of load from
the increment of generation with the lowest running costs (fuel, other variable operating expenses and, now, emissions
allowances). If the seller is not using the same cost index in its dispatch decisions as it is proposing for pricing
its coordination sales, we cannot rely upon the index to reflect incremental cost.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Calculation of Amount of Emissions Allowances Associated With a Transaction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission will also adopt EEI's proposal that sellers explain how they will compute the amount of emissions allowances
that will be attributed to each coordination transaction. The amount of emissions allowances related to a coordination
sale will vary based on the unit used for pricing, the amount of energy generated and the type of fuel used. The Commission
expects that the generating unit used to compute the emission allowance amount would be the same unit that is used to
price the incremental fuel component of the coordination rate. Also, the seller should explain how fractional amounts
will be handled. While a customer choosing the cash compensation method could pay for part of an allowance, the customer
cannot choose to return part of an allowance. To resolve this problem, utilities could adopt a ``rounding'' approach,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, rounding up to the next whole number if the fraction is greater than one half, or down if the fraction is less than one-half.
If a rounding approach is used for the return of allowances in kind, it should also be used for cash settlements so that
there is no bias for or against the return in kind option.

Timing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission also adopts EEI's proposal that utilities provide details on the timing of opportunities to return
allowances or stipulate whether they will purchase or return allowances. Customers should be able to take advantage
of possible cost savings resulting from the timing of allowance settlements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
32
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This can be accomplished by allowing customers that choose to provide allowances in kind to do so by the appropriate
EPA reporting date
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
33
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, a ``timing option.'' Thus, allowance customers will have the same opportunities as allowance sellers and face the
same consequences, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

This issue is significant because utilities in effect settle their allowance position with EPA at the EPA reporting
date and the cost of obtaining an allowance may be different at that time than it is at the time that the transaction occurs.
Indeed, there may be significant differences in allowance costs at different times of the year.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission adopts EEI's proposal that sellers specify any other factors that may affect pricing. For example,
many utilities have coordination rates that allow a reservation charge based on a unit other than the unit used to generate
energy as long as the total revenues do not exceed the fixed and variable costs of the unit used for pricing.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
35
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Utilities which operate under this type of ceiling will have to clarify that the variable cost component includes
the emissions allowance amount associated with the unit used to establish the ceiling.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
An example is Indiana Michigan Power Company's coordination rate schedule, supra n.16, which consist of an energy
charge based on system incremental fuel and operating costs and a reservation charge based on the cost of its Rockport
generating unit. Because Indiana Michigan has negotiated favorable coal contracts for the Rockport unit, that unit
is not likely to be available for coordination sales. As a result, there is an inconsistency between Indiana Michigan's
demand charge (based on its Rockport unit) and its energy charge (based on system incremental fuel cost which is higher
than Rockport's fuel cost). To conform this rate to the Commission's requirement that energy and demand charges be
designed on a consistent basis, the rate is subject to a ceiling reflecting the fixed and variable costs of the Rockport
unit.

Other Rate Issues Raised by Intervenors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission will not expand the scope of this Policy Statement beyond what EEI has proposed. The ratemaking treatment
for coordination, requirements and affiliated pooling arrangements must recognize the differences in the character
of the service arrangements. Furthermore, the timing of any ratemaking implementation will, of necessity, be different.
For instance, because in requirements service the cost of emissions allowances will be a very small percentage of
a utility's overall costs, a utility may choose not to address emissions allowance costs in requirements rates until
it files its next general rate case. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, since requirements customers typically pay a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
share of all of a utility's prudently incurred costs and utilities may choose various methods to comply with the CAAA,
it would be difficult, if not impossible, to establish a generic policy that would be appropriate for all requirements
service. Likewise, since operating agreements between affiliate utilities are not uniform, it would be difficult
to establish a generic ratemaking policy for affiliated pooling arrangements. Affiliate agreements also may reflect
compromises to satisfy the concerns of state regulators.

Conversely, the pricing of coordination transactions is fairly standardized, generally reflecting an energy charge
equal to incremental costs and a reservation charge providing a contribution to the fixed costs of the units used to
price the energy. Thus, the treatment of emissions allowances in coordination rates can be readily addressed in a
generic fashion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with Florida Power's request, we state that Phase II utilities are not now required to make rate filings
detailing their emission allowance treatment for coordination transactions that will not be affected until the
year 2000. Such filings would be due no more than 120 or less than 60 days prior to Phase II. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The intervenors have raised concerns regarding the crediting of allowance related revenues to requirements rates
or the allocation of emissions allowances between retail and wholesale requirements jurisdictions. It will be our
policy to treat the revenues from allowances sold as part of coordination sales the same way we treat other revenues
from coordination sales. In other words, to the extent, and in the same way that, the latter revenues are credited to
jurisdictional customers, so should the former revenues. However, we will address implementation of this policy
in the context of individual requirements rate proceedings, or, if appropriate, complaint proceedings. In section
205 proceedings, utilities will be expected to fully support their test year projections for emission allowances
associated with coordination sales. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We reject Clean Air's requests that the Commission require sellers to report the volume and price of allowances transferred
and publish this information, and that sellers certify unaffiliated third parties to provide allowances to a customer.
Sellers must, of course, be prepared to document the calculation of all aspects of their rates, including the emissions
allowance component. However, an extensive reporting requirement and third-party certification would be costly
and time consuming, and there is no basis to conclude that imposition of this burden on utilities would enhance the
development of the emission allowance trading markets.

Finally, the Commission notes that this Policy Statement contains general guidelines on ratemaking treatment in
coordination rates for the cost of emissions allowances. It is not intended to preclude utilities or other interested
parties, such as state commissions, from proposing alternate rate treatments for consideration on a case-by-case
basis.

Florida Power requests that the Policy Statement not prejudge every contractual relationship. Florida Power is
primarily concerned about its existing arrangements with Southern Companies which are at issue in Docket No. ER95&hyph;59&hyph;000.
This Policy Statement will not preclude Florida Power from proposing different treatments with respect to those
arrangements at issue in Docket No. ER95&hyph;59&hyph;000.

APPA is concerned about the lack of specifics concerning possible alternatives to EEI's proposal. However, we will
not address alternate proposals in this Policy Statement, other than to state that they are permitted to be presented
to the Commission and will be considered on a case-by-case basis. The Commission will ensure that any alternate proposal
adopted is just and reasonable, and in so doing will consider fully the concerns of affected parties who intervene
in individual rate proceedings, abbreviated or otherwise, involving emissions allowances.

V. Implementation Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the Interim Rule accompanying the Policy Statement, the Commission also adopts EEI's proposal that if utilities
have rate schedules on file that expressly provide for the recovery of all incremental or out-of-pocket costs, these
utilities should be allowed to make abbreviated rate filings, limited to detailing how they would recover emissions
allowance costs. These filings should include the following: the index or combination of indices to be used, the method
by which the emission allowance amounts will be calculated, timing procedures, how inconsistencies, if any, with
dispatch criteria will be reconciled, and how any other rate impacts will be addressed. These filings would constitute
rate schedule amendments under FPA section 205 since they would describe how the rates are computed. Utilities making
such abbreviated filings should: (1) clearly identify the filing as being limited to amendments to coordination
rates to reflect the costs of emissions allowances, in the first paragraph of the letter of transmittal accompanying
the filing, (2) submit a document that can be inserted into each rate schedule and (3) identify each rate schedule to
which the amendment applies. Finally, the abbreviated filing should apply consistent treatment to all coordination
rate schedules or the filing utility should justify its failure to do so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding coordination rates that do not provide for the recovery of all incremental costs,
<FOOTCITE>38</FOOTCITE>
 we conclude that the seller may include rate schedule amendments together with the abbreviated filing discussed
above if the customer agrees to the rate change. If the customer does not agree to revise such rates, the utility should
tender its emission allowance proposal in a separate section 205 rate filing, fully justifying its proposal. This
will ensure that the processing of uncontested rate filings is not delayed by disputes over individual agreements.

Some coordination rates provide only for the recovery of incremental fuel costs, and contain no provisions for recovery
of other incremental costs. Also, some coordination transactions, while premised upon incremental costs, take
place under stated rates.

would be noticed and customers provided an opportunity to comment.

45-Day Amendment Period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission adopts EEI's proposal that utilities be allowed to implement the policy announced herein on January
1, 1995, but make the filings discussed above within 45 days after the Commission issues an order in this proceeding.
In return for granting waiver of notice, the utilities must agree that revenues will be collected subject to refund
pending Commission action. Utilities making such filings should include a statement in the first paragraph of their
transmittal letter agreeing to the refund condition with respect to allowance-related charges assessed between
January 1, 1995, and the date the Commission issues an order accepting the filing without investigation or hearing.

VI. Information Collection Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Management and Budget's (OMB's) regulations at 5 CFR 1320.13 require that OMB approve certain information
and recordkeeping requirements imposed by an agency. The information collection requirements in this policy statement
are contained in FERC&hyph;516 ``Electric Rate Schedule Filings'' (1902&hyph;0096). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is issuing this Policy Statement and Interim Rule with the information requirements to carry out its
regulatory responsibilities under the Federal Power Act to determine the appropriate ratemaking treatment of sulfur
dioxide emissions allowances in coordination transactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Policy Statement and Interim Rule provide guidance to public utilities on the ratemaking treatment of emissions
allowances in coordination transactions in order that the CAAA emissions allowance program will be implemented
in accordance with the Congressional mandate. The Commission's Office of Electric Power Regulation uses the data
for determination for the reasonableness and justness of costs for emissions allowances when a public utility seeks
to pass through its costs in wholesale rates. These collections of information are intended to be the minimum elements
needed for utilities to file amendments to their rate schedules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is submitting to the Office of Management and Budget a notification of these proposed collections
of information. Interested persons may obtain information on these reporting requirements by contacting the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 941 North Capitol Street, NE, Washington, DC 20426 [Attention: Michael Miller, Information
Services Division, (202) 208&hyph;1415]. Comments on the requirements of this rule can be sent to the Office of Information
and Regulatory Affairs of OMB, Washington, D.C. 20503, (Attention: Desk Officer for Federal Energy Regulatory Commission)

The Commission invites interested persons to submit additional written comments on the matters addressed in this
Interim Rule. An original and 14 copies of the comments must be filed with the Commission no later than January 23, 1995.
Comments should be submitted to the Office of the Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol
Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, and should refer to Docket No. PL95&hyph;1&hyph;000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All other written comments will be placed in the Commission's public files and will be available for public inspection
in the Commission's Public Reference Room at 941 North Capitol Street, N.E. Washington, D.C. 20426, during regular
business hours.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This Policy Statement and Interim Rule are effective January 1, 1995. Because Phase I of the CAAA begins January 1,
1995, public utilities subject to the Commission's jurisdiction need to have in place as of that date a method of recovery
in rates of the cost of emissions allowances used in coordination transactions. For that reason the Commission finds
good cause to make the Interim Rule effective without prior notice and comment, and finds good cause to make the Interim
Rule effective on less than 30 days' notice.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General Policy. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This Statement of Policy is adopted in furtherance of the goals of Title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, Pub.
L. 101&hyph;549, Title IV, 104 Stat. 2399, 2584 (1990).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Costing Emissions Allowances in Coordination Sales. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a public utility's coordination rate on file with the Commission provides for recovery of variable costs on an incremental
basis, the Commission will allow recovery of the incremental costs of emissions allowances associated with a coordination
sale. If a coordination rate does not reflect incremental costs, the public utility should propose alternative allowance
costing methods or demonstrate that the coordination rate does not produce unreasonable results. The Commission
finds that the cost to replace an allowance is an appropriate basis to establish the incremental cost. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Use of Indices. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission will allow public utilities to determine emissions allowance costs on the basis of an index or combination
of indices of the current price of emissions allowances, provided that the public utility affords purchasing utilities
the option of providing emissions allowances. Public utilities should explain and justify any use of different incremental
cost indices for pricing coordination sales and making dispatch decisions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) If a public utility has a coordination rate schedule on file that expressly provides for the recovery of all incremental
or out-of-pocket costs, such utility may make an abbreviated rate filing detailing how it will recover emissions
allowance costs. Such filing must include the following: the index or combination of indices to be used; the method
by which the emission allowance amounts will be calculated; timing procedures; how inconsistencies, if any, with
dispatch criteria will be reconciled; and how any other rate impacts will be addressed. In addition, a utility making
an abbreviated filing must:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) clearly identify the filing as being limited to an amendment to a coordination rate to reflect the cost of emissions
allowances, in the first paragraph of the letter of transmittal accompanying the filing;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) submit revised pages that can be inserted into each rate schedule; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) identify each rate schedule to which the amendment applies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The abbreviated filing must apply consistent treatment to all coordination rate schedules. If the filing does
not apply consistent rate treatment, the public utility must explain why it does not do so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If a public utility wants to charge incremental costs for emissions allowances, but its rate schedule on file with
the Commission does not provide for the recovery of all incremental costs, the selling public utility may submit an
abbreviated filing if all customers agree to the rate change. If customers do not agree, the selling public utility
must tender its emissions allowance proposal in a separate section 205 rate filing, fully justifying its proposal.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is withdrawing a final rule that revoked the generally recognized as safe (GRAS)
listing of sulfiting agents (i.e., sulfur dioxide, sodium sulfite, sodium and potassium bisulfite, and sodium and
potassium metabisulfite) on ``fresh'' potatoes that are intended to be served or sold unpackaged and unlabeled to
the consumer. The agency is revising its regulations in accordance with the withdrawal. This action is being taken
in response to a court ruling.

 December 22, 1994. Insofar as it prohibits the use of sulfiting agents on ``fresh'' potatoes that are intended to be
served or sold unpackaged and unlabeled to consumers, the final rule being withdrawn has been null and void since a
court ruling to that effect on August 3, 1990.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of March 15, 1990 (55 FR 9826), FDA published a final rule that amended the GRAS regulations to revoke GRAS status for
the use of sulfiting agents on ``fresh'' potatoes. The rule was challenged by the ``fresh'' potato industry and invalidated
by the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania on procedural grounds; subsequently, the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, sitting en banc, i.e., the full court, heard the case and, by an equally divided
vote, let the district court's decision stand. In accordance with the court's ruling, the agency is withdrawing the
revocation of GRAS status for the use of sulfiting agents on ``fresh'' potatoes and is revising 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;&sect;182.3616, 182.3637, 182.3739, 182.3766, 182.3798, and 182.3862 (21 U.S.C. 182.3616, 182.3637, 182.3639,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the issuance of this document is in response to a court order, FDA finds that providing notice and public comment
prior to the publication of this final rule is unnecessary and may therefore be dispensed with for good cause under
5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B). Therefore, publication of this rule withdrawing the revocation of GRAS status for use of sulfiting
agents on ``fresh'' potatoes constitutes final action. The agency advises, however, that it has continuing concerns
about the safety of this use of sulfiting agents and is considering further action.

 This document contains temporary regulations relating to the income tax withholding requirement on distributions
of profits from certain gaming activities made to members of Indian tribes under section 3402(r) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986. The regulations reflect changes to the law made by section 701 of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act. Those
affected by the regulations are persons, including Indian tribes, making payments to members of Indian tribes from
net revenues of certain gaming activities conducted or licensed by the tribes. Also affected are members of Indian
tribes who receive the payments. The text of these temporary regulations also serves as the text of the proposed regulations
set forth in the notice of proposed rulemaking on this subject in the Proposed Rules section of this issue of the

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This document contains amendments to the Employment Tax Regulations (26 CFR part 31) under section 3402(r). Section
3402(r) was added by section 701 of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, which approved the trade agreements resulting
from the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (GATT) and the Statement of Administrative Action to implement the Agreements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3402(r) requires that persons, including Indian tribes, making payments to members of Indian tribes from
the net revenues of certain gaming activities conducted or licensed by the tribes deduct and withhold income taxes
from those payments. These regulations provide guidance on how to comply with the new withholding requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Explanation of Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Net revenue from certain gaming activities conducted or licensed by an Indian tribe may be used to make taxable distributions
to members of the Indian tribe. The tribe must notify its members of the tax liability at the time the payments are made.
25 U.S.C. 2710(b)(3) and (d)(1). Under prior law, the tribe was not required to withhold on such payments except to
the extent backup withholding rules applied under section 3406. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Distributions of net revenues from gaming activity by an Indian tribe may result in significant tax liability to the
tribe's members. Withholding on such payments is intended to approximate ultimate tax liability. For some tribal
members, this withholding may eliminate the need to make quarterly estimated tax payments. For others, it will reduce
the likelihood that they will face penalties for underpayment of tax. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3402(r) generally requires that, for payments made after December 31, 1994, persons, including Indian tribes,
making payments to members of Indian tribes from the net revenues of certain gaming activities conducted or licensed
by the tribes deduct and withhold income taxes from those payments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This regulation provides for the amounts to be withheld to be determined under the applicable table. Upon publication
of this regulation, the IRS will make available tables for withholding on distributions to tribal members in 1995.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3402(r)(5) requires that payments be placed on an annualized basis under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.
While these regulations provide a method for placing payments on an annualized basis, it will ordinarily not be necessary
to annualize the payments, because the tables provided by the IRS reflect the annualized payment in prescribing the
amount to be withheld. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3402(r)(6) provides that, at the election of an Indian tribe, the tax imposed by section 3402(r) on any payment
made by such tribe shall be determined in accordance with such tables or computational procedures as may be specified
in regulations. This regulation allows withholding under section 3402(r) pursuant to any tables or procedures,
provided that the amount of tax withheld is substantially the same as it would be using the tables provided by the IRS
pursuant to section 3402(r). No written election is required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3402(p)(2) authorizes the Secretary to provide in regulations for withholding from payments other than
wages if the person making the payment and the person receiving the payment agree to the withholding. This regulation
provides that additional withholding is permitted where a tribal member and a tribe enter into a voluntary withholding
agreement.

Special Analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore,
a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure
Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations,
and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue
Code, these temporary regulations will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration
for comment on their impact on small business.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a)(1) General rule. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 3402(r)(1) requires every person, including an Indian tribe, making a payment to a member of an Indian tribe
from the net revenues of any class II or class III gaming activity, as defined in 25 U.S.C. 2703, conducted or licensed
by such tribe to deduct and withhold from such payment a tax in an amount equal to such payment's proportionate share
of the annualized tax, as that term is defined in section 3402(r)(3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Withholding tables. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Except as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the amount of a payment's proportionate share of the annualized
tax shall be determined under the applicable table provided by the Commissioner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Annualized amount of payment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 3402(r)(5) provides that payments shall be placed on an annualized basis under regulations prescribed by
the Secretary. A payment may be placed on an annualized basis by multiplying the amount of the payment by the total number
of payments to be made in a calendar year. For example, a monthly payment may be annualized by multiplying the amount
of the payment by 12. Similarly, a quarterly payment may be annualized by multiplying the amount of the payment by 4.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In general. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Any procedure for determining the amount to be deducted and withheld under section 3402(r) may be used, provided that
the amount of tax deducted and withheld is substantially the same as it would be using the tables provided by the Commissioner
under paragraph (a)(2) of this section. At the election of an Indian tribe, the tax imposed by section 3402(r) shall
be determined in accordance with this alternate procedure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Method of election. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is sufficient for purposes of making an election under this paragraph (a)(4) that an Indian tribe evidence the election
in any reasonable way, including use of a particular method. Thus, no written election is required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Additional withholding permitted. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistent with the provisions of section 3402(p)(2), a tribal member and a tribe may enter into an agreement to provide
for the deduction and withholding of additional amounts from payments in order to satisfy the anticipated tax liability
of the tribal member. The agreement may be made in a manner similar to that described in &sect;31.3402(p)&hyph;1 (with
respect to voluntary withholding agreements between employees and employers).

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The U.S. Parole Commission is clarifying its paroling policy guidelines on using a prior conviction for determining
a prisoner's salient factor score, when the prisoner claims the conviction was obtained in violation of his right
to counsel, and the records of the conviction are not available. This amendment of the salient factor score instructions
was published as an interim rule on March 10, 1994. 59 FR 11185&hyph;86. The final version of the rule is almost identical
to the interim rule. The rule provides that the prisoner must demonstrate that the allegedly invalid conviction must
have occurred prior to Supreme Court decisions establishing the right to counsel for felony and misdemeanor/petty
offense convictions. Otherwise, the Commission will presume that the prior conviction was validly obtained and
will count the conviction even if records of the conviction are no longer available.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The rationale for this revision of the salient factor scoring manual is provided in the supplementary information
for the interim rule. 59 FR 11185&hyph;86. Several comments were received in response to the publication of the interim
rule. One federal defender argued that the interim rule was unfair because if the records of the prior conviction are
not available, the limited information the Commission had about the prior conviction was presumptively unreliable.
But the mere fact that the records of the conviction are no longer available should not lead to the inference that the
conviction did not occur or was obtained using invalid procedures. More likely, the absence of the records would be
caused by their destruction or retirement according to a practice of purging court files on a regular schedule. Another
person asked the Commission to postpone action on the new rule until it assessed to what extent tribal courts have implemented
a defendant's right to counsel. The Commission decided that the promulgation of this rule_which was intended to promptly
clarify its salient factor scoring instruction at Item A, paragraph A.8_should not be deferred for the task of re-examining
tribal court procedures and determining whether a change in a separate instruction at paragraph A.10 should also
be made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several editorial changes were made in the interim rule. Also, in the final rule the Commission clarifies that the
prisoner would have to claim that he served a jail term for a non-felony, pre-1973 conviction before the Commission
would decline to count such a conviction in salient factor scoring. If the prisoner had not served a jail term for such
a conviction, the conviction would be constitutionally valid even if obtained in violation of his right to counsel.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The U.S. Parole Commission is adding to its guidelines, under the heading of ``Carnal Knowledge or Sodomy Involving
Minors'' a provision increasing the offense severity rating from Category Four to Category Seven for any crime involving
an adult offender who has abused a position of trust (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
, teacher, counselor, or physician), or who has engaged in predatory sexual behavior. The purpose of this guideline
amendment is to clarify the aggravated nature of such crimes in relation to all other offenses that involve non-forcible
sexual relations between an adult and a minor age 12 or older. This item was published as a proposed rule on May 20, 1994.
59 FR 26466. The guideline increase follows a Congressional directive that, when the Commission frequently exceeds
the guidelines in a particular type of case, the guidelines should be amended to provide for consistency in such decisions.

 Federal parole laws remain in effect until November 1, 1997, for prisoners and parolees who committed their crimes
prior to November 1, 1987, and whose sentences place them under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Parole Commission. See
Section 235(b) of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1987, Public Law 98&hyph;473 (as amended) and 18 U.S.C. 4201 through
4218. The Paroling Policy Guidelines at 28 CFR 2.20 provide consistency in Parole Commission decision-making for
such offenders.

The proposed rule would increase the prison time to be served in cases where the adult has committed such an offense
through an abuse of a position of trust, or through predatory behavior. Whereas ordinary offenses involving non-forcible
sexual relations between adults and minors age 12 or older are rated Category Four on the guidelines, offenses involving
abuse of trust or predatory behavior were proposed for a Category Seven rating. One public comment was received on
this proposal from the U.S. Probation Office for the Eastern District of North Carolina supporting the proposal.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After a careful review of its decision-making practices, the Commission has decided that the proposal merits adoption
as a final rule. The increase to Category Seven reflects optimum Commission decision-making practice, which is to
order an upward departure from the guideline range for a Category Four offense if the offender has abused a significant
position of trust or has behaved in a predatory manner toward multiple victims. Such circumstances would constitute
good cause to exceed the guidelines pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 4206(c). An abuse of trust would be exemplified by a child
psychiatrist who engages in sodomy with youthful patients under his care, a high school teacher who seduces a student
in his classroom, or a religious counselor who has sexual relations with teenage members of his congregation. Predatory
behavior is defined as the repeated use of tricks or other devices to lure unsuspecting youthful victims into sexual
relations with an adult offender.

summary:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) issues a document that it will begin a one-year experimental modification
of its rules with respect to the role that its Administrative Law Judges (ALJs) play in facilitating the expeditious
resolution of unfair labor practice proceedings. During the experimental period, the NLRB will amend its rules to
give the Chief Administrative Law Judge discretion to assign a judge other than the trial judge to conduct settlement
negotiations with the parties, and to give the settlement judge certain powers necessary to engage effectively in
those settlement efforts. The NLRB will also, during the experimental period, modify its rules to give ALJs assigned
to hear a case the discretion to dispense with briefs, to hear oral argument in lieu of briefs, and to issue bench decisions.
The rule changes will expire at the end of the one-year experimental period absent renewal by the Board.

supplementary information:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On September 8, 1994, the Board issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) which proposed certain modifications
to the Board's rules to permit the assignment of ALJs to serve as settlement judges, and to provide ALJs with the discretion
to dispense with briefs, to hear oral argument in lieu of briefs, and to issue bench decisions (59 FR 46375). The NPR
provided for a comment period ending October 7, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board received eight written comments on the NPR. The comments were received from a variety of sources, including
unions, employer associations, practitioners, and the academic community. The comments were mixed, with some supporting
some of the proposals but not others, and others supporting none of the proposals. Having carefully considered these
comments, for the reasons discussed below, the Board has decided to implement the proposed changes with certain modifications
for a one-year experimental period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Settlement Judges 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal on the use of settlement judges proposed to amend &sect;102.35 of the Board's rules to include provisions
for the assignment of ALJs to serve as settlement judges. The comments on this proposal were mixed, with two comments
opposing the proposal, two comments supporting the proposal, and two comments suggesting that the proposal be modified
to require the agreement of the parties. (The other two comments made no comment on the proposal.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The comments opposing the proposal generally expressed the view that the proposal was unneeded and unlikely to yield
significant benefits given the Agency's already high settlement rate. The comment submitted by the AFL&hyph;CIO
also expressed the concern that the proposal would diminish the availability of trial judges, cause the postponement
of hearing dates, and have a negative effect on settlement discussion at the Regional level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The Board acknowledges that there are potential problems which could arise with the use of settlement judges. The
proposed rules, however, were drafted to minimize any such problems by requiring the assigning judge to consider,
among other factors, the likelihood that a settlement may occur, the good faith of any person making a request for assignment
of a settlement judge, and whether the assignment is otherwise feasible. The Board indicated in the NPR that among
the factors which the assigning judge could consider would be the effect of an assignment upon agency resources, whether
the assignment is being sought for, or would have the effect of, delaying the proceeding, and whether the assignment
might tend to undermine other pending settlement efforts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 As suggested by some of the comments, a further safeguard against abuse of the procedure would be to condition the use
of settlement judges on the agreement of all parties. The proposed rule did not include such a condition or otherwise
permit a party to veto the use of the procedure, but indicated that a party's opposition was a factor for the assigning
judge to consider in assessing whether to appoint a settlement judge. Having considered the comments, however, the
Board agrees that the rule should state clearly that the procedure should not be used unless the parties agree to it.
This should further minimize the potential for problems of the kind discussed by the AFL&hyph;CIO. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 In view of the Agency's lack of experience with settlement judges, however, the Board has decided to implement the
procedure at this time for a one-year trial period. If significant problems arise with the procedure during that period,
those problems may be considered by the Board in considering whether to implement the changes permanently.

II. Briefs, Oral Argument, Recommendations, and Bench Decisions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As part of its ongoing review of ways in which unfair labor practice proceedings can be revamped to move the cases more
expeditiously, the Board proposed to give its ALJs the discretion, in appropriate cases, to dispense with post-hearing
briefs or proposed findings and conclusions, to hear oral argument, and to issue bench decisions. These changes were
proposed in the form of amendments to &sect;102.35(j) (renumbered to &sect;102.35(b)(10)), &sect;102.42, and
&sect;102.45(a) of the Board's Rules and Regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the eight comments received, two generally supported or did not oppose these changes, while the remaining comments
generally opposed the changes. The comments opposing the changes generally expressed the concern that dispensing
with post-hearing briefs and issuing bench decisions would be prejudicial to respondents given the absence of pretrial
discovery in Board proceedings, and would result in lower quality ALJ decisions leading to further litigation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As with the settlement-judge proposal, the Board recognizes that problems could arise under the proposed changes
if not properly utilized. As the Board noted in the NPR, many cases are not suitable for these expedited procedures,
and if inappropriate cases were selected, the resulting remands could delay the final disposition of the cases.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated in the NPR, however, the Board believes that if ALJs choose the cases carefully, the benefits of expediting
those cases would outweigh any problems arising in other cases where the procedures are improvidently utilized.
In order to provide some guidance to the ALJs in this regard, the Board in the NPR suggested certain types of cases in
which it may be appropriate to dispense with briefs and/or to issue bench decisions, such as cases that turn on a very
straightforward credibility issue; cases involving one-day hearings; cases involving a well-settled legal issue
where there is no dispute as to the facts; short record single-issue cases; or cases in which a party defaults by not
appearing at the hearing. The Board indicates that in more complex cases, including cases with lengthy records, these
procedures would likely not be appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board continues to believe that the proposed changes would be beneficial if properly implemented in accordance
with the cautions and guidance expressed by the Board in the NPR. However, in view of the Agency's lack of experience
with such procedures, as with the settlement-judge proposal, the Board has decided to implement the procedure at
this time for a one-year trial period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As the dissent states, the Board has held that a judge's issuance of an oral decision did ``not satisfactorily compl[y]
with the requirements of Section 10(c) of the National Labor Regulations Act, as amended, and Section 102.45 of the
Board's Rules and Regulations, as amended, with regard to the preparation of a written decision.'' See

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
``because he did not issue a written decision,'' inasmuch as the judge had allowed the General Counsel to present his
legal and factual arguments and had stated on the record the reasons for his findings). The rule changes which we adopt
today on an experimental basis are designed to remove any regulatory obstacle which may exist in light of the Board's
decisions in

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In any event, the new provisions on bench decisions do not violate Section 10(c). Section 102.45 of the rules, as amended,
provides that all decisions, including bench decisions, must contain findings of fact, conclusions, and the reasons
or basis therefor upon all material issues of fact and law, as well as a recommended order, including affirmative provisions,
all as required by Section 10(c). The amendments to &sect;102.45 of the rules provide that the administrative law
judge will certify the accuracy of the pages of the transcript which contain the decision and shall cause those pages
to be served on the parties and filed with the Board. Thus, these provisions provide for a written decision, in the form
of a certified copy of the record pages containing the judge's full decision, which is served on the parties, in full
compliance with the provisions of Section 10(c) of the Act. To the extent that the decisions in

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
suggest otherwise, we conclude that they are based on a misreading of the requirements of Section 10(c), and they are
overruled by the new provisions of the Rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) the NLRB certifies that these rules will not have
a significant impact on small business entities.

In exercising his or her discretion, the chief, deputy chief, or associate chief judge making the assignment will
consider, among other factors, whether there is reason to believe that resolution of the dispute is likely, the request
for assignment of a settlement judge is made in good faith, and the assignment is otherwise feasible.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The settlement judge shall convene and preside over conferences and settlement negotiations between the parties,

negotiations, recommending continuation or termination of the settlement negotiations. Where feasible, settlement
conferences shall be held in person. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Participation of the settlement judge shall terminate upon the order of the chief, deputy, or associates issued
after consultation with the settlement judge. The conduct of settlement negotiations shall not unduly delay the
hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) All discussions between the parties and the settlement judge shall be confidential. The settlement judge shall
not discuss any aspect of the case with the trial judge, and no evidence regarding statements, conduct, offers of settlement,
and concessions of the parties made in proceedings before the settlement judge shall be admissible in any proceeding
before the Board, except by stipulation of the parties. Documents disclosed in the settlement process may not be used
in litigation unless voluntarily produced or obtained pursuant to subpoena. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Any party shall be entitled, upon request, to a reasonable period at the close of the hearing for oral argument, which

of the hearing, file a brief or proposed findings and conclusions, or both, with the administrative law judge, who
may fix a reasonable time for such filing, but not in excess of 35 days from the close of the hearing. Requests for further
extensions of time shall be made to the chief administrative law judge in Washington, D.C., to the deputy chief judge
in San Francisco, California, to the associate chief judge in New York, New York, or to the associate chief judge in
Atlanta, Georgia, as the case may be. Notice of the request for any extension shall be immediately served on all other
parties, and proof of service shall be furnished. Three copies of the brief or proposed findings and conclusions shall
be filed with the administrative law judge, and copies shall be served on the other parties, and a statement of such
service shall be furnished. In any case in which the administrative law judge believes that written briefs or proposed
findings of fact and conclusions may not be necessary, he or she shall notify the parties at the opening of the hearing
or as soon thereafter as practicable that he or she may wish to hear oral argument in lieu of briefs.

disposition of the case should be made, which may include, if it be found that the respondent has engaged in or is engaging
in the alleged unfair labor practices, a recommendation for such affirmative action by the respondent as will effectuate
the policies of the Act. The administrative law judge shall file the original of his decision with the Board and cause
a copy thereof to be served on each of the parties. If the administrative law judge delivers a bench decision, promptly
upon receiving the transcript the judge shall certify the accuracy of the pages of the transcript containing the decision;
file with the Board a certified copy of those pages, together with any supplementary matter the judge may deem necessary
to complete the decision; and cause a copy thereof to be served on each of the parties. Upon the filing of the decision,
the Board shall enter an order transferring the case to the Board and shall serve copies of the order, setting forth
the date of such transfer, on all the parties. Service of the administrative law judge's decision and of the order transferring

1. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We are not opposed to the provision regarding settlement judges. We have some concerns that the provision may tempt
respondents to delay settlement talks with the Regional Offices and thereby upset the highly successful settlement
efforts of those offices. However, we are willing, in light of the one-year sunset provision, to join our colleagues
in promulgating this provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are strongly opposed, however, to the rules that give Administrative Law Judges (ALJs or Judges) the discretion
to dispense with briefs and to issue bench decisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Statutory Issue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a threshold matter, we note that, under established Board law, the provision for bench decisions directly contravenes
the Act. In 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Plastic Film Products Corp., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
232 NLRB 722 (1977), the Board held that such decisions fail to comply not only with Section 102.45 of the Board's Rules
and Regulations, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
but also with Section 10(c) of the Act. Id. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
at 722. See also 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Local Union No. 195 (Stone &amp; Webster Engineering Corp.), 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
237 NLRB 931 (1978) (oral grant of motion for summary dismissal of complaint at close of hearing violates Section 10(c)
as well as Section 102.45 of Board's Rules and Regulations).
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 Thus, the Board's new rule reverses established Board law.

Contrary to the assertion of our colleagues, it is clear that Section 10(c) was indeed one of the obstacles to the oral
decisions in these cases. Only one Member (Murphy) relied solely on the Rules. The majority relied on Section 10(c)
and the Rules.

In arguing to the contrary, our colleagues rely upon

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Jumbo Produce, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
294 NLRB 998. However, that case is readily distinguishable. In that case, the judge made an oral evidentiary ruling
on a single issue. He did not rule on the entire case. Indeed, the Board specifically noted this in distinguishing its
earlier ruling in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Local Union 195. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
See 294 NLRB at 999 n.4. We have no quarrel with the traditional practice under which judges issue bench rulings on evidentiary
issues. But the instant rule goes far beyond that. It gives the judge the power to orally decide the entire case.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We recognize that, in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Local Union 195, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the judge did not read any findings and conclusions into the record. However, in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Plastic Film Products, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the judge did precisely that. Notwithstanding this, the Board found that the judge's decision violated Section 10(c)
of the Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
highly questionable, but he agrees that it at least presents an additional issue that parties might raise in the courts
when seeking review of cases decided by bench rulings. As we argue below, to the extent that further grounds for appellate
litigation are provided, the asserted delay-minimizing objective of the rule is undermined.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In sum, the rules are at odds with Board law. Our colleagues, in apparent recognition of this fact, overrule Board law
to the extent necessary to accomplish their purpose. However, they set forth no rationale for this result other than
the assertion that the cases are based on a ``misreading'' of Section 10(c). They offer no support for this sweeping
assertion. Further, they may not have the power to overrule the extant cases. If the Board was correct in the prior cases,
i.e., if Congress did indeed intend to preclude bench decisions in enacting Section 10(c), then the Board is simply
without authority to establish a rule to the contrary. See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
467 U.S. 837, 842&hyph;43 (1984) (where intent of Congress is clear, agency must give effect to that intent).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the Board has now declared that it has the power to issue the rule, that declaration will not end the matter.
The statutory issue will undoubtedly be the subject of extended litigation in the federal courts. Thus, for this reason
as well as other reasons described 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
infra, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the rule is at cross-purposes with its stated goal: to expedite the final resolution of unfair labor practice cases.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Policy Considerations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We do not rest entirely, or even principally, on the statutory issue. Quite apart from the statutory issue, we oppose,
for policy reasons, the provisions giving ALJs the power to issue bench decisions and the related power to dispense
with written briefs. In our view, the rules sacrifice fundamental fairness, procedural due process and high-quality
decisionmaking. This sacrifice is said to be in the interest of speed. However, we are not convinced that the rules
will result in any overall savings of time. More importantly, to the extent that they might save some time, the price
is simply too high.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We first address the rule concerning briefs. Underlying much of our concern about this rule is one critical fact: NLRB
proceedings are conducted without pre-trial discovery. Thus, far from involving a rehash of previous deposition
testimony and jousting over the significance of documents long ago made available to the opposing side, Board trials
typically represent the first occasion on which the parties learn the details of their opponent's case.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 Notwithstanding this fact, the rule would require counsel, promptly upon the close of evidence, to marshal the pertinent
facts, spot all the factual and legal issues, cite the relevant authority, and articulate policy concerns_all in
a cogent and organized fashion. In our view, even the ablest of counsel cannot be expected to do an effective job under
these circumstances. Moreover, as some of the comments on the proposed rules have pointed out,
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 counsel for respondents will be at a distinct disadvantage under this scheme. Armed with the information gathered
in the pre-complaint investigation, the General Counsel is in a much better position than respondent's counsel to
plot out in advance an oral presentation of the facts and the law.

As noted 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
infra, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
the General Counsel will ordinarily have some prior knowledge of the specifics of the respondent's case, with the
extent of that knowledge varying with the degree of cooperation extended by the respondent during the pre-complaint
investigation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The rule is otherwise flawed. Although it provides for a ``reasonable period'' for oral argument, it does not provide
such a period for the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
preparation 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
of the argument. Further, even if a judge granted such a period, that would not cure the fundamental defect in this provision.
A recess period is simply no substitute for the time-honored practice of reading the transcript, researching the
issues by use of a library and computer technology, reflecting upon the law and the facts, and writing a cogent, organized
and persuasive brief.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requiring counsel to throw together a presentation at the close of the trial also creates a real danger that relevant
points will be overlooked. The consequences of any such omission or oversight can be severe. If a party fails to raise
a point before the ALJ, it may well have waived its right to raise that issue before the Board. See, e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

287 NLRB 602, n.1 (1987). Issues not raised before the Board, of course, cannot ordinarily be raised on appeal. See
NLRB Section 10(e).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For all of the reasons discussed above, we believe that dispensing with briefs is fundamentally unfair to the participants
in Board proceedings. We further believe that this practice will erode the quality of decision-making by ALJs. As
any decision-maker can attest, the decisional process is greatly facilitated by access to thorough and competent
written arguments on both sides of the issue. Substituting hasty and perhaps ill-considered oral presentations
for written briefs cannot help but make the job of the ALJ more difficult, as well as that of the Board members and federal
judges who must review the ALJ's decision.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The provision allowing ALJs to issue decisions from the bench is perhaps even more objectionable. First of all, the
threat to the quality of ALJ decisions posed by dispensing with briefing will only be compounded by the absence of a
written ALJ decision. In essence, the Judge will have just heard oral arguments, which were constructed without benefit
of time for assimilation, research, organization and reflection. The judge will thereupon render a decision, without
an independent opportunity for assimilation, research, organization and reflection. In our view, such a process
is not a recipe for excellence_or even quality_in decision-making.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of bench decisions, moreover, is bound to compound the Board's difficulties in the federal courts. In recent
years, reviewing courts have shown an increasing propensity to remand cases to the Board (or simply to reverse the
Board outright) on grounds that the Board has not adequately articulated the basis for its decision. Our colleagues
nonetheless wish to implement a rule that can only exacerbate this problem.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As the new rule recognizes, ALJ bench decisions are not exempt from the requirements of the Administrative Procedures
Act (APA), which provides that all decisions ``shall include a statement of *&blank;*&blank;* findings and conclusions,
and the reasons or basis therefore, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
on all the material issues of fact, law, or discretion presented on the record *&blank;*&blank;*.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 5 U.S.C. Section 557(c) (1988) (emphasis added). Just as the most competent of counsel will have difficulty constructing
a cogent oral argument on the spot, so, too will even the ablest of ALJs have difficulty covering all the basis required
by the APA in a bench decision_especially one rendered without the benefit of written briefs. The question whether
the Judge's oral decision complies with the APA will thus, as noted in comments on the proposed rule,
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 provide fertile ground for litigation before the circuit courts as well as the Board.

In addition, we are not convinced that resorting to bench decisions will result in any net savings of time_the driving
force behind this provision. Litigation over the adequacy of the Judge's oral findings is almost certain to add time
at both the Board and court levels. Indeed, the mere opportunity to litigate this procedural issue may result in the
appeal of cases that would not otherwise be taken up_for instance, Section 8(a)(3) cases that turn largely on the Judge's
factual findings. Moreover, where the Judge has indeed failed to make all the proper findings, the Board will have
to attempt, where possible, to supply the missing ingredients itself, or else remand the case for further findings_both
time-consuming processes. Further remands will be doubt occur at the circuit court level when the court disagrees
with the Board's determination regarding the adequacy of the findings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, litigation over the ``adequacy'' issue, and the necessity for remands in some cases, will add time to the process.
In our view, this additional time will likely be greater than the time saved by dispensing with a written decision.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 Whereas a remand will likely result in a minimum of several months of delay, requiring a written decision (after the
filing of briefs) should add at most several weeks to the decision time in a ``simple'' case_a period that can be kept
to a minimum by encouraging ALJs to set short briefing schedules in appropriate cases.

In this regard, we do not share our colleagues' apparent belief that remands can be avoided by carefully culling out
only relatively simple cases. The rule, of course, does not confine use of the procedure to any particular kind of case.
Even if ALJs attempt to abide by the ``suggestions'' put forth by the Board, there will undoubtedly be cases where the
prediction is not borne out. A case that appears ``simple'' may turn out not to be so simple after all. This is particularly
true, given the absence of discovery. The fact that the ALJ knows little about the case until the evidence unfolds at
trial increases the risk that a case that appears at first blush to require only a straightforward credibility determination
or the application of a well-settled principle of law may, upon reflection, turn out to involve much more.

The concerns set forth above are shared by most of the persons and organizations submitting comments. The great bulk
of the comments submitted to the Board express strong opposition both to dispensing with briefs and to oral ALJ decisions.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 Indeed, the proposed rules are characterized in such terms as ``ill-advised'', ``unwarranted'', and as ``sacrific[ing]
accuracy, fairness and quality for expedience.''
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 The sole comment that fully supports the proposed rule completely ignores one of our primary sources of concern (discussed
extensively in our earlier statement as well as in our dissent today)_the lack of discovery in Board proceedings.
The comment is thus unpersuasive.

See Comment of Laurence Gold &amp; James Coppess (AFL&hyph;CIO). This comment asserts that ``a number of federal
administrative agencies expressly authorize oral decisions by ALJs,'' and urges us to join the crowd. See id. at 5.
Its citations support this claim as to three agencies or administrative bodies_the Maritime Administration of the
Department of Transportation, the National Transportation Safety Board, and the Department of Agriculture. The
rules of two of these bodies, however, expressly provide for discovery, see 49 C.F.R. Section 821.19 (1993) (National
Transportation Safety Board); 46 C.F.R. Section 201.109 (1993) (Maritime Administration); and those of the third
provide for a pre-hearing conference at which the Judge may compel the parties to furnish certain information regarding
their case, including documents they intend to introduce, see 7 C.F.R. Section 1.140 (1994) (Department of Agriculture).
This comment's analogy to bench decisions issued by the federal district courts is similarly wide of the mark; those
proceedings, of course, are conducted in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which provide for
extensive pre-trial discovery.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Like our colleagues, we are in favor of expediting the Board's processes. The rules being implemented today, however,
are unlikely to achieve that end, and in any event would do so at a cost that is much too high to pay. That price includes:
a lack of fundamental fairness in Board proceedings, a decline in the quality of the agency's decisional product,
and increasing tension in our relationship with the federal courts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In our quest for speed, we must be careful not to undermine the fundamental goals of fairness in our decisional procedure
and excellence in our decisional product. Because we believe that the rules approved by our colleagues will do just
that, we dissent.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Amendments to OSHA's Hazard Communication Standard (HCS) were published on February 9, 1994 (59 FR 6126). The modified
final rule included a number of minor changes and technical amendments to further clarify the requirements of the
HCS published August 24, 1987 (52 FR 31852). The amendments included a new exemption to the standard's requirements.
Section (b)(6)(ii) intended to exempt any hazardous substance as such term is defined by the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) (42 U.S.C. 9601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), only when subject to comprehensive regulations issued under the Act by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Need for Correction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The language of the CERCLA exemption was patterned after the language of the Resources Conservation and Recovery
Act (RCRA) exemption that precedes it. However, this has led to possible misinterpretation because CERCLA, unlike
RCRA, regulates many chemicals in the limited circumstances of remedial and removal actions and does not pervasively
regulate those chemicals. It was OSHA's intent to exempt CERCLA-listed chemicals only in circumstances where they
are fully regulated by EPA, making OSHA's HCS requirements duplicative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, OSHA is correcting the language to make this clear. The new language states that the exemption applies
to any hazardous substance as that term is defined by CERCLA when the hazardous substance is the focus of remedial or
removal action being conducted under CERCLA in accordance with EPA regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This document also corrects a typographical error in section (c) of the standard and eliminates a confusing clause.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In 1984, the Congress enacted legislation, Pub. L. 98&hyph;506 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(98 Stat. 2338) codified at 16 U.S.C. 460
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
l
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&hyph;22(c) (the Act), to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prohibit the operation of ``solid waste disposal sites'' within units 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the National Park System except for those ``operating as of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
September 1, 1984,'' or those ``used only for disposal of wastes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generated within that unit so long as such site will not degrade 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any of the natural or cultural resources'' of the unit. The Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
went on to direct the Secretary of the Interior to promulgate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations to ``carry out the provisions of this subsection, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including reasonable regulations to mitigate the adverse effects of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solid waste disposal sites in operation as of September 1, 1984, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upon the property of the United States.'' The regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implement those statutory provisions. Further authority for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the restriction and controls on operations of existing solid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste disposal sites is found in the Act of August 16, 1916, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended, (NPS Organic Act) codified at 16 U.S.C. 1 and 3.

Summary of Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These rules were published in proposed form for public comment on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
December 13, 1993 (58 FR 65141&hyph;65149) with a comment period of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
60 calendar days. The comment period closed at the end of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business, February 11, 1994. The National Park Service received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seven timely comments regarding the proposed regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because Federal offices in Washington, DC were closed on February 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11, 1994 due to a snow emergency, and the NPS could not accept 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments on that day, the NPS accepted comments received on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Monday, February 14, 1994. Comments were received from two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, two individuals, one organization, and two offices within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the National Park Service. Of the seven comments, three were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either fully supportive of the rule or advocated further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restrictions. The other four comments questioned both the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scope and the meaning of the rule.

Section 6.2&blank;Applicability and Scope 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations are generally applicable to any solid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste disposal site operated in, or proposed for operation in, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
units of the National Park System. Two comments sought 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clarification of this rule and how it coincides with State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. The States, under the overall aegis of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0320 forcenewline -->
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), are the primary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory authorities for solid waste disposal sites on all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lands within the boundaries of National Park System units, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including Federal lands (See Resource Conservation and Recovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act at 42 U.S.C. 6961). This rule does not duplicate existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State regulatory controls for solid waste disposal sites in units 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the National Park System. Rather, this rule governs the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions under which a solid waste disposal site may exist within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the boundaries of a National Park System unit, not whether the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
site meets the standards of EPA and State regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The National Park Service does not intend to displace the States by administering the standards of 40 CFR parts 257
and 258, Solid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Waste Disposal Facility Criteria, to sites within the boundaries of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National Park System units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment asked what action the National Park Service would take 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should the appropriate unit of State or local government fail to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply the standards at 40 CFR parts 257 and 258 to a solid waste disposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
site within a National Park System unit. In such cases, the NPS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regional Director for the unit involved would notify the EPA and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the appropriate States to secure enforcement of regulations by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proper entity. Where an operator of a solid waste disposal site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is governed by a National Park Service permit under 36 CFR 6.4, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6.5, or 6.6 of this part, the Regional Director may, among other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
things, revoke a permit to operate under &sect;6.12 of this part for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator failure to comply with EPA or State regulations governing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solid waste disposal. Language has been added to &sect;6.12 of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rule to include noncompliance with State regulations or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards at 40 CFR parts 257 and 258 as a basis for which permit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revocation, forfeiture of bond, or penalties may be applied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment requested that the rule also apply to solid waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal sites adjacent to units of the National Park System. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the context of Pub. L. 98&hyph;506, the Service concludes that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation of existing sites and the prohibition of new sites apply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only to lands and waters within the boundaries of a National Park 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
System unit. Therefore, the final rule does not extend its reach 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beyond unit boundaries.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Three comments questioned whether the rule applies to nonfederal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lands within the boundaries of National Park System units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule, as does the proposed, applies to all nonfederal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lands within such boundaries, without regard to title. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress explicitly directed that the law apply ``*&blank;*&blank;* within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
boundary of any unit of the National Park System.'' It is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the authority of the National Park Service to rewrite an act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Congress and limit the rule's applicability to only ``Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lands within the boundary.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are many statutes establishing National Park System units. A brief survey of these statutes disclosed that
the phrase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``within the boundaries'' is commonly employed to refer to both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal land and nonfederally owned land or interests in land 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the outer boundaries a unit. The statute, Pub. L. 98&hyph;506, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that mandates this final rule specifically uses the term ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the boundary 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
of any unit of the National Park System.'' (Emphasis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
added) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment from Alaska noted that 36 CFR 1.2 applies only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain regulations to nonfederal lands, and then, only in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those units under the concurrent or exclusive legislative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jurisdiction of the United States. However, the self-imposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limitation of 36 CFR 1.2(b) applies only to regulations at 36 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CFR parts 1 through 5 and 7. Because Congress specifically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enacted a statute, Pub. L. 98&hyph;506, that applies to all lands within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the boundaries of a unit, the regulations derived from that statute are not limited by 36 CFR 1.2(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The situation most analogous to 36 CFR part 6 is 36 CFR part 9, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subpart A, Mining and Mining Claims. The regulations at 36 CFR part 9A apply to all mining claims within a unit, both
patented and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unpatented, and in all parks, even in those where the United 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States exercises neither concurrent nor exclusive legislative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jurisdiction. Thus, for example, patented claims, which are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
private property in every sense of the word, in Death Valley 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National Monument, or the Kantishna area of Denali National Park 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Preserve (areas of proprietary jurisdiction only) are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
governed by 36 CFR part 9 subpart A, notwithstanding 36 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1.2(b). The same principle applies to 36 CFR part 6. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three comments questioned whether the regulations apply to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonfederal lands within unit boundaries in units of the National 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Park System specifically in Alaska. (Alaska units of the National 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Park System contain approximately 2.7 million nonfederal acres of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a total of over 54 million acres encompassed within their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
boundaries, or approximately 5% of the total acreage.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The basis for the comments from Alaska lies in section 103(c) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(16 U.S.C. 3103(c)). That language states:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Only those lands within the boundaries of any conservation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system unit which are public lands (as such term is defined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in this Act) shall be deemed to be included as a portion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of such unit. No lands which, before, on, or after the date of enactment of this act, are conveyed to the State, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to any Native Corporation, or any private party shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to the regulations applicable 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
solely
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 to public lands within such units. If the State, a Native 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Corporation, or other owner desires to convey any such lands, the Secretary may acquire such lands in accordance with
applicable law (including this Act), and any such lands shall 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
become part of the unit,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 and be administered accordingly. (Emphasis added)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The comments from Alaska cite this language to raise the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant issue of whether nonfederal lands within National Park System units in Alaska are part of the units at
all, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thus subject to any NPS regulations, including the final rule at 36 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CFR part 6. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 103(c) language creates a question of statutory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interpretation. Namely, does this section effectively render the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solid waste site law (Pub. L. 98&hyph;506), and its implementing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations, inapplicable to all nonfederal lands in National Park 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
System units in Alaska? Or does it simply mean that the non-federal lands are not be to be administered as part of the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conservation unit in the same manner as the Federal lands? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is the Service's opinion that the language of section 103(c) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not render the final rule at 36 CFR part 6 inapplicable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonfederal lands in units of the National Park System in Alaska 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because of the presence of the word ``solely.'' Since Pub. L. 98&hyph;506 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorizes the regulation of solid waste disposal sites, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prohibits all but certain such sites, ``within the boundary of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit of the National Park System,'' neither the law, nor its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations apply ``solely'' to public lands within the units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The other possibility is that section 103(c) renders Pub. L.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``within the boundary of any unit of the National Park System.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first sentence of section 103(c) specifies:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Only those lands within the boundaries of any

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(as such term is defined in this Act) shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deemed to be included as a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
portion of such unit
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Under this argument, since nonfederal lands are not ``a portion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of'' a unit, they are not ``within the boundary of a National Park 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
System unit'' and thus not subject to this regulation. The Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that the better view of the law negates this argument. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pub. L. 98&hyph;506 applies ``within the boundary of any unit of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National Park System.'' Words in a statute generally are to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
given their common meaning. The common understanding of the words 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``within the boundary'' is that something be within the outer limits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It does not mean the same thing as ``a portion of.'' Perhaps the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
best indication of this analysis is the use of the word ``within'' in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Alaska Lands Act itself. Section 1301(b)(7) (16 U.S.C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3191(b)), refers to ``privately owned areas, if any, which are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
within such unit
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.'' Thus, while there are no privately-owned areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which are ``a portion of'' the unit, the Alaska Lands Act recognizes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that there are privately-owned areas ``within'' a unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 103(c) itself speaks of ``only those lands within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
boundaries of any conservation system unit which are public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lands,'' thus implying the existence of non-public lands within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those boundaries. The Service therefore concludes from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
language of section 103(c) itself that nonfederal lands are ``within'' the boundaries of Alaska units of the National
Park System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
even if they are not ``a portion of'' the unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments from Alaska offer an opportunity to further clarify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the applicability of 36 CFR part 6 and illuminate the exceptions to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this rule that are specifically aimed at small private 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residential inholders. Persons who either reside or farm within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the exterior boundaries of a National Park System unit need not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submit a request and obtain a permit from the Regional Director 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the disposal of residential or agricultural wastes on their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule at &sect;6.2(c)(iii) stated that such waste could be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposed of ``on lands or waters'' that ``he or she owns or leases'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the unit. In response to two comments, the final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deletes the word ``waters'' since disposing of solid waste in water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or wetlands may likely violate other laws. In the interest of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gender neutrality, the word ``person'' is substituted for ``he or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
she.''

One comment noted that &sect;6.2(d) exempts the NPS from its own rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at this part. Two comments asked how the NPS will ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with conditions of &sect;6.4 for NPS-operated solid waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal sites, if the procedural, administrative, financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assurance and penalty provisions of the proposed regulations do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not apply to NPS operated solid waste disposal sites. The NPS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will adhere to the conditions of &sect;6.4 (for a new, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expanded existing solid waste disposal site) and to the conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of &sect;6.5 (for existing NPS operated solid waste disposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sites) as a matter of policy and special directive. In addition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the NPS will comply with the National Environmental Policy Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(42 U.S.C. 4321, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and, at a minimum, prepare an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental assessment for any new, or expansion of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing, solid waste disposal site that the NPS proposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule changes the word ``procedural'' at &sect;6.2(d) to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``permit'' for clarity. The reason why the permit, bond and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalty provisions do not apply to the NPS is that there is no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
means by which the NPS may be both the permitting agency and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permittee, the bond-poster and the bond-holder, the enforcer and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the violator, simultaneously.

Section 6.3&blank;Definitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to one comment, note that the proposed, as well as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final, definition of the term ``agricultural waste'' includes waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resulting from the ``harvesting of .&blank;.&blank;. trees.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment specifically sought clarification about whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concession operations in parks, whether under contracts or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial use licenses are ``exempt'' from the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This question is best answered by discussing the definition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the term ``National Park Service activities.'' There must be a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary connection between the NPS and the establishment of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solid waste disposal site after the passage of the Act. ``National 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Park Service activities'' includes activities conducted by NPS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contractors, concessionaires and commercial use licensees because such persons, under agreement with the NPS,
provide eating, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lodging, transportation and other services to park visitors or to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
park management itself. Since the NPS may operate a new solid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste disposal site within a unit for NPS activities, the NPS may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approve new sites for the disposal of solid waste generated by NPS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contractors, concessionaires and commercial use licensees. Such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
persons may also dispose of solid waste in existing NPS operated or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approved sites. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While NPS contractors, concessionaires and commercial use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licensees may dispose of solid waste on lands within a unit, any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal by such a person to establish their own new site for solid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste disposal, or continue to operate and use their own existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solid waste disposal site, is fully governed by 36 CFR 6.4 or 6.5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The disposal of solid waste by such persons, while permissible on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lands within a National Park System unit, must be subject to full 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NPS scrutiny. The NPS has a fundamental obligation to ensure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contractors, concessionaires and commercial use licensees dispose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of solid waste on lands within a unit, even the remote lands in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alaska, in an environmentally sensitive manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Residential waste,'' as defined in &sect;6.3, means waste generated by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the normal activities of a household. One comment suggested that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the residential waste exception at &sect;6.2(c) not include paper, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plastic and metal. Since the &sect;6.2(c) exception is intended to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimize the solid waste stream by providing an alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal means for agricultural or residential solid wastes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are compostible, we have partially adopted the suggestion. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rule defines ``residential waste'' to exclude plastic and metal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste, since these are not compostible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment appeared to confuse the ``residential waste'' exception 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this part with the ``household waste exclusion'' that exists 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at 40 CFR 261.4(b)(1). The definition of ``residential solid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste'' used in this part comes from 40 CFR part 243. That 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition means waste generated by the normal activities of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
households. This definition applies only to residences, not to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial activities, such as lodges, motels or eating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishments. On the other hand, the EPA definition at 40 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
261.4(b)(1) broadly excludes ``household waste'' from the legal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meaning of hazardous waste. The 40 CFR part 261 meaning of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``household waste'' includes waste generated by residences AND 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial lodging and eating establishments. It does not follow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that because 36 CFR part 6 largely excludes residential waste from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its control, that the NPS is also somehow excluding waste disposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from commercial lodging or eating establishments. The fact that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastes generated by such establishments are specifically excluded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the definition of ``hazardous waste'' under RCRA regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not make such wastes ``residential wastes'' for the purposes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this regulation. These two issues are unrelated and are addressed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in separate sections of this regulation.

One comment suggested that the proposed definition of ``solid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste disposal site'' is so broad that it would encompass lands 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where the Exxon Valdez spilled oil. The Service agrees, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inserts language in the final definition of ``solid waste disposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
site'' to make clear that 36 CFR part 6 does not govern discharges 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of materials, or substances into the environment that are covered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by such laws as the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1321(b)(3)) and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comprehensive Environmental Response and Compensation and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). It was never the intent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the NPS to regulate such discharges or deposits as if they were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``solid waste disposal sites.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment suggested that this rule also govern ``transfer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stations,'' since they are places where solid waste is deposited, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
albeit temporarily. Because such stations may be places of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant degradation to park resources resulting from noise, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
litter, visual intrusion, runoff and traffic, the Service has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decided to include transfer stations in the definition of a ``solid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste disposal site.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Note that the EPA's definition of ``hazardous waste'' at 40 CFR part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
261 excludes wastes generated by households (including single and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
multiple family residences, hotels and motels). In light of one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment, the Service reiterates that such waste is not ``legally'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazardous. This ``household waste exclusion'' is mentioned here again because it is important to point out that the
prohibition at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;6.4(a)(6)(i) and at &sect;6.5(c)(3)(i) does not prevent the NPS from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accepting for disposal at NPS-operated solid waste disposal sites, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solid wastes such as used oil, grease, paints, solvents, cleaning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agents, or pesticides that are generated by ``households.'' Such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials are not ``legally'' hazardous waste when discarded by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
households (including hotels, motels, restaurants, single or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
multiple family residences). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, as long as such waste is generated by National Park Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities, such as garbage collection from park/concessionaire 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees, they may be disposed of in an NPS-operated solid waste

In response to comments from the NPS Alaska Region, the Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
points out that both the proposed and the final rule recognize 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that some communities may lie wholly within the boundaries of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit of the National Park System in Alaska. Such communities may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exhaust the capacity of their existing solid waste disposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
site. Such communities may request that the Regional Director 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permit them to expand an existing site within the unit. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regional Director must normally judge such a request under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions in &sect;6.4. However, the Regional Director will instead 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
judge a request for expansion of an existing site under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval conditions of &sect;6.5(c), if the operator shows that the solid waste is generated solely from within the
boundaries of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit, the operator owns or leases the lands proposed for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expansion, and the solid waste disposal site lacks road, rail or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequate water access to any lands outside of the unit for all, or

One comment asked how this part applies to operations on mining

claims. This section is intended to clarify the relationship

between the final regulations governing solid waste disposal and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing regulations at 36 CFR part 9, Minerals Management, that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
govern mineral operations. Without this section, this final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation would govern solid waste disposal sites by all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mineral operators. The NPS now regulates solid waste disposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by many mineral operators and does not intend to create a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
duplicate regulatory scheme for such operators. Thus, this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section excludes from the permit and financial assurance provisions of the final regulations solid waste disposal
sites 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by operators that are, now or prospectively, governed by NPS

regulations at 36 CFR part 9 or the terms of a Federal mineral

One comment asked if the NPS would establish a household 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``harmful'' waste collection program for its inholders. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
answer is ``No.'' Inholders may not dispose of their waste in NPS operated solid waste disposal sites. Nor is the NPS
in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business of collecting waste from inholders. Moreover, the NPS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will establish collection programs for household waste that, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
though not legally hazardous, may be harmful, ONLY in those units 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where the NPS operates a solid waste disposal site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The same comment then seemed to suggest that since the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations at 36 CFR 6.8(b) mandate the establishment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collection programs for ``household hazardous wastes'' ONLY for parks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that operate solid waste disposal sites, then only such parks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
need have hazardous waste collection programs. This is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorrect. Every park that generates waste that is defined by 40 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CFR part 261 as hazardous, must collect, store, handle and manage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that waste under the regulations governing such waste prescribed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under Subtitle D of RCRA. To eliminate confusion, the final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at &sect;6.8(b) no longer refers to ``household hazardous waste'' which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legally is not ``hazardous'' but to ``harmful wastes generated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by residential activities.''

One comment asked if this section applies the penalties to solid waste disposal sites on ``private inholdings.''
The answer is yes, 36 CFR part 6, including its penalty provisions, applies to solid waste disposal sites on nonfederal
lands, insofar as such lands are within the boundaries of a unit of the National Park System.

Section 6.2&blank;Applicability and Scope
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations are generally applicable to any solid waste disposal site operated in, or proposed for operation
in, units of the National Park System. While the NPS is concerned with the disposal of all solid wastes on all lands and
waters within unit boundaries, the rule provides for certain exceptions. This final rule at &sect;6.2(c) does not
require that all persons who either reside or farm within the exterior boundaries of a National Park System unit submit
a request and obtain a permit from the Regional Director for the disposal of residential or agricultural wastes on
their lands. Paragraph (c) provides that a person residing within the boundaries of a unit of the National Park System
may dispose of certain solid wastes without a permit or penalty unless the person requires a State or local permit or
license to dispose of solid waste. The final rule enumerates conditions under which such persons may dispose of waste.
This exemption does not apply to the disposal of agricultural pesticides, pesticide equipment or containers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This exception is intended to minimize the solid waste stream by providing an alternative disposal means for agricultural
or residential solid wastes that are compostible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the Superintendent of the affected unit determines that the disposal of agricultural or residential solid wastes
poses a reasonable probability of threat to public health or the environment, as described in the regulations at 40
CFR part 257, the Superintendent will notify the Regional Director and the resident that the request, permit, and
penalty provisions of 36 CFR part 6 are applicable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph 6.2(d) explains the effect of the regulations on NPS operated sites. Existing and new solid waste disposal
sites operated or proposed by the NPS for administration of the National Park System must meet the standards prescribed
in 40 CFR subchapter I, specifically at 40 CFR part 241, Guidelines for the Land Disposal of Solid Waste; part 257, Criteria
for Classification of Solid Waste Disposal Facilities and Practices, and part 258 Criteria for Municipal Solid Waste
Landfills, and by appropriate State laws. The permit, administrative, financial assurance and penalty provisions
of the final rule do not apply to NPS operated landfills. However, the NPS will adhere to the conditions of &sect;6.4
to establish a new, or expand an existing, solid waste disposal site for NPS activities. The NPS will also adhere to
the conditions of &sect;6.5 to continue operations at existing NPS operated solid waste disposal sites. In addition,
the NPS will comply with the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and, at a minimum, prepare an environmental assessment for any new, or expansion of any existing, solid waste disposal
site that the NPS proposes.

Section 6.3&blank;Definitions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The definitions section of the rule applies to terms that are not otherwise defined in 36 CFR part 1. The words defined
in the rule either come from the legislation on which the rule is based or are included to enhance the clarity and accuracy
of the rule. The primary purposes of the definitions are to make clear the reach and applicability of the rule for the
NPS and the regulated community and to ensure that actions taken under the rule are consistent and predictable. In
most cases, other statutes serve as the bases for the precise wording selected. These statutes are referred to in the
discussions of the definitions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``boundaries'' of any unit of the National Park System comes from the language of the statute. It is defined
in the final rule to include all lands within units of the National Park System, regardless of jurisdictional status
or ownership. Many units of the National Park System include nonfederal lands. Solid waste disposal on both Federal
and nonfederal lands within National Park System unit boundaries come under the purview of this rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because there are no limitations on applicability to any class or type of lands in the statutory language, the rule
defines the term broadly. The definition includes waters as well as lands because of the breadth of the statutory language
and because the effects of such solid waste disposal sites are not limited to lands, but can also affect waters, particularly
groundwater.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule adds a definition for the term ``compostible materials.'' The Service determines that facilities
for the management of compostible materials are not solid waste disposal sites for the purpose of these regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also defined is the term, ``National Park Service activities.'' It is explained for two reasons: First, to clarify
that there must be a necessary connection between the NPS and the establishment of solid waste disposal sites after
the passage of the Act; second, beginning one year after the effective date of the regulations, only persons engaged
in ``National Park Service activities,'' as defined herein, may dispose of solid waste in an NPS operated solid waste
disposal site. ``National Park Service activities'' thus includes activities conducted by NPS contractors, concessionaires
and commercial use licensees. Such persons, under agreement with the NPS, provide eating, lodging, transportation
and other services to park visitors. Since new solid waste disposal sites may be established in National Park System
units for NPS activities only, new sites may accept for disposal waste generated only by these persons. NPS contractors,
concessionaires, and commercial use licensees may also dispose of solid waste in existing NPS operated sites. ``National
Park Service activities'' do not include activities engaged in by Special Use Permittees (Form 10&hyph;114). Waste
disposal by Special Use Permittees and others is governed by all the substantive, permit, financial assurance and
penalty provisions of &sect;6.4 for a new waste disposal site, or &sect;6.5 for an existing site.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The word ``degrade'' also comes from the statute and is defined as ``to lessen in quantity, quality, or value.'' It
is included in the terms defined in the rule for the sake of clarity and predictability. Since the statutorily mandated
standard for any solid waste disposal site operating in a park unit is that the operation not ``degrade'' park resources,
this section provides guidance as to how the term degrade is to be used by the NPS in determining such effects.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The terms ``agricultural solid waste,'' ``residential solid waste'' and ``leachate,'' are defined as they are in
the regulations that govern solid waste under the authority of the Resource Recovery and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C.
6901 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and implemented at 40 CFR part 243, Guidelines for the Storage and Collection of Residential, Commercial, and Institutional
Solid Waste. The term ``hazardous waste'' refers to the definition of such solid waste prescribed at 40 CFR part 261,
Identification and Listing of Hazardous Wastes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Natural resources'' is defined here so as to provide a comprehensive inventory of the inherent attributes of National
Park System units that may be affected by solid waste disposal sites. The detailed listing of resource attributes
is designed to enable the agency and the regulated community sufficient consistency and specificity to evaluate
potential effects to the parks. The Report of the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs (House Report 98&hyph;1069)
that accompanied the Act said, ``the conditions of noise, air pollution, waste disposal in surrounding lands, rat
and other pest problems, and area disruption due to heavy truck use that are created by these waste disposal sites have
resulted in a deep concern over the degradation of park values.'' In another section, the Report stated ``The Committee
notes that the operation of solid waste disposal sites within units of the National Park System causes deterioration
of air and water quality, increases levels of mechanical noise, and has the potential to degrade land and water areas
that are in relatively natural condition and areas containing significant cultural values, and that the operation
of such disposal sites renders adjacent lands, and waters, unfit for full public use and enjoyment.'' In light of the
Committee's broad findings concerning what may constitute natural resources affected by solid waste disposal sites,
the drafters have chosen to provide a broad definition for this term.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of the term ``National Park System,'' mirrors the statutory language of 16 U.S.C. 1c. The purpose in
including it here is that the term is used in the statute. Defining it in the rule clarifies the applicability of the
rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definitions of the terms ``PCBs and PCB items'' and ``post closure care'' is the same as used by EPA. The terms ``PCBs
and PCB items'' are defined by regulations at 40 CFR part 761, Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) Manufacturing, Distribution
in Commerce, And Use Prohibitions. The terms ``closure'' and ``post closure care'' are described at 40 CFR part 258.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the heart of this regulatory package are the management and control of ``solid waste.'' The National Park Service
defines the term similarly to that used in RCRA regulations at 40 CFR part 258. The broad definition of solid waste included
here is intended to ensure that all potential sources of adverse effects to National Park System units from such sources
come under the purview of the final rule. The rule also defines two classes of solid waste_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agricultural and residential_that may be exempt from the rule under clearly delineated circumstances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the statute severely restricts the establishment of new ``(solid waste) disposal sites'' within units of
the National Park System and because the term is central to any regulatory activities under the framework of the statute,
it is defined in the rule. The definition is based on the statutory language in RCRA for the term ``disposal.'' The definition
explicitly states that such sites include land or waters where such solid waste may be placed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule governs solid waste transfer stations but not recycling centers, sewage treatment plants, septic
systems, or facilities for managing compostible materials.

Section 6.4&blank;Solid Waste Disposal Sites Not in Operation on September 1, 1984
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulation permits establishing new solid waste disposal sites after September 1, 1984, within units of the National
Park System, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
only
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 with the approval of the Regional Director. This section does not apply to solid waste disposal sites in operation
on September 1, 1984.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Regional Director may approve a permit for a new solid waste disposal site only under the stringent conditions
outlined in the rule that are derived from the statute. The Act states that any new sites must be ``*&blank;*&blank;*
used only for disposal of wastes generated within that unit of the park system *&blank;*&blank;*'' This is the basis
for the first approval condition. The drafters have included the phrase ``solely from National Park Service activities''
in recognition of the fact that the Congress acknowledged that the National Park Service might need to operate solid
waste disposal sites for its own management and associated activities. The Service believes that the statutory language
``wastes generated within that unit of the park system'' was meant to convey a nexus between the disposal sites and
activities of the NPS.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second condition requires that there be no reasonable alternative for disposal outside the unit boundaries.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third condition also is directly derived from the statute which says ``*&blank;*&blank;* so long as such site
will not degrade any of the natural and cultural resources of such park unit.'' The fourth and fifth conditions ensure
consistency and compliance with other Federal, State, and local regulatory programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The sixth condition, that hazardous wastes may not be stored, handled, or disposed at solid waste disposal sites within
National Park System units, recognizes the unique resource values protected in the National Park System and the fundamental
incompatibility of the placement of hazardous wastes with protecting those resources. The final rule adds tires
to the list of wastes that may not be disposed of at a solid waste disposal site within the boundaries of a National Park
System unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Note that the EPA's definition of hazardous waste at 40 CFR part 261 excludes wastes generated by households (including
single and multiple residences, hotels and motels). Thus, the sixth condition does not restrict disposal of household
wastes in NPS operated or other solid waste disposal sites in National Park System units, as long as the waste results
from National Park Service activities, such as garbage collection from park/concessionaire employees' residences.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The seventh condition, that such sites be located wholly on nonfederal lands, implements the policy of the National
Park Service articulated in its 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Management Policies
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1988), page 9:6. As a consequence, no such sites may be established or expanded onto Federal lands in a unit, except
that the NPS may establish a new solid waste disposal site on Federal lands in a park where nonfederal lands do not exist,
or are otherwise unavailable or unsuitable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The eighth condition implements Executive Orders 11988 and 11990. The ninth and tenth conditions seek to clearly
specify precise categories of facilities and lands where solid waste disposal sites would be incompatible with NPS
management and visitor enjoyment. The eleventh condition limits the size of such sites and the twelfth condition
seeks to ensure that such sites will not degrade park resources and visitor enjoyment at a future date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The request for a permit forms the basis for the Regional Director's evaluation of whether the conditions for approval
listed above may be met. The Act states that its general purpose is to ``protect the air, land, water, natural and cultural
values of the National Park System and the property of the United States therein.'' Section 6.4(b) of the rule specifies
the minimum amount of information necessary, in the professional judgment of the NPS, to evaluate whether the air,
land, water, and cultural and natural resources of the National Park System can be protected if a proposed operation
is permitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, &sect;6.4(c) requires that the Regional Director reject the request if the conditions for approval detailed
in paragraph (a) are not met. This section also requires that the Regional Director notify the requester of the rejection
and the reasons for the rejection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Section 6.5&blank;Solid Waste Disposal Sites in Operation on September 1, 1984 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NPS believes that solid waste disposal sites are not an appropriate use of lands within National Park System unit
boundaries. The long-term intent of the National Park Service is to eliminate, to the extent possible, such sites
from within unit boundaries. In the interim, the requirements of &sect;6.5 are designed to ensure that any solid waste
disposal sites in operation on September 1, 1984, in units of the National Park System and continuously operated since
that time meet minimum standards for operation and do not degrade park resources and values. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``continuous operation'' requires clarification. The Service determines that a solid waste disposal site
existing on September 1, 1984, qualifies under &sect;6.5, if that site has accepted solid waste for disposal at least
for some portion of each year after 1984. To be in ``continuous operation'' does not require that the site receive waste
on a daily, weekly, or even monthly basis. Often seasonal factors, such as weather, access, and fluctuations in waste
loads require that some existing sites may be used intermittently.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The approval conditions of &sect;6.5 are designed to implement the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section of the Act that requires the Secretary to promulgate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations ``to mitigate the adverse effects of solid waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal sites in operation as of September 1, 1984, upon property 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the United States.'' As a result of the statutory language, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the first condition requires that there be adequate mitigation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse effects from the operation of the disposal site. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
second condition requires compliance with all applicable Federal, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State, and local laws and regulations. This section, like 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;6.4, requires that there be no hazardous waste disposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at any such sites because such activities are incompatible with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the values and purpose of the National Park System and each unit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thereof. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several solid waste disposal sites are currently operated by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonfederal parties in units of the National Park System. Most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are on nonfederal lands within the unit boundaries, while others 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are on Federal lands within the units. The sites on Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lands often exist because of agreements made as conditions to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal acquisition of specific tracts of land. The regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not terminate any existing agreements that are in compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with applicable local, State, and Federal laws. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 6.5(c) prescribes the conditions under which the Regional Director may allow existing solid waste disposal
sites 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to continue operations. However, the NPS intends that existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solid waste disposal sites operated by nonfederal parties will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not operate indefinitely. Under &sect;6.5(e), a site that reaches its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capacity may continue operation only if the site meets conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable to new sites at &sect;6.4(a). For the purposes of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations, the capacity of a solid waste disposal site is that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area, volume, or height prescribed in the State-issued permit or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other instrument. Any proposal to extend the capacity of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing solid waste disposal site beyond that specified in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permit will be treated as a proposal for a new solid waste disposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
site. Such a proposal is subject to the approval conditions in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;6.4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is conceivable that communities that lie wholly within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
boundaries of a unit of the National Park System may exhaust the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capacity of their existing solid waste disposal sites. Such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
communities may request that the Regional Director permit them to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establish a new, or expand an existing, site within the unit. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regional Director must judge such a request under the conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prescribed in &sect;6.4. However, the Regional Director will judge a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request for expansion of an existing site under the approval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions of &sect;6.5(c), if the operator shows that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The solid waste is generated solely from within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
boundaries of the unit; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The operator owns or leases the nonfederal lands proposed for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expansion; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The solid waste disposal site lacks road, rail or adequate water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
access to any lands outside of the unit for all or substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portions of the year. A substantial portion of the year consists 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of three or more consecutive months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The principles of this section govern the NPS. Should the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NPS seek to expand an existing solid waste disposal site that has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reached its capacity, such an expansion is to be judged as a ``new'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
site, governed by the approval standards of &sect;6.4(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the NPS meets the first and third conditions of &sect;6.5(e)(2), the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NPS may also expand an existing NPS-operated solid waste disposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
site that has reached its capacity, under the standards of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;6.5(c), rather than &sect;6.4(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule includes a new section (f) to address concerns about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solid waste incinerators and transfer stations. The proposed and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final definition of ``solid waste disposal site'' included 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incinerators. The final rule defines solid waste disposal sites to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also include transfer stations. The installation of an incinerator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or a transfer station where there was no site for solid waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal on September 1, 1984 is governed by &sect;6.4. Section 6.5(a) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
governs the continued operation of an incinerator or a transfer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
station where such a solid waste disposal site existed before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
September 1, 1984. Existing incinerators or transfer stations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
just as any other solid waste disposal site, may continue to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dispose of solid waste within the boundaries of a unit of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National Park System only after applying to the NPS under &sect;6.5(a) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and under the standards of &sect;6.5(c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because incinerators or transfer stations generally do not reach capacity and require expansion, &sect;6.5(e)
does not apply to them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rather &sect;6.5(e) addresses conventional land-fill solid waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal sites. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 6.5(f) is needed to address the conversion of an existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
land-fill solid waste disposal site to a transfer station after the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective date of this rule. Without &sect;6.5(f), an operator of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing solid waste disposal site, approved under &sect;6.5(c), may not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
realize that converting an existing solid waste disposal land-fill 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to a transfer station requires a request to the NPS Regional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Director and further NPS review and approval.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the National Park System in the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, solid waste disposal sites on Federal or nonfederal

lands included within a unit boundaries must cease operations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediately upon expiration of the permit or license in effect on

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a) applies to solid waste disposal sites on both Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and nonfederal lands included within a National Park System unit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
boundaries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the interim, and until the expiration of the permit, permittees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and/or operators of such sites on Federal or nonfederal lands 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the boundaries must submit a permit request and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental report. Thus, paragraph (b) states that an operator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wishing to continue solid waste disposal must request a permit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within 180 days of the site's designation as lying within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
boundaries of a National Park System unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule modifies paragraph (c) to delete immediate closure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as the NPS remedy under part 6 for an operator on Federal or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonfederal lands who disposes of solid waste on that land without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requesting NPS approval as specified in paragraph (b). The final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule substitutes instead a broader selection of remedies and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalties as defined in &sect;6.12. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule modifies paragraph (d) to make clear that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
while an operator of a solid waste disposal site on lands 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporated within the boundaries of a unit of the National Park 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
System may continue to operate until the expiration of the permit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or other license that existed on the date the lands were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporated into the unit, such an operator may do so, only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insofar as such operator meets the NPS approval standards of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;6.5(c).

Section 6.7&blank;Mining Wastes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section is intended to clarify the relationship between the regulations governing solid waste disposal and
existing regulations at 36 CFR part 9, Minerals Management, that govern mineral operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 6.7 (b) and (c) address solid waste disposal by persons conducting mineral operations on the date these regulations
become effective. Section 6.7(b) addresses existing mineral operations within a unit of the National Park System
that are not governed by an NPS-approved part 9 plan of operations or terms of a Federal mineral lease. Such an operation
may continue to dispose of solid waste at a site within a unit only after following the procedures and conditions prescribed
in &sect;6.5, posting financial assurance prescribed by the Regional Director, and obtaining a permit from the Regional
Director under &sect;6.9.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 6.7(c) provides that an existing mineral operation, if governed by a plan of operations approved under 36
CFR part 9 or the terms of a Federal mineral lease, may continue to operate a solid waste disposal site within a unit of
the National Park System pursuant to the approved plan of operations or lease. In approving the plan of operations,
the Regional Director, under part 9, should have already prescribed conditions to ``*&blank;*&blank;* mitigate
the adverse effects of solid waste disposal on the property of the United States *&blank;*&blank;*'' associated
with the operation. Congress prescribed this standard as the basis for regulations that govern all existing solid
waste disposal sites.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 6.7(c) makes clear that where an existing mineral operation is governed by 36 CFR part 9 or the terms of a Federal
mineral lease, the Regional Director's approval of the plan of operations constitutes the permit for operation of
a solid waste disposal site in connection with the mineral operation. Financial assurance is not required, if a bond
has been posted under 36 CFR part 9 or the Bureau of Land Management regulations that govern Federal mineral lessees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final regulations allow new solid waste disposal sites by mineral operators within a unit only under the conditions
that Congress prescribed for solid waste disposal at 16 U.S.C. 460
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
l
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&hyph;22. Thus, final &sect;6.7(d) addresses solid waste disposal sites operated by persons proposing mineral
operations beginning after the effective date of these regulations. Such an operator is governed by the conditions
at &sect;6.4(a) that preclude any new solid waste disposal sites within the boundaries of a unit of the National Park
System, unless the waste is generated solely by National Park Service activities. Thus, persons who begin mineral
operations after the effective date of the regulations, as all other persons, could not operate a new solid waste disposal
site within the boundaries of a unit of the National Park System. Among the alternatives available to mineral operators
are disposing of the solid waste in appropriate facilities outside the unit boundaries, or in an existing solid waste
disposal site in a unit, whose continued operation has been approved by the Regional Director under &sect;6.5 and
permitted under &sect;6.9.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 6.7(d) applies to establishment of a solid waste disposal site by a prospective operator, whether the operator
is governed by regulations at 36 CFR part 9 or the terms of a Federal mineral lease. Nonetheless, the Regional Director
must ensure that all persons, including those beginning mineral operations within a unit, obey the prohibition on
establishing a new solid waste disposal site on all lands within a unit's boundaries. This task will be relatively
simple where an operator is governed by 36 CFR part 9 or a Federal mineral lease. Where an operator is not so governed,
the Regional Director must inform the operator of, and enforce, the conditions that prohibit a new solid waste disposal
site. To ease the regulatory burden on a mineral operator, nothing in this part prohibits the temporary storage, or
stockpiling for return, or the return of mining overburden to the mine site for reclamation purposes. Such activity
does not constitute creation of a solid waste disposal site and will not be governed by the need to request or possess
a permit, the conditions at &sect;6.4 and &sect;6.5, or the financial assurance requirements of &sect;6.9. This
exception applies only to mining overburden that is not hazardous under EPA regulations at 40 CFR part 261. However,
a mineral operator commencing operations after the effective date of this final rule will not be permitted to permanently
abandon spoil or overburden on their lands, including on patented claims, or other nonfederal lands in a unit. Such
an action constitutes creation of a new ``solid waste disposal site'' which Congress prohibited within the boundaries
of a National Park System unit. The Service recognizes that this requirement may increase the costs of conducting
mining in parks. However, the cost of conducting mining must also include the cost of reclaiming the solid waste remaining
after mining is completed. The NPS cannot reasonably implement congressional intent to prohibit new solid waste
disposal sites in National Park System units, and then allow mining operators to establish such sites in parks in connection
with mining.

Section 6.8&blank;National Park Service Solid Waste Responsibilities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (a) prohibits the disposal of solid waste in NPS-operated solid waste disposal sites by persons other than
those engaged in National Park Service activities. ``National Park Service activities'' are defined in &sect;6.3
to include NPS contractors, concessionaires or commercial use licensees. In several instances, persons other than
contractors, concessionaires, or commercial use licensees now dispose of solid waste in NPS operated solid waste
disposal sites on Federal lands. This is an inappropriate use of Federal park lands that the regulations terminate
one year after the effective date of these regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b) directs the NPS to set up special collection program to remove harmful substances from the household
waste stream where appropriate. While wastes generated by households (including hotels and motels) are not hazardous,
they may be harmful to NPS resources. Therefore the NPS, under &sect;6.8, will establish a collection program to remove
such materials from the waste stream in units where the NPS operates a solid waste disposal site. The proposed rule
required that such collections be conducted every six months. The final rule requires it once each year. Each such
park has the latitude to establish a collection program that best meets its circumstances, ranging from a one-day
collection of certain wastes only (used oil, paints, thinners, etc.) to a continually open collection site for all
harmful wastes generated by park residents.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (c) requires that the NPS strictly adhere to the regulations at 40 CFR part 244, Solid Waste Management Guidelines
for Beverage Containers. While some units may not be aware of the requirements at 40 CFR part 244 for deposit systems
on Federal facilities, nonetheless the requirements are longstanding. Note that the regulations require (not simply
``recommend'') that Federal facilities maintain deposit and return systems on containers in which ``carbonated
beverages'' are sold. Such containers may be plastic, glass, aluminum or steel. Parks, such as Grand Canyon National
Park, that have voluntary recycling programs are not exempt from final &sect;6.8(c). Mandatory deposit and return
systems are not replaced by voluntary recycling efforts. Rather these two approaches complement each other. As part
of its environmental leadership responsibilities, the NPS seeks to address the solid waste issue with several tools,
including mandatory deposit and return systems for carbonated beverage containers sold by facilities on Federal
lands in units of the National Park System. Individual units that propose not to implement 40 CFR part 244 shall maintain
deposit and return systems while a fully-documented request for non-implementation is being considered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule inserts a new subsection (d) at &sect;6.8 to address Executive Order 12873, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Federal Acquisition, Recycling and Waste Prevention. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
That order mandates that all Federal agencies ``shall incorporate waste prevention and recycling in the agency's
daily operations and work.'' This requirement governs not only the NPS but also NPS concessionaires, commercial
use licensees and contractors.

Section 6.9&blank;Permits
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule requires that a person proposing to continue, or begin operating a solid waste disposal site within
the boundaries of a unit of the National Park System must possess a permit issued under this part. The regulations exempt
only two classes of persons operating solid waste disposal sites from this permit requirement. They are persons who
reside or farm within a park under &sect;6.2(c) and existing mineral operators described by &sect;6.7(c).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Residents under &sect;6.2(c) do not require a permit and the mineral operator's permit consists of an NPS-approved
plan of operations or Federal lease terms. Also note that &sect;6.2(c)(3) and &sect;6.7(e) exclude some substances
from the ambit of these regulations under certain conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This section also governs the issuing of a permit for the operation of a solid waste disposal site and outlines the contents
of such permits. Section 6.9(b) requires that the Regional Director comply with the National Environmental Policy
Act (NEPA) and other pertinent laws and executive orders before issuing a permit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Regional Director may find that a proposal meets the conditions under which the NPS may approve a new, or continued
operation of an existing, site. If a proposal meets the conditions, the Regional Director shall then determine, through
preparation of an environmental assessment, whether the Service's approval constitutes a major Federal agency
action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. When the Regional Director finds such an effect,
the NPS will prepare an Environmental Impact Statement on the proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 6.9(d) makes clear that the issuance of a Special Use Permit is the method by which the Regional Director approves
a request and environmental report, and provides that the authority to issue a permit resides with the Regional Director.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (e) sets forth the minimum requirements a permit may prescribe for operating a solid waste disposal site.
The requirements are aimed at reducing the potential adverse effects attributable to the operation of such sites
on the property of the United States.

Section 6.10&blank;Financial Assurance
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section prescribes the procedures for financial assurance from a solid waste disposal site operator in a unit
of the National Park System.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations at 40 CFR part 258 require that an operator of a solid waste disposal site for household and certain
other commercial and industrial solid wastes (not including hazardous wastes) must provide an estimate of costs
related to closure and post-closure care responsibilities of the site, and establish sufficient financial assurance
to meet those responsibilities. The NPS sees no need to require added financial assurance, in the form of cash or surety
bond guaranteeing payment or performance, where the operator has provided such a bond under regulations at 40 CFR
258.74(b). Nor will the NPS require financial assurance from an owner or operator of a site that is a State entity whose
debts and liabilities are the debts and liabilities of a State. There is also an exception that may apply to mineral
operators under &sect;6.7(c).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NPS will require financial assurance when issuing a permit for a new, or continued operation of an existing, solid
waste disposal site if the operator has not posted a bond under 40 CFR 258.74(b).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section of the rule clarifies that operating a solid waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal site within a unit of the National Park System without a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permit is prohibited. Operating a site in violation of a term or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition of a permit, or in violation of 40 CFR parts 257 or 258, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or in violation of the equivalent State law or regulation is also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prohibited. Violations of these provisions subject operators to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the penalty provisions of 36 CFR 1.3 and/or, where applicable, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revocation of the permit and/or forfeiture of the bond or security 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deposit. These penalties apply to operators on nonfederal lands

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the NPS has prepared an environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment (EA) of these regulations. The EA examines whether the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation of the regulations will be a major Federal action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that would have a significant effect on the quality of the human 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment, requiring the preparation of an environmental impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement. The EA was available for public inspection and comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the National Park Service Office of Environmental Quality, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
located in the Department of Interior Building in Washington, DC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for a period running concurrently with the comment period for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed regulations. The Director of the NPS has signed a Finding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of No Significant Impact (FONSI) declaring the implementation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this regulation not to be a significant Federal action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;511), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the NPS is requested to perform a regulatory flexibility analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for all rules that may have a significant impact on a substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of small entities. The NPS has determined that this action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities since the rule deals with the location of future solid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste disposal sites and the number of existing solid waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal sites is small. Consequently, there is no necessity for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a regulatory flexibility analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under Executive Order 12866. The NPS has reviewed this rule as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directed by Executive Order 12360, ``Government Actions and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interference with Constitutionally Protected Property Rights,'' to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine if this rule has ``policies that have takings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implications.'' The NPS has determined that this rule does not have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
takings implications because the rule will not deny any private 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
property owner all beneficial use of their land, nor will it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significantly reduce their land's value.

(a) The operator of a solid waste disposal site in operation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as of September 1, 1984, within the boundaries of a unit of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National Park System, having been in continuous operation on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
January 23, 1995, and who wishes to remain in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation, must submit to the proper Superintendent for review by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Regional Director, within 180 calendar days of January 23, 1995, a permit request and an environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report as described in &sect;6.4(b) (1)&hyph;(9). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Any operator who fails to submit a request as described in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (a) of this section will not be allowed to continue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations and must immediately fulfill all applicable closure and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
post-closure care requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The Regional Director may approve a request to allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the continued use of a solid waste disposal site only if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator has shown and the Regional Director finds that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Adverse effects resulting from leachate, noise, odor, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicular traffic, litter and other activities upon natural and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(x) Tires; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The proposed closure and post-closure care is sufficient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to protect the resources of the National Park System unit from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
degradation; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The site conforms to all of the restrictions and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria applicable to the site under 40 CFR 257.3 and 40 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part 258, or where applicable, 40 CFR part 240, Guidelines for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thermal Processing of Solid Waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the environmental report do not meet the conditions for approval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, the Regional Director 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall reject the request and notify the proposed operator of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasons for the rejection. Within 90 calendar days of such notice, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the operator of the solid waste disposal site must cease disposing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of solid waste at the site. The operator may resume disposing of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solid waste only upon submission and approval of a permit request 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and environmental report that the Regional Director determines meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the conditions set forth in paragraph (c) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Site expansions. (1) A request for an existing solid waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal site to continue operations by expanding its capacity, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laterally or vertically, is considered a request for a new solid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste disposal site and is subject to the conditions of &sect;6.4(a), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A request for an existing solid waste disposal site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to continue operations by expanding its capacity, laterally or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vertically, will be judged by the approval conditions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (c) of this section if the operator shows that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The solid waste is generated solely from sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the boundaries of the unit; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The area proposed for site expansion encompasses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only nonfederal lands owned or leased by the operator; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) the solid waste disposal site lacks road, rail, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or adequate water access to any lands outside the unit for all or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial portions of the year.

is not described in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section must file with the Regional Director a suitable performance
bond with satisfactory surety, payable to the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary's designee. The bond must
be conditioned upon faithful compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, and the permit requirements as
approved. When bonds are to serve as security, an operator must provide a power of attorney to the Secretary or the Secretary's
designee. The bond must be issued by a surety company listed and approved by the Department of the Treasury. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) In lieu of a performance bond, an operator may deposit with the Secretary or the Secretary's designee cash or negotiable
bonds of the United States Government. The cash deposit or the market value of such securities must be at least equal
to the required sum of the bond(s). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The bond or security deposit will be established by the Regional Director in an amount equal to the estimated cost
to accomplish all closure and post-closure care requirements as described in 40 CFR part 258, subpart F, but in no case
less than $25,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) The responsibility and liability of the operator (and the surety, if any) under the bond or security deposit must
continue until the Regional Director determines that closure and post- closure care have been completed in accordance
with the permit requirements. No portion of the performance bond or security deposit may be released until such a determination
has been made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Within 30 calendar days after the Regional Director determines that all closure and post-closure care requirements
have been successfully completed according to the permit, the Regional Director will notify the operator (and the
surety, if any) that liability under the bond or security deposit has been terminated and the bond or security deposit
released.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 International Package Consignment Service (IPCS) is an international mail service designed for mail order companies
sending merchandise packages to other countries. The service will be available initially to Japan; Canada will be
added as a destination country in the near future. If feasible, other destination countries will be added as customer
needs dictate. To use IPCS, a customer will be required to mail at least 25,000 packages in 1 year to each country to which
it wants to use the service, and to agree to link its information systems with the Postal Service's so that the Postal
Service can extract certain information about the contents of the customer's packages for customs clearance and
other purposes. The implementation of IPCS will benefit U.S. mail order companies and other customers that export
goods by making it easier and less costly to do so; and all other users of the Postal Service by increasing the total contribution
to fixed costs realized by the Postal Service from its international operations. Interim implementing regulations
have been developed and are set forth below for comment and suggested revision prior to adoption in final form.

I. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With the exception of its International Surface Air Lift (ISAL) and International Priority Airmail (IPA) services
for small packets, which have 4-pound weight limits, and VALUEPOST/CANADA service for small packets, which has a
2-pound weight limit, the Postal Service currently does not offer any bulk international service for customers sending
packages containing merchandise to other countries. As a result, if those customers want to accomplish delivery
through the mail, their only option is to use one of the Postal Service's single-piece international services: Air
Parcel Post, Surface Parcel Post, or Express Mail International Service (EMS). These services are available to customers
mailing as little as one package from anywhere in the United States and are designed and priced accordingly. They provide
the features generally desired by household and small business mailers but do not necessarily provide the features
needed by medium- or large-size business mailers that actively solicit customers in other countries and require
a reliable and cost-effective means of sending large volumes of merchandise from the United States to their international
customers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the past few years, many customers that traditionally have used international mail to send merchandise packages
to other countries have sought more convenient and/or less costly delivery methods. This has been especially true
for customers sending packages to Canada, where the combination of relatively cumbersome customs treatment for
U.S.-origin international mail and Canada Post Corporation's practice of encouraging U.S. businesses to freight
their merchandise packages to Canada and enter them as domestic mail has caused the Postal Service's existing services
to appear increasingly unattractive as delivery methods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two factors in particular make customs clearance of U.S.-origin mail in Canada cumbersome for companies sending
merchandise packages. First, the value threshold at which Revenue Canada rates inbound merchandise packages for
duties and taxes is lower than the corresponding threshold used by most other industrialized nations' customs agencies.
Thus, a relatively high proportion of merchandise packages mailed from the United States to Canada are assessed for
duties and taxes. Second, as happens generally with international mail, any duties and taxes that have been assessed
are collected from the addressee at the time of delivery. However, in the case of Canada, Canada Post Corporation charges
the addressee a customs collection fee of $5 Canadian. In contrast, merchandise packages that clear Canadian customs
as freight can be delivered to the addressee completely prepaid, without the need to collect duties, taxes, and fees
at the time of delivery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, customers exporting merchandise to Japan have seen their businesses there detrimentally affected
by the costs they must incur to send merchandise from the United States to Japan. Mail order companies that pass their
delivery costs directly on to their Japanese customers generally are less likely to receive orders as those costs
increase. As a result, even those customers that have continued to use the Postal Service to send merchandise packages
to Japan are continually searching for better and cheaper delivery methods.

Section 403(b)(2) of the Postal Reorganization Act, 39 U.S.C. 403(b)(2), makes it the responsibility of the Postal
Service ``to provide types of mail service to meet the needs of different categories of mail and mail users.'' One of
the most important manifestations of this responsibility in the international area are services that enhance the
ability of U.S. companies to do business in other countries. That can be accomplished both by simplifying the process
those companies use to prepare their packages for mailing and by reducing the costs those companies incur to mail merchandise
to other countries. However, the Postal Service's existing international services for merchandise packages require
those companies to pay the same postage rates as all other customers pay even though very different Postal Service
operations may be involved.

II. International Package Consignment Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Rationale 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order more closely to meet the needs of mail order companies and other customers that send merchandise packages
from the United States to multiple international addressees, the Postal Service is implementing a new international
service, International Package Consignment Service (IPCS). Initially, the service will be available only to Japan.
The Postal Service anticipates offering IPCS to Canada in the near future. To the extent feasible, the Postal Service
will expand the service to include other destination countries in response to requests from customers. In this regard,
the Postal Service specifically requests comments from customers regarding the need for IPCS to destination countries
other than Japan and Canada. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to making it easier and less costly for U.S. mail order companies and other customers to export goods, the
implementation of IPCS will benefit all users of the Postal Service's other services by decreasing the total revenues
that the Postal Service needs to recover from them. Offering IPCS makes all Postal Service customers better off because
the additional business generated not only covers the extra variable costs it causes, but also enables the Postal
Service to recover its fixed costs from a larger base of customers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Qualifying Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A customer that wants to use IPCS will be required to enter into a service agreement with the Postal Service providing
for the following. First, the customer must commit to mail at least 25,000 packages through the service during the
next 12 months to each destination country to which it wants to use IPCS. Second, the customer must designate the Postal
Service as its carrier of choice to each destination country to which it wants to use IPCS. Third, the customer must
agree to link its information systems with the Postal Service's so that (1) the Postal Service and the customer can
exchange data transmissions concerning the customer's packages, and (2) by scanning the customer-provided barcode
on each package, the Postal Service can extract, on an as-needed basis, certain information about the package. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, the information that must be made available to the Postal Service includes: the order number; the package
identification number; the buyer's name and address; the recipient's name and address; the total weight of the package;
the total value of the package; the number of items in the package; and, for each item in the package, its SKU number,
its value, and its country of origin. The exact information required will vary, depending on the destination country
to which the packages are sent. In practice, this requirement means that the customer will have to begin the necessary
systems work by the time it begins using IPCS, and then will have to assist the Postal Service in completing and maintaining
the information systems linkages. The Postal Service will use the extracted information to prepare any necessary
customs forms and package labels, to accept the customer's mail and verify postage payment automatically, and to
provide user-friendly tracking and tracing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to these required commitments, which must appear in all IPCS service agreements, arrangements between
the Postal Service and the customer that are technical in nature also may appear in the IPCS service agreement. For
instance, the service agreement may describe the EDI or proprietary file format that will be used to transmit data
between the customer and the Postal Service, as well as the frequency and schedule of transmissions. Similarly, the
service agreement may describe the formats and frequencies for any exception and performance reports that the Postal
Service will provide to the customer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The IPCS service agreement will not define the basic terms and conditions of the service, or the rates that the customer
will pay. As discussed below, IPCS is not a customized service. All customers that use IPCS will be offered the same
rates and will receive the same delivery services. New regulations in International Mail Manual (IMM) 620 establish
IPCS and make it generally available at published rates.

III. IPCS to Japan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. JFK Processing Facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because of (1) the greater availability of direct air transportation to Japan from JFK International Airport compared
with that available from other airports; (2) the efficiencies created by the Postal Service's being able to process
all IPCS mail to Japan at a single facility designed for that purpose; (3) the efficiencies created by the Postal Service's
being able to dispatch all IPCS mail to Japan from a single facility designed for that purpose; and (4) general operational
and managerial considerations, the Postal Service has determined that all IPCS mail to Japan should be processed
at, and dispatched from, a dedicated facility located at JFK International Airport (the JFK Processing Facility).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the plant at which the customer's packages originate is located within 500 miles of JFK International Airport,
the Postal Service will accept the packages at the plant and transport them by truck to the JFK Processing Facility
according to a schedule agreed upon by the Postal Service and the customer. If the customer's plant is located more
than 500 miles from JFK International Airport, the customer will be required to present the packages to the Postal
Service for verification at the plant and transport them as a drop shipment to the JFK Processing Facility according
to a schedule agreed upon by the Postal Service and the customer. The Postal Service is imposing this requirement because
the IPCS customer will be in a better position than the Postal Service to arrange for cost-effective air or long-haul
surface transportation that meets the customer's package preparation schedule and other operational requirements.
Although the Postal Service initially will require all IPCS mail to Japan to be brought to the JFK Processing Facility,
the Postal Service specifically requests comments from customers regarding the need for an additional processing
site in another part of the country, such as the Seattle or San Francisco metropolitan areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Customs Forms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Packages mailed to Japan through IPCS will not be required to bear customs forms when they are tendered to the Postal
Service. After scanning the customer-printed barcode on each package and correlating it with the package-specific
information transmitted by the customer, the Postal Service will print the necessary customs forms and then affix
them to the customer's packages as part of the processing operation at the JFK Processing Facility. However, during
the interim period in which the Postal Service and the customer are working together to establish the information
systems linkages to enable the Postal Service to accomplish this, the customer will be required to prepare the necessary
customs forms on its own and affix the forms to the packages before tendering them to the Postal Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Delivery Options 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Within the framework of IPCS to Japan, the Postal Service will offer three delivery options: Express Service, Standard
Air Service, and Economy Air Service. While the weight limit for Express Service and Standard Air Service packages
will be 44 pounds, the weight limit for Economy Air Service packages will be 4 pounds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Express Service will be the fastest option and will provide tracking and tracing and insurance at no additional cost.
The Postal Service will transport Express Service packages to Japan by air, where they will receive special handling
by Japan Post and expedited delivery. Each package sent by this option must bear a label identifying it as an Express
Service package (Label 11&hyph;B, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Express Mail Service Post Office to Addressee, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
or an alternative label acceptable to Japan Post). Before or after scanning the customer-printed barcode on each
package and correlating it with the package-specific information transmitted by the customer, the Postal Service
will prepare the necessary labels and affix them to the customer's Express Service packages as part of the processing
operation at the JFK Processing Facility. However, during the interim period in which the Postal Service and the customer
are working together to establish the information systems linkages to enable the Postal Service to accomplish this,
the customer will be able to use Express Service by preparing the necessary labels on its own and affixing the labels
to the packages before tendering them to the Postal Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standard Air Service will be the next fastest delivery option and will provide confirmation of dispatch from the United
States.

The base rates for the three delivery options are set forth below. The base rates may be reduced by any or all of four additive
annual discounts depending on how many packages the customer mails to Japan through IPCS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For each delivery option, the Postal Service will charge the base rates, at 1-pound increments, for the first 100,000
packages mailed by the customer during the 12-month period. Once the customer has mailed 100,000 packages, postage
for the customer's next 150,000 packages will be reduced by 4.75% from the base rates. Packages mailed through any
of the three delivery options will count toward the customer's meeting the 100,000-package threshold. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Once the customer has mailed 250,000 packages during the 12-month period, postage for the customer's next 250,000
packages will be reduced by an additional 5.75% taking into account the first discount. That is, postage will be calculated
for these 150,000 packages by calculating postage at the base rates, then reducing it by 4.75%, and then reducing that
total by a further 5.75%. Again, packages mailed through any of the three delivery options will count toward the customer's
meeting the 250,000-package threshold.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Once the customer has mailed 500,000 packages during the 12-month period, postage for the customer's next 500,000
packages will be reduced by an additional 6.00% taking into account the first two discounts. That is, postage will
be calculated for these 500,000 packages by calculating postage at the base rates, then reducing it by 4.75%, then
reducing that total by a further 5.75%, and then reducing that total by a further 6.00%. Again, packages mailed through

Once the customer has mailed 1,000,000 packages during the 12-month period, postage for the customer's remaining
packages will be reduced by an additional 6.25% taking into account the first three discounts. That is, postage will
be calculated for the remaining packages by calculating postage at the base rates, then reducing it by 4.75%, then
reducing that total by a further 5.75%, then reducing that total by a further 6.00%, and then reducing that total by
6.25%. Again, packages mailed through any of the three delivery options will count toward the customer's meeting

IV. Legal Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
On May 16, 1994, the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware ruled against the Postal Service in the case of

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
UPS Worldwide Forwarding, Inc. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
v. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
U.S. Postal Service 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and enjoined it from offering International Customized Mail (ICM) service. ICM was a new service in which the Postal
Service negotiated service features and rates with qualifying customers that entered into service agreements.
To qualify for ICM service, a customer had to be capable of annually tendering to the Postal Service at least 1 million
pounds of international mail or paying at least $2 million in international postage, and of tendering all of its mail
to the Postal Service at one location. ICM enabled the Postal Service to provide customer-specific service offerings
at rates that reflected the specific costs incurred in providing the service. Rates and services in any ICM service
agreement were available to any customer qualifying for the service that sent mail with similar characteristics
and that undertook the same preparation and work-sharing specified in the service agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The District Court first held that UPS, as a competitor of the Postal Service, had standing to challenge ICM service
even though it did not allege that ICM rates were predatory. The District Court then concluded that ICM rates violated
section 403(b)(2) of the Postal Reorganization Act (Act), 39 U.S.C. 403(b)(2), because ICM agreements were with
individual mailers and section 403(b)(2) limits the Postal Service to providing services and establishing rates
for categories of mail and mailers consisting of more than one mailer. The District Court then concluded that ICM rates
were unduly discriminatory because a mailer had to be capable of posting 1 million pounds of mail or paying $2 million
annually in postage to be eligible for the service, but did not have to tender those minimum volumes to the Postal Service
to receive ICM service. Under those circumstances, the Court concluded, different mailers could be paying different
rates for similar mail and mail services. The District Court then concluded that ICM rates inequitably apportioned
the costs of postal services because smaller mailers that could meet the minimum capabilities requirements did not
have access to ICM rates even if they mailed similar quantities of mail. Finally, the District Court concluded that
ICM rates were illegal because under section 407 of the Act, 39 U.S.C. 407, the Postal Service had to obtain the consent
of the President to establish international rates, and the Postal Service had not obtained Presidential consent
for ICM rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Postal Service is appealing the District Court's decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, and
is confident that it will prevail on appeal. Notwithstanding the appeal, however, the Postal Service recognizes
that it is obligated to comply with the terms of the District Court's injunction as long as it is in effect, and that IPCS
may be challenged under the same legal theories that UPS used to challenge ICM service. Consequently, when designing
IPCS, the Postal Service avoided those features of ICM service that the District Court found to be inconsistent with
the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, IPCS will be available, under the same terms and conditions and at the same rates, to any customer that can meet
the qualifying criteria. All customers that use IPCS to mail packages to a particular country will receive the same
delivery services. Further, all IPCS customers will pay the same base rates and will be able to take advantage of the
same volume discounts. Thus, all customers using IPCS to Japan, even those that eventually mail 500,000 or more packages
during a 12-month period, will pay the same rates for their first 100,000 packages. Similarly, all customers will
pay the same rates for their next 150,000 packages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the volume-based qualifying criteria will be based on the actual number of packages that the customer will
tender, not on the customer's potential volume. In selecting 25,000 packages per 12 months per country as the qualifying
threshold, the Postal Service struck a balance between its desire to provide the service to as many customers as practicable
and its need to be able to recover the costs associated with providing the service, including the costs of establishing
the necessary information system linkages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of the foregoing, the implementation of IPCS is fully consistent not only with the provisions of the Act that
govern international rates and services, but also with the District Court's decision in

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Accordingly, the Postal Service hereby adopts IPCS to Japan, on an interim basis, at the rates set forth in the schedule
above. Although 39 U.S.C. 407 does not require advance notice and opportunity for submission of comments, and the
Postal Service is exempted by 39 U.S.C. 410(a) from the advance notice requirements of the Administrative Procedure
Act regarding proposed rulemaking (5 U.S.C. 553), the Postal Service invites interested persons to submit written
data, views, or arguments concerning the interim rule.

the necessary customs forms based on the package-specific information transmitted by the mailer, and affixes them
to the packages. However, during the interim period in which the Postal Service and the mailer are establishing the
information systems linkages to enable the Postal Service to accomplish this, the mailer is required to affix the
appropriate customs forms to the packages, as follows:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule amends Domestic Mail Manual (DMM) standards concerning the maximum weight of an automation-compatible
barcoded letter-size mailpiece. Subject to additional preparation requirements, certain barcoded mailpieces
weighing more than 3 ounces will be acceptable at Barcoded rates for a trial period of up to 1 year.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On July 14, 1994, the Postal Service published for public comment in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 35873&hyph;35875) a proposed rule to amend the Domestic Mail Manual (DMM) standards for the physical characteristics
of automation-compatible barcoded letter-size mail. For a period of up to 1 year, the Postal Service proposed to conduct
a live test of barcoded bulk third-class regular rate letter mail weighing between 3.0 and 3.3067 ounces, and First-,
second-, and bulk third-class nonprofit rate letter mail weighing between 3.0 and 3.3363 ounces.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the Postal Service believes that this mail can benefit from barcoding (as the means of moving this mail into
an automated processing environment), it also believes that this benefit can be achieved only under specific standards
governing the construction and preparation of this ``heavy letter mail.'' Thus, the proposed new standards required
that each ``heavy letter'' mailpiece comply with the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Be part of a mailing that is 100 percent delivery point barcoded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Have the barcode in the address block. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Be in an envelope that has no open windows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Not be bound or have stiff enclosures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Postal Service proposed to set the maximum weight for Barcoded rate letter-size mailpieces at 3.3363 ounces (or
3.3067 ounces for pieces mailed at regular bulk third-class rates), the break points between the bulk third-class
minimum per-piece rates and the two-part piece/pound rates then in effect. (These values increase to 3.3376 and 3.3071
ounces, respectively, when R94 rates are implemented on January 1, 1995. The increased values are used in the text
and DMM revisions appearing below.) If the maximum weight were set at 3.3 ounces, a small amount of letter-size minimum
per-piece mail would be excluded from the rates otherwise available to letter mail. For simplicity and consistency,
the maximum weight for First- and second-class barcoded letter mail was also proposed to be set at 3.3376 ounces. For
regular bulk third-class rate only, the maximum is set at 3.3071 ounces, which is its ``break point.'' If the proposed
test or changes in the ``break point'' indicate that this alignment is not in the best interest of the Postal Service,
the maximum weight will be adjusted accordingly.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Postal Service received 14 comments on the proposed rule, including three from mailing industry trade associations,
one from a mailing-related business, and 10 from companies and corporations. The specific topics covered in those
comments are discussed below.

Consideration of Letter Mail Heavier Than 3.0 Ounces for Automation Rates

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All 14 commenters expressed support for the Postal Service's efforts to conduct live tests of barcoded letters weighing
between 3.0 and 3.3376 ounces (or 3.3071 ounces for third-class regular rate mail). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter encouraged consideration for a much higher weight limit. The Postal Service believes that for the heavy
letter-mail test period, the maximum weight should be limited to 3.3376 ounces. Previous controlled tests conducted
by the Postal Service revealed that increased problems (such as damage, jams, and throughput) arose or worsened with
mail heavier than 3.3376 ounces. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter (a mailing company) supported the Postal Service's effort but expressed doubts that presort service
bureaus would accept address-block barcoded heavy letter mail to run through their automated equipment because
of possible machine jams, lowered machine throughput, and the requirement for 100 percent delivery point barcoding.
Participation in this test is voluntary. Although the Postal Service realizes that some companies will be unable
to participate, it does not believe that the objectives of the test can be served if the test criteria are altered. The
Postal Service believes that it will be able, under the requirements adopted by this rule, to obtain sufficient participation
to conduct a valid test.

Requirement for Enveloped Mailpieces

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two comments were received opposing the proposed standard that all heavy letter mail be in envelopes. One commenter
thought that the heavy letter mail tests should be conducted using mailpieces constructed under current standards
and encouraged the use of tabbed catalogs during the trial period. One commenter recommended the inclusion of self-mailers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Postal Service believes that only enveloped mail should be tested as part of this trial and that the proposed restriction
on self-mailers and on bound or booklet-type mail should remain. The preliminary tests were performed only on enveloped
mailpieces that were heavier than 3.0 ounces and not on tabbed catalogs. The Postal Service has recently tested tabbed
catalogs weighing 3.3 ounces on its automated equipment and found that such pieces caused equipment jams and were
more susceptible to damage. As a result, the Postal Service believes that it is prudent to proceed to test only enveloped
mail. Accordingly, that portion of the proposed rule that specified only enveloped mail would be eligible for the
test will be retained in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In allowing only enveloped mail in the proposed test, the Postal Service is seeking to evaluate the performance of
heavy letter mail having the best opportunity for successful automated processing, insofar as that can be predicted
by physical criteria. Accordingly, in addition to retaining its focus on enveloped mail, the Postal Service also
wishes to point out that by including heavy letter mail in the general category of automation-compatible mail for
the test period, it is expecting that this mail will be prepared in trays, as is currently the case for other automation-compatible
letter mail. Although the proposed rule did not explicitly discuss this point, the Postal Service finds it appropriate
to emphasize this point in the final rule as a logical corollary to the temporary transfer of heavy letter mail into
the automation-compatible category.

Four comments were received opposing the standard that heavy letter mail not be in envelopes with open windows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Postal Service has conducted tests in which preliminary results indicate that open windows on mailpieces above
3.0 ounces have a greater tendency to snag on automated processing equipment. The Postal Service is also concerned
about damage to the heavy letter mailpieces with open windows and other mail that might be adjacent to it during automated
processing. Thus, the Postal Service has determined to retain the proposed prohibition of open-windowed envelopes
in the final rule.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Nine comments were received opposing the standard that mailings of heavy letter pieces be 100 percent delivery point
barcoded. Eight commenters stated that 100 percent delivery point barcoding would discourage or inhibit them from
participating in the test and requested that barcoding levels be set at the 85 percent level now generally applicable
to Barcoded rate letter mailings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seven commenters stated that 100 percent delivery point barcoding would require splitting their mailings into two
streams_one delivery point barcoded stream and one not. Several commenters stated that splitting the mail into two
such streams would negate the benefits of the automation rate. One commenter stated that his company already splits
the mail into two streams and meets the 100 percent requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four commenters stated that no major mailer today has been able to ZIP+4 code 100 percent of its mailing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Postal Service believes that the requirement for 100 percent delivery point barcoding of all heavy letter mail
is necessary. As part of an effort to get a barcode on all mail, the Postal Service routinely processes on an optical
character reader (OCR) all mailpieces rejected from barcode sorters in an effort to read the delivery address and
print a barcode in the lower right corner of the mailpiece. However, heavy letter mail will not run through OCRs; attempts
to process and barcode such mail on an OCR revealed that significant damage occurred to the heavy letter pieces and
that any barcodes printed in the barcode clear zone by the OCR were often unreadable. (The increased thickness caused
the bottom edges of the heavy letter mail envelopes to be rounded and to buckle when bent. Because of the curvature and
irregular surface created by the rounding and buckling of the heavy mailpiece, barcodes printed in the lower right
corner of such mailpieces by the OCR were outside the working specifications of postal barcode readers and, as a result,
useless for automated processing.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The additional OCR processing of non-delivery point barcoded heavy letter mail, the labor to repair damaged pieces,
and the ensuing manual or mechanized handling of that mail amount to unreasonable additional costs for the Postal
Service, well beyond that appropriate for Barcoded rate mail. As a result, the proposed rule's provisions for a 100
percent delivery point barcoded mailstream for heavy letter mail will be retained in the final rule.

Follow Current Postal Requirements for Heavy Letter Mail 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Six commenters stated that the heavy letter mail trial period should be run using the current standards for automation
rate mail and that no additional constraints should be imposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Postal Service believes that modification of the current standards for automation-compatible mail are necessary
based on the results of controlled tests already performed on heavy letter mail as previously described. If appropriate
additional standards are not imposed on heavy letter mail, consistent with the results of earlier tests, the Postal
Service believes that live mail testing will have no chance for success and that greater customer dissatisfaction
would result than may occur with the heavy letter mail standards adopted by this rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The section referred to by the commenter applies only to lower right corner barcode windows. The Postal Service does
not intend to add new standards to DMM C840.6.0, only to limit the use of lower right corner barcode windows to mailpieces
weighing 3.0 ounces or less.

Requirements for Identification of Test Mail 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before the Postal Service can determine whether a permanent increase in the maximum weight for barcoded letter mail
is appropriate, it must determine whether the impact of heavy letter mail is acceptable. Accurate evaluation of the
test data will depend in part on the Postal Service's ability to identify, measure, and monitor heavy letter mail as
it enters and moves through the mailstream. Accordingly, test participants will be required to take specific measures
to identify heavy letter mail to enable the Postal Service to gather the necessary data for this test. Although not
specifically discussed in the proposed rule, the importance of mail identification became evident as the comments
were being reviewed, and provisions requiring identification are being introduced in the final rule as reasonable
and logical elements of the test process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, the Postal Service will require that each container of heavy mail be clearly identified when submitted
by the mailer. Pallets, general purpose mail containers, and other similar equipment used to transport trays of heavy
letter mail will require labels (placards) bearing the words ``HEAVY LETTER MAIL'' in letters not less than 1/2 inch
high. These labels must be white or light-colored stock, not smaller than 8 by 11 inches, and placed on two adjacent
sides of the pallet or other equipment. Each tray of heavy letter mail must also be identified by a flag (similar to a
separator card) clearly marked ``HEAVY LETTER MAIL'' and placed in front of the contents of the tray. No marking will
be required on the pieces of heavy letter mail themselves other than as required by the class or rate claimed, or by the
postage payment method used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Participants in the heavy letter mail test will also be asked to provide documentation for any heavy letter mailing
exceeding 100,000 pieces. Requested information includes the mailer's name and contact person for test information,
the mailing's contents (size, weight, volume, level of presort, and proportion of heavy letter mail), and the mailing's
distribution (place(s) of mailing and destination ZIP Code ranges). This information, which should be provided
to the address below at least 3 weeks before mailing, will allow the Postal Service adequate time to conduct on-site
evaluation and data collection for test mail. Documentation of heavy letter mailings should be addressed to:

pieces before delivery (by completing Form 1509) to allow their examination for evaluation of both the cause of the
damage and possible remedies for that cause.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On December 31, 1985, June 29, 1988, and August 19, 1992, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources
(PADER) formally submitted amendments to 25 Pa Code Chapter 121_General Provisions and Chapter 129_Standards for
VOC as SIP revisions. These revisions were submitted by PADER to correct existing deficiencies in its VOC regulations
and to control emissions as part of the Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) Fix-up requirement of Section
182 of the CAA. Specifically, this document approves the addition of &sect;129.72_Manufacture of Sulfonates (Surface
Active Agents) and &sect;129.71_Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing Industry Equipment (SOCMI) Leaks into
the PADER SIP submitted on December 31, 1985 and June 29, 1988, as well as amendments to the following section of 25 PA
Code &sect;121.4_Regional Organization of the Department; &sect;129.51 General_VOC Recordkeeping Requirements;
&sect;129.52_Surface Coating; &sect;129.62_General Standards for Bulk Gasoline Terminals, Bulk Gasoline Plants
and Small Gasoline Storage Tanks; &sect;129.66_Compliance Schedules and Final Compliance Dates; &sect;129.67_Graphic
Arts; and &sect;129.69_Pneumatic Rubber Tire Manufacturing; &sect;129.72_Manufacture of Sulfonates (Surface
Active Agents) and &sect;129.71_Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing Industry (SOCMI) Equipment Leaks contained
in the August 19, 1992 submittal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The December 31, 1985 and June 29, 1988 submittals also included a request that EPA approve the addition of the Commonwealth's
wood cabinet and wood furniture finishing rule into the Pennsylvania's SIP. That regulation is the subject of a separate
rulemaking document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 26, 1988, EPA issued a SIP call letter to Pennsylvania notifying the Commonwealth that its SIP was substantially
inadequate to achieve the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone. In a June 14, 1988 follow-up letter,
EPA notified PADER of deficiencies in its existing VOC regulations which needed to be corrected in order to make the
regulations consistent with EPA policy and guidance. A SIP call letter is a finding made by EPA that the SIP does not
provide for attainment by the required date, (section 110(a)(2)(H) of the Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)(H);
42 U.S.C. 7410(A)(K)(5)). EPA's review of this material indicates that PADER has addressed the deficiencies pertaining
to the correction of State VOC regulations required by section 182(a)(2)(A) and section 184(b) of the Act, as amended
in 1990.

Section 129.51_General 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 129.51(d) was amended to add general recordkeeping requirements for regulated sources of VOCs subject to
the emission limitations and control requirements in Chapter 129. Section 129.51 requires the owner or operator
of a facility or source to keep records to demonstrate compliance with the applicable limitation or control requirement.
Those records are to provide sufficient data and calculations which clearly demonstrate that the emission limitations
or control requirements are met. The data or information required to determine compliance with the applicable limitation
are to be recorded and maintained in a timeframe consistent with the averaging period of the standard. The records
are to be retained at least two years and made available to PADER on request. A facility or source which claims exemption
from the emission limitations and control requirements is to maintain records adequate to demonstrate that the facilities
and sources are entitled to the exemption.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 129.52(a) was changed to expand the applicability of the surface coating requirements to statewide for facilities
with emissions greater than 2.7 tons/yr., 15 lbs/day, or 3 lbs/hr. before controls.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subsection (c) specifies that a person may not allow a gasoline tank truck subject to &sect;129.59_Bulk Gasoline
Terminals, &sect;129.60_Bulk Gasoline Plants or &sect;129.61_Small Gasoline Storage Tank Control to be filled
or emptied statewide unless the gasoline tank truck meets the requirement below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The word ``annual'' was deleted from subsection (c)(1) to add ``12 months.'' The gasoline tank truck leak check requirement
was revised to clarify the annual gasoline tank truck leak check requirement to add that the owner or operator subject
to the requirements of &sect;129.62(c) may not allow a tank to be filled or emptied statewide unless the gasoline tank
truck has been tested by the owner or operator within the immediately preceding 12 months in accordance to the applicable
test method and procedure in &sect;139.14_Emissions of VOCs.

Section 129.66_Compliance Schedules and Final Compliance Dates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This regulation adds a one year compliance interval for existing sources newly subject to the requirements of &sect;129.52,
&sect;&sect;129.59&hyph;129.61, &sect;&sect;129.67&hyph;129.69 as a result of the revised applicability requirements,
and to the newly affected pneumatic rubber manufacturing facilities and surface coating processes subject to the
emission standards. Newly subject sources or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities are those existing sources which were not previously subject to the emission limitations because they
emitted less than the cutoff levels or operated at de minimis production levels prior to the date of publication of
the limitation in the Pennsylvania Bulletin, but are now subject to the standard because they meet or exceed the cutoff
levels; compliance shall be achieved by May 23, 1993. Section 129.68_Manufacture of Synthesized Pharmaceutical
Products was deleted from this section because the compliance schedule (August 3, 1992) for this source category
was the subject of a separate rulemaking.

Section 129.67_Graphic Arts Systems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 129.67(e) establishes a requirement that the emissions of VOCs used in clean-up operations shall be summed
with emissions from surface coating and printing to determine the applicability of the graphic arts regulatory requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 129.69_Manufacture of Pneumatic Rubber Tires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The VOC control requirements in Section 129.69(a) are revised to delete the 5,000 tire/day exemption level, add the
definitions of pneumatic rubber tire manufacture and passenger type tire, specify minimum control requirements
for tire manufacturing, and allow an affected tire manufacturer to petition for approval of an alternative RACT control
program. Such an alternative must be approved by PADER and EPA as a SIP revision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pneumatic rubber tire manufacturing is defined as the production of pneumatic rubber passenger-type on a mass production
basis, and passenger-type tires are agricultural, airplane, industrial, mobile home, light or medium duty truck
or passenger vehicle tires with bead diameters up to 20 inches (50.8 centimeters) and cross-sectional dimensions
up to 12.8 inches (32.5 centimeters). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, this section adds that the production of specialty tires for antique or other vehicles, when produced
on an irregular basis or with short production runs and when produced on equipment separate from normal production
lines for passenger-type tires, are exempt from the requirements of this section upon written approval from PADER.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsection (b)(1) clarifies the requirement that the owner or operator of an undertread cementing, tread-end cementing
or bead dipping operation subject to this section shall install and operate a capture system designed to achieve maximum
reasonable capture of at least 85% by weight of VOC emitted, from all undertread cementing, tread-end cementing and
bead dipping operations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsection (d) deletes the 0.161 pound per tire emission limit, and adds the requirement that as an alternative to
meeting the specified control level, an affected facility may develop and implement an alternative RACT control
program if the program is approved by the PADER and EPA as a SIP revision.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 129.71(a) applies to surface active agent manufacturing facilities subject to &sect;129.72 (relating
to manufacturing of surface active agents) and to facilities with design capability to manufacture 1,000 tons per
year (tpy) or more of one or a combination of synthetic organic chemicals listed in 40 CFR 60.489 (relating to list of
chemicals provided by affected facilities), Methyl tert-butyl ether, polyethylene, polypropylene, or polystyrene.
The previous 4,000 tpy applicability level was deleted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsection (c) requires the owner or operator of a newly affected facility to complete, develop and initiate a leak
detection program including liquid leaks for pumps, valves, compressors, vessels, and safety pressure relief valves
and a repair program for these components that cause a hydrocarbon detection instrument reading equal to or greater
than 10,000 ppm not later than May 23, 1993. The leak detection and repair program shall include the following: a leak
check during every quarter of all components, by methods referenced in &sect;139.14; a waterproof identification
tag is to be attached to the leaking component (that is causing the instrument to read greater than 10,000 ppm) with
the identification number and the date which the leak was detected in a visible area; the repair and retest of a leaking
component must be done within 15 days from the date of detection; and the identification tag must indicate if the component
cannot be repaired until a process shutdown that will not occur within 15 days from the date of detection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsection (2)(iv) was revised to require a weekly visual check of all pumps in light liquid service for indications
of leaks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fugitive emission leak check requirements in &sect;139.14 (relating to emissions of VOCs) were separated from
subsection (2)(iv) and added as a new subsection, (2)(v). This new subsection specifies that safety relief valves
are subject to the requirements for rechecking within 24 hours. The requirements for the recordkeeping and reporting
of the leak detection and repair program were separated from subsection (2)(iv) and added as a new subsection, (2)(vi).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 129.72 requires a leak detection program (see &sect;129.71 synthetic organic chemical and polymer manufacturing
fugitive sources). Subsection (b) of this section was amended to clarify the emission control system efficiency
requirements for surface active agent manufacturing facilities with potential VOC emissions of greater than 100
tpy. Emission of VOCs in ambient air from solvent wash tanks, reaction vessels, separators, distillation processes,
solvent trippers and solvent storage tanks may not be caused or permitted by any person unless the emissions are exhausted
through an emission reduction system which is designed and operated to recover or destroy at least 90% by weight of
the VOC emissions exhausted to the emission reduction system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is approving this SIP revision without prior publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking because the Agency
views this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. However, in a separate document
in this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 publication, EPA is proposing to approve the SIP revision should adverse or critical comments be filed. This action
will be effective February 21, 1995, unless, within 30 days of publication, adverse or critical comments are received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If EPA receives such comments, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing a document that
will withdraw the final action. All public comments received will then be addressed in a subsequent final rule based
on this action serving as a proposed rule. EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties
interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. If no such comments are received, the public is advised
that this action will be effective on February 21, 1995.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is approving the addition of and revision to Pennsylvania's SIP to control VOCs from &sect;129.52 - surface coating,
&sect;129.69 - pneumatic rubber tire manufacturing, &sect;129.67 - graphic arts and &sect;129.72 - synthetic organic
chemical manufacturing industry equipment leaks which were submitted to EPA on December 31, 1985, June 29, 1988 and
August 19, 1992. These revisions meet part of the RACT Fix-up requirement of the Act, as amended.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.

EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, Part D of the Clean Air Act do not create any new requirements but simply
approve requirements that the Commonwealth is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does
not impose any new requirements, the Administrator certifies that it does not have a significant impact on any small
entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation of a
flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Clean
Air Act forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

.) requires a ban on the importation of commercial fish or products from fish that have been caught with commercial
fishing technology which results in the incidental kill or serious injury of marine mammals in excess of U.S. standards.
In the case of yellowfin tuna harvested by purse seine in the ETP, the MMPA requires a ban unless the harvesting nation
has a program and performance that is comparable in its level of marine mammal protection to that of the United States.
The regulatory program of the harvesting nation must include, among other things, such prohibitions against encircling
certain schools of dolphin, conducting sundown sets, and other activities as are applicable to U.S. vessels under
the marine mammal program of the United States (16 U.S.C. 1371(a)(2)(B)(I)). MMPA regulations require that harvesting
nations implement marine mammal protection requirements within 180 days of the date that such requirements are placed
on U.S. vessels (50 CFR 216.24(e)(5)(v)(B)).

Earth Island Institute v. Brown

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, No. C 88&hyph;1380 TEH, enjoined NMFS, effective immediately, from permitting any incidental taking of any northeastern
offshore spotted dolphin in the ETP, and required that NMFS include this prohibition in the comparability requirements
for foreign nations. On February 1, 1994, NMFS notified U.S. vessels fishing under the general permit issued to the
American Tunaboat Association (ATA general permit) that all sets on the northeastern stock of offshore spotted dolphin
were prohibited due to the stock's recently determined status as depleted under the MMPA. On February 4, 1994, NMFS
further advised those vessels that the take of all offshore spotted dolphin was prohibited immediately under the
provisions of the January 27, 1994, order requiring NMFS to minimize the take of northeastern offshore spotted dolphin.
On February 8, NMFS, in order to ensure that the aggregate dolphin mortality quota mandated by the International Dolphin
Conservation Act was not exceeded, prohibited the taking of any additional dolphin, regardless of species or stock,
under the ATA general permit, thus closing the fishery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On February 22, 1994, NMFS published a notice in the

 (59 FR 8417) of the January 27, 1994, court order, and of the February 1, 4, and 8, 1994, NMFS actions discussed above.
The prohibition on the take of any of the northeastern stock of offshore spotted dolphin has been incorporated as a
new element in the marine mammal program of the United States. On August 24, 1994, with a subsequent technical correction
on September 19, 1994, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California amended its order of January
27, 1994, and specified that its prohibition applied only in the area from 40

As of September 28, 1994, NMFS had not received documentary evidence from Colombia or from the Republic of Vanuatu
that either nation has incorporated into its marine mammal protection program a prohibition on encircling with a
purse seine net any school in which a northeastern offshore spotted dolphin is observed. Therefore, because the 180-day
period allowed for a foreign nation to adopt a comparable prohibition expired on July 26, 1994, in adherence to the
regulations and court orders cited above, NMFS on September 28, 1994, notified the U.S. Customs Service, and here
announces, an immediate ban on imports of yellowfin tuna harvested in the ETP by purse seine vessels of Columbia and
the Republic of Vanuatu.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The domestic and foreign groundfish fisheries in the exclusive economic zone of the GOA are managed by NMFS according
to the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska (FMP). The FMP was prepared by the North Pacific
Fishery Management Council (Council) under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act.
The FMP is implemented by regulations for the foreign fishery at 50 CFR part 611 and for the U.S. fisheries at 50 CFR parts
672, 676, and 677. General regulations that also pertain to the U.S. fisheries appear at 50 CFR part 620. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action provides certain specifications for the 1995 fishing year on a preliminary or interim basis, including:
(1) Specifications of total allowable catch (TAC) for each groundfish target species category in the GOA and apportionments
thereof among domestic annual processing (DAP), joint venture processing (JVP), total allowable level of foreign
fishing (TALFF), and reserves; (2) apportionments of reserves to DAP; (3) apportionments of the sablefish TAC to
vessels using hook-and-line and trawl gear; (4) apportionments of pollock TAC; (5) apportionments of Pacific cod
TAC; (6) ``other species'' TAC; (7) halibut prohibited species catch (PSC) limits; (8) seasonal allocations of the
halibut PSC limits, (9) interim groundfish harvest specifications, (10) the opening date of the directed fishery
for sablefish for hook-and-line gear, and (11) closures to directed fishing. A discussion of each of these measures
follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Proposed Establishment of TACs and Apportionments Thereof Among Domestic Annual Processing (DAP), Joint Venture
Processing (JVP), Total Allowable Level of Foreign Fishing (TALFF), and Reserves 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under &sect;672.20(c)(1)(ii), NMFS, after consultation with the Council, publishes in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 preliminary specifications of annual TACs and interim harvest limits. These preliminary specifications indicate
apportionments of TACs among DAP, JVP, reserves, and TALFF for each target species and the ``other species'' category.
The sum of the TACs for all species must fall within the combined optimum yield (OY) range, of 116,000&hyph;800,000
metric tons (mt), established for these species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Species TACs are apportioned initially among DAP, JVP, TALFF, and reserves under &sect;&sect;611.92(c)(1) and
672.20(a)(2). DAP amounts are intended for harvest by U.S. fishermen for delivery and sale to U.S. processors. JVP
amounts are intended for joint ventures in which U.S. fishermen deliver their catches to foreign processors at sea.
TALFF amounts are intended for harvest by foreign fishermen. Existing harvesting and processing capacity of the
U.S. industry is capable of utilizing the entire 1995 TAC specification for GOA groundfish. Therefore, the Council
recommended that DAP equal TAC for each species category, resulting in no proposed amounts of TALFF or JVP for the 1995
fishing year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reserves for the GOA are 20 percent of the TACs for pollock, Pacific cod, flatfish target species categories, and
``other species.'' Given that the GOA groundfish TACs have been utilized fully by DAP since 1987, NMFS has reapportioned
all the reserves to DAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council met from September 28 to October 5, 1994, to review scientific information concerning groundfish stocks.
The preliminary SAFE Report, dated September 1994, prepared and presented to the Council by the GOA Plan Team (Plan
Team), summarizes the best available scientific information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The September 1994 SAFE Report contains revised stock assessments for all species except sablefish and demersal
shelf rockfish (DSR). New assessments for these two species are discussed in the final SAFE Report issued in November.
New stock assessment models were used in the assessments for Pacific cod, arrowtooth flounder, and thornyhead rockfish.
Additional information, based on 1993 trawl surveys, was presented for pollock, slope rockfish, Pacific ocean perch
(POP), pelagic shelf rockfish, and the flatfish groups. Details of the assessments can be found in the September 1994
SAFE Report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total ABC amount recommended by the SSC and accepted by the Council was a range from 481,090 &hyph; 533,690 mt. The
range accounted for the recommended ABC range in the Pacific cod stock. The total TAC amount recommended by the Advisory
Panel (AP) was 326,515 mt. The AP recommended a 1995 TAC equal to the 1995 ABCs, as recommended by the SSC, for pollock,
rex sole, sablefish, shortraker/rougheye, other rockfish, northern rockfish, pelagic shelf rockfish, DSR, and
thornyhead rockfish. The AP recommendation for a 1995 TAC for Pacific cod was equal to the upper end of the range (103,000
mt) recommended by the SSC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council considered information in the SAFE Report, recommendations from its SSC and its AP, as well as public testimony.
The Council then accepted the ABCs as recommended by the SSC and, with the exception of ``other rockfish,'' the TACs
as recommended by the AP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council chose a TAC range for ``other rockfish'' that ranged from the 1994 TAC amount of 2,235 mt to the 1995 ABC amount
of 6,930 mt. This range was recommended to recognize the need for conservative management of this group. However,
NMFS must manage the fisheries based on a single TAC amount, rather than on a range of numbers. NMFS has chosen to propose
a TAC of 6,930 mt, which is the number proposed by the AP and is the ABC that was recommended from the 1994 stock assessment.
Even though this number will be used to establish the 1995 interim TAC until the final specifications are implemented,
no practical difference exists in choosing any number within the Council's recommended TAC range. The hook-and-line
fisheries typically do not harvest other rockfish and the trawl fisheries for rockfish do not open until July 1, by
which time the final specifications will be published. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS also revises the Council's recommendation for the 1995 flathead sole TAC. The Council approved the AP recommendation
of adopting the 1994 TAC amounts for flathead sole for the 1995 TAC amounts. In the GOA Eastern Regulatory Area, the
1994 TAC amount (3,000 mt) is higher than the Council's recommended 1995 ABC (2,740 mt). To maintain consistency with
the accepted policy of setting TACs lower than or equal to ABC amounts, NMFS is proposing to establish a 1995 TAC of 2,740
mt for the Eastern Regulatory Area. This number is equal to the 1995 ABC recommended by the Plan Team and the SSC and approved
by the Council. Adjustment of the flathead sole TAC in the Eastern Regulatory Area changes the total 1995 flathead
sole TAC to 9,740 mt. This also results in a revised ``other species'' TAC amount of 15,535 mt and a revised 1995 total
GOA TAC of 326,242 mt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1995 ABCs, TACs and interim TACs, as well as the ABC and TAC apportionments, are shown in Table 1.

2. Preliminary Apportionment of Reserves to DAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulations implementing the FMP require 20 percent of each TAC for pollock, Pacific cod, flatfish species, and the
``other species'' category be set aside in reserves for possible apportionment at a later date (&sect;672.20(a)(2)(ii)).
Consistent with &sect;672.20(a)(2)(iii), NMFS is preliminarily apportioning the 1995 reserves for each of the
four species categories to DAP, anticipating that domestic harvesters and processors have established markets
for these species and should be provided the opportunity to realize revenues from the harvest of the full DAP amounts
so specified. Specifications of DAP shown in Table 1 reflect apportioned reserves.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under &sect;672.24(c), sablefish TACs for each of the regulatory areas and districts are assigned to hook-and-line
and trawl gear. In the Central and Western Regulatory Areas, 80 percent of the TAC is allocated to hook-and-line gear
and 20 percent is allocated to trawl gear. In the Eastern Regulatory Area, 95 percent of the TAC is assigned to hook-and-line
gear and 5 percent is assigned to trawl gear. The trawl gear allocation in the Eastern Regulatory Area may only be used
as bycatch to support directed fisheries for other target species. Sablefish caught in the GOA with gear other than
hook-and-line or trawl must be treated as prohibited species and may not be retained. Table 2 shows the assignments
of the preliminary 1995 sablefish TACs between hook-and-line and trawl gears.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
In the GOA, pollock is apportioned by area and season. These amounts are further apportioned between inshore and offshore
components. Regulations at &sect;672.20(a)(2)(iv) require that the TAC for pollock in the combined Western/Central
Regulatory Areas (W/C) be apportioned among statistical areas Shumagin (61), Chirikof (62), and Kodiak (63) in proportion
to known distribution of the pollock biomass. This measure was intended to provide spatial distribution of the pollock
harvest as a sea lion protection measure. Each statistical area apportionment is further divided equally into the
four calendar quarters. Within any fishing year, any unharvested amount of any quarterly allowance of pollock TAC
is added in equal proportions to the quarterly allowances of following quarters, resulting in a sum for each quarter
not to exceed 150 percent of the initial quarterly allowance. Similarly, harvests in excess of a quarterly allowance
of TAC are deducted in equal proportions from the remaining quarterly allowances of that fishing year. The Eastern
Regulatory Area proposed TAC of 3,360 mt is not allocated among smaller areas, or quarterly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulations at &sect;672.20(a)(2)(v)(A) require that the DAP apportionment for pollock in all regulatory areas
and all quarterly allowances thereof be divided into inshore and offshore components. The inshore component is apportioned
100 percent of the pollock DAP in each regulatory area after subtraction of amounts that are determined by the Director,
Alaska Region, NMFS, (Regional Director) to be necessary to support the bycatch needs of the offshore component in
directed fisheries for other groundfish species. At this time, these bycatch amounts are unknown, and will be determined
during the fishing year. The preliminary distribution of pollock within the combined W/C GOA is shown in Table 3, except
that inshore and offshore component apportionments of pollock are not shown.

The FMP specifies that amounts for the ``other species'' category are calculated as 5 percent of the combined TACs
for target species. The GOA-wide ``other species'' TAC is calculated as 15,535 mt, which is 5 percent of the sum of combined
TACs for the target species.

7. Preliminary Halibut PSC Mortality Limits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Under &sect;672.20(f), annual Pacific halibut PSC mortality limits are established for trawl and hook-and-line
gear and may be established for pot gear. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At its September 1994 meeting, the Council recommended that, for 1995, NMFS re-establish 1994 PSC limits of 2,000
mt and 750 mt for the trawl and hook-and-line gear fisheries, respectively, with 10 mt of the hook-and-line limit allocated
to the DSR fishery in the Southeast Outside District and the remainder to other hook-and-line gear fisheries. These
interim specifications exempt pot gear from halibut limits for 1994, as proposed by the Council. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1994, NMFS approved a rule that authorizes separate apportionments of the trawl halibut bycatch mortality limit
between trawl fisheries for deep-water and shallow-water species (59 FR 38132, July 27, 1994). These apportionments
are divided seasonally to avoid seasonally high halibut bycatch rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with the goals and objectives of the FMP to reduce halibut bycatches while providing an opportunity to
harvest the groundfish OY, NMFS preliminarily concurs in the Council's 1995 recommendations and assigns 2,000 mt
and 750 mt of halibut PSC mortality limits to trawl and hook-and-line gear, respectively, as interim limits. While
these limits would reduce the harvest quota for commercial halibut fishermen, NMFS has determined that they would
not result in unfair allocation to any particular user group. NMFS recognizes that some halibut bycatch will occur
in the groundfish fishery, but expansion of the Vessel Incentive Program, required modifications to gear, implementation
of the IFQ program, and changes in the season start date for some fisheries are intended to reduce adverse impacts on
halibut fishermen while promoting the opportunity to achieve the OY from the groundfish fishery.

8. Preliminary Seasonal Allocations of the Halibut PSC Limits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Under &sect;672.20(f)(2)(iii), NMFS preliminarily allocates seasonal halibut PSC limits based on recommendations
from the Council. The Council recommended the same seasonal allocation of PSC limits for the 1995 fishing year as those
in effect during the 1994 fishing year. The publication of the final 1994 initial groundfish and PSC specifications
(59 FR 7647, February 16, 1994) summarizes Council findings with respect to each of the FMP considerations set forth
above. At this time, the Council's findings are unchanged from those set forth for 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pacific halibut PSC limits, and apportionments thereof, are presented in Table 5. Regulations specify that any overages
or shortfalls in PSC limits will be accounted for within the 1995 season. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council did not recommend changes in the seasonal apportionments for the hook-and-line gear fisheries from those
specified in 1994; however, NMFS notes that the opening date of the sablefish fishery is scheduled to change from May
18, in 1994, to March 1, in 1995, under the IFQ program. This change and the Council's proposed exemption of the sablefish
fishery from the 1995 PSC limit may prompt the Council to alter its recommendation for seasonal apportionments at
its December 1994 meeting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Pacific halibut PSC limit for hook-and-line gear is allocated to the demersal shelf rockfish (DSR) fishery and
fisheries other than DSR.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Current regulations at &sect;672.20(c)(1)(ii)(A) require that one-fourth of the proposed TAC (not including the
reserves and the first quarterly allowance of pollock), one-fourth of the inshore and offshore allocations of Pacific
cod in each regulatory area, and one-fourth of the halibut PSC amounts, take effect on January 1 on an interim basis
and remain in effect until superseded by the final 1995 initial specifications published in the Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 or until harvested. Seasonal apportionments of TACs or PSC limits under provisions of other regulations may supersede
this interim specification. Table 1 shows amounts of proposed specifications of target species and the ``other species''
categories in effect on an interim basis beginning January 1, 1995.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under &sect;672.20(c)(2)(ii), if the Regional Director determines that the amount of a target species or ``other
species'' category apportioned to a fishery, or with respect to Pacific cod, to an allocation to the inshore or offshore
component, is likely to be reached, the Regional Director may establish a directed fishing allowance for that species
or species group. In establishing a directed fishing allowance, the Regional Director shall consider the amount
of that species group or allocation of Pacific cod to the inshore or offshore component that will be taken as incidental
catch in directed fishing for other species in the same regulatory area or district. If the Regional Director establishes
a directed fishing allowance, and that allowance is or will be reached before the end of the fishing year, NMFS will
prohibit directed fishing for that species or species group in the specified regulatory area or district. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Regional Director has determined that interim amounts of groundfish specified by this preliminary specification
(Table 1) for species or species groups identified in Table 7 will be necessary as incidental catch to support anticipated
groundfish fisheries prior to the time that final specifications of groundfish are in effect for the 1995 fishing
year. Therefore, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for those target species, gears, and components listed in
Table 7 to prevent exceeding the interim amounts of groundfish TACs specified. These closures will be in effect during
the period that the appropriate interim specifications of groundfish TACs are in effect. During these closures,
applicable directed fishing standards may be found at &sect;672.20(g). Additional closures and restrictions may
be found in existing regulations at 50 CFR part 672.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Student Loan Reform Act of 1993, enacted on August 10, 1993, established the Direct Loan Program under the Higher
Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Subtitle A of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;66). Under the Direct Loan Program,
loan capital is provided directly to student and parent borrowers by the Federal Government rather than through private
lenders. Borrowers under the Direct Loan Program are provided a range of repayment options, including an ICR plan.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The HEA directs the Secretary to consult with members of the higher education community and to publish a notice of standards,
criteria, and procedures for the program's first year in lieu of issuing regulations using the Department's usual
procedures. The Secretary's representatives have consulted with representatives of students, colleges, universities,
proprietary schools, and educational associations, as well as representatives of the financial aid community,
in developing this notice. In particular, the Secretary's representatives have had extensive consultations with
the other members of the Direct Student Loan Regulations Negotiated Rulemaking Advisory Committee established
to develop proposed regulations for the second and subsequent years of the program. See the Secretary's announcement
of his intention to establish this Committee at 58 FR 68619 (December 28, 1993). The Secretary, in consultation with
the above-discussed members of the higher education community, has determined that this notice is reasonable and
necessary to the successful implementation of the first year of the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice modifies the provisions of the ICR plan and the alternative repayment plan for the 1994&hyph;95 academic
year.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 1, 1994, the Secretary published a final regulation governing the Direct Loan Program for the 1994&hyph;95
academic year. That regulation prescribes the formula used to determine the repayment amounts under the ICR plan
for borrowers whose loans enter repayment during the 1994&hyph;95 academic year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 18, 1994, the same formula was published in a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking relating to the 1995&hyph;96
and subsequent years of the Direct Loan Program. The Secretary received 98 comments on that NPRM, most of which include
discussion of the ICR plan. In response to those comments, the Secretary made several changes to the ICR plan for the
1995&hyph;96 and subsequent academic years. The changes provide borrowers with better repayment terms than are
currently available for the 1994&hyph;95 academic year. For example, the limit on the amount of interest that will
be capitalized (or added to principal) was reduced from 50 percent of the original principal to 10 percent of the original
principal, thereby reducing the cost of borrowing significantly for some borrowers whose monthly payments are lower
than the amount of interest accrued. The new ICR formula also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lowers the required monthly payment for many borrowers who have lower incomes.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice extends the revised ICR formula and its benefits, including the reduced level of capitalization, to borrowers
whose loans enter repayment in the 1994&hyph;95 academic year. This notice also reduces the level of capitalization
of interest on loans repaid under the alternative repayment plan for borrowers whose loans enter repayment in the
1994&hyph;95 academic year. Finally, this notice establishes a 30-year maximum repayment period for the alternative
repayment plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes that it is desirable for all Direct Loan borrowers who choose the ICR plan to be subject to the
same formula during the first years of this new program. As of this date, no Direct Loan borrowers have entered repayment
under the ICR formula published on July 1, 1994, but some Direct Loan borrowers will enter income contingent repayment
before the 1994&hyph;95 academic year is over. This notice provides that the revised ICR plan will apply to those borrowers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes that applying one formula to all borrowers allows the Secretary to publish materials that
clearly explain the repayment options to borrowers without having to discuss multiple formulas. Furthermore, having
a single formula during the initial years of this program simplifies the administration of the program for schools
and promotes a clear understanding of the repayment provisions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary has established the maximum repayment period allowable under the alternative repayment plan at 30
years. Further, under the alternative plan, interest that accrues and is not paid will be capitalized annually until
the outstanding principal is 10 percent greater than the original principal amount. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Section 685.209&blank;Income Contingent Repayment Plan
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary has significantly modified the income contingent repayment (ICR) plan provisions. The Secretary
is lowering the limit on interest capitalization that may occur when interest accrues, but is not paid, from 50 percent
greater than the original principal amount to 10 percent greater than the original principal amount. Also, monthly
payments will be limited to 20 percent of discretionary income (AGI minus the poverty level appropriate to the family
size). This change eliminates the need for the previous family size offset of $7 and provides a new cap on the amount
of income assessed. The Secretary is including years of repayment under the 10-year standard repayment plan and the
12-year extended repayment plan as years eligible for determining the 25-year period for loan forgiveness. The monthly
repayment amount below which no payment is required under the formula calculation is $15. Under the 12-year standard
amortization cap, the minimum payment is $15 (that is, a borrower must pay at least $15 each month). The 12-year standard
amortization cap calculation has been modified to provide for the recalculation of the cap following periods of negative
amortization because these periods result in an increase in the outstanding loan balance. The payback rate for married
borrowers paying jointly under ICR will be calculated on the outstanding debt at the time the borrowers are approved
for joint repayment. For borrowers repaying jointly, payments will be applied to interest on both accounts prior
to principal reduction in either. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 685.209 (ICR plan) contains provisions governing the two monthly payment calculations, namely the formula
amount and the capped amount, available for repayment of Direct Loans under the ICR plan. Borrowers may choose to repay
either the formula amount or the capped amount. (See Appendix A for detailed examples illustrating, for single borrowers
and for married borrowers who are repaying under the ICR plan, the calculations of the formula and capped monthly repayment
amounts.)

Formula Amount
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Calculation of the ICR formula monthly payment amount is described in paragraph (b) of this section. In general, the
borrower's annual repayment obligation is the borrower's AGI multiplied by a ``payback rate'' that is based on the
borrower's debt. The monthly payment is the annual repayment obligation divided by 12. The ``payback rate'' varies
from four to 15 percent, calculated as described in paragraph (b)(2). The payment amount cannot exceed 20 percent
of discretionary income (AGI minus the annual poverty level appropriate to the family size) divided by 12. If the calculated
monthly payment is less than $15, the borrower is not required to make a payment. When a borrower is not required to make
a payment, interest on the principal accrues and will be capitalized until the limitation on capitalization is reached.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Capped Amount
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Calculation of the capped monthly payment amount is described in paragraph (c), and equals the monthly amount the
borrower would repay over 12 years using standard amortization schedules. If the formula amount exceeds the capped
amount, the borrower may choose to pay the capped amount. If the borrower chooses to pay the capped amount, the borrower's
repayment period may be longer than if the borrower chooses to pay the higher formula amount.

Joint Repayment By Married Borrowers
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section includes provisions for joint income contingent repayment of Direct Loans by married borrowers. Negative
amortization is minimized by attributing joint repayments first to the interest due on each spouse's account and
then to principal. A step-by-step calculation of a combined repayment amount is included as Example 2 in Appendix
A.

Repayment Period
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Provisions governing the repayment period under ICR are contained in paragraph (d)(2). The maximum period is 25 years,
excluding periods of authorized deferment and forbearance under &sect;&sect;685.204 and 685.205, respectively,
and periods in which the borrower made payments under a repayment plan other than the 10-year standard or 12-year extended
plans. The Secretary believes the exclusion of repayment periods under all other extended and graduated plans is
needed to prevent potential borrower repayment abuses.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a borrower repays more than one loan under ICR and the loans enter repayment at different times, a separate repayment
period for each loan begins when the loan enters repayment. This approach ensures that no loan will be repaid under
ICR for more than 25 years. If loans enter repayment at the same time, a single repayment period applies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To encourage borrowers to begin repaying their loans and to limit negative amortization at the beginning of the repayment
period, a borrower must make monthly payments of accrued interest until the Secretary calculates the borrower's
monthly payment on the basis of the borrower's income. A borrower who is unable to make monthly payments of accrued
interest or is unable to qualify for a deferment under &sect;685.204, may request forbearance under &sect;685.205.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Limit on Capitalization of Interest
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary believes a limit on the amount of interest that is added to principal (the capitalization of interest)
is desirable to prevent an excessive increase in a borrower's debt burden when the borrower's income is insufficient
to cover accruing interest. Paragraph (d)(3) permits capitalization of unpaid interest until the outstanding principal
amount is 10 percent greater than the original principal amount, a decrease from the 50 percent proposed in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NPRM. Thereafter, unpaid interest accrues but is not capitalized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Consent to Disclosure of Tax Return Information
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to repay a Direct Loan under ICR, a borrower must consent, on a form provided by the Secretary, to the disclosure
of certain tax return information by the Internal Revenue Service to agents of the Secretary for purposes of calculating
a monthly repayment amount and servicing and collecting a loan. The information subject to disclosure is taxpayer
identity information as defined in 26 U.S.C. 6103(b)(6) (including such information as name, address, and social
security number), tax filing status, and AGI. Paragraph (d)(5) describes the procedures for providing written consent
and requires that consent be provided for a period of five years. If a borrower selects ICR but fails to provide or renew
consent, or withdraws consent without selecting a different repayment plan, the Secretary designates the 10-year
standard repayment plan for the borrower.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Waiver of Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the Administrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, it is the practice of the Secretary to offer interested
parties an opportunity to comment on proposed regulations. However, Pub. L. 103&hyph;66 permits the Secretary to
publish a notice in lieu of regulations for the first year of the Direct Loan Program and exempts the contents of the
notice from the rulemaking requirements of section 431 of the General Education Provisions Act (recently revised
and renumbered by Pub. L. 103&hyph;382 as section 437). In developing this notice, the Secretary's representatives
have consulted extensively with the other members of the Direct Student Loan Regulations Negotiated Rulemaking
Advisory Committee established to develop proposed regulations for the second and subsequent years of the program,
and has taken into consideration the public comments submitted in response to the Secretary's invitation in the August
18, 1994 Direct Loan NPRM. The timely implementation of the ICR plan for borrowers entering repayment in academic
year 1994&hyph;1995 does not permit the solicitation of further public comment. A public comment period would seriously
delay operation of the Direct Loan Program and would prevent borrowers entering repayment during the first year of
the program from receiving the same benefits as borrowers who enter repayment in the second year of the program. Therefore,
the Secretary finds that solicitation of public comments is impracticable and contrary to the public interest under
5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B). For the same reasons, the Secretary has decided to waive the 30-day delayed effective date under
5 U.S.C. 553(d).

adequate to accommodate the borrower's exceptional circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Secretary may require a borrower to provide evidence of the borrower's exceptional circumstances before
permitting the borrower to repay a loan under an alternative repayment plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If the Secretary agrees to permit a borrower to repay a loan under an alternative repayment plan, the Secretary
notifies the borrower in writing of the terms of the plan. After the borrower receives notification of the terms of
the plan, the borrower may accept the plan or choose another repayment plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A borrower shall repay a loan under an alternative repayment plan within 30 years of the date the loan entered repayment,
not including periods of deferment and forbearance.

(5) If the amount of a borrower's monthly payment under an alternative repayment plan is less than the accrued interest
on the loan, the unpaid interest is capitalized until the outstanding principal amount is 10 percent greater than
the original principal amount. After the outstanding principal amount is 10 percent greater than the original principal
amount, interest continues to accrue but is not capitalized. For purposes of this paragraph, the original principal
amount is the amount owed by the borrower when the borrower enters repayment.

. (1) Under the income contingent repayment plan described in &sect;685.208(f), a borrower may choose to repay under
the formula described in paragraph (b) of this section or may choose to have payments capped as described in paragraph
(c) of this section. The amount calculated under paragraph (b) of this section is called the ``formula amount,'' and
the amount calculated under paragraph (c) of this section is called the ``capped amount.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Borrowers may choose to repay either the formula amount or the capped amount when they enter repayment and may change
between the options one time each year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The Secretary may determine that special circumstances, such as a loss of employment by the borrower or the borrower's
spouse, warrant an adjustment to the borrower's repayment obligations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Married borrowers may repay their loans jointly if they meet the following requirements: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The spouses have both chosen either the formula amount or the capped amount. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The spouses filed a joint Federal income tax return for the most recent year for which the Secretary has obtained
income information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The spouses submit a written request to the Secretary that includes their names and social security numbers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Examples of the calculation of monthly repayment amounts and tables that shows monthly repayment amounts for
borrowers at various income and debt levels are included in appendix A to this part.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (i) If a borrower chooses to pay the formula amount under the income contingent repayment plan, the borrower generally
makes monthly payments that are calculated using a percentage of the borrower's Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) called
the ``payback rate.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A borrower's monthly payment is equal to the borrower's AGI multiplied by the payback rate, divided by 12 months.
However, a borrower's monthly payment is never larger than 20 percent of the borrower's discretionary income as defined
in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, divided by 12 months. Additionally, if the monthly repayment amount is
less than $15, the borrower is not required to make a payment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) For purposes of this section, discretionary income is defined as a borrower's AGI minus the amount of the ``HHS
Poverty Guideline for all States (except Alaska and Hawaii) and the District of Columbia'' as published by the United
States Department of Health and Human Services on an annual basis.

 If a borrower provides documentation acceptable to the Secretary that the borrower has more than one person in the
borrower's family, the Secretary applies the HHS Poverty Guideline for the borrower's family size.

Payback rate. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) A borrower's payback rate is based upon the borrower's Direct Loan debt when the borrower's first loan enters repayment
and does not change unless the borrower obtains another Direct Loan or the borrower and the borrower's spouse obtain
approval to repay their loans jointly under paragraph (a)(4) of this section. If the borrower obtains another Direct
Loan, a new payback rate for all of the borrower's Direct Loans is calculated on the basis of the combined amounts of
the loans when the last loan enters repayment. If the borrower and the borrower's spouse repay the loans jointly, the
provisions under paragraph (b)(3) of this section apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the total amount of a borrower's Direct Loans is less than or equal to $1,000, the payback rate is four percent.
If the total amount of a borrower's Direct Loans is greater than $1,000, the payback rate is four percent plus an additional
percent that begins at zero and increases at a rate of 0.2 percent for each additional $1,000 borrowed up to a maximum
payback rate of 15 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) More specifically, if the total amount of a borrower's Direct Loans is greater than $1,000, the payback rate
is the lesser of 0.15 or the following: 0.04 + (debt ^ 1,000) (0.000002).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (i) The combined monthly payment amount for married borrowers who repay their loans jointly under paragraph (a)(4)
of this section and who repay the formula amount is the total of the individual monthly payment amounts for each borrower
calculated under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The payback rate for each borrower is calculated separately on the basis of the amount of the outstanding debt
on the borrower's Direct Loans at the time the borrower enters into joint repayment with the borrower's spouse. For
purposes of this paragraph, the Secretary assumes that the AGI for each borrower is proportionate to the relative
size of the borrower's individual debt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) For purposes of determining whether a borrower's payment amount is larger than 20 percent of the borrower's
discretionary income under paragraph (b)(1)(ii), a portion of the appropriate HHS Poverty Guideline for the borrowers'
family size 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is applied to each borrower in proportion to the relative size of the individual borrower's debts.

General. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a borrower's monthly payments calculated under the formula amount as determined in paragraph (b) of this section
are greater than the capped amount calculated under paragraph (c)(2), the borrower may choose to repay the capped
amount. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Calculation of the capped amount. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) The capped amount is the amount that a borrower would repay monthly over 12 years using standard amortization or
$15, whichever is greater. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The amount of the cap is recalculated on an annual basis to include changes in the variable rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) After periods in which a borrower makes payments that are less than interest accrued on the loan, the amount of
the cap is recalculated. If the new cap is larger than the existing cap, the new cap is applied. If the new cap is smaller
than or equal to the existing cap, the existing cap is applied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Exception to the calculation of the capped amount for certain married borrowers. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The capped amount for married borrowers who repay jointly under paragraph (a)(4) of this section is the same amount
as calculated under paragraph (c)(2) of this section except that the amount is based on the combined Direct Loan debt
of the borrowers.

If a borrower's AGI is not available or if, in the Secretary's opinion, the borrower's reported AGI does not reasonably
reflect the borrower's current income, the Secretary may use other documentation of income provided by the borrower
to calculate the borrower's monthly repayment amount.

Repayment period. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) The maximum repayment period under the income contingent repayment plan is 25 years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The repayment period includes periods in which the borrower makes payments under the standard repayment plan
and under extended repayment plans in which payments are based on a repayment period that is up to 12 years. The repayment
period does not include periods in which the borrower makes payments under the graduated and alternative repayment
plans or periods of authorized deferment or forbearance. The repayment period also does not include periods in which
the borrower makes payments under an extended repayment plan in which payments are based on a repayment period that
is longer than 12 years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If a borrower repays more than one loan under the income contingent repayment plan, a separate repayment period
for each loan begins when that loan enters repayment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) If a borrower has not repaid a loan in full at the end of the 25-year repayment period under the income contingent
repayment plan, the Secretary cancels the unpaid portion of the loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) At the beginning of the repayment period under the income contingent repayment plan, a borrower shall make monthly
payments of the amount of interest that accrues on the borrower's Direct Loans until the Secretary calculates the
borrower's monthly repayment amount on the basis of the borrower's income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Limitation on capitalization of interest. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the amount of a borrower's monthly payment is less than the accrued interest, the unpaid interest is capitalized
until the outstanding principal amount is ten percent greater than the original principal amount. After the outstanding
principal amount is ten percent greater than the original amount, interest continues to accrue but is not capitalized.
For purposes of this paragraph, the original amount is the amount owed by the borrower when the borrower enters repayment.

Notification of terms and conditions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When a borrower elects or is required by the Secretary to repay a loan under the income contingent repayment plan, the
Secretary notifies the borrower of the terms and conditions of the plan, including_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) That the Internal Revenue Service will disclose certain tax return information to the Secretary or the Secretary's
agents; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) That if the borrower believes that special circumstances warrant an adjustment to the borrower's repayment
obligations, as described in &sect;685.209(a)(3), the borrower may contact the Secretary and obtain the Secretary's
determination as to whether an adjustment is appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Consent to disclosure of tax return information. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) A borrower shall provide written consent to the disclosure of certain tax return information by the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) to agents of the Secretary for purposes of calculating a monthly repayment amount and servicing and
collecting a loan under the income contingent repayment plan. The borrower shall provide consent by signing a consent
form, developed consistent with 26 CFR 301.6103(c)-1 and provided to the borrower by the Secretary, and shall return
the signed form to the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The borrower shall consent to disclosure of the borrower's taxpayer identity information as defined in 26 U.S.C.
6103(b)(6), tax filing status, and AGI. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The borrower shall provide consent for a period of five years from the date the borrower signs the consent form.
The Secretary provides the borrower a new consent form before that period expires. The IRS does not disclose tax return
information after the IRS has processed a borrower's withdrawal of consent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The Secretary designates the standard repayment plan for a borrower who selects the income contingent repayment
plan but_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Fails to provide the required written consent; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Fails to renew written consent upon the expiration of the five-year period for consent; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Withdraws consent and does not select another repayment plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) If a borrower defaults and the Secretary designates the income contingent repayment plan for the borrower but
the borrower fails to provide the required written consent, the Secretary mails a notice to the borrower establishing
a repayment schedule for the borrower.

Step 1: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Calculate the payback rate. Because the borrower's debt is greater than $1,000, the payback rate is calculated on
the basis of the formula in &sect;685.209(b)(2)(iii), as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 01 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Subtract $1,000 from the total amount of the borrower's Direct Loans: ($12,500^$1,000=$11,500).

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 2: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Compare the calculated payback rate (0.063) to the maximum payback rate (0.15). Because the calculated rate is less
than the maximum rate, the borrower's payback rate is 0.063.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 3: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Calculate the annual repayment amount by multiplying the borrower's AGI by the payback rate: ($25,000&times;0.063=$1,575).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 4: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Calculate the monthly repayment amount by dividing the annual repayment amount by 12 months: ($1,575
<!-- PJG 0001 unknown -->
12=$131.25). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 5: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Calculate the borrower's discretionary income (AGI minus HHS Poverty Guideline for a family of one): ($25,000^$7,360=$17,640).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 6: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Multiply the borrower's discretionary income ($17,640) by 20 percent: ($17,640&times;.2=3,528).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 7: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Divide the amount calculated in Step 6 by 12 months: ($3,528
<!-- PJG 0001 unknown -->
12=$294). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 8: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Compare the amount calculated in Step 4 ($131.25) with the amount calculated in Step 7 ($294). The lower amount is the
formula amount. The formula amount is $131.25. The borrower's monthly payment under the formula amount would be $131.25.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 01 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 9: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Compare the monthly formula amount ($131.25) to the $15 floor repayment amount. Because the formula amount is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greater than the $15 floor, the borrower's monthly formula amount is $131.25. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 10: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Compare the formula amount calculated in Step 9 ($131.25) to the capped amount, which is the monthly amount the borrower
would repay under a 12-year standard amortization schedule. If the interest rate is seven percent, the 12-year standard
amortization amount is approximately $10.28 for every $1,000 of debt. In this example, since the borrower has $12,500
in debt, the capped amount is approximately $128.50 ($10.28&times;12.5). Because the formula amount ($131.25)
exceeds the capped amount ($128.50), the capped amount is the minimum monthly repayment. The borrower has the option
of paying the formula amount (or any higher amount).

Example 2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Married borrowers both repaying under the ICR plan with a combined Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) of $30,000. The husband
has $5,000 of Direct Loans. The wife has $15,000 of Direct Loans. The couple has two children. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 1: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Calculate the husband's payback rate. Because his debt is greater than $1,000, the payback rate is calculated on the
basis of the formula in &sect;685.209(b)(2)(iii) as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Subtract $1,000 from the amount of the husband's loans: ($5,000^$1,000=$4,000). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Multiply the result by 0.000002: ($4,000&times;0.000002=0.008). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Add the result to 0.04: (0.04+0.008=0.048). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The result is the husband's payback rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 2: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Compare the husband's calculated payback rate (0.048) to the maximum payback rate (0.15). Because the calculated
rate is less than the maximum rate, the husband's payback rate is 0.048. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 3: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Calculate the husband's assumed AGI by multiplying the couple's total AGI ($30,000) by the amount of the husband's
loans ($5,000), divided by the total amount of the couple's debt ($20,000): ($30,000&times;$5,000
<!-- PJG 0001 unknown -->
$20,000=$7,500). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 4: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Calculate the husband's annual repayment amount by multiplying the husband's assumed AGI ($7,500) by his payback
rate (0.048): ($7,500&times;0.048=$360). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 5: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Calculate the husband's monthly repayment amount by dividing his annual repayment amount by 12 months: ($360
<!-- PJG 0001 unknown -->
12=$30). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 6: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Calculate the couple's discretionary income (AGI minus HHS Poverty Guideline for a family of four): ($30,000^14,800=$15,200).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 7: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Calculate the husband's portion of the couple's discretionary income by multiplying the couple's discretionary
income ($15,200) by the amount of the husband's loans ($5,000) divided by the total amount of the couple's debt ($20,000):
($15,200&times;$5,000
<!-- PJG 0001 unknown -->
$20,000=$3,800). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 8: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Multiply the husband's discretionary income by 20 percent: ($3,800^.2=$760). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 9: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Divide the amount calculated in Step 8 by 12 months: ($760

Step 10: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Compare the monthly amount calculated in Step 5 ($30) with the monthly amount calculated in Step 9 ($63.33). The lower
amount is the formula amount. The formula amount is $30. If the borrowers choose to repay the formula amount, the husband's
payment would be $30.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 11: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Calculate the wife's payback rate. Because her debt is greater than $1,000, the payback rate is calculated on the basis
of the formula in &sect;685.209(b)(2)(iii) as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Subtract $1,000 from the amount of the wife's loans: ($15,000^$1,000=$14,000). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Multiply the result by 0.000002: ($14,000&times;0.000002=0.028). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Add the result to 0.04: (0.04+0.028=0.068). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The result is the wife's payback rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 12: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Compare the wife's calculated payback rate (0.068) to the maximum payback rate (0.15). Because the calculated rate
is less than the maximum rate, the wife's payback rate is 0.068. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 13: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Calculate the wife's assumed AGI by multiplying the couple's total AGI ($30,000) by the amount of the wife's loans
($15,000), divided by the total amount of the couple's debt ($20,000): ($30,000&times;$15,000
<!-- PJG 0001 unknown -->
$20,000=$22,500). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 14: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Calculate the wife's annual repayment amount by multiplying the wife's assumed AGI ($22,500) by her payback rate
(0.068): ($22,500&times;0.068=$1,530). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 15: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Calculate the wife's monthly repayment amount by dividing the annual repayment amount calculated in Step 14 ($1,530)
by 12 months: ($1,530
<!-- PJG 0001 unknown -->
12=$127.50). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 16: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Calculate the wife's portion of the couple's discretionary income by subtracting the husband's portion of the couple's
discretionary income calculated in Step 7 ($3,800) from the couple's total discretionary income calculated in Step
6 ($15,200): ($15,200^$3,800=$11,400). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 17: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Multiply the wife's discretionary income ($11,400) by 20 percent: ($11,400&times;.2=$2,280). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 18: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Divide the amount calculated in Step 17 by 12 months: ($2,280
<!-- PJG 0001 unknown -->
12=$190). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 19: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Compare the monthly amount calculated in Step 15 ($127.50) with the monthly amount calculated in Step 18 ($190). The
lower amount is the formula amount. The formula amount is $127.50. If the borrowers choose to repay the formula amount,
the wife's payment would be $127.50. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 20: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Calculate the couple's combined monthly formula amount by adding the husband's monthly formula amount calculated
in Step 10 ($30) and the wife's monthly formula amount calculated in Step 19 ($127.50): ($30+$127.50=$157.50). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 21: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Compare the couple's combined monthly formula amount ($157.50) to the $15 floor repayment amount. Because the combined
formula amount is greater than the $15 floor, the couple's combined monthly formula amount is $157.50. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 22: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Compare the formula amount calculated in Step 21 ($157.50) to the capped amount, which is the amount the couple would
repay under a 12-year standard amortization schedule. If the interest rate is seven percent, the capped amount is
approximately $10.28 for every $1,000 of debt. In this example, since the couple has $20,000 in debt, the capped amount
is approximately $205.60 ($10.28&times;20). Because the formula amount ($157.50) does not exceed the capped amount
($205.60), the couple's combined monthly repayment amount is the formula amount of $157.50.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In this document, the Bureau of Prisons is rescinding its regulations on Designation and Transfer of D.C. Women Offenders
because it is no longer the routine policy of the District of Columbia Department of Corrections to place such inmates
in the federal system. By joint agreement with the Bureau, the Department of Corrections is responsible for notifying
D.C. women offenders being boarded in Bureau facilities of any applicable Department of Correction provisions previously
contained in these regulations. Therefore, separate notification by Bureau regulations is no longer necessary.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Bureau of Prisons is rescinding its regulations on Designation and Transfer of D.C. Women Offenders (28 CFR 527,
subpart F). A final rule on this subject was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 October 21, 1983 (48 FR 48969). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with E.O. 12866, the Bureau of Prisons is reviewing its regulations for the purpose of ensuring that
it promulgates only such regulations as are required by law, are necessary to interpret the law, or are made necessary
by compelling public need. The Bureau has determined that provisions for the designation and transfer of D.C. women
offenders are adequately covered through joint agreement with the District of Columbia Department of Corrections.
The text of the joint agreement has been incorporated in its entirety into the Bureau's internal instructions to staff,
and the Bureau believes that there is no need to restate these provisions in regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1972, a civil suit (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Garnes v. Taylor
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) was filed against the District of Columbia Department of Corrections seeking to have the court declare unconstitutional
the practice of transferring female D.C. Code violators to federal facilities far from the District of Columbia.
This suit was settled in 1975 by an agreement which established procedures for designating and transferring female
D.C. Code violators to and from federal institutions. This agreement, known as the ``Garnes Decree'', became effective
December 10, 1976. The Bureau of Prisons, recognizing that the District of Columbia Department of Corrections had
no facilities for housing long-term female offenders, agreed to designate federal institutions for women with sentences
of more than one year who are not within nine months of a parole eligibility, sentence expiration, or mandatory release
date. The Bureau further agreed to refer to the District of Columbia, for further consideration, a District of Columbia
woman confined within a Bureau institution provided that the inmate desires the referral and is within nine months
of a parole eligibility, sentence expiration, or mandatory release date. Regulations on this subject were issued
by the Bureau in 1983 as part of the general publication of Bureau rules relating to the control, custody, care, treatment,
and instruction of inmates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since 1983, the number of female offenders transferred from the District of Columbia Department of Corrections has
declined to the point where only five cases remain in Bureau custody. Pursuant to a joint agreement with the Bureau,
the Department of Corrections is responsible for notifying these inmates of the pertinent designation and transfer
procedures. This is similar to procedures applicable to State inmates boarded in Bureau facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because this rescission imposes no new restrictions on inmates, the Bureau finds good cause for exempting the provisions
of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, the opportunity for
public comment, and delay in effective date. Members of the public may submit comments concerning this rule by writing
to the previously cited address. These comments will be considered but will receive no response in the
