Changes to the Federal Register files.

1. The <DOCNO> numbers are the same as used in the TREC-4 routing data.
   Because this data will be used as part of a larger OCR collection, a new
   field called <PARENT> has been added.  This contains a "corrected" DOCNO to
   resolve problems where the document was incorrectly broken apart for TREC-4.

2. All punctuation was changed to be SGML compliant.  This was most obvious in 
   the case of '&'.  In addition, control characters, special symbols, and 
   foreign language characters were removed from the documents, replaced with 
   the appropriate SGML entity, or a SGML entity was created to handle the 
   character in question.  For a detailed list of the entities handled by 
   sgml, see the file fr94.dtd.  

3. In the previous FR94 collection, the following tags existed.  These tags
   have been converted to SGML compliant comments.

   <FTAG>
   <GTAG>
   <ITAG>
   <QTAG>
   <STAG>
   <TTAG>

   The GTAG and TTAG values have been amalgamated into ITAG comments.
   The ZTAG was removed.

4. The following tags have been added. They delimit regions of specific 
   semantic content within the Federal Register.  The tags occur zero or more 
   times in any given document.

   USDEPT          The name of the department within the federal government 
                   that released the document.
   AGENCY          The name of the government agency within the department.
   USBUREAU        The name of the government service or bureau contributing 
                   the document.
   DOCTITLE        The title text of the contribution.
   ADDRESS         The address(es) of the contributing agency.
   FURTHER         The text detailing availability of further information.
   SUMMARY         A precis of the text of the full document. This text is
                   contributed by the agency and appears before the main
                   body of the text.
   ACTION          The function of the article; the reason it is in the
                   federal register. Usually just a few words.
   SIGNER          The signatory of the document.
   SIGNJOB         The title of the signatory.
   SUPPLEM         The supplementary information; the bulk of the document
                   text.
   BILLING         The Federal Register billing code for that section.
   FRFILING        The document's filing details.
   DATE            The effective date and/or time applicable to the text.
   CFRNO           The relevant section of the United States Code.
   RINDOCK         The docket or RIN number of the entry.

5. The following tags contain text that is optionally useful for retrieval.  
   There may be multiple occurrences of these tags within a document.

   TABLE           The text appearing in a table, often numeric.
   FOOTNOTE        The text appearing as a footnote.
   FOOTCITE        The text appearing that labels a footnote, usually just a 
                   superscripted integer.
   FOOTNAME        The text labelling the footnote, corresponding to the 
                   citation.

6. The text contained in the following tag's scope is probably not useful for 
   retrieval.

   IMPORT          This tag denotes the importation of a special figure (a map,i
                   graph, table, image) whose contents do not appear in the 
                   files supplied, but that do appear in the Federal Register 
                   itself.

7. comments:
   The many SGML compliant comments all contain the string "-- PJG ".  They may
   safely be removed with the following UNIX command:
   % egrep -v '\-\- PJG ' FR940101-0 > FR940101-0.nocomments
