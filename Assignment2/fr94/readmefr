A Note to the User

The material on this disk is copyrighted and is subject to the terms and 
conditions of the TREC-96 Information-Retrieval Text Research Collection User 
Agreement, which must be signed in order to obtain a copy of the CD-ROM on 
which this data is to be found.

This data is the FR routing data used in TREC-4.  The document boundaries and 
<DOCNO>s have been kept the same, however many more tags and SGML comments 
have been added.  These were added to preserve all formatting information for 
a larger OCR collections being built.

The changes between the original material as it came from the publisher and the
version on this disk is detailed in the following file: readchg.

The format uses a labelled bracketing, expressed in the style of SGML (Standard 
Generalized Markup Language).  The SGML DTD's used for verification at NIST are 
included on the CDs.  All of the different datasets have their major structures 
identical for easier reading, but have different minor structures.  The 
philosophy in the formatting at NIST has been to preserve as much of the 
original structure as possible, but to provide enough consistency to allow 
simple decoding of the data.

The major data structures are illustrated below in a sample of the 
Federal Register data.

</DOC>

Every document is bracketed by <DOC> </DOC> tags and has a unique document 
number, bracketed by <DOCNO> </DOCNO> tags.  Each beginning tag starts as the 
first character of a new line, but the ending tags could be on the same line 
or on later lines.

The datasets have all been compressed using the UNIX compress utility and are 
stored in chunks of about 1 megabyte each (uncompressed size).

Both as part of the philosophy of leaving the data as close to the original as 
possible, and because it is impossible to check all the data manually, there 
are many "errors" in the data.  These range from errors in the original data, 
such as typographical errors, improper tagging errors, to errors in the 
reformatting done at NIST.  The error-checking has concentrated on allowing 
readability of the data rather than on correcting content.  This means that 
there have been automated checks for control characters, special symbols,
foreign language characters, for correct matching of the begin and end tags, 
and for complete DOC and DOCNO fields.  The types of "errors" remaining include 
fragment sentences, strange formatting around tables or other "non-textual" 
items, misspellings, missing fields (that are generally missing from the data), 
etc.
