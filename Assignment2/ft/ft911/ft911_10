SAAB-SCANIA, the Swedish vehicle and aerospace group, yesterday reported a
47 per cent fall in profits after financial items to SKr267m (Dollars 43m)
for the first quarter of 1991, due to mounting losses at Saab Automobile.
Saab-Scania, recently bought out by the investment group controlled by the
Wallenberg family, predicted that annual earnings would be lower than the
1990 result of SKr2.2bn. Group sales slipped by 6 per cent to SKr6.94bn
(Dollars 1.11bn), mainly because the Scania truck division suffered a 10 per
cent fall in sales to SKr5.4bn.
Losses at Saab Automobile, the 50:50 joint venture with General Motors,
increased by 52 per cent to SKr1.011bn during the period. This reduced
profits for Saab-Scania by SKr506m. Excluding Saab Automobile, profits for
the rest of Saab-Scania declined 6 per cent to SKr764m.
Saab Automobile reported a 16 per cent fall in volume sales to 20,800
vehicles, with demand weakening mainly in the Nordic region. Sales amounted
to SKr3.36bn, a 18 per cent fall. Sales for Saab Automobile are not
consolidated in Saab-Scania results.
Saab-Scania and General Motors are discussing a new injection of capital
into Saab Automobile. They will decide whether more funds are needed for the
company's rationalisation after a review of its capital structure is
completed in June. No forecast was offered for Saab Automobile's 1991
profits. The company noted that rationalisation measures taken in 1990 did
not affect the first-quarter results.
Scania division earnings were also lower than last year's first quarter, but
were not specified. Scania's annual profits were predicted to be below last
year's SKr2.9bn. Sales of trucks and buses fell by 6 per cent to 7,800
vehicles.
Profits increased at the aerospace division, however, with a 17 per cent
rise in sales to SKr1.18bn as orders climbed for the Saab 340 and Saab 2000
commuter aircraft. Earnings for 1991 are expected to exceed last year's
SKr111m.
Saab Combitech, the defence technology division, reported unchanged earnings
on sales up by 38 per cent to SKr622m.

<TEXT>
ASSURANCES Generales de France (AGF), the country's second largest
state-owned insurer, shrugged off losses on its international activities
last year to produce a 5 per cent overall net profits increase, writes
William Dawkins.
AGF's net earnings rose in line with forecasts to FFr2.7bn (Dollars 461m)
from FFr2.57bn in 1989, on turnover up by 20 per cent over the same period,
to FFr46.03bn from FFr38.22bn, the group said yesterday. Half of the
turnover growth came from acquisitions.
Group investment income rose to FFr9.18bn from FFr7.67bn, while profits on
asset sales climbed to FFr3.37bn from FFr2.45bn.
Life insurance produced an 8.8 per cent rise in sales to FFr15.9bn, with
growth mainly coming from savings and retirement contracts. Profits on AGF's
life activities rose by 4.6 per cent to FFr1.5bn net.
AGF's international division saw its turnover rise by 54 per cent to
FFr11.2bn from FFr7.2bn, within which 38 per cent came from new acquisitions
including NEM in Britain, ICI in Ireland and l'Escaut, a Belgian insurer.
AGF's reinsurance business produced a 17 per cent rise in turnover to
FFr2.3bn.

ZENITH Electronics, which is competing for a share of the high-definition
television market, yesterday unveiled a deeper first-quarter loss and a drop
in sales.
The US company, which is in the middle of a proxy battle, incurred a
first-quarter net loss of Dollars 23.7m, or 85 cents a share, compared with
a loss of Dollars 4m, or 15 cents, last time.
Mr Jerry Pearlman, chairman, described the first-quarter results as
'unsatisfactory'.
News of the loss was not expected to help Zenith as it fights a proxy
contest by Nycor to replace three directors. A count of the proxy votes from
yesterday's annual meeting was not expected to be announced for at least
several weeks.
Nycor, a holding company spun off from Fedders, the air conditioner maker,
holds 8.2 per cent of Zenith's shares. It claims the company has no business
plan to turn around consumer electronic losses. Nycor and Fedders are
controlled by the Giordano family of New Jersey.
Zenith has responded that the Giordanos, with only low technology
experience, do not understand the long-term, high-tech strategy of the
company, which is engaged in a race for the estimated Dollars 80bn market of
high-definition television.
Zenith may have undermined Nycor's arguments about weakness in consumer
electronics with its sale in March of a near 5 per cent stake to Goldstar,
South Korea's largest consumer electronics maker, for Dollars 15m.
Goldstar wanted access to the US company's high technology.

LYONNAISE des Eaux-Dumez, the newly-formed French water distribution and
construction combine, reported increased turnover and profits for 1990,
writes William Dawkins.
The group turned in net profits of FFr1.42bn (Dollars 230m) last year,
slightly below the FFr1.48bn forecast by the Lyonnaise des Eaux water
distribution group and the Dumez construction company at the time of their
merger in July.
The result is a 12.8 per cent increase on the combined earnings in the
previous year, on a 13.4 per cent increase in pro-forma turnover to FFr72bn.
Earnings per share rose 17.6 per cent to FFr31.6.
Mr Guy de Panafieu, group administrator and managing director, forecast that
turnover would rise by between 5 and 10 per cent this year.
The former Lyonnaise des Eaux contributed FFr896m to net profits.

FT  25 APR 91 / UK Company News: Hardy Oil &amp; Gas calls for Pounds 27.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HARDY OIL &amp; Gas, the exploration company demerged from Trafalgar House,
yesterday launched a 1-for-4 rights issue of 17.8m shares to raise about
Pounds 27.6m.
Shareholders will be offered new shares at 160p apiece to enable the group
to invest in further exploration.
The cash call was accompanied with an up-beat profit forecast for the year
to March 31.
Group profit after tax is expected to almost double to Pounds 10.1m (Pounds
5.1m), after taking into account estimated Petroleum Revenue Tax credits of
Pounds 4m.
However, the recent fall in oil prices forced the group to warn that the
current year's trading profits might be 'adversely affected', despite
hedging two thirds of its oil production. Analysts believe profits could
fall by up to Pounds 7m.
Hardy's share price - after an initial fall of 10p - recovered to end the
day 5p down at 192p.
Earlier this month the company announced its most significant gas find in
the North Sea, 150 miles east of Aberdeen, since joining the stock market
two years ago.
It has also announced discoveries of potential significance in the US,
Canada and the Netherlands, while building up a portfolio of exploration
acreage, with stakes in noted oil-bearing regions such as the Gulf of Mexico
and Western Australia.
Mr Peter Elwes, chief executive, said he wanted to build on the recent
discoveries. The rights issue was an exercise 'in cash flow management.' It
would help fund the exploration which would generate the group's income.
He also hoped it would help reduce borrowing, although he added that since
the group's debt was all project-related he was not under any pressure to
tap the equity market for cash.
Hardy's share of the development of the Ravenspurn North gas field and the
acquisition of an interest in the producing Harriet oil field in Australia
have been financed largely by bank loans. By the end of last month some
Pounds 35.4m had been borrowed.
Mr Elwes hoped the contribution to profits from the sale of gas -
particularly from Ravenspurn, which is priced in sterling and not subject to
short-term price fluctuations - would do much to offset the instability of
the oil price.
To finance acquisitions and drilling in North America the company has
arranged an Dollars 80m (Pounds 46.8m) credit facility. At the end of March
it had borrowed Dollars 53.2m of this amount.

FT  25 APR 91 / UK Company News: Devenish hits back at criticism on strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEVENISH, the West Country brewer fighting off a hostile bid from
Boddington, yesterday gave its first detailed response to the attack on its
strategy by the pubs, hotels and health-care group.
Directors met with advisers to begin drawing up 'a line by line rebuttal' to
be sent to shareholders by May 6, 14 days after Boddington issued its formal
offer document.
Mr Michael Cannon, chairman of Devenish, responding to allegations that his
company had committed a U-turn in buying and then selling wholesalers,
accused Boddington of the 'biggest ever U-turn' in brewing history.
Mr Cannon said: 'Ours was a blip of a U-turn compared with their massive
blunder. The sale of our wholesalers was just a short, sharp reversal of
strategy which generated a healthy profit. The same can not be said for
Boddington's decision to buy and then sell its breweries.'
Boddington bought the Oldham Brewery in 1982, followed by the acquisition of
Higsons Brewery three years later. The group's brewing business was then
sold by November 1989.
The group said it recognised that 'the longer term prospects for profitable
growth linked to brewing and brand ownership were unexciting'.
In response to Boddington's accusation that Devenish had failed to achieve
its ambition of increasing its estate from 400 to 1,000 houses, Mr Cannon
said he still intended to buy more pubs 'but only when the price is right'.
The West Country brewer is already buying individual pubs but admitted that
it has put its plans to bid for a for a larger group of pubs on hold until
the big brewers drop their prices.
Mr Cannon also denied Boddington's charge that Devenish had wasted millions
of pounds of shareholders' money on advertising the Newquay Steam brand. He
said the promotional expenditure had been worthwhile and had helped push up
sales to about 100,000 barrels a year.
He added: 'The board's investment in Newquay Steam achieved its purpose. How
does Boddington expect to launch a new product without advertising?'

FT  25 APR 91 / Business Law: A case of good timing over VAT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE ARE few opportunities more welcome than that of using someone else's
money, free of charge. When that opportunity is offered by the government to
exporters of goods in the form of a cash refund of tax not yet paid, it
would be madness not to take advantage of it.
This has certainly been the view of a number of manufacturing exporters in
relation to value added tax and, until Customs and Excise attacked the
Philips Electrical group of companies, at the end of 1989 the arrangement
apparently worked well. How that arrangement operated demonstrates a
principle of VAT which is of interest and potential benefit not just to
exporters but to all those who pay it.
The events which followed the attack on Philips reveal a good deal of
confusion in VAT administration policy.
The scheme, if it can be called that, used the simple mechanics of VAT to
achieve a substantial cash flow benefit. It works as follows.
A business which sells goods only to UK customers taxes those sales at the
standard rate of 17.5 per cent. It will pay over to Customs the tax which it
charges and collects (output tax) having first deducted from that payment
the amount of VAT paid to its own suppliers on purchases and other
expenditure (input tax). A business which sells goods for export does not
charge VAT on those sales (they are zero-rated) but can claim back its input
tax from Customs, ie, it receives repayments of VAT. The difference between
the two types of businesses is that an export business can claim its VAT
repayments monthly, whereas most businesses which have to charge their
customers VAT make returns and account for VAT quarterly.
A company which makes both standard-rated sales in the UK and zero-rated
export sales would normally make three-monthly VAT returns. Such a company
can improve substantially its cash flow by selling the exports through a
subsidiary, registered separately for VAT. The export company then makes
monthly returns, claiming repayments of the tax charged to it on sales by
the parent, up to 10 weeks before that same tax has to be paid by the parent
to Customs and Excise.
The advantage to be gained by doing this was recognised by a number of
companies as long ago as the early 1970s when VAT was first introduced in
the UK. They have operated the system successfully since then, and with at
least tacit approval from Customs and Excise evidenced by their
discretionary agreement to the use of monthly returns.
However, for reasons that have never been made clear, Customs took exception
to the scheme operated by Philips. Philips' appeal went first to the VAT
Tribunal where Philips lost; then to the High Court in May last year where
Customs conceded defeat having agreed the tribunal's decision was wrong.
At the same time, Customs asked the judge, Mr Justice Roch, to give his view
on the critical point of the tribunal decision - whether or not Philips had
made a 'supply' to the export company.
Originally, Customs had informed Philips that there was in its view no
supply of the goods to the export company and the supply for export was in
fact made direct from the manufacturer. Thus there was no tax to be charged
between the companies and no claim to input tax to be made by the export
company.
The tribunal supported Customs, saying that if the export company did take
ownership of the goods at all, it was for so fleeting a moment as to be
compared with an inter-city express train passing through a station. There
could therefore be no supply made under those conditions.
In the High Court the matter was settled by consent, leaving Philips to
continue with the scheme subject to agreed conditions. In the judge's
opinion there was no requirement in the VAT legislation as to the length of
time for which a transferee should have ownership of the goods to establish
that a supply had been made to him.
He went on to make the incisive comment that any other interpretation would
create considerable difficulties in the levying and recovery of VAT,
particularly in chains of transactions where title might pass
instantaneously through a number of persons.
There is much to be read between the lines in this case. It is clear from
their conduct of the case that, having argued the point successfully at the
VAT Tribunal, Customs suddenly realised that the decision would cause
enormous administrative difficulties. This shows an unexpected lack of
foresight in a department responsible for an important part of government
policy.
In any event, there was a clean and simple alternative for Customs. Monthly
returns are allowed at the discretion of the commissioners and, if they
wished to make Philips an exception to the generally permissive treatment
accorded to exporters, the commissioners could have directed Philips Exports
Ltd to make quarterly returns.
This would have largely erased the cash flow benefit of the scheme to the
company. To reverse that direction, Philips would have had to show that the
commissioners were behaving unreasonably in denying them the monthly
facility.
What then prompted Customs to take the action they did? To understand their
position, it must be appreciated that the VAT timing point used in the
export scheme is a general feature of the UK VAT system and can provide a
benefit even without intentional arrangement.
As the quarterly tax periods allocated to businesses for VAT accounting are
not all coincidental (Customs could not cope with 1.4m returns at one time)
there are three different quarterly return groups, the maximum variation in
period ends being two months.
In large commercial transactions, particularly property transfers, this can
be important because the VAT charge on a sale can be a cash flow cost or a
benefit, depending upon whether the vendor must account to Customs for the
output tax before or after the purchaser obtains the benefit of his claim to
the input tax.
There have been wholly contrived cases, which have demonstrated the timing
point only too well and have rightly been stopped. There was, for instance,
the enterprising individual who registered two businesses with conveniently
overlapping VAT periods. He then 'sold' an article of jewellery at a grossly
inflated price from one business to the other, thereby creating a charge of
VAT which could be claimed as input tax and banked for the remaining time
before it was to be paid over as output tax by the 'vendor'.
Nevertheless, it must be said that, in general, Customs have never been too
happy when the timing works against them, despite the rigidity of the tax
point regime which they insist must be observed by taxpayers.
When VAT was introduced on land and buildings in 1989, it was pointed out to
the department that businesses might suffer if they had to wait for three
months to claim the substantial input tax on the purchase of new premises.
At that time, Customs said that they would consider making early repayments
of tax in such cases, before the normal quarterly period end.
In reality, the position is quite different. Businesses which make unusual
claims to repayment of tax must undergo time-consuming credibility checks
even where the claim is made at the normal time. These will frequently
involve visits from the local VAT office before their claims are approved
for payment. Some of those checks are to ensure that the vendor has properly
accounted for the tax which includes a check on the due date for payment.
This attitude is an unnecessary source of annoyance, as well as cost, to the
trading community. On the whole, the VAT system works to the advantage of
the Revenue. However, the system which provides for easily administered,
self-assessed tax collection at each stage of the journey from production to
final consumer inevitably contains in its structure benefits for some
taxpayers. This should be accepted by Customs.
Further, the civil penalty system, progressively introduced since 1985,
allows for little or no mitigation when errors or defaults are made by
taxpayers. It is tempered only by a concession that in cases where Customs
are extremely late in making repayments Customs will pay a compensation
supplement.
Because these sanctions against underpayment of VAT are heavily biased in
favour of the Revenue it is hard to see the justification for tilting the
administrative balance of the collection system any further in favour of the
department. If a realisation of that fact was at least part of the reason
for Customs withdrawing from the Philips case, it would be an encouraging
sign of as yet unseen maturity in the administration of VAT.

FT  25 APR 91 / UK Company News: Ashtead seeks Pounds 5.8m and sees profit
fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ONRUSH of equity financing in the construction industry continued
yesterday when Ashtead, the acquisitive plant hire group, announced it was
raising approximately Pounds 5.8m net of expenses in a 1-for-4 rights issue.
The issue of 4.49m new ordinary shares at 135p represents a 15.6 per cent
discount to Tuesday's market price. Yesterday the shares slipped 2p to 158p
on the news. The new shares will rank for the final dividend for the year to
April 30.
The move is aimed at strengthening the group's financial position to enable
it to take advantage of the opportunities for expansion in the wake of the
recession, directors said.
'Our competitors clearly have had a horrid time, and we expect more to go
into receivership as conditions improve,' said Mr Peter Lewis, chairman.
Historically bankers have tended to let their troubled customers go when it
looks like they are going to be able to sell their assets, he explained.
Additionally, Ashtead considers that its 5 per cent share of the
highly-fragmented UK plant hire industry leaves it with significant scope
for further expansion.
The group's strategy through the current UK recession has been to maintain
its business infrastructure of 49 profit centres and increase its market
share even at the expense of short-term profitability.
The rights issue was announced as Ashtead forecast a near-halving of pre-tax
profits for the year to April 30.
In the absence of unforeseen circumstances profits will be not less than
Pounds 4m and earnings per share not less than 14.3p, the company said.
This represents a 49 per cent fall in profits from last year's Pounds 7.82m
and a 50 per cent drop in earnings per share from a previous 28.44p.
Trading conditions deteriorated in the second half, following a
disappointing first half which saw profits fall 31 per cent to Pounds 2.5m
(Pounds 3.6m).
Operating margins, although still among the highest in the industry, slipped
from 20 per cent to 18 per cent in the second half, resulting in a forecast
of 19 per cent for the whole year.
Pending acquisitions, the proceeds of the rights issue will be used to
reduce borrowings which have risen to about Pounds 14m. Gearing, which stood
at over 83 per cent at the year-end will come down to about 40 per cent,
directors said.
'I think we have taken our medicine in the form of this year's results, and
now we stand a better chance to benefit from any upturn in the industry,' Mr
Lewis said.
On the basis of its profits forecast, the group expects to recommend a final
dividend of not less than 3.025p making a total of 4.125p (3.75p).

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SOVEREIGN OIL &amp; Gas, the North Sea exploration and production company,
reported an advance from Pounds 1m to Pounds 3.9m in pre-tax profits for
1990 after a strong rise in oil prices at the outset of the Gulf crisis.
Mr David Biggins, managing director, said he hoped for some stability in the
value of sterling against the dollar this year to provide a reasonable
future for the company's business. The weakness of the dollar against the
pound had produced an oil price of Pounds 8 per barrel in February which was
'sheer misery' for North Sea independent oil producers, he said.
Sovereign is partly hoping to hedge its exposure to the dollar oil price by
increasing its stake in the Victor gas field which sells gas to British Gas
on long-term contracts priced in sterling. Sovereign increased its stake in
the field from 3 to 5 per cent with a Dollars 30m purchase from Superior
Oil, an affiliate of Mobil.
Turnover rose to Pounds 20.4m (Pounds 12.3m). Earnings per share increased
from 0.9p to 4.9p.

<TEXT>
CO-OPERATIVE Wholesale Society, the co-operative trading company which has
substantial interests in retailing, farming and manufacturing, raised
trading profits from Pounds 30.7m to Pounds 44.1m in the year to January 12.
However, pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 19.7m to Pounds 19.1m after a
higher interest charge of Pounds 21.8m (Pounds 13.8m). And following a
Pounds 10.9m loss arising from bad-debt provisions in the banking group
there was only Pounds 12.3m transferred to reserves in comparison with
Pounds 34.7m last year.
Sir Dennis Landau, chief executive, said the society's property development
and engineering businesses had also proved vulnerable to the downturn in the
economy but that retailing had proved resilient and had increased profits by
Pounds 6m.
He singled out for praise the performance of the Scottish retailing arm
which which operates a wide spread of outlets, ranging from superstores to
small shops in the Orkney, Shetland and Western Isles.
In total, the group's retailing activities now represent 30 per cent of
turnover.
Almost half of CWS's business is accounted for by supplies to its retail
society shareholders although these operations are run on a cost-recovery
rather than a profit basis.
Sales topped Pounds 3bn for the first time climbing from Pounds 2.68bn to
Pounds 3.03bn as the society benefited from the inclusion of North Eastern
Co-op, which joined CWS in June.
During the year, CWS spent almost Pounds 150m on capital expenditure.
Sir Dennis said this had helped sow the seeds for future development which
augured well for the future of CWS and the Co-op as a whole.

<TEXT>
SCOTTISH POWER, the larger of the two Scottish electricity companies due to
be floated in May, said it had raised its exposure in the electricity
options market with a 77 per cent increase in its option contract with the
12 English regional electricity companies.
It also said that losses of supply contracts to industrial customers in its
own area in the current round were significantly smaller than in last
April's round.
Last year Scottish Power lost 6 per cent of its business with large
industrial customers - which take more than 1MW - measured by volume.
Although that is lower than the losses suffered by the regional companies in
England, Scottish Power emphasised that it was not immune from competition
in Scotland and that has had a 'material' effect on the prices it can
charge.
Scottish Power increased its power sales in volume terms in the past year by
7 per cent through exports to England.
The company has agreed option contracts covering 320MW of power to the
regional companies compared with 180MW last year. This is not a contract to
supply electricity but a financial instrument under which Scottish Power
guarantees a price for power which applies when the price prevailing in the
electricity pool exceeds it. The regional companies pay an initial fee and
Scottish Power still expects to make money if it has to supply the power.
Mr Michael Smith, marketing and distribution director, said Scottish Power
had signed option contracts with industrial users in England in the current
round of contracts which outweigh by three-and-a-half times the contracts
lost.
Scottish Power recently agreed with another supplier an option contract for
well over 200,000 gigawatt hours of power with an unnamed customer,
offsetting option contract losses of 83,000 gigawatt hours.
Mr Smith said that Scottish Power's retail shops had roughly doubled their
share of the south of Scotland white goods market last year to about 25 per
cent, thanks to a large scale reorganisation and upgrading of its shops.

FT  25 APR 91 / UK Company News: Aquascutum chairman retires a year after
takeover by Renown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GERALD Abrahams, chairman of Aquascutum, has retired from the board of
the fashion company after 44 years' service.
His departure comes almost exactly a year after the acquisition of
Aquascutum by Renown, Japan's biggest clothing company.
At the time of the takeover, Mr Abrahams said that he looked forward to
working with Renown and continuing to run the company from London.
But his departure and the appointment as chairman of Mr Paul Bennett,
previously head of the company's Far East operations, is perhaps an
indication of the greater in-fluence Renown is now intending to exercise
over the business.
In particular, Renown is planning to speed up the development of the company
in North America and the UK.
Mr Bennett has also been appointed joint managing director along with Mr
James Stokes, the former vice-chairman.
Mr Abrahams' wife, Marianne, who was the ladies fashion director, has also
retired from the board.
They have however, been appointed the company's president and vice-president
respectively.

FT  25 APR 91 / UK Company News: Austin Reed down 48% as white-collar
recession bites
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTIN REED, the upmarket clothing retailer and manufacturer, blamed a
dearth of tourists and a 'white-collar recession' for a decline of nearly 48
per cent in pre-tax profit for the year to January 31.
The taxable figure fell from Pounds 6.9m to Pounds 3.6m, the lowest since
1983. Turnover declined by nearly 8 per cent to Pounds 78.4m (Pounds 85m)
and trading profit by 34 per cent to Pounds 6.5m (9.9m). Interest charges
were little changed at Pounds 2.9m (Pounds 3m).
Mr Barry Reed, chairman and grandson of the founder, said the start to the
current year had been the worst he could remember. He has been on the board
for 33 years.
The final dividend is held at 6.5p, making an unchanged total of 9.5p. This
was only just matched by earnings per share of 9.5p (17.3p).
An extraordinary loss of Pounds 1.3m on the closure of Cashmeres of Scotland
led to a retained loss.
Cashmeres, which was built up to 11 small US branches, had entailed an
investment of Dollars 2.2m (Pounds 1.3m) over the past 3 1/2 years, said Mr
Reed. Over the past two years it had lost Pounds 1.1m.
On UK trading, he said: 'The Gulf situation caused tourism to dry up which
affected retailing in London.
'While womenswear stayed level with the previous year, men's tailored
clothing was difficult. This recession has been atypical because it has been
a white collar one in London and the south-east.'
The group had closed two branches leaving a total of 40. About 10 per cent
of the 2,000 jobs in retailing and manufacturing had been shed.
In manufacturing, exports were up, sales to other retailers were 25 per cent
down and inter-company sales were static.
Borrowings (including credit finance) peaked at Pounds 20m but finished the
year at Pounds 14.5m (Pounds 13.7m), compared with shareholders' funds of
Pounds 54m (Pounds 55.8m).
COMMENT
It is possible to defend these figures as 'no worse than expected,' bearing
in mind the company's dependence on the highly elastic, south-eastern end of
the men's suit market. But there is still plenty of scope to quibble. Some
of the customers, for instance, must be in the less-squeezed, mortgage-free
bracket; the Cashmere venture was a failure; and the figures would have been
even worse but for a Pounds 500,000 property profit and a sharp cut in
capital spending. This year started with a 17 per cent sales fall in
February, since when some ground has been made up. Progress will come from
eliminating Cashmere's losses and lower interest payments; tight cost
control is promised. A forecast pre-tax profit of Pounds 4m, but a higher
tax rate, gives a prospective p/e of nearly 18 on the A share price of 170p.
Japanese takeovers of Daks-Simpson and Aquascutum have stirred up some
speculative interest, but with 60 per cent of the stock held by family,
directors and friends, it looks as though it will be up to the present
management to make better use of the prime sites and prestigious brand
names. They should be helped considerably by economic recovery.

FT  25 APR 91 / UK Company News: Ibex talks could lead to offer below market
value
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLARE PEARSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IBEX, the USM-quoted recruitment and employment agency, said yesterday that
it was in talks that might or might not lead to an offer being made at a
price materially lower than the current market value.
The announcement sent the shares plummetting 7p to 11p.
At 18p, they were standing at their lowest point since the company joined
the USM in April 1989, representing a steep decline in the company's market
value since it floated at 175p per share.
Ibex's market capitalisation at yesterday's closing level was Pounds 1.5m.
Ibex and Hoare Govett, its financial adviser, said they could provide no
further information on the situation.
Last September, the company reported that it had just broken even in the six
months to end-June, producing pre-tax profits of Pounds 7,000 against Pounds
1m in the corresponding period. That was after finance charges of Pounds
477,000 (Pounds 169,000).
Earnings per share were nil (5.7p).
Mr Hugh Laughland, chairman, then blamed the deterioration on a 'substantial
reduction' in demand for the group's services. Turnover was up at Pounds
17.77m (Pounds 15.23m) owing to an increased number of branches.
He also said the company had agreed to sell P&amp;M, its advertising business,
for a nominal sum.
The other main businesses are Austin Benn, a recruitment consultancy for
sales and marketing staff and ABC Contract Services, which supplies
temporary staff for the construction, warehousing and distribution
industries.

FT  25 APR 91 / UK Company News: Disposal helps limit fall at British
Dredging
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   IN 1990
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
a period when the UK building trade hit a severe recession - British
Dredging managed to limit its profits fall to just under 14 per cent, from
Pounds 4m to Pounds 3.45m.
The final dividend is raised to a proposed 4.8p, to lift the total from 7p
to 7.4p.
This marine dredging company is also involved in the supply of sand and
gravel, the manufacture of paving blocks, other concrete products and tiles,
builders' merchanting and ship repairing.
Mr Fane Vernon, chairman, said that the structure of the group was changed
significantly during the year by the sale in April of a 50 per cent stake in
British Dredging Aggregates to RMC Group for Pounds 4.39m and by July's
acquisition of Selco Trade Centres, the building materials supplier, for an
initial Pounds 3.5m.
Mr Vernon noted that the Pounds 443,000 contribution from Selco partly
offset reduced trading profits from established operations, where concrete
products fell to Pounds 792,000 (Pounds 1.23m) and marine aggregates to
Pounds 331,000 (Pounds 1.79m).
Group operating profits were down by Pounds 1.42m at Pounds 1.9m, though the
share of profit of associated undertakings rose to Pounds 308,000 (Pounds
13,000) and net interest received almost doubled to Pounds 1.25m (Pounds
674,000).
Earnings slipped to 13.06p (14.53p) per share. There was an extraordinary
gain of Pounds 2.58m (Pounds 322,000) relating mainly to proceeds from the
disposal to RMC.
The company was proud of its 'very strong' position, with net short-term
cash deposits, loan notes and investments at the year-end totalling Pounds
7.2m (Pounds 6.9m).

FT  25 APR 91 / UK Company News: ADT reveals Dollars 96m provisions against
sold Sechura businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADT, the Bermuda-based car auction and security group, has made provisions
of Dollars 95.7m (Pounds 56m), against businesses recently sold by Sechura,
a Canadian former associated company in which Mr Michael Ashcroft, ADT's
chairman and chief executive, has revealed an interest.
In a footnote to its annual report, filed with the Stock Exchange yesterday,
ADT revealed that last year Sechura disposed of a string of loss-making
businesses, and reorganised its capital structure. As a result of that
restructuring, ADT's former 47.8 per cent interest was eliminated.
Consequent on Sechura's restructuring, said the annual report, and 'given
the uncertainty with respect to the future value' of the businesses Sechura
has disposed of, ADT recorded 'provisions totalling Dollars 95.7m against
the carrying value of amounts owed by and investments made in these
operating businesses'.
The ADT report added: 'While the company may recover a portion of this sum,
the amount and timing is uncertain.'
The businesses Sechura disposed of had been sold to it by ADT in 1987.
Documents issued in December 1990 as part of Sechura's restructuring said
that Mr Michael Ashcroft and his wife, Susan, between them owned 29.1 per
cent of voting shares in Sechura.
Earlier this month Laidlaw, a Canadian waste management group which owns
28.4 per cent of ADT, sued the Bermuda-based group in a New York court,
alleging that transactions between ADT and Sechura had led to an 'illusory
profits stream' for ADT. The allegations were rejected by ADT, which
threatened a counter-suit for defamation.
Laidlaw withdrew its suit last week following an agreement that gives it
four seats on the ADT board and ensures that outsiders outnumber executive
directors there.
Laidlaw insisted, however, that it had only withdrawn, not dropped, its case
against ADT and said that investigations into its allegations would continue
through an audit committee set up by the new independent directors.
The ADT annual report makes no mention of Mr and Mrs Ashcroft's stake in
Sechura, and says: 'There were no contracts of significance during or at the
end of the year in which a director of the company is, or was, materially
interested.'
ADT shares closed 3p lower yesterday, at 86p.

Shares of Partridge Fine Arts yesterday fell by 6p to 73p after the antique
furniture dealer warned shareholders that trading in the current year had
been badly affected by the fall in the number of visitors, particularly from
the US.
Mr John Partridge, chairman, told the annual meeting that the decline in
trading would hit first half profits. The position would not improve until
more people came to the UK.
Turnover rose 2.9 per cent to Pounds 13.2m for the year to end-October,
although pre-tax profits advanced 28 per cent to Pounds 4.1m as a result of
increased cash resources.

FT  25 APR 91 / UK Company News: Poor second half as CI dips 38%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CI GROUP, the formerly acquisitive steel and engineering concern, saw
pre-tax profit fall 38 per cent to Pounds 4.83m in the year to January 31.
The decline, from Pounds 7.77m, came in spite of a 9.5 per cent turnover
increase to Pounds 93.75m (Pounds 85.61m). CI said this was accounted for by
acquisitions early last year.
Mr Albert Hargreaves, chairman, said the pain of UK recession had been felt
since October. Only Pounds 1m was added to interim pre-tax profits of Pounds
3.8m.
In the steel division, turnover expanded 8 per cent to Pounds 49m, but
pre-tax profit fell 34 per cent to Pounds 3.2m. Worst hit had been sales of
reinforcing material to the construction industry.
Engineering turnover rose 11 per cent to Pounds 44.7m, but profit fell to
Pounds 1.62m. The capital goods business slipped into loss as sales
plummeted by a third.
Early this year, Mr Cedric Grew, a driving force behind the acquisitions
policy, resigned as chief executive.
He was replaced by Mr Rob Yates, the former head of the steel division.
Mr Hargreaves said the resultant review of activities had focused on the
problem areas of reinforcing, capital goods and part of the foundry
business. Two factories had been closed and further rationalisation was
going on. An extraordinary charge of Pounds 1.46m (Pounds 696,000) was made.
Some unspecified costs were also incurred above the line, as the workforce
was cut by 7 per cent to 1,500 and Mr Grew was paid off.
Mr Hargreaves said the group had grown quickly and encompassed 20 companies.
'But probably 80 per cent of the turnover is generated by 20 per cent of
them.'
It would concentrate on areas where it had a significant market share or a
concentration of management skills. A prime example was industrial flooring,
where Redman Fisher Engineering had won a Queen's Award for export.
Operating profit fell to Pounds 6.64m (Pounds 9.31m) and interest charges
rose to Pounds 1.81m (Pounds 1.55m). Year-end gearing was reduced to 40 per
cent (44 per cent) of shareholders' funds of Pounds 16m (Pounds 17m).
Capital spending was cut from Pounds 3m to Pounds 2.5m.
Earnings per share slid to 3.77p (5.93p). A slightly reduced final dividend
of 1.225p leaves the total unchanged at 2.05p.
COMMENT
Several nettles have been grasped at CI, as the changed leadership has given
belated priority to managing recession rather than growth by acquisition.
Cash has started to move in the right direction and orders have picked up
since a dismal February. With 79 per cent of sales in the UK, the group has
obvious vulnerability and many uncertainties remain, not least over how much
more the reorganisation will cost. A second-half improvement might rescue
profit to another Pounds 4.8m, a prospective p/e of 7.8 on yesterday's close
of 29 1/2 p. Its 25 per cent discount to the engineering sector reflects
uncertainty over both trading prospects and the results of the
reorganisation. Until the picture is clearer, the share price is unlikely to
make much headway.

With the management preferring to retain commercial properties rather than
sell them at the depressed prices of 1990, Dencora, the East Anglian
property group, saw profits fall from Pounds 7.06m to Pounds 2.21m pre-tax
in the 12 months to end-December.
Net asset value was down 17 per cent at 280p (336p). Turnover dropped to
Pounds 34.34m (Pounds 41.22m), with a contraction in trading to Pounds
27.31m (Pounds 36.1m) and an expansion in rental income to Pounds 7.04m
(Pounds 5.13m). Net interest payable was Pounds 405,000 higher at Pounds
5.35m.
Fully diluted earnings tumbled to 7.7p (21.6p) but the single dividend is
maintained at 5.5p. Bank borrowings at the year-end were up at Pounds 71m
(Pounds 59m).

FT  25 APR 91 / Manchester wins Olympic heat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIKE A bruising heavyweight boxer scoring a famous victory, Manchester
out-slugged London yesterday and won the right to bid for the Olympic Games
in the year 2000. The result was a terrible mauling for the capital but a
powerful boost to Manchester and north-west England.
At a meeting of the British Olympic Association (BOA) in London, Manchester
won unanimous support for its bid and was thus catapulted into the
billionaire bidding game that will preface the millennial Olympics.
The host city for the Games of 2000 will be chosen by the International
Olympic Committee in September 1993. Manchester's rivals are expected to
include Berlin, Peking, Sydney, Milan, Brasilia and Belgrade.
Last September Manchester was roundly defeated in its bid to stage the 1996
Olympics, which were won by Atlanta. But it says it has learnt from that
episode, and that its new bid will be better and stronger.
Mr Bob Scott, chairman of the Manchester Olympic bid committee, said
yesterday: 'We're going to go hell for leather for 2000. This is not just
Manchester's bid. It is the British bid.'
London's campaign was led by Mr Sebastian Coe - Olympic gold-medal runner,
millionaire world record holder and would-be Conservative MP. After losing
the vote, Mr Coe, crest-fallen, claimed London had mounted a credible bid.
The hope had been that a successful London campaign would have proved a
fillip for development in the Docklands area of east London and a spur to
accelerating transport and other spending.
But Mr Coe was floored by a campaign led by an even richer man, the Duke of
Westminster, president of the Manchester committee, who told the BOA that he
was not a Londoner but had lived in Chester for 22 years - and his family
for 900.
From the briskness and gumption displayed by the Duke and his colleagues, it
was clear Manchester was going to keep bidding for the Olympics until it won
them.
Manchester city council has said it will underwrite the bid. Fourteen
Olympic-style sports venues are said to exist already in Manchester and the
North-west, with eight to be built or under construction by September 1993
and a further five at the planning stage.
Manchester claims that its transport infrastructure is the best in Britain,
and that the core sports venues and planned Olympic village would be within
15 minutes of each other.
Mr Graham Stringer, leader of Manchester city council, said: 'We are
determined to give Manchester, and Britain, the best possible platform for
its case to host the 2000 Games.'
A study by Kleinwort Benson has forecast an Olympic operating surplus of
around Pounds 190m if Manchester wins.
According to insiders Manchester beat London because of the technical
competence of its experience of Olympic in-fighting. What hampered London,
it is thought - the BOA would not say - was the capital's lack of an
umbrella council, its crowdedness, grime, and terrible transport.
Yesterday it was tottery old London versus a wily and free-punching northern
foe - virtually a push-over.

FT  25 APR 91 / IMF urges cut-off point for benefit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, LISA WOOD and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A CUT in the length of time during which unemployment benefit is paid in
Britain is urged by the International Monetary Fund, which also warns that
the UK is facing the deepest recession of the Group of Seven leading
industrial countries.
The IMF's suggestion of the benefits limit is a part of a package of
measures intended to curb the UK's high level of wage increases.
In its World Economic Outlook, the IMF says that action is needed to
increase the responsiveness of British wages to market conditions and to
promote labour mobility.
It also suggests 'increasing training programmes and improving the
functioning of labour exchanges' to prevent a rise in unemployment in the
recession similar to the sharp increase witnessed in the early 1980s.
Britain must maintain monetary and fiscal policies 'conducive to a
substantial downward adjustment in the growth of wages,' the IMF says.
While warning of the depth of the recession, the IMF says there is 'little
scope for a significant reduction in UK interest rates' unless this is fully
justified by sterling's position in the exchange rate mechanism of the
European Monetary System and clear signs that underlying inflation is
falling.
IMF projections point to a sharp 2.1 per cent drop in UK gross domestic
product this year. Growth next year is forecast at around 1.9 per cent.
However, unemployment will keep on rising in 1992 and is expected to average
8.5 per cent of the labour force next year compared to 7.5 per cent this
year and just 6 per cent in 1990.
Britain faces several years of slow growth, it indicates. Between now and
1996 the IMF expects GDP growth in the UK will lag slightly behind the
average annual increase of 2.1 per cent which was seen in the 1980s.
The IMF did not elaborate on its suggestion for a cut-off point on
unemployment benefit. The government said yesterday that it was keeping the
impact of the benefit system on the labour market under review but insisted
that it was not considering any proposals to cut the duration of
unemployment benefit payments.
Basic unemployment benefit, currently Pounds 41.40 a week, is paid in
Britain for up to a year, but after that individuals who have no savings can
claim indefinite income support at only a slightly lower weekly rate.
Mr Tony Blair, shadow employment secretary, said: 'It would be wrong to
think that a cut in the period of unemployment benefit would, of itself,
bring lower unemployment.'
Mr Blair endorsed other comments in the report, saying: 'I would agree with
the IMF in the importance of better training, a better employment service
and, in particular, we believe it is right now to adopt a temporary work
programme to prevent the unemployed becoming long-term unemployed.'

FT  25 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Lyonnaise
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There was some confusion in Paris yesterday about what to make of last
year's FFr1.425bn net profit from Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez, the first set of
results since the utilities and construction groups merged their activities
in September. A figure close to FFr1.5bn had been forecast in the pro forma
profit and loss account. Lower than expected capital gains as well as a
disappointing performance from the Canadian construction materials group
Westburne appear to be responsible for the shortfall. Lyonnaise shares
slipped FFr9 to FFr618 on the day, though that may have had as much to do
with the forecast that this year's earnings would only advance in line with
the likely 5 to 10 per cent increase in sales.
At this early stage of the venture, it is difficult to tell whether Mr
Jerome Monod's vision of an integrated group solving problems of
infrastructure around the world will succeed. He certainly would appear to
be getting the upper hand in what many suspected would not turn out to be a
marriage of equals, or so the earlier than expected disposal of Dumez's
electrical equipment businesses would suggest. That might even point to a
Westburne sale as part of the ongoing programme of asset sales, though now
is hardly the best time in the cycle to be speeding it along.
French utilities have been popular with investors and Lyonnaise has
outperformed the market by 5 per cent over the last year. But the market's
hesitancy is reflected in the fact that its rival, Generale des Eaux, which
swallowed Societe Generale des Entreprises that much earlier, has

FT  25 APR 91 / The Lex Column: ADT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Given the habitual secrecy of ADT's chairman Mr Michael Ashcroft, it was
never to be expected that the company's annual report would give many clues
to the real state of its affairs. But it does confirm what a deplorable
muddle ADT has become. Investors have every reason to ask why the disposal
of ADT's 48 per cent holding in Sechura has given rise to a Dollars 96m
write-off, or indeed why there is no suggestion in the accounts that a
principal shareholder in Sechura was Mr Ashcroft himself. Above all, there
is no real explanation of why a year which saw the issue of ADT paper to the
value of Dollars 335m also saw a horrendous drop of Dollars 842m in the
group's cash mountain.
As always, the answer will lie not in the group's operating businesses but
in Mr Ashcroft's dabblings around the fringe. So far as can be told from an
exceptionally opaque flow of funds statement, the operating businesses net
of capital expenditure, tax and dividends were broadly cash neutral in the
year. The same dabblings doubtless lie behind the drop of almost 20 per cent
in the group's net asset value in the year. It would be nice to know what
has happened to Mr Ashcroft's salary as a result of all this. Needless to
say, in accounts certified by Coopers &amp; Lybrand 'in accordance with auditing
standards generally accepted in the UK', we are not told that either.

FT  25 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Laura Ashley
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The transformation of Laura Ashley from small family business to closely
scrutinised public concern has been a painfully fraught affair. However,
yesterday's announcement of a second consecutive annual loss may prove the
nadir of the group's fortunes. Much has been achieved over the last year,
not least the overdue closure of its manufacturing plants. Gearing has been
brought under control through the disposal of peripheral assets, the arrival
of new Japanese capital and impressively brutal financial controls. Stock in
the core Laura Ashley business, for example, has been slashed by more than a
fifth.
There is a long way to go before the group can make the most of its prized
asset: an international brand name which covers an enviable product range.
There is still a big marketing challenge to be addressed, notably in
clothing, where the image badly needs bringing up to date. Cost pressures
from rents and wages remain intense, the plight of UK retailers is getting
no better, and the company has still to master the art of dealing with
third-party suppliers.
The shares - up a penny at 80p yesterday - have risen roughly 50 per cent
since late January. At that level, the prospective multiple is more than 20
times for 1992. It will be some years before police horses are again
controlling crowds desperate to throw money at a Laura Ashley issue.

FT  25 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Industry surveys the gloom
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,488.6 (-15.2)
A couple of days ago, the UK chancellor announced that his assessment of the
economy would henceforth rely more heavily on anecdotal surveys of consumer
and business confidence. The latest quarterly survey from the British
Chambers of Commerce will have dampened his spirits accordingly. The level
of home and export orders is plunging faster than ever, in both
manufacturing and services. Expectations on employment and investment are
down again, as is capacity utilisation. Against the odds, there is a modest
revival in business confidence. Significantly, though, it relates more to
sales than to profitability.
There is room for slight scepticism on the findings, since the Chambers of
Commerce survey does not have the same long history as that of the
Confederation of British Industry. But there is no reason to suppose the two
will differ radically. If the CBI confirms the picture in its quarterly
survey next week, the equity market will have to rethink the timing on the
recovery of the UK economy as a whole.
Equally, the chancellor might be tempted to rethink his views on interest
rates. But as luck would have it, sterling is proving a minor casualty in
the battle between the D-Mark and the dollar, besides perhaps suffering from
market nerves ahead of next month's UK local elections. Earlier this week,
it was the second strongest currency in the ERM after the peseta. It has now
fallen to fifth place. There is no real threat from the mooted rise in
German interest rates, since the D-Mark has meanwhile dropped to second
bottom in the system after the French franc. But with sterling now bang in
the middle of its divergence range, it is a risky time for UK rates to move
aggressively the other way.

FT  25 APR 91 / Letter: Water meters - a fair but costly option
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr M. R. HOFFMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr D. A. Fagandini is quite right (Letters, April 20) to point out that
substantial cost savings are possible with a water meter, though much
depends on the size of the property concerned and the customer's
consumption.
Thames Water has regularly told its customers about the meter option. We
give details every year with our billing document and our customer service
staff will offer advice to anyone who calls.
We believe that metering is the fairest option but it would be vastly
expensive to meter all private premises in our region. This is especially
true in London where installation costs could be as high as Pounds l,000 per
property because of the need to separate supply pipes. This should be seen
against an average household's annual bill of Pounds 130 - among the lowest
in the UK, and Europe.
Our price rises - up to 4.5 per cent above inflation for the next five years
 -are necessary to correct years of under-investment. Our aim is to give
customers one of the best water and sewage services in Europe and meet the
highest environmental standards.

FT  25 APR 91 / Letter: Quite a time for teenagers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This has been quite a time for the economic teenagers - those who rush to
dramatic but volatile conclusions on the basis of ephemeral indicators. At
the end of last week there were cries of 'credit crunch' on the basis of a
one-month drop in seasonally adjusted bank lending this March to Pounds
0.7bn (or 0.1 per cent) compared to an average of Pounds 5bn in each of the
preceding six months. A reduction of base rates, we were assured, was now
urgent.
Then on Monday there was the opposite alarm. The volume of retail sales in
March rose by 3.7 per cent above that of February. Now we were told that
base rate reductions must be put on hold in view of the vigorous rebound in
consumer spending.
Both conclusions were of course absurd. Next Tuesday we will have the Bank
of England's analysis of bank lending on a three, six and 12-month basis. It
has already told us that, on any of these bases, narrow money (M0) is well
within, but not below, the government's target range. Broad money, which the
government does not target, has been growing by between 6.8 and 9.9 per cent
per annum - if anything, reassuring compared with the double-digit rates
experienced for so long.
The idea of a retail sales boom is even more absurd than the opposite one of
a credit crunch. The main reason for the March upsurge was, of course, the
desire to beat the April VAT increase. A secondary factor was the early
Easter. On a slightly longer view, sales volume fell smartly in the final
three quarters of 1990 and recovered very slightly in the first quarter of
1991 to end up half a per cent lower than a year ago. In other words, sales
are just about dragging themselves off the bottom.
The trade figures are not now as fashionable as credit and retail sales.
This is partly because the recession has reduced imports, while the
discovery by the Central Statistical Office of hitherto unrealised invisible
earnings has diminished the current deficit by some Pounds 6bn per annum.
Nevertheless, teenagers found the estimated March current deficit of Pounds
432m 'disappointing' and 'double your money'. Why? Because it was twice as
high than February's erratically low deficit and because the so-called
market consensus was for a deficit of Pounds 300m. This latter guess was
simply the average of the previous five months; and the actual shortfall
from it was very well within the normal range of variation. The entire
deterioration is due to a swing from an erratically high surplus in volatile
items, such as aircraft and precious stones in February, to an erratically
low one in March.
If we look at quarterly export volumes, and exclude oil and erratics, they
have been roughly level pegging since the second quarter of 1990, with small
fluctuations in both directions. Imports, on the other hand, have been very
gradually declining with economic activity.
Arguments about the importance or otherwise of the balance of payments will
well up again with economic recovery and will not be stilled until there is
a single European currency and no intra-European payments figures. Roll on
the day.

FT  25 APR 91 / Economic Viewpoint: A country with a fix-price culture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When unemployment exploded in the early 1980s and then continued to climb
more gradually, ministers suggested that the phenomenon was related to
excessive pay increases. Indeed, the Treasury issued a mustard-coloured
paper, The Relationship between Employment and Wages, in January 1985, with
the unusual by-line 'Review by Treasury Officials', presumably to show
respectability.
Respectable or not, the thesis is true - although there is much room to
argue about how far the trouble is with money wages, how far with real wages
and how far with something more elusive, like real pay objectives.
The Treasury paper, written when ERM was under veto, concentrated on real
pay and estimated that for every 1 per cent it rose above some appropriate
level, employment would fall by  1/2 to 1 per cent (other things being
equal, which they are usually not).
Ministers were, therefore, puzzled and almost embarrassed when unemployment
virtually halved, falling from 11.1 per cent of the workforce in 1986 to a
low of 5.6 per cent in 1990, without any visible wage moderation and indeed
some modest reacceleration as the last boom got going.
The answer to the puzzle is, I am afraid, that part of the fall in
unemployment in the late 1980s was unsustainable. Economists who had no
political axe to grind hesitated to say this for good reasons.
They hoped that there had been a sufficient productivity breakthrough, and
not just a temporary boom-related upsurge, to raise the warranted rate of
pay growth consistent with high employment. They also hoped that the labour
market had become more flexible - that is, more responsive to supply and
demand changes - so that pay would respond to any required application of
the economic brakes without having to endure agonies of massive unemployment
first.
These hopes have obviously proved too optimistic, but more definitely on
labour market flexibility than on productivity. The official estimates
showing annual UK labour cost increases of 11 per cent, based on a 2 per
cent fall in productivity for the whole economy are as suspect as the trade
figures were before the statisticians found missing invisibles (see below).
Productivity has always moved with the business cycle; but the statisticians
may well have underestimated even year-on-year productivity, which the CBI
puts at nearly 4 per cent in manufacturing. Even with that correction,
British labour costs are still rising by about 5 per cent, compared with 1
per cent in Germany.
The real disappointment is that pay should have taken so long to respond to
the slowdown in demand which has been going on for more than two years.
Employers and unions appear to have responded not to fundamentals but to a
backward-looking glance at the headline Retail Prices Index.
There are two aspects of perverse labour markets. One is the rate of
unemployment required to maintain in being any reasonably low and stable
rate of inflation, once it has been achieved (the so-called NAIRU, or
non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment). The second relates to the
even higher transitional unemployment costs of moving from one rate of
inflation to a lower one.
Recent academic estimates of the UK NAIRU have varied from 6 per cent to 9
per cent, or 1.8m to 2.5m. Although much too high, it has, if anything, been
slightly less than actual average EC unemployment. The real British disease
has been the even higher transitional unemployment required to achieve each
percentage point reduction in inflation.
The late Sir John Hicks used to distinguish between flex-price and fix-price
economies. Flex-price economies respond to a slackening of demand by
reductions in pay and prices or in their rate of increase. In fix-price
systems, wages and prices have a large inertia and adjustments are made by
means of quantity. Stocks pile up, outside purchases are curtailed, and
workers are laid off.
The UK is by and large a fix-price economy. This is shown not only in the
stickiness of wage inflation, but of price inflation too in many sectors.
Employers respond to difficulties by cutting outside purchases, trimming
staff; but they reduce list prices or wages only as a last resort.
Eventually, of course, prices and margins do get trimmed and pay increases
do come down to what the international competition can justify. But after a
painfully long interval when many jobs have disappeared.
Gavyn Davies of Goldman Sachs is very likely right in pointing to the
parallel with the corresponding stage of the 1980 recession when both the
headline RPI and pay settlements suddenly fell with astonishing speed - the
latter from 16 1/2 per cent to 9 per cent in the course of the year. This
time Davies expects a drop from 10 per cent to 7 1/2 per cent. The headline
RPI will not, of course, be the basic cause of wage de-escalation, but the
fig-leaf which will be used to justify it.
But what a cost this fall in pay settlements will have exacted on both
occasions. Unemployment is now rising by some 300,000 a quarter and is
likely to be within spitting distance of 3m before the rise tapers off, even
assuming a gradual recovery from recession from mid-year onwards.
Eventually ERM membership should acquire enough credibility to speed up
these adjustments. In any case a change in business culture is as important
as changes in laws and incentives. The Thatcher years may have laid the
ground for this change. But it has not yet happened.

FT  25 APR 91 / Letter: The real roots of poverty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GEOF RAYNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As a former teacher in a supposedly 'ghetto' area of New York and today
a social services worker in Lambeth, I recognise - and reject - the
diagnosis of the underclass offered by the American academics presented in
Michael Prowse's sympathetic piece, 'The underclass is no illusion' (April
22).
However, if their diagnosis smacks of Thomas Malthus and Samuel Smiles, the
alternative that Prowse offers, that of mass relocation of the poor, also
has roots in a more repressive era. His suggestion of moving people out of
the ghetto en bloc, as was also achieved in 'ghetto' parts of London in the
final quarter of the last century and through urban planning in this, is
merely an act of dispersal and dilution. Sprinkle the poor through those
neighbourhoods with economic abundance, says this theory, and the problems
would be set to right.
But what is wrong with trying to redress - by economic, educationa1 and
other means - the injustices to poor people in the communities in which they
already live, and by activities which encourage their existing survival
structures? Individuals and families do suffer damage by deprivation, but it
has to be said that the problem is not fundamentally the people or even for
that matter, the place. What is missing from communities afflicted by
unemployment, drugs, or other perils, on either side of the Atlantic, is
hope - hope that is associated with individual and group economic progress,
community pride, and legitimacy of social institutions.
Until American policymakers discard Dickensian fantasies about lifestyles of
the poor and start dealing with poverty, they'll be as far off the mark as
their Victorian forebears.

FT  25 APR 91 / Hiccups over monetary growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TECHNIQUES to monitor monetary growth across Europe will be vital to the
operation of the new European central bank, due to be set up during the
final stages of economic and monetary union (Emu). Officials at the Bank of
England, in conjunction with other European central banks, are working on a
novel, highly secret approach to this subject. The FT has stumbled upon a
Bank briefing paper on the project, part of which we reproduce here.
The European Aggregates Targeting (EAT) programme is aimed at finding
monetary indicators that will faithfully monitor changes in the pan-European
economy. That is no mean task, given the range of economic and cultural
conditions across the continent.
Britain's role in EAT can be traced to the mid-1980s. Disillusioned with the
performance of existing monetary aggregates, a small team of Bank officials
started work on a Grand Unifying Theory (GUT) of monetary targeting. The
group explored new thinking that went beyond conventional monetarist
economics. It drew on people skilled not just in this field but in
biochemistry, an area where Britain has a world reputation for innovation.
The GUT team's radical approach paid off with the theory that changes in the
UK money supply could be modelled on genetically-induced interactions during
the digestion of food. The influences of genetic programming on this process
were found to be similar to the way that factors such as wage claims,
unemployment and production efficiencies affect the money supply.
The practical relevance of the GUT ideas was established in a programme of
tests, which used human volunteers with a range of genetic characteristics.
Virtually all aspects to the trials were satisfactory. Outbreaks of
inflation were characterised in the GUT model by localised physiological
disturbences. Ingestion of specific foods accurately simulated external
economic shocks; lobster for an England cricket victory, rice pudding for an
oil-price rise and a well-grilled steak for a broadside from the Bundesbank
on price control.
More quantitatively, the studies held out the prospect of a new regime of
monetary indicators - code-named Biological Universal-Rule Parameters, or
BURPs - which would be far better than any previous monetary aggregates.
Mr Nigel Lawson, then chancellor, was elated with the project's success. But
Mrs Thatcher, then prime minister, was more sceptical; apart from her own
personal disagreements with Mr Lawson, she had little confidence in the
practical capabilities of UK biochemists, whom she had never forgiven for
failing to patent monoclonal antibodies.
After Mr Lawson resigned in 1989, the GUT work foundered - until Mr John
Major took over as prime minister and recognised its significance to Emu. Mr
Major, whose straightforward eating habits based around a liking for ice
cream and brown sauce are well known, was instinctively attracted to the GUT
concept. He also seized upon the work as a demonstration of how Britain
could use its capabilities in the monetary field to the benefit of Europe,
following up the UK's pioneering studies on the hard Ecu currency. After Mr
Major broached the matter over dinner with the other European heads of
state, EAT was born.
EAT has led to the establishment of several loosely linked projects across
Europe. Germany, France and Denmark have led the way with a joint effort,
the Strategic Alliance Aimed at Monetary Indicators (SALAMI). Italy has its
Provisional Attempt at Short-Term Aggregates (PASTA) project, while Spain is
working on the Critical Inflation-Target Reduction Scheme (CITRUS).
EAT has found that, despite the cross-border differences in genetic
programming and eating habits, the same basic theories hold across the
entire continent. Although it is too early to be sure, we can hold out the
hope that ultimately EAT will produce an all-encompassing monetary index for
Europe, provisionally labelled the Highly Operational Target Aimed at
Inflation Reduction, otherwise known as HOTAIR.

FT  25 APR 91 / Letter: Sophistication of the Polish consumer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANDRE SPARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Although I am unable to devote the time necessary to refute each point
James Morgan addresses in 'Poland wakes to the day of the deal' (April 13)
let me bring just one of his mis-statements to light. In his attempt to
characterise Polish consumers as unsophisticated and naive, Mr Morgan writes
that Poland is filled with 'goods well past their sell-by dates, which are
incomprehensible to most Poles. The labelling of these goods comes in any
language but Polish'.
For a few weeks last year I conducted an economic experiment by working as a
street-side vendor in Warsaw. After all, how could I claim to offer economic
advise to Poland without a real, first-hand knowledge of the nuts and bolts
of the Polish economy? So I joined the crowd of Polish traders on the night
train to west Berlin, stocked up with several crates of Dutch chocolates,
returned to Warsaw, and set up shop on Marszalkowska Street. The first thing
that virtually every potential customer did was bring my attention to the
expired sell-by date. It was the worldly American who had unwittingly
purchased out-dated merchandise.
Likewise, with the ski jackets I was selling the next week. Although 'Made
in China' does not look much like 'Wyprodukowano w Chinach', it was
universally understandable - and unfortunately not much of a selling point.
It is the clever entrepreneurial spirit of the Poles, not their desire to
cheat and exploit, that will lead to Poland's return to 'western' Europe.

FT  25 APR 91 / Letter: Britain's march from a social market economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr BRYN JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, David Marsh ('A hard act for Britain to follow', April 15) is surely
right in identifying a gulf between the German reality of a 'social market
economy' and present arrangements in Britain. It is a pity that he didn't
emphasise the size of that gulf. The Thatcher era has not only left us with
a battlefield of broken 'social' institutions but with brigades of
enterprise warriors force-marching human and capital resources in the
opposite direction from the social market towards the 'free market'.
For example, in the field of vocational training, David Marsh is wrong to
say that Britain is already actively trying to imitate the German 'dual
system'. The core of the latter is the industrial craft apprenticeships for
Facharbeiter (skilled workers), as in the metal-working sectors. British
training has been, and is still being, pushed away from the
Facharbeiter/craft principle of training for broad-based potential
capacities, towards much narrower train-as-you-need-them 'competencies'; a
trend that the government's National Council for Vocational Qualifications
is actively endorsing.
When a British government has to turn social market rhetoric into reality -
if only to keep up with the probable institutional harmonisation for common
EC standards in training and other employment relations - the necessary
U-turn will be on a scale to match the retreat from Moscow.

FT  25 APR 91 / Leading Article: Days of hope in Moscow
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SUDDENLY, there is hope in Moscow. The statement agreed between the leaders
of nine republics - crucially including Mr Boris Yeltsin of Russia - and Mr
Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet president, offers the best possibility in
months for ending the zero-sum games which have been the stock-in-trade of
Soviet politicians.
They have agreed that they must, as soon as possible, sign a new union
agreement, adopt a new union constitution and then hold elections for the
union parliaments and perhaps the union presidency. But with that, they have
explicitly said that those six republics which appear determined to pursue
an independent course and not sign a union agreement, and which did not send
their leaders to Tuesday's meeting, have the right to do so.
At the same time, they warn that those which sign will establish a common
economic space, within which 'most favoured nation' status will prevail. The
implication is that non-signers will be on the same footing as former
fraternal allies in eastern Europe: that is, they can go, but they must then
pay hard currency for Soviet oil, gas and other products. This will be hard,
but it looks like freedom: an end to the 'internal Brezhnev doctrine'.
They have agreed, too, that the anti-crisis programme which Mr Valentin
Pavlov, the prime minister, laid before the Supreme Soviet on Monday will be
supported and that the strikes now paralysing important parts of the Soviet
economy should end. Mr Yeltsin seems ready to lend his authority to the
restoration of industrial peace.
Step forward
This is a big step forward. Most of these republican leaders are
increasingly powerful figures, so the deal, if it sticks, marks both a
further coup for Mr Gorbachev's political skills and an indication of their
own sober sense that they must, in these hardest of times, hang together if
they do not wish to choke separately.
But it is Mr Yeltsin's signature on the document with Mr Gorbachev's which
represents the main political breakthrough. The Russian leader will, in
seven weeks' time, run for the presidency of Russia. His previous
calculation, that his popularity would increase in inverse proportion to the
fall in Mr Gorbachev's seems to have yielded to an appreciation that if he
blows too hard, down will come Gorby, Boris and all. If the two most
powerful politicians in the Soviet Union can suppress their personal dislike
in favour of a political accord with clearly stated aims, the Soviet Union
may have a period in which it can peacefully dis-unite.
Western aid
Such an accord is essential if the country is to receive any of the western
aid, investment and technical assistance it must have.
There is, however, another large question: is the reform which the
republican leaders have agreed to support - the anti-crisis plan - actually
serious? Mr Pavlov says he wants to use the power of the state to effect
necessary sacrifices, steady the currency, balance the budget and increase
production. He has recognised explicitly that a socialist economy with no
fear factor cannot work.
But he also plans (small) privatisations this year and larger ones next. He
urges entrepreneurial behaviour. He has already pushed through price rises,
and has even freed some from state control.
There is much room for doubt. Many - not all - of the radical economists
associated with a more rapid dash for the market distrust Mr Pavlov deeply:
after all, as finance minister, he was responsible for debauching the
currency. He talks too easily of coercion, of states of emergency and of
force.
But if, in the fleshing out of his programme, he really is prepared to
bequeath decision making to the market-oriented republics and, more
importantly, to the enterprises; if he really can provide some space for
market behaviour and not simultaneously woo it and beat it, as Mr Nikolai
Ryzhkov, his predecessor, did; if he can keep the apparatus at bay - then he
may prove to be a reformer after all. And then the Soviet economy may have a
chance, even if it is a slim one.

GLOBAL RESPONSIBILITY: IN SEARCH OF A NEW WORLD ETHIC
By Hans Kung
SCM Press Pounds 12.95, 158 pages
This is a small mountain of a book. Its sides are steep and climbed only
with frequent pauses for breath, but the view from the top is worth the
exertion.
The difficulty of the climb stems from the author's ambition. Hans Kung, the
prolific Catholic theologian whose teaching licence was withdrawn by the
Vatican in 1979, uses this short work to outline his plan to spend the
coming years examining the history and theology of Christianity, Judaism and
Islam in pursuit of a secure, ethical basis for world peace. The spirit of
the enterprise is captured in the book's German title: Projekt Weltethos.
What a project]
But this is not a book for a closed theological fraternity. Dedicated to a
former Bundesbank president, one chunk of the thesis was shared with a
momentous meeting of the Davos World Economic Forum in February 1990.
In style, the book swerves between brilliantly compressed summaries of, for
example, theories of world history (Hegel to Toynbee) and slideshow slogans.
Its final words read:
no human life together without a world ethic for the nations;
no peace among the nations without peace among the religions;
no peace among the religions without dialogue among the religions.
Kung's thesis states that 'our new, post-colonialist, polycentric age, in
post-modernity' needs an agreed ethos which only religion can provide;
post-modernism, in his view, set in about 1918. Among its identifying
features are technologies capable both of drawing people together
(telecommunications) and destroying the planet (nuclear weapons and
environmental mis-management). And yet in this world of information
overload, there is a simultaneous tendency for old individualisms, cultures,
nationalisms and religions to re-assert themselves, most powerfully and
obviously in the Islamic world.
Kung accepts that 'those who have no religion can also lead a life which is
authentically human and in this sense moral', but he argues that without
religion there is no absolute or unconditional reason to adhere to or to
require adherence to religion's essential tenets: don't kill, don't lie,
don't steal, respect parents, love children and avoid immorality. Only
religion, he says, has shown itself capable of leading and influencing whole
populations, regardless of background and education.
Although Kung's unmistakably central European timbre betrays a hint of the
evangelist, he makes a specific pitch for unbelievers to join this great
dialogue on the grounds that even if you resist the claims of belief, you
cannot deny the political and social importance of the fact that millions do
believe.
Kung thus seeks at once to be open-minded, but loyal to his own creed:
steadfastness and self-criticism are the essential qualities he identifies
for the task ahead.
What, though, is the common threat which binds the great religions? For
Kung, the answer is 'the humanum', or basic human values. 'Religion,' he
writes, 'is true and good to the degree that it serves humanity, to the
degree that . . . it advances men and women in their identity, sense of
meaning and sense of dignity, and allows them to attain a meaningful and
fruitful existence.' The thread is thus clearly aspiration rather than
achievement, and perhaps even as aspiration it is too much the work of a
post-Englightenment European mind to carry the weight the author gives it.
It would be wrong, however, to imply that Kung is unaware of the
Eurocentricity of his intellectual heritage. He rejects both Hegel's and
Spengler's seminal theories of history partly on the grounds that they
ignore or marginalise Judaism and Islam. Arnold Toynbee, the British
historian, is viewed more favourably, but still found wanting in his groping
for some synthesised 'world religion'. Kung is surely right to recognise
that religions will remain stubbornly factional; the best that can be hoped
is that they learn to love dialogue more than they enjoy militancy.
As we look from Prof Kung's mountain top, it is not surprising to see
patches of haze. In his opening survey of the state of the world, for
example, he dismisses Japanese moral and spiritual life with a
superficiality which seems over-influenced by newspaper stories about recent
scandals in politics and business.
But mostly, we should be thankful for Hans Kung and his motivating judgment,
that religion remains decisive in human affairs and that peace, if it is to
be found anywhere, lies along the road of intelligent and well-researched
dialogue. Kung, an antidote to the conservatism of the current Vatican, is
the kind of intellectual the late 20th century needs; thorough, engaged and
with a global perspective.
Towards the end of the book, he mentions in passing the great protestant
theologian, Paul Tillich, who gave a lecture in Chicago in 1965, recognising
the need to re-work a lifetime of systematic theology in the light of his
emerging understanding of world religion. Ten days later, he died. As Kung
approaches his mid-sixties, with Projekt Weltethos before him, we can only
wish him a long and active old age.

FT  25 APR 91 / Arts: Ten new productions for Covent Garden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new principal conductor and ten new productions for 1991-92 were announced
yesterday by the newly ebullient Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. Edward
Downes is taking over on September 1 as principal conductor from Jeffrey
Tate. He will also function as associate music director, making life easier
for Bernard Haitink.
These days 'new' productions tend to have started life in some foreign opera
house, but five of next season's repertoire will actually have been created
in the House. They are Verdi's Simon Boccanegra, conducted for the first
time by Georg Solti and directed by Elijah Moshinsky; a very early Mozart,
Mitrodate, re di Ponti, which opens on the actual centenary of his death in
December, and a very established Mozart, Don Giovanni; a new production of
Wagner's Die Fliegende Hollander to replace the one recently booed off the
stage; and the first British professional staging of Rossini's comic opera
Il viaggio a Reims.
The five 'bought in' productions are Prokofiev's The Fiery Angel, never
previously staged at Covent Garden; Das Rheingold, to complete the new Ring
cycle; Meyerbeer's Les Huguenots; Bellini's I Puritani (the WNO production);
and Britten's last opera, Death in Venice.
The general director of Covent Garden, Jeremy Isaacs, also placated his
critics by announcing that he was asking many of the members of the chorus
aged over 50 to take early retirement.
The Minister for the Arts, Timothy Renton, has asked the Arts Council to
come up with savings of Pounds 1m on its devolution programme by May 17. He
is unhappy with the few savings that have accrued so far from the policy of
creating Regional Arts Boards with enhanced responsibilities.
So far out of a total Arts Council and RAB payroll of around 500 only 35
jobs are to be lost through the rationalisation. The Minister wants a 10 per
cent cut in the payroll bill.
Mr Renton has approved the first Arts Council list of 28 devolved arts
organisations but it is remarkable for the general unimportance of the
companies involved. It includes Aldeburgh, going to Eastern Arts, and
Northern Sinfonia, to Northern Arts. There is no mention of the big four
London orchestras, the ICA, the Royal Court, or Manchester Exchange, all
once earmarked for devolution.
It could well be that Tim Renton is not so keen as the Arts Council on
devolution. The new Boards are being recruited but they start life, on
October 1, not knowing whether they will handle the really major arts
companies.

<TEXT>
Vaut le voyage, says the guidebook; or vaut le detour. Not for Rambert's new
programme when you have to negotiate the horrors of Hammersmith Broadway.
And not, alas, for the way the troupe is performing this season. It may be
that the adjustment to an open space from a routine of proscenium
appearances has thrown the dancers off balance, but the company style looks
to me less polished and purposeful than of late years. A notable exception
on Tuesday night was Amanda Britton, who appeared in Richard Alston's Soda
Lake. This solo in silence is inspired by Nigel Hall's sculpture, which in
turn was inspired by the austere and isolated forms of a dry lake in the
Mojave desert. Miss Britton, with her wonderful linear qualities and clear,
fluent phrasing, makes a very fine impression in a piece that has previously
been danced by men. She reveals the watchful stillness of the piece in
movement that is beautifully poised, responding to the two austere metal
forms that are the sculpture (like a telegraph pole and a skeletal tree)
with images no less pure and controlled.
The novelty of the evening was the first performance of William Tuckett's
Slippage, fruit of funding from the Ashton Memorial Commission. Tuckett is
just starting to make his way as a choreographer with creations for both
halves of the Royal Ballet. He is still young, and I am not persuaded that
the chance to compose for a modern dance troupe is the best means of
extending his skills. For Slippage he has chosen a score of minimalist
chatter by Dan Jones, music that provides nothing to sustain choreographic
invention save the dubious merit of continuing to do what it has already
done at interminable length. The chief incidents of the piece amount to the
dancers peeling off layers of clothes - dull, and by Candida Cook - to
reveal themselves in dreary underwear (one chap looks like Captain Webb
about to embark upon the English Channel).
The dance, like the score, goes on. Four couples leap and walk, droop and
race over the stage, and part of the choreography has the innocent
springiness I associate with revivals of the sacred texts of early Denishawn
dance of 60 years ago. It is decent, and unmemorable, and Tuckett has
already shown us that he can do better things than this.
The problems of the Riverside space were very apparent in the revival of
Richard Alston's Dealing with Shadows. It is a piece altogether too
sprightly about a Mozart piano sonata, but when it was first seen at
Sadler's Wells last year, ebullient performance gave it a superficial charm.
In its present setting it looks diffuse and garrulous, and the choice of
printed tops and beach trunks as costume makes the dancers seem like
gigantic babies. The visual record of this season has not been happy.

FT  25 APR 91 / Arts: Frederick Douglass - New Jersey State Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW PORTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Newark is a romantic and vital place, easily reached from New York by
overground or underground train, architecturally explorable, ethnically
diverse. The biggest Portuguese community outside Lisbon lives there.
Italians abound. And opera in Newark is attended by an eager audience in
which English is the last language overheard.
The only big new opera to have been staged in or around New York this season
is Ulysses Kay's Frederick Douglass, which was put on by the New Jersey
State Opera for a single performance in Newark's Town Hall. It's a grand
Roman theatre, seating 2,700. One of the company's specialities is verismo -
Iris, Lodoletta, Zanetto, L'amico Fritz - performed under a conductor,
Alfredo Silipigni, who knows the traditions. Another is loyalty to singers
abandoned by the Met: it was in Newark that I heard Birgit Nilsson sing her
last Turandot, with Licia Albanese as Liu; and an Attila with Jerome Hines.
This season a Carmen with Fiorenza Cossotto was billed, but it fell through.
So did the second performance of a star-cast Lombardi, Bergonzi the tenor; I
made the trek to Newark only to find a 'Performance cancelled' sign on the
door. Money had run out, as in this country it is running out for musical
enterprise of all kinds.
But Frederick Douglass reached the stage, if only for a single performance.
The Mayor of Newark, Sharpe James,appeared as a super. I wish I could write
that it was a triumph; instead, I can find nothing to praise. I thought it
an incompetent opera. Douglass - a hundred years ago this identifying would
not be necessary - was an escaped slave whose oratory and whose published
Narrative (Penguin keeps it in print) stirred both the US and Europe. The
Narrative tells of a youth whose free, active mind rejected the notion that
he and his fellows should be lifelong a white man's owned chattels. William
Garrison, the great abolitionist, wrote truly that 'he who can peruse it
without a tearful eye, a heaving breast, an afflicted spirit, must have a
flinty heart.'
David Blake's Toussaint, Thea Musgrave's Harriet, and Anthony Davis's X have
given differing examples of how such matter can be more worthily treated. By
comparison with those operas, Frederick Douglass seems cheap and unworthy.
Kay and his librettist, Donald Dorr, concocted a clumsy, long-winded drama -
untrue to history, crudely and conventionally 'operatic', wholly
unconvincing - about how Douglass in his last years, ambassador to Haiti,
was brought low by a conspiracy of Washingtonians resentful of a black man's
eminence. Donizetti and Verdi would had have rejected it as ineffectual.
The libretto is poetastry, and Kay's music drones on and on in Puccinian
arioso without Puccini's command of melodic gesture. Kevin Maynor sang the
title role, and the veteran dramatic soprano Klara Barlow was Mrs Douglass.
Should we hail the show as homage to an elderly black composer (Kay was born
in 1917), or deplore it as time, money and talent spent on something
artistically worthless and unworthy?

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE ARMITSTEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The most obvious feature of Mike Alfreds' version of The Seagull for the
Oxford Stage Company is that it looks extraordinary, not because of any
design-led flight of fancy but because of its conception of the people
involved. The members of Chekhov's country house party appear like a cross
between the background interest in a Renoir painting and a convention of
Lithuanian nationalists. The men sport big-bottomed beards; the women are
simply big-bottomed. Even the luckless seagull, bagged by the fretful
Konstantin, is an albatross in all but name.
Biggest and brashest of all is Pam Ferris, whose Arkadina is no elegant
Muscovite, bestowing her refined presence on her country estate, but a
corpulent diva with an all-engulfing presence, who erupts into unconfined
temper tantrums and as quickly erupts out of them again. When she steps on
to her son's rickety little stage, after ridiculing his play off it, the
structure shakes under her weight, its little proscenium arch no match for
her voluminous coiffure.
One can well imagine her appeal to a restless spirit like Trigorin, who
could simply bury his sense of inadequacy in her massive bulk; likewise, she
makes it woefully clear why her son, Konstantin, has never grown up. Michael
Mueller presents a man spiritually and materially squashed by a mother who
bandages his head one minute and hurls insults at him the next. 'While I'm
away, you won't go click-click again,' she beseeches him. It is the nearest
she gets to acknowledging his desperation, her choice of childish euphemism
underlining her childlike refusal to face his attempted suicide.
The refusal is so complete that it makes a charade of her attempt to prevent
Trigorin from leaving her for the younger Nina. This central scene, which
anchors the characterisation of Arkadina to a sense that her day is past,
loses its meaning when it is played by an emotional illiterate. She weeps,
bullies and finally, having reduced Trigorin to hopeless tears, bustles off
with a smug smile on her face, her sense of her own importance confirmed.
Alfreds' preoccupation with grandiloquence of emotion and gesture creates a
sore problem for Irena Brook, whose visually lovely Nina - a gift for the
declamation of Konstantin's sweet nothings - signally fails to gather the
required stature along the way. Her reappearance, a fallen woman, in the
final act is certainly not the stuff of tragedy as Arkadina would know it;
this haggard little slip is merely pathetic - and rather less so than
Caroline Quentin's slatternly Masha, whose capacity for melodramatising her
misery gives her a sombre momentum.
So what of the men? One is tempted to leave them till last because they are
so entirely dwarfed by the women. Nicholas Clay builds the character of the
usually urbane Trigorin around a sphynx-like smile into his beard, as if the
successful writer is lost for the appropriate words. It is as hard to
imagine him indulging a casual amour as it is to envisage Roger Frost's
skinny schoolmaster fathering Masha's family, or Ric Morgan's brusque doctor
sustaining a 20-year liaison with Dawn Keeler's fluttery Polina. It is all
interesting and different enough, until one starts to look for the
Chekhovian heart.

'If the doors of perception were cleansed everything would appear as it is,
infinite.'
It was astute of William Blake, a film critic before his time, to associate
the notion 'doors' with the notion 'infinite.' Oliver Stone's film The Doors
seems infinite, though it lasts a mere 141 minutes. Yet it shows not the
remotest perception of what was 'infinite' in the Blake-ian sense about The
Doors' music. Even I, a non-rockomane, recognise in Jim Morrison's
broody-thunderous songs a power born of some pyromaniac vision in the soul.
Stone's vision is the same as the one he brought to Platoon and Born On The
Fourth Of July. Well-upholstered hyperbole drives on the story, with a few
tinny morals attached like cans to a wedding car. Drug-prone
composer-vocalist Morrison, though played and sung with spitting-image
similitude by Val Kilmer, is presented as a messiah in search of martyrdom.
Society is out to get him, but who in this film is 'him'? No human being
dwells inside the mad eyes and the marijuana'd wisecracks. ('I don't
remember being born,' he tells a reporter, 'it must have been during one of
my blackouts'). This Morrison was a bio-pic legend even before he was born.
The whole film starts with the assumption of immortality then tries to climb
higher into Rock Era inspirationalism. Socking on through concert after
concert (mixing real and staged footage), traversing ever dottier sexual
skirmishes with girlfriend Meg Ryan or groupie Kathleen Quinlan ('Have you
ever tried drinking blood?'), the story's ascent is interrupted only by the
odd dutiful attempt to 'explain' Morrison. He may have been traumatised as a
child by the sight of a roadside accident (cue surreally bleached
flashback). Or he may have been a free soul spurred to revolt by society's
moral pressures or the Vietnam war or . . . What the hell. Suffice it that
he is a genius and the film is two hours of designer idolatry. Stone's
Steadicam powers on through rock stadiums and hotel corridors, tracking
after its hero like a mad lepidopterist chasing a butterfly.
Occasionally the headlong chase yields a glimpse of some Elysian
possibility. The film could have been a pop-world mockumentary in the style
of This Is Spinal Tap, but its funny lines are strictly unintentional. ('I
had enough of this shit with Janis,' screams a studio manager at a
misbehaving Morrison). It could have confined itself to what it does best:
re-constructing the concerts via fact and fiction. Stone comes into his
barnstorming own here: the thousands of extras are whipped into a plausible
frenzy, as the air crackles to 'Come on, baby, light my fire' or 'This is
the end.' At these moments Morrison-fever means something. Elsewhere in The
Doors it means only Hollywood's latest bid to be with it by jumping on a
bandwagon that vanished 20 years ago.
White Palace starts out as a steamy slice of erotic life only to end up a
soggy May-December romance. Max (James Spader) is an effete Yuppie adman who
is emotionally scarred by the accidental death of his wife. He seems
destined for a life of tortured celibacy until he meets Nora (Susan
Sarandon), a brassy hamburger waitress 16 years his senior. Against all the
odds, the two fall madly in love, bonded not only by intense sexual desire
but also by shared tragedy - Nora lost her teenage son to drugs. Their first
few dates see them proceeding all the way from the sofa to the waterbed,
with Nora using her considerable skills and experience to draw Max out of
his cocoon of impotent self-pity.
So fa so good. In these opening scenes director Lius Mandoki elicits the
film's erotic tension with a steady, stylish hand. Spader's unctuous
self-containment, reminiscent of his fine performance in sex, lies and
videotape, is perfect for his character, while Sarandon is eminently
believable as a woman determined to keep middle age at bay by sheer sensual
will. Unfortunately, their energy flags about a half-hour into the film,
transforming it into a quirky love story far less engrossing than the
initial pyrotechnics promised. There's a squabble over a vacuum cleaner, an
embarrassing visit by Nora's clairvoyant sister (Eileen Brennan), and the
inevitable confrontation when Max brings his older, declasse girl home to
meet family and friends. Sarandon is much less convincing making impassioned
pleas for the working class to Spader's smug relations than she is showing
him the sensual ropes. After all this soppy domesticity, it comes as little
surprise that heir final reconciliation is sealed with a chaste, public
kiss, in which eroticism is joked about rather than explored.
It also comes as little surprise that Bill Murray plays a robber in Quick
Change. There can be few more apt roles for one of modern cinema's most
adept scene stealers. In fact, everything about this light, engaging comedy
suits Murray perfectly, lending him a perfect vehicle for his wry asides and
deadpan double-takes. He plays an ambitious thief who, with the help of a
clown suit, a sexy girlfriend (Geena Davis) and a doltish sidekick (Randy
Quaid), pulls off what just might be the perfect bank heist. Unfortunately,
the one thing that he doesn't take into account is making his getaway
through New York City, portrayed here as a thoroughly moronic inferno.
Maniacal bus drivers, lovelorn Mafia wiseguys and urban jousters conspire to
turn a simple trip to Kennedy Airport into a tortuous adventure.
Murray deadpans his way through it all with consummate skill, particularly
in the opening scenes when he takes over the bank. Despite attempts at
broadening his character with hints of a traumatic Vietnam past and a
romantic entanglement with Davis, he never stops being Bill Murray, even
when hidden behind a fright wig and white face. Everybody else - including
New York - plays off him with varying degrees of success. His fans will not
be disappointed.
Fans of the triumvirate headlining Scenes from a Mall - Paul Mazursky, Woody
Allen and Bette Midler - will be less satisfied. Everything is in place here
for a wonderful comedy, with the veteran satirist Mazursky directing Allen
and Midler as a successful Beverly Hills couple (she's a best-selling author
of psychobabble, he's a sports lawyer) publicly feuding their way through
their 16th wedding anniversary. The movie is strangely flat, however,
despite an occasionally trenchant script by the director and Roger L. Simon.
The problem, surprisingly, is with the leads, who suffer from a
disappointing lack of chemistry. When mixed, these two potent and precious
elements fizzle out rather than ignite. Allen bravely plays against his
usual screen persona, sporting a pony tail and singing the praises of Los
Angeles, but is never altogether convincing. Nor is Midler, whose frenetic
mastery is only sometimes glimpsed, such as when she publicly pelts her
wayward husband with sushi. For the most part, she's as subdued and aimless
as the picture itself.
It's a shame that Wings of Fame isn't a bit more subdued. In it, Peter
O'Toole plays a pompous actor who is gunned down by a deranged fan (Colin
Firth). When the assassin perishes as well, their spirits are barged to the
netherworld, depicted here as a posh island hotel inhabited by famously dead
souls. It is a last resort of sumptuous comfort and profound ennui -
Hemingway shoots clay pigeons, Einstein saws away at his fiddle, even Lassie
makes an appearance, lurking in the bushes. All wait in dread of the moment
when their earthly fame runs out and they will be consigned to the much less
cozy mists of oblivion.
Despite the overblown symbolism of hooded boatmen, cadaverous bellhops and
blindfolded archers, writer/director Otakar Votocek has a simple point to
make - in a godless world, fame is the only form of immortality going. He
would have fared far better to ease up on the skewered allegory and focus on
the complex relationship between O'Toole and Firth, who both labour
heroically to salvage the film from its pretensions. O'Toole is
characteristically dissolute and charming, maintaining his legendary poise
even in a film that sends him to Hell and back.

FT  25 APR 91 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Jockeying for
position - The battle in the TV listings market
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Until March 1 this year the market for television listings magazines in the
UK was a market like few others, quaint even by British standards. All over
the rest of Europe a diversity of listings magazines, some countries with as
many as 30, is normal.
Yet in Britain there was only the Radio Times for BBC programmes and later
on TV Times for commercial television. Each jealously guarded its monopoly
and sued any publisher which broke it. The only limited exception was for
newspapers - they could print weekday schedules 24 hours in advance, 48
hours at weekends.
The listings duopoly was nearly overturned by the Monopolies Commission in
1985. The commission found that the listings duopoly was anti-competitive
but, on the casting vote of the chairman, Sir Godfray Le Quesne, strangely
it found that it was not against the public interest. A suggestion by the
commission that other publishers should be able to get the information under
licence was ignored.
The drama intensified in December 1988 when the European Commission ruled
that the titles of programmes should be freely available. A year later the
then Home Secretary Douglas Hurd denounced 'the dotty duopoly' and set the
beginning of last month as the date for opening up the market.
Partly because of the government's own Copyright Act which strengthened the
concept of intellectual property, the 'dotty duopoly' could not be
overturned entirely.
In future, however, the broadcasters had to make the listings available to
any other legitimate publisher under licence - a licence they could charge
for.
For the first time the British viewing public is able to get all its
programme schedules - BBC, commercial television, satellite and cable -
under one cover.
The controversy is, however, far from over. Companies such as ITP,
publishers of TV Times and What's On TV, are threatening to take the BBC to
court in the UK and to Brussels for abusing its dominant position by using
its own airtime to promote its magazines such as Radio Times.
Newspapers are also angry because they now have to pay for listings material
that once was free - some weekly papers are even boycotting programme
listings because they cannot afford them.
Formal complaints have been made to the Copyright Tribunal, the body that
will adjudicate on fair rates for listings.
It's all a long way from the hopes of the original campaigners who argued
that publicity for television programmes benefited broadcasters and that
programme details should simply be available for free.

FT  25 APR 91 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Of hard hats and
brownie points - A government/commerce approach to road safety
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Malcolm Rifkind, the UK's transport minister, launched a campaign this
week aimed at improving safety for child cyclists, Halfords basked in the
glow of its public-spiritedness.
The motor accessories retailer is one of several companies to take advantage
of the opportunities offered by the Department of Transport to enhance their
corporate image by helping to promote road safety.
This year the DoT is raising the amount spent on road safety publicity from
Pounds 4.75m to Pounds 6m. Since last year, campaigns on subjects ranging
from drink-driving to aircraft security have all come under the Safety on
the Move umbrella.
An important element is the initiative on child safety which concentrates on
two big campaigns a year. The first of these last autumn featured Texaco's
'Children should be seen and not hurt' campaign.
For the companies involved, the return on their investment - which typically
includes disseminating literature and providing equipment at cost - cannot
be measured in terms of profit on the promoted item promoted. It could,
however, be argued that the products resemble loss leaders and win it more
customers.
Instead, they count on a boost to their image. 'We get the benefit of being
associated with a government campaign. We are seen to be responsible
retailers,' says Hugh Birley, a spokesman for Halfords.
The DoT is not shy in extracting some benefit for consumers in return for
the companies' public earning of brownie points. In Halfords' case it
suggested that the retailer might supply helmets for child cyclists at a
more accessible price than the usual Pounds 23 to Pounds 24. For the offer
period, the helmet will be sold for Pounds 14.99, the wholesale price.
There are, however, limits to the closeness of the relationship between
government and the commercial concern. The department is keen to dispell any
impression that it is using taxpayers' money to help a company's advertising
campaign.
No product is endorsed - 'we don't say buy this or buy that' - nor are there
any exclusive arrangements. For instance, Mothercare and Elastoplast are
also involved in the child cyclist campaign.
Because of the delicacy of the relationship, Miller &amp; Leeves WAHT, the
advertising agency used by the DoT, is careful which companies are invited
to take part. Peter Jones, the director responsible, says: 'Part of our
remit is to find companies interested in the marketing of road safety.'
One company Jones describes as having a suitable track record is Kwik-Fit,
the tyre and exhaust company. It is contributing to publicity about new
legislation which, from July 1, will make it compulsory for adult back-seat
car passengers to wear safety belts.
The law applying to children came into force in 1989, when Kwik-Fit mounted
its original 'Belt up in the Back' campaign.
Peter Holmes, marketing director of the Edinburgh-based company, says it
first ventured into the safety area in 1987 when it launched its offer to
fit toddler safety seats for Pounds 34.90, with the promise to take back the
seat and refund the money once the child had reached the age of four.
The rear seat-belt legislation, however, can only go so far; it can only be
enforced if the belts are already fitted and the DoT estimates that a third
of the UK's 19m cars do not have them. Part of Kwik-Fit's role will be to
offer a fitting service.

FT  25 APR 91 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): TV schedules
publishing wars
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The fiercest marketing battle for 30 years has broken out in the once sedate
world of publishing television programme schedules.
This has been generated by the British government's decision to end the
duopoly of programme listings held by TV Times and the BBC's Radio Times.
The market, at least in theory, is now open to any publisher willing to pay
for the information under licence.
As a result, the established titles and the new entrants are jockeying for
position and market share; as much as Pounds 20m has been spent on
advertising and promotion.
There has even been the first casualty - one of the new entrants, TV Plus,
collapsed after only three issues. Some potential players didn't even make
it to the starting line; the Daily Telegraph closed its television magazine
7 Days before deregulation and Rupert Murdoch's candidate, the British
version of the US TV Guide veered off to concentrate on satellite TV
programmes.
'This market is not for the faint-hearted,' says John Matthews, managing
director of Independent Television Publications - with more than a touch of
understatement. ITP is the publisher of TV Times and a cheaper entrant to
the market, What's On TV.
Until March 1 viewers who wanted advanced listings had to pay 50p each for
TV Times and the Radio Times. Just over 3m households regularly bought a
programme journal; about 88 per cent of them bought both. This amounted to
only 15 per cent of households with a television compared with 80 per cent
in the Netherlands, 30 per cent in France and 28 per cent in Italy.
In the UK now there are four paid-for magazines giving all the programmes
including those on satellite; at least two more are under consideration.
Britain's two leading popular newspapers, The Sun and the Daily Mirror, now
include special listings supplements in Saturday's editions which cover the
whole week's programmes.
But this has potentially tricky consequences; circulation on Saturdays has
increased but sales for the rest of the week have gone down. Robert Maxwell,
the publisher of Mirror Group Newspapers, says that he will review the
situation in two months.
Time Out magazine has seen a significant increase in circulation since it
has been carrying full TV listings. The full week's listings are also
available in the popular celebrity magazine, Hello.
But the publication to have made the most significant entry to the scene
comes from the German publisher, H Bauer. Having scored two successes in the
UK women's weekly market with Bella and Take A Break, and planned its move
for nearly two years, Bauer then sat out the first four weeks of the
liberalised market before launching TV Quick with all guns blazing.
'We really wanted to be sure that the product was absolutely right before we
launched,' says Alan Urry, managing director of Bauer in the UK, who
explains that the company had wanted to allow a little of the dust to
settle.
Some of that dust settled on TV Plus which, after an estimated initial sale
of 500,000, sank to 220,000 and closed; Hamfield Publications, the company
behind it, went into receivership before TV Quick even appeared. Bauer aimed
TV Quick unashamedly at the mass market with a cut-throat cover price of 10p
for its first four weeks and backed it with a saturation television
advertising campaign.
The strategy behind the pricing policy was to get as many people as possible
to sample the magazine; it seems to have achieved its objective. Between
1.85m and 1.9m were sold of the first two issues, giving TV Quick an early
lead over both TV Times and Radio Times.
According to Urry, between Pounds 5m and Pounds 6m was spent on the launch.
For its first four weeks, Bauer gave the 10p straight to the newsagents,
paid the wholesalers a distribution fee and shouldered the entire production
costs without revenue. The true test of its circulation will come when TV
Quick charges an economic price that Urry says will be between 35p and 45p.
Over at ITP, Matthews has also placed considerable emphasis on price-cutting
as a device to draw attention to the fact that TV Times now has news of all
TV programmes. For the first three weeks of the new competitive era TV Times
halved its cover price to 25p.
Radio Times was forced to respond - but John Thomas, managing director of
BBC Publications did not cut the magazine's cover price - although the
effect for the consumer was similar. The BBC seized on the fact that the
second week after deregulation coincided with Comic Relief, when comedians
and the public raise money for charity. The Corporation announced that
during the last two weeks of the special offer at TV Times the BBC would
donate half its 50p cover price to Comic Relief.
'We were absolutely appalled that TV Times cut its price - thus devaluing a
very well established brand in the marketplace,' Thomas argues. But TV
Times's Matthews says the price reduction was both planned and necessary and
was a strategy that worked.
The second string to ITP's bow grew out of research which showed that while
many consumers wanted detailed programme information, others wanted their
listings in a more concentrated form.
To meet this latter market and to try to extend the company's market share,
What's On TV, complete with a free TV planner board with the first issue,
was launched. What's on TV began at a discount price of 25p and had a single
week at 35p before having to match TV Quick's 10p cover price.
After a total ITP promotional spend of Pounds 10m by week six What's on TV
had a circulation of around 600,000 and TV Times claims its circulation was
1.7m, down from 3.1m before deregulation.
Falls in circulation of both TV Times and Radio Times were expected as
double buying of the titles fell away; the BBC says Radio Times sales fell
from 2.16m to 1.72m. The Corporation's promotional costs were about Pounds
5m including more than Pounds 1m spent on commercial television. It also had
considerable support on BBC television channels.
Thomas believes deregulation is leading to a polarisation of the market. The
BBC claims that more than 50 per cent of Radio Times readers are ABCIs, the
professional and managerial classes, compared with a TV Times figure in the
mid-30s. 'We think the UK public is realising what this is all about; there
is now an opportunity to increase the market not through pyrotechnics but
through careful promotion to distinct segments,' says Thomas.
He has researched a new listings title which could be launched later this
year, but refuses to say at which sector of the market it would be aimed.
ITP, too, has plans for a third title - a glossy upmarket magazine - but no
decision has yet been taken on whether to bring them to fruition.
Thomas says he would be amazed if another mainstream British publisher were
to enter the market now 'with the blood still drying on the wall', although
further interest from non-UK publishers could not be ruled out.
In two or three years' time when the market has settled down, Matthews
forecasts there will be five paid-for listings magazines in the UK with
total sales of more than 6m, 1m more than at present - a far cry from the
last time all Britain's broadcasting listings were available in a single
magazine: the Radio Times of the 1950s sold more than 10m copies a week.

FT  25 APR 91 / Technology: A crackdown on originality - Beginning a series
on innovation in the recession, Charles Leadbeater looks at how the economic
climate has affected investment in research and development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bombarded by the pressures of recession British managers might be forgiven
for putting plans for innovation to one side. But they would be gambling
with their company's future.
As the director of one of the UK's leading electronics companies puts it:
'We cut back research and development for 1988. We are still reaping the
harvest of this decision, which has left us 1.5 product generations behind
the competition. We are faced with the choice of leapfrogging generations or
getting out of the business.'
Innovation is becoming increasingly central to competition. It is no longer
enough to produce low-cost, high-quality items. Product ranges must be
renewed constantly to take advantage of the quickening pace of technological
change and create distinctive products which can command a niche in
international markets.
The Confederation of British Industry's Innovation Trends survey* published
on Monday showed that UK companies have had little success in reducing the
time it takes them to develop new products. Yet the need for new products is
becoming more pressing. Companies reporting that the lifespan for their
products had shortened outweighed those who said it had lengthened by almost
10 to one. About 40 per cent said they needed to replace their product
ranges within three years.
The innovative capacity of an economy is a key index of its strength. The
impact of the recession upon the UK's innovative potential will have
implications for the health of the economy long after the recession is
formally declared over. Cuts in investment in 1990-91 might allow dividends
to be maintained in the teeth of recession. But by the mid-1990s companies
may find their product development pipelines have run dangerously dry.
Britain entered the recession with a record for innovation which was at best
mixed. The main source of industry's renewed competitiveness in the last
decade was a leap in productivity. Between 1980 and 1987 output per person
employed in the UK rose in real terms by 24 per cent, compared with 22 per
cent in Japan, between 12 per cent and 14 per cent in Germany, Italy and
France and about 7 per cent in the US. But have British manufacturers become
more efficient at developing new products?
A House of Lords select committee report** published earlier this year says
that many UK manufacturers invest too little in new or improved products,
plants or systems. 'They rely on doing what they have done in the past and
fail to seize new opportunities created by changing customer demand. As a
result their competitiveness declines.'
Gross domestic expenditure on research and development fell in the UK
between 1981 and 1988, but rose in France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the US.
Public spending on R&amp;D fell markedly while industry spending rose from about
1.2 per cent of GDP to about 1.25 per cent. This compares with a rise in
German industry's expenditure from 1.4 per cent of GDP to 1.8 per cent.
British electronics groups such as GEC have been criticised for avoiding
technologically important areas such as the mass production of
semiconductors. In retrospect this looks like a sensible decision as all the
big European semiconductor manufacturers - Siemens of Germany, Philips of
the Netherlands and SGS-Thomson, the Franco-Italian joint venture - are
losing money hand over fist on chips.
At best Britain's relative technological decline may have been arrested. It
has definitely not been reversed and there are signs that it has continued.
Is the British innovation system strong enough to withstand the battering of
recession?
Over the last 15 months the outlook for innovation has deteriorated in line
with the fall in confidence among manufacturers, according to the CBI. In
October 1989 a balance of about 35 per cent of manufacturers expected to
increase their expenditure upon innovation in the year ahead. By January of
this year the balance had turned negative - more companies expected to
reduce their expenditure than those expecting to increase it.
Yet it seems possible that innovation may not be cut back as far as other
costs and the cuts will fall unevenly across the economy. Throughout last
year manufacturers remained quite bullish about their spending on innovation
even though they had become deeply pessimistic about the business outlook.
This may mean that innovation spending could get away with a shave rather
than a cut, as long as confidence recovers soon (see graph).
Moreover cuts in innovation are likely to be spread unevenly across the
economy. The recession will widen the gap between those sectors where
Britain has well-established strengths, built upon heavy research and
development spending, and those where it is weak because it has
underinvested in the past. The recession will amplify the difference between
these two sectors.
Chemical and pharmaceutical manufacturers are the most buoyant about the
outlook for innovation. A positive balance of 20 per cent of companies in
the chemicals sector still expect to spend more on innovation in the coming
year. Only 18 per cent think their spending is less than adequate. The UK
entered the recession with a strong position in chemicals and
pharmaceuticals and is likely to retain it.
In contrast the mechanical engineering sector is among the weakest in
manufacturing, with one of the poorest investment records in the 1980s. In
this sector the outlook for innovation is poor. A negative balance of 10 per
cent of companies expect to spend less on innovation. About 44 per cent of
companies believe their innovation spending is inadequate. This sector will
be made weaker by the recession.
Yet it would be complacent to assume that areas of traditional strength will
escape unscathed. The defence-related areas of aerospace and electronics are
cases in point. Within the overall recession is a specific defence recession
brought on by cuts in military expenditure.
Defence accounts for 51 per cent of UK government spending on research and
development and 20 per cent of total UK research and development. Defence is
one of Britain's specialisms. Military research feeds much of the civil
aerospace and electronics industries. Thus the British innovation system
will be particularly hit by cuts in defence-related research.
A development which may counterbalance the decline in defence is the
increase in foreign investment in innovation in the UK. The share of British
R&amp;D accounted for by foreign companies rose from 4 per cent in 1967 to 13
per cent in 1986. In areas such as consumer electronics and automobile
assembly the UK has become almost wholly dependent upon foreign groups. In
the long run the prospects for innovation in the UK will increasingly turn
upon whether large foreign groups choose to complement their UK
manufacturing plants with research facilities.
Small companies may fare worse than larger groups. The CBI survey found that
45 per cent of companies which employ fewer than 50 people felt their
spending on innovation was inadequate, compared with 30 per cent of
companies employing between 1,000 and 5,000.
Innovation is the product of a complex process involving a range of
ingredients. It seems likely that companies will cut back on some elements
of innovation, while continuing to invest in others. According to the CBI,
in manufacturing as a whole investment in formal R&amp;D will fall this year.
Yet there could be an expansion in the resources devoted to other elements
of innovation such as training. David Lees, chairman and chief executive of
GKN, the automotive and industrial services group, says: 'In 1980 we cut
back on training. This time we will not do that.'
Joint ventures with foreign companies are set to expand. About 50 per cent
of manufacturers are planning to put more effort into joint ventures which
bring access to technology, according to the CBI. Some groups such as Smiths
Industries in aerospace and John Brown in engineering pride themselves upon
being highly skilled buyers, integrators and appliers of technology to
specific markets rather than inventing it in house.
Perhaps most importantly the best British companies have developed a
management culture of continuous, incremental improvement to products and
processes which will continue through the recession.
Indeed one beneficial side-effect of this recession may be to expose the
relative fragility of the British approach to innovation. In the wake of the
1980-81 recession government policy and management effort was directed at
improving labour productivity, through trade union reform, de-manning and
the introduction of reformed working practices. The recession of 1990-91 may
well yield a different, and altogether more complicated, task - to shore up
and strengthen the British capacity to innovate.

FT  25 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Fears over warheads discounted -
Defence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEARS that the nuclear warheads to be fitted to Britain's Trident missiles
could be unsafe were discounted by Mr Kenneth Carlisle, junior defence
procurement minister, in the Commons last night.
He gave an assurance that the warheads would be designed and manufactured in
the UK and would not be affected by the problems which led to the closure of
the plant at Rocky Flatts, near Denver, which produced missiles for the US
Trident force.
Concern over the warheads was raised by a US Congress armed services
committee report warning of the risk of 'unintended detonations'.
Mr Carlisle said the British made warheads would be subject to a series of
trials and independent assessments to ensure safety before and during
operational service.
He rejected opposition criticism of the Atomic Weapons Establishment Bill
which provides for private contractors to undertake the management of the
atomic weapons establishments at Aldermaston, Burghfield, Cardiff and
Foulness.

FT  25 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Hurd to press Kuwaitis on human
rights - Foreign Office Questions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DOUGLAS HURD, the foreign secretary, will raise concerns over human
rights abuses when he visits Kuwait at the beginning of next month. Mr Hurd
will be also be going to Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan between May 1st and
5th.
In the Commons yesterday he said the government was taking seriously the
recent report by Amnesty International on the torture of Palestinians and
others in Kuwait.
'We take the Amnesty report seriously, because it's been made clear by us to
Kuwaiti ministers before the liberation, that we believe this should be a
new and hopeful chapter in the history of Kuwait,' said Mr Hurd.
While some retaliation and disorder was understandable, Mr Hurd said he
would reinforce the message he had given the government in exile.
During foreign office questions, MPs from both sides urged Mr Hurd to give
an assurance that foreign policy would remain the concern of individual
countries within the EC.
Mr Peter Shore (Lab Bethnal Green and Stepney) said divisions within the
European Community over the Gulf were 'very worrying indeed'.
He said the government should 'oppose the extension of majority voting to
any aspect of foreign policy'.
Mr David Wilshire, (Con Spelthorne) said it was possible to be a good
European by supporting economic aspects of the EC while questioning the
wisdom of a common foreign policy.
The advantage to Britain of joint action within the community should not be
under-rated, said Mr Hurd who pointed to the relief effort for the Kurds as
a good example of the twelve member countries working together effectively.
Later Mr Hurd defended the presence of British troops in Iraq after warnings
from a backbench MP about getting involved in the internal politics of Iraq.
'The purpose of the presence of our troops in northern Iraq is purely
humanitarian,' said Mr Hurd.
That did not prevent the government, when asked, from saying it believed the
Kurds should have autonomy within the boundaries of Iraq, he said.
Mr Douglas Hogg, the foreign office minister, insisted yesterday that full
diplomatic links with Iran would not be restored until the three British
hostages held in Lebanon were released.
'We believe Iran has a decisive influence over their future,' he said.

Corporate Affairs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Redwood, corporate affairs minister, told the Commons yesterday the
Government was 'concerned' about threats made by certain national brewers to
serve their tenants with notices to quit.
He said the tenants involved were not yet protected by the Landlord and
Tenant Act 1990 extending to pub tenants the same protection as other
business tenants.
The Act requires brewers, for the first time, to pay statutory compensation
to tenants whose pubs are taken back into management, but does not become
fully effective until July 1992.
Mr Redwood said it was understood that most of the notices to quit had been
served for the purpose of renegotiating the terms of tenancy agreements and
would not ultimately lead to evictions.
The Government has begun appointing advisers for the flotation of part or
all of its remaining 48 per cent holding in British Telecom.
In the Commons yesterday Mr Francis Maude, financial secretary to the
Treasury, said no decisions had been taken about the timing and number of
shares to be sold.

FT  25 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Party set to discipline councillors
 -Lambeth Council
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LABOUR Party's national executive is intending to bring disciplinary
charges against thirteen suspended Lambeth councillors.
At a meeting yesterday the NEC committee reaffirmed its decision to suspend
members of the south London borough for 'continual breaches of the rules of
the party' and agreed to consider drawing up charges to go to the party's
national constitutional committee.
At this stage the councillors could face expulsion from the party.
Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, said at the meeting: 'Who is going to be
convinced by people who say they are going to change the world and can't
even collect the garbage.'
The suspension of the councillors, which included Ms Joan Twelves, leader of
the council, followed council meetings which, in one case, voted against the
Labour leadership's policy by condemning Britain's role in the Gulf war and,
in the other, refused to allow bailiffs to be used to collect poll tax.
The meetings were deemed highly damaging to the national party.
Also suspended along with the councillors were Mr Steve Nally, secretary of
the All Britain Anti-Poll Tax Federation, which Labour judges to be a
Militant front group, and Mr Kevin Fernandez, a prominent member.
With the campaign for next week's local elections well under way, the Labour
Party's national leadership is anxious to distance itself from hard-left
councils like Lambeth which is considered by some to be an electoral
liability.
The remaining 27 Labour councillors in Lambeth have been told to write to
the council's chief executive stating that they are members of the Labour
group.
The NEC has also instructed them to elect new officers at their next council
meeting on May 13th.
Until then Ms Twelves, one of those who has been suspended, is technically
still the leader of the council.

FT  25 APR 91 / The Guinness Appeals: Saunders said to be suffering dementia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Ernest Saunders, the former chairman and chief executive of Guinness, is
suffering from incurable pre-senile dementia, the appeal court was told
yesterday. A scan has disclosed evidence of abnormalities of his brain.
Three doctors called to give evidence on Mr Saunders' appeal against the
five-year jail sentence he is serving for his part in the Guinness affair
said they had diagnosed pre-senile dementia and believed he would have been
suffering from it during his trial.
A doctor called by the Serious Fraud Office did not agree with that
'unequivocal diagnosis'. He said there was no definite correlation between
an abnormal brain scan and pre-senile dementia.
Mr Saunders, serving his sentence in Ford open prison in West Sussex, was
sentenced on August 28. He will become eligible for parole after a third of
his sentence, at the end of next April. Mr Saunders; Mr Anthony Parnes, a
City stockbroker; and Mr Gerald Ronson, head of the Heron group, are
appealing against their convictions and sentences.
Mr Antony Shaw, Mr Saunders' counsel, said the brain scan had been part of
an investigation carried out into possible organic causes for headaches from
which Mr Saunders had suffered for some time.
Mr John Chadwick, QC, for the SFO, said the Crown had been advised the
diagnosis was 'not impossible' but was not capable of being confirmed by
reference to the observations and tests so far carried out.
Dr Patrick Gallwey , a consultant with Devon and Cornwall Forensic
Psychiatric Services, said he had treated Mr Saunders in 1988. When he had
seen him earlier this month the change in Mr Saunders' symptoms, coupled
with the scan evidence, had been sufficient to diagnose pre-senile dementia
of the Alzheimer type.
Dr George Perkin, consultant neurologist at Charing Cross Hospital, called
by the SFO, said the 'bedside tests' carried out on Saunders would raise 'a
suspicion' of pre-senile dementia, but he would want further, and much more
structured, data. He said that undoubtedly if Mr Saunders did have
pre-senile dementia it would be a progressive disorder and it should be
easier month by month to make a diagnosis based on psychometric tests,
because changes would become much more evident.
The appeals continue today.

FT  25 APR 91 / IBM to shed 400 jobs at two sites
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Business Machines, the world's largest computer maker, is
rationalising its manufacturing activities in the UK with the loss of 400
jobs over three years at its plants in the south of England and in Scotland.
IBM manufactures magnetic disc files, the memory systems used in large
mainframe computers, at Havant in Hampshire, and personal computers at its
Greenock plant near Glasgow. The company said it remained committed to a
policy of full employment and there would be no redundancies.
The rationalisation measures are designed to eliminate duplication in
services to the two plants.
They will involve creating a single structure for planning, finance,
information processing and site services under Mr John Holmes, director of
manufacturing for IBM UK.
IBM plants worldwide compete against each other to manufacture particular
computer systems. The performance of plants making comparable equipment in
the US, Europe and Asia is closely monitored.
The company said yesterday that the chief aim of the rationalisation was to
improve the cost-effectiveness and competitiveness of the UK manufacturing
operations with the intention of winning more manufacturing 'missions' for
the UK plants. That did not imply that Havant and Greenock were less
efficient than their counterparts in the US or Japan.
Over the past three years, IBM has moved thousands of employees worldwide
from administrative positions into line jobs.
Many other workers have been encouraged to leave through voluntary
redundancy schemes as part of a restructuring operation designed to match
overheads to a market that has slowed from growth rates of more than 20 per
cent to 10 per cent or less.

FT  25 APR 91 / Public entry to police cases urged
</HEADLINE>

   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SERIOUS allegations against police officers should be heard at tribunals
open to the public, Judge Francis Petre, chairman of the police complaints
authority, said yesterday.
The authority, an independent government-appointed body, oversees
investigations into serious complaints against the police. Its annual report
published yesterday shows that it is supervising 60 per cent more cases now
than in 1987.
Judge Petre, introducing the report, said that the proposed tribunals
hearing serious cases would include independent representatives and
recommend punishments to chief constables. Less serious allegations would
still be handed by police forces internally, but with lower standards of
proof than at present.
The authority believes that the standard of proof in complaints against
police officers is unnecessarily high.
He also criticised the level of secrecy surrounding the handling of
complaints. At present, those making complaints are not informed of
disciplinary decisions made by chief constables.
Last year the authority received 7,156 new cases for consideration - 16 per
cent more than in 1989.
The authority's report expresses concern at the length of time taken to
complete investigations into complaints.

BUILDING SOCIETY receipts fell to Pounds 543m in March from Pounds 608m in
February, mainly because investors withdrew funds to apply for electricity
shares.
However, mortgage advances rose sharply to Pounds 3.356bn from Pounds
2.681bn in February as falling interest rates spurred homebuying. Mr Mark

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S engineering industry is unlikely to see any real recovery from the
recession until at least mid 1992 and has not yet reached the bottom of the
current downturn, according to a gloomy forecast by the Engineering
Employers' Federation.
Output, productivity, employment and exports are all still dropping, the EEF
said yesterday in its spring 1991 trends report. Employment is forecast to
fall a further 90,000 by this time next year to 1.9m, making a total
reduction of 210,000 over three years.
Mr Peter Brighton, director general, said the EEF's forecasts 'obviously
differed' from those of Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, who this week
forecast a slow recovery in output in the second half of this year.
Mr Brighton said he disagreed with the view of some in industry that the
upturn is already happening. 'The rate of decline is decreasing, but we
haven't reached the bottom' in manufacturing industry, he said.
He ger-term effects of a further decline in British manufacturing. 'The
simple thing is that our manufacturing base is now down at a level where it
will not be able to cope with the upturn,' he said.
That was the main reason why the EEF was relatively pessimistic about the
mid-term outlook for engineering exports. In the more immediate future, it
sees the decline in engineering exports, which began in the second half of
last year, continuing this year, before recovering slowly in the first half
of 1992.
The one relatively bright spot was in motor vehicle exports, which rose
sharply at the end of last year and are expected to stay high. In contrast,
domestic demand for vehicles is very weak.
The EEF has 5,000 member companies in electronics, computers, electrical and
mechanical engineering, motor vehicles, aerospace and shipbuilding. It said
the recession was affecting virtually the entire industry.
Engineering output is estimated to have fallen about 8 per cent between the
first halves of 1990 and 1991 and a further decline of 2 per cent is
forecast between the first six months of 1991 and 1992.
Sales by the engineering sector this year are forecast at about Pounds 128bn
 -of which Pounds 50bn are for export - compared with Pounds 136bn in 1990,
and Pounds 117bn 10 years earlier . All figures are at 1991 prices.
The EEF said productivity - output volume per person - had dropped in spite
of falling employment, but further job cuts this year and next would prevent
productivity from falling below early-1991 levels.

FT  25 APR 91 / Toll of cuts in media staff mounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TOLL of media job losses is mounting. The BBC yesterday announced 364
redundancies among its national radio staff while News International is to
cut 185 jobs from its newspaper printing workforce.
The BBC redundancies will affect cleaning, catering and security staff at
Broadcasting House in London, where its national radio operation is located.
The losses, which involve one in eight employees at Broadcasting House, are
the result of the BBC's decision to contract out those services.
Yesterday's announcement means the BBC has called for more than 1,000
redundancies this week, after Tuesday's 720 job losses at its network
television operation in west London.
The BBC is cutting costs across all activities as part of the Funding the
Future financial restructuring programme intended to save Pounds 75m a year
by 1993. Yesterday's cuts will reduce Broadcasting House overheads by at
least Pounds 1m a year.
Those redundancies bring the total of jobs lost as a result of Funding the
Future to 2,818.
The job cuts at Mr Rupert Murdoch's News International are among the
printing workers who produce its national newspapers, including The Sun and
The Times.
Most of the job losses will be at Wapping, its main newspaper production
plant in east London. The company also plans to shed 56 staff at its
regional printing plants in Glasgow and near Liverpool.
The redundancies follow News International's decision to restructure
printing operations by changing shift patterns. They also form part of
general cost-cutting after the completion of Mr Murdoch's Dollars 7.4bn
(Pounds 4.4bn) debt restructuring measures. Century Newspapers of Belfast,
publishers of the News Letter, the UK's oldest morning newspaper, is to cut
45 jobs at the end of the month, nearly a fifth of its workforce.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE streamlined city lifestyle of thousands of New Yorkers has been thrown
into turmoil this week. From the most high-toned Park Avenue apartment
blocks to hovels in Hell's Kitchen, residents are confronting a strike by
30,000 building service workers.
This is no joking matter. Jobs done by striking employees - members of Local
32B-32J of the Service Employees International - range from internal rubbish
collection to building maintenance. Many doormen, security guards, lift
operators and caretakers have joined the strike.
At issue is a new wage contract. Neither side has been forthcoming about the
negotiations, but at the weekend, when the strike began, the union claimed
that the building owners, represented by the Realty Advisory Board on Labour
Relations, were offering wage increases of only 2 per cent a year over three
years.
Even so, the strike seemed to take some union members by surprise. 'The
first I knew about it was when we were called out on Sunday,' said one
doorman.
To date, the dispute seems to have been largely good-humoured. Good doormen
are a valuable commodity in New York, and those residents inclined to whinge
are careful to do so out of the strikers' earshot. Many apartment blocks,
meanwhile, quickly instigated temporary arrangements, asking residents to
take out their own rubbish.
Even in extreme situations, it seems commonsense prevails: two striking
Fifth Avenue doormen were reported to have abandoned their picket-line
yesterday to rescue a maid who had set fire to her wealthy employer's
apartment with an overheated iron.
How the dispute will be resolved is unclear. The union claims that many
building owners are settling individually, saying that these numbers now run
into three figures.
The owners claim that this trend is being over-played and that the number of
individual settlements is much less. In the meantime, New Yorkers can only
grit their teeth and put out the rubbish.

NICARAGUA expects to settle Dollars 360m in overdue payments to the World

year, following the approval of Dollars 225m in bridging loan finance by the
Mexican, Venezuelan and Spanish governments.
Mr Antonio Lacayo, Nicaragua's Minister for the Presidency, said on Tuesday
night that Mexico and Spain had confirmed in the past week their support for
the financial package. He said that Venezuelan support was to be ratified
during the state visit of President Carlos Andres Perez to Nicaragua today,
to mark celebrations of the first year in office of President Violeta
Barrios de Chamorro of Nicaragua.
Between Dollars 100m and Dollars 150m has been pledged by other countries on
longer-term finance. A special meeting is to be held in mid-May in Paris to
finalise the entire package.
Settlement of the overdue payments to the multilateral institutions is
considered to be a central pillar of the government's economic stabilisation
plan, as it would unlock new foreign credit for the country.

FT  25 APR 91 / Kurdish leaders meet Saddam: Meeting angers other opposition
groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET, Middle East Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Saddam Hussein of Iraq held talks yesterday with Kurdish guerrilla
leaders who want internationally-guaranteed autonomy from Baghdad and the
safe return of Kurdish refugees to their homes.
Iraqi government officials have been negotiating with the Kurds since last
Friday, but the state-run Iraqi media mentioned the discussions for the
first time yesterday.
Kurdish organisations have expressed optimism that President Saddam will
make concessions to the Kurds, although many Kurds hate and distrust him and
some non-Kurdish opposition groups are angry about the negotiations.
President Saddam met Mr Jalal Talabani, leader of the Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan, and representatives of other Kurdish parties, the Iraqi news
agency said.
'The meeting means there was agreement on the basic points and that a
breakthrough was achieved in the talks,' a Kurdish official in Damascus was
quoted as saying.
Both sides need a deal. President Saddam's army is weakened by the Gulf war
and he could not use chemical weapons against the Kurds without incurring
the wrath of the international community.
The Kurdish guerrillas are still a force to be reckoned with in the
mountains, but they are fighting for an empty political cause if nearly 2m
Kurdish refugees - half the Kurds of Iraq - do not return home from the
borders of Iran and Turkey.
It remains to be seen if Mr Saddam will accept Kurdish demands for a
genuinely autonomous region within a democratic Iraq, for control over oil
revenue from Kurdish areas, and for international guarantees to bolster any
agreement.
A loose ceasefire is in force in the Kurdish areas of northern Iraq, but
Shia Moslem rebels in the south continue to announce guerrilla attacks on
government targets.
The Voice of the Iraqi Opposition radio station recently described Mr
Talabani's discussions with the government as 'a stab in the back for all
the Iraqis'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TOKYO has agreed that a 20 per cent target figure can be included in a new
pact with the US on its foreign semiconductor market share in Japan, but the
two countries were divided last night over final wording of the agreement.
Japanese officials suggested they had made a significant concession in
accepting the figure, although it has been clear that the US would not
conclude the negotiations unless a target was set.
The two countries have argued for five years over whether a target figure
was set for the first semiconductor agreement, which began in 1986 and will
expire at the end of July, with Washington insisting that the commitment was
contained in a side-letter and Tokyo arguing that no such commitment was
made.
Japanese officials want the 20 per cent to be seen as a general goal rather
than a specific target, and are aiming for a final wording of the agreement
to be vague enough for it not to be a precedent for market share targets in
other trade areas.
The foreign-market share in Japan at the end of last year was 13.2 per cent
and, under the US interpretation of the present agreement, was supposed to
be 20 per cent in July, a target that is now out of reach.
The latest round of negotiations for a new pact began here on Tuesday and
continued late last night. While there were hopes that the agreement would
be settled, officials of Japan's Ministry of International Trade and the
office of the US Trade Representative are likely to have to meet again.
Other important issues have been Japan's insistence that sanctions imposed
under the present agreement be lifted, and the choice of a measurement
standard for the market share. Japanese officials have argued that Japanese
companies are making efforts to increase their use of foreign chips and
these efforts should be recognised in the new agreement.

FT  25 APR 91 / World Trade News: Caricom slow to put common into market -
Agreed uniform external tariffs look like being held up a year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EFFORTS of the Caribbean Economic Community (Caricom) to create a
customs union are being set back by reservations by some member governments
over the impact of a new common external tariff.
The new tariff should have been implemented by all 13 members at the start
of this year. In the event, several were unable to meet the deadline, with
trade ministers saying they were concerned about the impact on national
economies.
Government officials and representatives of the Community's secretariat
appear confident that the common tariff will be in place by the end of this
year. They suggested that, despite the delay, the implementation of the
common tariff would be significant for the Community, not least because it
was written into the treaty establishing Caricom 18 years ago.
While the Community is moving with equal uncertainty towards the reduction
of barriers to trade among its members - the aim is to have a common market
in place by 1993 and monetary union the following year - the level of
success with which the common external tariff is implemented could determine
the viability of any attempt to increase economic integration.
Efforts at integration have been bedevilled by parochial concerns and the
tendency of some governments to implement significant changes in economic
policy without consulting partners.
'We have to get our act together in view of what is happening in Europe and
other parts of the world,' said Mr John Compton, prime minister of St Lucia.
'All of these things show we must have a common market, and we must have the
common external tariff.'
The community is made up of the English-speaking countries in the region,
including Belize in central America and Guyana in South America. It has a
combined market of 5.5m people. All members, except the Bahamas which is not
a signatory of the trading agreements, have said they will implement the
common tariff.
The proposed tariff structure promises low rates of duty on imports which do
not compete with goods produced within the community, but sets high rates on
any imports likely to injure domestic industry. Under the new tariff the
highest rate of duty will be 45 per cent and the lowest 5 per cent. This
replaces a structure where tariffs range from 5 per cent to 70 per cent.
The new measures will streamline the three different tariff structures used
in the community. Rates will differ where imports are raw materials or
finished products, and agricultural products will be given protection while
inputs for agriculture will be subject to low tariffs.
'There is need for the common external tariff to stimulate production in the
community,' said Mr Hayden Blades, director of trade and agriculture for the
Community secretariat.
'But the tariff structure must not encourage inefficient production. The
tariffs have to be set at levels which will allow regional industry to be
competitive,' he said.
In effect, however, most of the smaller Community members, in particular the
smaller islands of the eastern Caribbean, and Belize on mainland central
America, will have to raise their import duties, while the more developed
countries (Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados and Guyana) will be
lowering theirs.
This has led some government officials in the smaller states to be concerned
about the inflationary impact of the common tariff.
Mr Charles Maynard, trade minister of Dominica, says the the new
arrangements will have to be constantly monitored to determine the impact on
the cost of living 'so we can decide, at the level of the Community's
Ministerial Council whether we need to revise it upwards of downwards'.
Several governments have become dependent on revenues from import duties,
and have moved to cushion the expected loss of income with the lowering of
tariffs. The Jamaican government has imposed a sales tax on some imports on
which duties have been reduced.
The new tariff offers greater protection to the fledgling industries of the
smaller community members, while presenting increased competition to
businesses in the larger countries. The community's industrial sector is
based on light manufacturing and the assembly and re-export of consumer
durables.
The changes caused by the new arrangements have unsettled some
manufacturers. Mr Anthony Robinson, president of the Jamaica Manufacturers
Association, has complained that the implementation of the common external
tariff has exacerbated differences in the level of competitiveness among the
Caribbean Community members.
Mr Robinson said Jamaican manufacturers may be forced to close or reduce
operations because '. . . our Community competitors pay no duty on raw
materials, and having made the products, ship them here at between 14 per
cent and 21 per cent less than it costs Jamaican manufacturers to ship
products to other parts of the Community.'
Mr Compton argued that the Caribbean Community has no option but to
implement measures such as the common external tariff. 'It will take some
sacrifice, there might be short-term adjustments and we must be prepared to
bear these sacrifices if the Caribbean is to adjust itself economically to
meet the challenges of the outside world.'

SUZUKI is to become the first Japanese car maker to assemble cars in eastern
Europe. It is to take a 40 per cent stake in a joint venture in Hungary,
Magyar Suzuki, to produce up to 60,000 cars a year.
Its partners in the venture are C Itoh, the Japanese trading group, with an
11 per cent stake, Autokonszern, a Hungarian consortium (40 per cent), and
International Finance Corporation, a World Bank affiliate (9 per cent).
The total project cost of more than Y32bn (Pounds 136m) makes it Hungary's
largest joint venture undertaking to date. Magyar Suzuki will have an equity
capital of Y10bn. Production is due to start at end-1992, Mr Osamu Suzuki,
Suzuki Motor president, said. Viability depended on promoting local
production of components and improving quality, he added.
The company said output would be about 15,000 in the first year, rising to
50,000 after the third. The workforce will total some 1,100 when production
reaches 50,000 a year. Suzuki aims to reach a target of 60,000 cars a year
by 1997.
The venture will be located at Esztergom, north of Budapest. Suzuki said it
would assemble its small 1- and 1.3-litre Suzuki Swift hatch-back range at
the plant.
The Japanese car maker is giving local parts suppliers a stake in the
success of the project by taking them on as equity-holding partners. It is
encouraging them to link up with its own suppliers in Japan through joint
venture or licensing agreements.
Up to 1997, it aims to increase local content to some 70 per cent. Suzuki
seeks to sell about 60 per cent of output in the Hungarian market, with some
40 per cent exported mainly to western Europe.
Like Fiat's small-car production at FSM in Poland, Suzuki will seek to
export from its Hungarian plant to the whole of the European market.
Hungary was chosen because it had the most market-oriented economy in
eastern Europe and a home market free of domestic competitors, Mr Istvan
Lepsenyi, Magyar Suzuki president, said. The Suzuki investment in Hungary
follows moves by General Motors and Ford of the US to set up manufacturing
operations in Hungary.
General Motors has formed a joint venture with Raba, the Hungarian
state-owned maker of trucks, diesel engines, and tractors, to build Opel car
engines and to assemble Opel cars with an investment of around Dollars 150m
(Pounds 88m). It has a 67 per cent stake and management control.
It aims to produce up to 30,000 Opel Kadett/Vauxhall Astra cars and 200,000
engines a year at a plant at Szentgotthard, close to the Austrian border.
Ford plans an investment of Dollars 80m in a wholly-owned plant in
Szekesfehervar producing ignitions.
Plans by western car makers are now advanced for moving into eastern Europe,
with Volkswagen investing heavily in Czechoslovakia and eastern Germany, and
General Motors establishing operations in eastern Germany and Hungary.
Fiat is still the dominant force in Poland but GM is also expected to begin
negotiations shortly for an assembly venture in Warsaw with FSO. Fiat has
led western car makers' moves in Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union.
Hungary has granted favourable tax and customs duty treatment for the the
Suzuki project.
Yesterday's signing marked the belated end of a six-year gestation for the
venture. Suzuki's insistence on a 10-year tax holiday had postponed
agreement. Analysts also said the delay and the scaling down of the Japanese
car maker's earlier ambitions had followed a change of strategy.
Previously, the company had intended to use Hungary as a base for deliveries
to the rest of the region. After the disintegration of the Comecon system of
trade between east European countries, Hungary has no preferential access,
however.

FT  25 APR 91 / Brussels crackdown on Italian state aid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE European Commission has told Italy to explain why it has prolonged an
Ecu292m (Pounds 200m) aid scheme for the consumer electronics industry,
approved by Brussels in 1984-85 for only five years. The move is part of a
widening crackdown by the EC on illegal state aid.
The action is intended as much to forestall further aid it believes Rome is
planning, as to hold Italy to the agreement.
This put strict time limits on the aid, channelled through the state's
Ristrutturazione Elettronica SpA (REL), set up by the Italian industry
ministry in 1982 to restructure the sector by taking minority stakes in, and
providing soft loans for, consumer electronics manufacturers and components
suppliers.
The stakes were supposed to be sold to the private sector after five years;
the Commission says state holdings in six companies have not been.
Furthermore, Brussels says, three companies in receipt of the subsidised
loans have missed their repayments schedule.
This 'illegal application' of the agreed aid regime constitutes a distortion
of competition, the Commission says, and it has asked Rome for a reply
within one month.
Yesterday's decision follows the announcement of four state aid inquiries
this month. These are into French plans to pump more than Dollars 1bn into
Bull, the computer maker, and Thomson, the defence and electronics group;
into France's use of its main state enterprises to funnel money into smaller
companies in industrially declining areas; into a Dollars 230m Italian plan
to restructure the road haulage sector; and into Belgium's plans to
recapitalise Sabena, its ailing flag airline, to the tune of Dollars 1bn.
The Commission also intends to investigate France's plans to inject around
Dollars 400m into Air France.
By contrast, the Commission yesterday approved eight separate state aid
schemes allowed by EC law: for research and development and for backward
regions in Italy and Spain; for small to medium-sized industry in Italy and
for Dutch shipbuilders; and a UK undertaking on future industrial aid to
assisted areas.

<TEXT>
THE German government is bracing itself for a dramatic increase in east
German unemployment in July, when several hundred thousand public servants
will lose their jobs and the one year ban on redundancies in the engineering
industry ends.
Mr Thomas Geitz, an official at the BDA, one of the main employers'
organisations, said that the engineering industry agreement had been
reluctantly respected but employers were hoping to shed many workers in
July. IG Metall, the industry union, is seeking talks to extend the
agreement.
Many engineering workers in east Germany are on government supported
short-time working so the effect of ending the no-redundancies agreement
will be to transfer many short-time workers (currently about 2m) to the
unemployed total (now about 1m).
Most of the several hundred thousand public servants who have been suspended
on 70 per cent of their pay since the end of last year will also lose their
jobs in July. The public servants worked for organs of the former communist
state which have now been dissolved.
Yesterday the German constitutional court in Karlsruhe ruled that the
suspension of the workers had not been unconstitutional, except in the case
of pregnant women whose suspension contravened their job security
arrangements.
Early signs of upswing in the east German economy were detected yesterday by
two economic research institutes, the IFO in Munich and the DIW in west
Berlin. The IFO business confidence report said that in February the
business climate had improved for the first time since August last year.
DIW said incomes in east Germany rose by a fifth from the middle of 1989 to
the end of 1990, reaching about 60 per cent of the west German level.

FRANCE'S foreign trade deficit widened slightly in March, according to
provisional figures published yesterday, writes Ian Davidson in Paris.
The slowdown in demand in France and abroad led to unchanged levels of
exports, while imports increased very slightly. The underlying trend points
to a further gentle deterioration ahead.
The seasonally adjusted deficit in March grew to FFr4.7bn (Pounds 460m),
compared with FFr3.5bn in February and FFr5.7bn in January. The deficit in
industrial goods grew to FFr4.5bn, compared with FFr1.9bn in February.

THE World Bank has approved a Dollars 120m loan aimed at improving Poland's
inefficient telecommunications system. The loan will help finance the
installation of a new digital system including new switches, fibre optic
cables and the construction of a satellite ground station to improve
international links.
The World Bank is also considering a Dollars 300m loan to aid privatisation
and industrial restructuring, as well as another Dollars 300m loan for heat
supply and conservation projects.
A further Dollars 500m of loans devoted to developing financial
institutions, employment promotion, agriculture and health services are also
being considered.
The telecommunications project is primarily aimed at providing an
improvement for 70,000 new business subscribers and will be part of Poland's
telephone modernisation programme which is set to cost Dollars 1.5bn over
the next ten years.
Next week PPTT,the country's telecommunications authority, is to announce a
shortlist of western companies which are bidding to supply a separate
cellular telephone network costing Dollars 150m, which should provide
100,000 lines over five years.
The World Bank loan, to be repaid over 17 years, is to be accompanied by an
Ecu70m (Pounds 48m) loan from the European Investment Bank. The project
includes the installation of 12 digital switches and should improve
communications between 17 towns as well as calls abroad.
Poland's Finance Ministry has decided to suspend sales of bonds which gave
holders a 20 per cent discount when used to buy shares in privatised
companies. The issue was to have run till 1994.
The decision, which will be implemented early next month, comes after a
parliamentary declaration in February criticised the scheme for overly
favouring investors.
The bonds, with an interest rate index-linked to the monthly inflation rate,
have been on sale since December 1989. Zl 196.7bn of the bonds had been sold
by the end of February.

THE EC Council of Ministers yesterday settled a institutional row with other
Community bodies and approved Ecu3.83bn (Pounds 2.62bn) for ten research
projects over the next two and a half years.
The row, which threatened further to delay the EC's already tardy framework
programme for 1990-94, was a by-product of the sparring between EC
institutions in the negotiations on political union.
The Council had earlier changed five programmes - on marine and life
sciences, the environment, communications and electronic data transmission -
to the extent that the parliament persuaded the Commission to withdraw them
altogether. Pulling these programmes off the table and then resubmitting
would have delayed them months.
So,in the end, the EC executive and parliament settled for a few vague and
minor changes, such as promises to weigh the socio-economic impact of EC
research, which were adopted by EC ministers yesterday and are expected to
win parliamentary approval next month.
In addition to these five programmes, ministers also reached basic political
agreement on information technology (worth Ecu1.33bn alone), medical
research, industrial materials, and non-nuclear energy and the
agro-industrial programme.

FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of Greece (15): 'Birds can mean good business' -
Environmental Tourism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST TOURISTS take one look at the Gouves estuary with its shallow, brackish
lagoons and tufts of spiky grass and head further down the beach.
But birdwatchers are fascinated: this 30-acre wetland near Heraklion on the
northern coast of Crete is a stop-over for dozens of exotic species
migrating to and from the rest of Europe.
With a little luck, Gouves should become the first organised centre for
environmental tourism in Greece. Next to it is a 680-bed hotel belonging to
Grechotel, the country's largest hotel management group, which is backing
the project.
The problem until recently was opposition from local residents, who wanted
to fill in the river delta and take advantage of soaring prices for property
close to the sea.
In fact, one part of the delta is now covered by a soccer pitch. But the
remaining lagoons are still frequented by such rarities as the giant
flamingo, the glossy ibis, the pallid harrier and the booted eagle. More
than 170 species have been logged on spring visits by British birdwatching
groups.
Mr Nikos Daskalantonakis, Grechotel's chairman, who owns a sizeable part of
the delta, is ready to see his property included in a nature reserve planned
for Gouves. 'Green tourism could be very successful on Crete,' he says. 'Why
shouldn't Gouves set the trend?'
Many Greek wetlands have disappeared in the past 20 years as long stretches
of sandy coastline were swallowed up by hotels and bungalow complexes.
Though specialised bird and flower tours to Crete have been operating for
years, environmental awareness was slow to develop in the rush to exploit
traditional sea and sun tourism.
But members of the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature have been
taking an interest in Gouves for several years. Now the Greek tourism
ministry is also involved.
A scheme to develop Gouves along the lines of the highly successful Minsmere
nature reserve in Suffolk is being considered for European Community
funding, as one of four green tourism projects in Crete. If accepted, the
Community would contribute 50 per cent of the costs initially estimated at
about Dr48m (Dollars 250,000).
In the meantime, the bird enthusiasts have been trying to persuade people in
Gouves that their lagoons will be worth more in the long run if they are not
filled in and sold off as building plots.
Mrs Anne Cryer, who runs a travel business for the Wildlife Trust in
Britain, argued the case with the villagers with the help of videotapes from
Minsmere dubbed into Greek.
'I think there's now a growing realisation that Gouves actually has a
natural resource that will help it catch up with other tourist areas. Birds
can mean very good business,' she says.

FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of Greece (14): Foreign visitors set to fall at least
10% - How the country's tourist bodies and hoteliers are trying to win back
lost trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ZEUS XENIOS, the ancient Greek god in charge of offering hospitality to
strangers, seems to have turned his back on the tourist industry. For the
third time in six years, a disastrous plunge in bookings threatens to wreck
a promising year for earnings.
Once again, a US travel warning to its nationals to avoid the eastern
Mediterranean because of the risk of terrorist attacks following the Gulf
war is scaring off the high-spending sector of the Greek market: Japanese
honeymooners, incentive groups and conference organisers as well as the
older Americans who like cruising in the Aegean.
Similar advice in 1985 was blamed for two unfavourable seasons that
followed. Then came a terrorist attack aboard a cruise ship in 1988. This
year a series of bomb explosions damaged foreign bank branches and tourist
buses and a badly aimed rocket narrowly missed a luxury hotel. There were no
injuries but concerns over visitors' safety have revived.
As in the past, the Greek Tourist Organisation (EOT) is trying to win back
lost trade through heavier advertising. This year's campaign will cost Dr6bn
(Dollars 33m). It is being co-ordinated for the first time by a group of
Athens advertising agencies with international affiliations. This, it is
hoped, will prove more effective than relying on haphazard media-buying by
EOT offices abroad.
Senior Greek tourism officials have visited the big tour operators in
Britain and Germany, their two main markets, as well as the US, offering
reassurances about airport security and the government's determination to
crack down on terrorism.
'We constantly point out that Athens is still one of the safest cities in
Europe for visitors, in spite of what has been going on,' says Mr Nikos
Iatrakos, EOT's secretary-general. 'However, we still face a considerable
drop in numbers this year, 10 per cent at minimum but perhaps as much as 20
per cent.'
In 1990, tourist arrivals reached a record 9.3m, a 9 per cent increase over
the previous year's 8.5m, the average figure for most of the past decade.
Official foreign exchange inflows totalled Dollars 2.57bn, up from Dollars
1.89bn in 1989.
But if credit card purchases, cruise earnings and tour operators'
commissions paid abroad are counted in, overall tourist earnings rose to
Dollars 4.1bn, almost 6 per cent of GDP. Income for 1991 was expected to be
well over Dollars 5bn but 'now we'll be lucky to maintain last year's
levels,' says Mr Iatrakos.
The worst-affected region this year will undoubtedly be Athens. Despite its
chronic traffic and pollution problems it remains the focus for most
conferences and incentive tours and a starting point for the classical tours
favoured by the Americans and Japanese.
Hopes of substantially boosting tourism in the capital during the 1990s
suffered a setback last autumn with the failure of Athens' bid to stage the
1996 Olympic Games.
Advance bookings for the Mediterranean Games in July, one of several major
sports events planned as dress rehearsals for an Athens Olympics, are
disappointing, according to the organisers.
But amid the general gloom, tourist officials note one optimistic pointer
for the future: the sale of the 100-year-old Grande Bretagne Hotel, to a
Dutch-based investment company which has transferred management to Ciga, the
international hotel group. As a family-run establishment, Athens' best-known
luxury hotel could barely make ends meet, with occupancy averaging only 55
per cent in recent years.
Ciga is expected to invest considerably in refurbishing to bring the Grande
Bretagne's facilities up to the standard of its other traditional luxury
hotels around Europe. 'The presence of a really top-quality hotel in Athens
will upgrade the surrounding area and encourage other hotels to try harder,'
says Mr Iatrakos.
The government is already trying to ensure that older first-class hotels
around Greece, including some in spectacular settings, are upgraded to the
standards of increasingly demanding guests. It is breaking up a
state-controlled hotel chain and offering individual units to private
operators on long-term leases.
Improving hotel facilities is one of the easier ways of attracting more
older, wealthier tourists, something Greece has been trying to do for years
but without conspicuous success.
With 433,000 hotel beds, Greece has no shortage of accommodation. But many
large island resort hotels built in the boom years of the 1970s have not
been maintained to international tour operators' standards. Occupancy levels
in Corfu and Rhodes have slipped in recent years.
It is no coincidence that the one area where bookings picked up sharply once
the Gulf war ended was Crete, which boasts some of the best-run hotels in
Greece. Last year the island drew over 1.7m tourists, close to 25 per cent
of total arrivals.
'Large-scale tourism didn't start in Crete till the early 1980s. The resort
hotels are newer and better managed and many of the mistakes made elsewhere
were avoided. As a result, we get a very high proportion of return
visitors,' says Mr Thanos Habipis, chairman of the Cretan Hoteliers'
Federation.

FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of Greece (16): Manos tackles the car fumes - Athens
Pollution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Stefanos Manos is fed up with discussing the problems of Athens. The
minister of environment and public works, an energetic - some would say
impatient - technocrat, he blames 'endless talking and delays in
decision-making' for the continuing presence of the nefos, the brown
pollution cloud that hangs over the city in still weather.
Car exhaust fumes are the major source of atmospheric pollution in Athens,
now that industrial emissions are more strictly controlled and householders
banned from using heavy diesel oil for heating.
Last summer Mr Manos proposed a tax break for Athenians who bought a new car
equipped with a catalytic converter, provided that their old model was
turned in.
Less than six months later, a short space of time by the standards of Greek
bureaucracy, the measure was fully in operation. Car buyers, who normally
pay import tariffs of over 100 per cent on new vehicles, rushed to the
showrooms. Within weeks, the main graveyard for superannuated cars near
Mount Parnes outside the city was almost overflowing.
Over the past decade the number of private cars in Athens has risen from
550,000 to 880,000. This was partly the result of government attempts to cut
pollution levels in the city centre by permitting cars to circulate only on
alternate days, according to the final digit of their number-plate.
Athenians got around the odd-even driving ban by acquiring a second car. But
since many new purchases were of second-hand vehicles, the city's car fleet
grew visibly older and dirtier. At the beginning of 1990, 40 per cent of
private cars were more than 10 years old, compared with 15-20 per cent in
other European Community capitals.
'The incentives are very successful. At the present rate, 30 per cent of the
Athens car fleet will be replaced in three years. Then from 1993, only clean
cars will be allowed into the city centre,' Mr Manos says.
The next stage of his plan to banish the nefos is to build a network of
underground garages across the city to provide 25,000 new parking spaces by
1994. They would be privately operated for 25 years and then turned over to
the Athens municipality.
'On any weekday, there are 45,000 cars illegally parked around Athens and 60
per cent of the city's road surfaces are taken up by stationary vehicles. If
we get parked cars off the streets, traffic will start flowing faster and
there'll be fewer fumes,' Mr Manos says.
The third stage is to revive a highway project first proposed over 40 years
ago by building about 50 kilometres of highway across northern Athens to
relieve pressures on central traffic arteries. It will cost about Dr150bn
(Dollars 850m) and be operated 'by the constructor as a toll road, a fast
highway where you pay to save time.'
Mr Manos says he is sticking to 'quite simple projects, because you have so
little time to make anything happen before people start thinking in terms of
the next election.'
The biggest project of all, a Dr250bn extension of the Athens underground,
should finally get under way by the end of the year. Its start is already
two years behind schedule because of politically inspired delays and a
dispute over contract terms.
An international consortium led by Siemens of Germany is to build two new
lines across the city centre, totalling 18 kilometres in length, and nine
stations including one beneath Constitution Square. The extension will take
six years to complete and should carry 1bn passengers a year.

FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of Greece (11): Athens roof for the arts - Classical
Music
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLASSICAL MUSIC lovers, long a beleaguered minority in a country whose
best-known composers are associated with the bouzouki, now have a concert
hall to be proud of. The Megaro Mousikis, a white marble cube overlooking a
main Athens avenue, has taken almost 40 years to complete, and its
German-designed acoustics are said to compete with any symphony hall in
northern Europe.
All the same, last month's opening was a modest affair. Almost nothing was
done to mark the occasion. The Moscow Soloists, a chamber-sized ensemble led
by Yuri Bashmet, a viola player, launched into Bach's Brandenburg Concerto
No. 6 without a trace of inauguration night nerves.
It was the audience who looked awed, as much by the surroundings as the
music. Until now, concert-going in Greece has required stoic dedication. It
usually means perching in the precipitous tiers of an ancient theatre on a
hot summer night with someone's knees pressing into the small of your back.
Moonlight and history do not necessarily compensate for the thin quality of
sound wafted from far below.
'Modern Athens never had a roof for the arts. This is what the Megaro will
provide,' says Mr Christos Lambrakis, the owner of Greece's largest
newspaper group. As chairman of the Friends of Music, which persuaded the
state to provide a site for the Megaro but repeatedly ran out of funds for
construction, he convinced the former socialist government to come up with
most of the Dr19bn (Dollars 10.5m) needed to complete the project.
Music is one of the areas where Greek cultural tradition has kept its
distance from the west. Folk music followed eastern rhythms; in cities the
equally oriental sound of the bouzouki held sway.
The bouzouki used to be inextricably linked with rebetika, harsh songs about
drugs and violence in the Greek underworld. It was made respectable by
composers Mikis Theodorakis and Manos Hadjidakis, whose scores for the films
'Zorba the Greek' and 'Never on Sunday' brought a softened version of
rebetika to a much bigger audience.
Yet Greece occasionally produced classical musicians of the stature of Maria
Callas or Dimitri Mitropoulos, the conductor, who became household names
like the bouzouki singers. In recent years classical music has gained ground
rapidly, helped by the success of a new generation of performers with an
international reputation.
But would the potential Greek audience be large enough to support a concert
hall seating 2,000? Mr Lambrakis suspected not, so the Megaro was redesigned
as a multi-purpose building when work on its concrete skeleton resumed in
1986 after a seven-year gap.
'Greece is obviously not the kind of country that can provide large
subsidies for the arts. We have to try to ensure that we can pay our way,'
he says.
The original design by a German architect, Heinrich Keilholz, was radically
overhauled to provide additional facilities for staging opera and theatre
and to accommodate advances in acoustic technology. The acoustics were
designed by Prof Helmut Muller, whose research was used in construction of
the Opera de la Bastille in Paris.
'It would have been too expensive to demolish the concrete shell, so we had
to work within the constraints of the original frame of a building which had
a much less ambitious purpose. This presented a great challenge to the civil
engineers,' says Mr Rolf Krogmeyer, an architect who worked on the Megaro at
the start of his career and found himself unexpectedly recalled years later.
The result is a hexagonal shaped hall with tiered boxes rising from both
sides of the stage. Behind the stage is a huge organ, concealed by a wooden
screen. The organ is a gift from Siemens and the Greek and German
governments.
The suspended ceiling, panelled in American red oak, can be set in four
separate positions to accommodate the variations in sound reflection that
are needed for the full enjoyment of different kinds of performance: opera,
theatre, chamber and symphony music.
'Nowadays, acoustics dictate the shape of a concert hall. To achieve clarity
of speech you must be able to shrink the space but for the sound of a
symphony orchestra to be appreciated, it must be enlarged again,' Mr
Krogmeyer says.
For theatre and opera, two towers rise from the basement and a lighting grid
descends to form a conventional proscenium arch. The front of the apron
stage drops away to make room for an orchestra pit.
The basement contains an asymmetrical chamber music hall, not yet finished,
which will seat an audience of 500. Beside it is a self-contained recording
studio with thick concrete walls set on steel springs to eliminate
vibrations from passing traffic.
The main hall is also equipped to serve as a conference centre with
translation booths for 10 languages. 'It's designed so that you can hold a
congress into the afternoon and then be able to set up for a concert in the
space of three hours,' Mr Lambrakis says.
Looking further ahead, the aim is to encourage young Athenians to become
regular concert-goers. As a start, Mr Lambrakis intends to fit the courtyard
outside the Megaro with a giant screen for simultaneous projection of
performances going on inside. 'There would be no entrance charge. We'll be
helping young people to experience classical music through a medium they're
familiar with.'

FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of Greece (12): Tribal feelings strained - The
pressure of immigrants from Albania and the Soviet Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOWN AMONG the newspaper booths and merchant stalls in Omonia Square in
central Athens, clusters of thin, weather-beaten men chat quietly. Any time
of the day and much of the night they are there, dressed in old-fashioned
jackets and ragged bell-bottomed trousers.
These are the Albanians, some of the many thousands who have crossed over
into Greece in recent months. The Greek authorities say that to date more
than 20,00 Albanians have arrived in Greece. Some have returned but at least
12,000 look like becoming permanent residents.
Most of the new arrivals are members of the Greek minority in southern
Albania - a region that for long has been claimed by Greece and that is
referred to as north Epirus in the political textbooks.
For years, Greece had expressed its concern about the Greek minority in
Albania. Now, with the government in Tirana no longer capable of, or willing
to, implement rigid border controls, the minority is flooding out. To the
Greeks, their arrival is something of a mixed blessing.
However, Greece cannot turn back its north Epirot brethren. Athens is also
aware that the new immigrants will at least bolster the Greek population.
That is now a little over 10m. The birth rate is declining and there is much
concern about what is called 'the shrinking of Hellenism'.
But the immigrants from Albania arrive with only the clothes they wear and
with few skills. Most are farm workers in their early 20s. Greece faces
enormous economic problems and is ill-equipped to deal with an immigrant
influx.
Athens estimates the Greek minority in Albania to be more than 350,000
though the government in Tirana says it is 57,000. Mr Constantine
Mitsotakis, the Greek Prime Minister, has appealed to the Greek minority to
stay at home and await the outcome of political reforms.
Greece also faces pressures in dealing with other immigrants, both legal and
illegal. Thousands of Bulgarians have entered Greece from the north. There
are numbers of Poles living for the most part illegally in various parts of
the country. Members of Turkey's Kurdish community regularly ask for
political asylum.
The Pontians are one of the more intriguing groups to arrive on Greek soil
in recent months. Pontians are an ethnic minority of Greek origin who once
inhabited an area on the southern coast of the Black Sea - referred to as
'Pontos' in ancient Greek.
According to the Greek government up to 500,000 Pontians are now dispersed
through the southern Soviet Union. With the freeing of Soviet emigration
controls, more than 25,000 Pontians have already arrived in Greece. Few
speak modern Greek but this group is unlikely to be a heavy burden on the
state.
Pontians are the butt of Greek jokes in much the same way as the Irish are
to the English or the Poles in some parts of the US. But the Pontians are a
resourceful group who through even the toughest times in the Soviet Union
survived and often prospered.
In many parts of Athens, Pontians have set up stalls selling goods brought
from the Soviet Union. As new residents of Greece, they have taken advantage
of entitlements on car imports, buying luxury models and selling them for
handsome profits.
To cope with these new immigrant groups, the government has set up a special
bureau to co-ordinate educational and resettlement activities. It is a
formidable task, fraught with social and political dangers.
Already, some concern has been raised about government plans to settle
several thousand Pontians in Thrace - a region where Muslims predominate and
one of the poorest in the country.
Greece wants to welcome its 'returnees'. But it is fully aware that its
resources are severely limited. In some ways the homecoming could not have
come at a worse time.

Profile, METAXA
</HEADLINE>

   By KERIN HOPE

<TEXT>
MR Dennis Malamatinas, chief executive of Metaxa, says that his company
boasts one of only three successful Greek brand names: 'The others are
Onassis and Maria Callas.'
Tankers and arias are easier to identify than the contents of a bottle of
Metaxa. In Greece it is 'koniak,' but to the rest of the European Community
it is brandy. Ask a member of the Metaxas family which invented it a century
ago and you are firmly told: 'Metaxa is a unique spirit.'
It is also very varied. Three-star Metaxa is something you gulp down in the
village cafeneion on a winter morning before setting out to prune the vines.
The five-star version is found in Athenian bars at a fraction of the price
of cognac, though few fashionable Greeks are seen drinking it.
But seven-star Metaxa is the top-selling brandy in international duty free
shops, with sales of 1.5m cases a year.
Nevertheless, duty-free sales account for only 13 per cent of Metaxa
turnover, though more than 50 per cent of production is exported. Most is
drunk in Germany and Austria, 'by expatriate Greeks and people who like to
keep up with things Greek between holidays,' Mr Malamatinas says.
He joined Metaxa after the owners sold out in 1988 to Grand Metropolitan,
the drinks, food and retailing group, with a brief to 'transform a
flourishing traditional Greek family business into a dynamic part of a
multinational group.'
Mr Malamatinas has the kind of background to make the transition go
smoothly: a Greek born in Zimbabwe, he worked for Procter and Gamble in the
US and headed Pepsico's operations in Italy before moving to Metaxa.
His management team was picked, he says, on the basis of 'being
internationally oriented with an awareness of Greek business culture' and
asked to carve out a niche for Metaxa in the international fashion and
luxury goods sector.
The Metaxa distillery outside Athens has been modernised and capacity
doubled, at a cost of Dollars 4.6m.
Last year packaging and advertising for seven-star Metaxa was redesigned.
The amphora-shaped bottle was relaunched as 'the Greek spirit'. Sales in
1990 improved by 10 per cent.
Unlike most Greek businessmen bought out by foreign companies in the past
few years, the Metaxas family still keeps an interest in the spirits
business.
Mr Elias Metaxas, who used to be the company's chief taster, owns a
distillery in central Greece where he experiments with liqueurs and produces
a brandy to match any Metaxa. 'I am still fascinated,' he says, 'by anything
to do with alcohol.'

FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of Greece (9): Why the timetable is slipping - The
progress towards privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RECENT survey of Greek industry caused a stir by pointing out something
the Finance Ministry knows only too well: the total amount of tax paid each
year by private sector companies falls considerably short of the overall
figure for losses incurred by public sector corporations.
It is not just the state-owned transport and utilities companies whose
payrolls are swelled by political appointees with little interest in
boosting productivity. The public sector also has a dominant role in
manufacturing though that is less visible, since many larger companies are
controlled indirectly through the state-owned banks. Others belong to the
Industrial Reconstruction Organisation, a state umbrella for a group of
debt-burdened companies nationalised in the early 1980s by the former
socialist government.
While the socialists were held responsible for weakening Greek industry
through selective nationalisations in sectors they considered strategic, the
seeds of today's crippling deficits were undoubtedly sown by the statist
policies of their right-wing predecessors.
However, Mr Constantine Mitsotakis is determined to reverse past attitudes.
The prime minister himself supervises a wide-ranging privatisation programme
launched immediately the conservatives came to power last April.
The companies to be privatised form a profile of Greek industry: among them
are shipyards, mineral processing units, a textile group, several paper
mills, a leading construction company and a group of co-operative dairies
that belong to the Agricultural Bank.
The original aim was to dispose of the 20-odd companies controlled by the
IRO as quickly as possible and encourage the banks to shed another 70
companies. As a parallel measure, legislation was passed permitting the sale
of up to 49 per cent of public sector corporations through the Athens Stock
Exchange.
To co-ordinate the process, the government issued official guidelines for
handling sales and appointed NM Rothschild, the British merchant banker, as
its privatisation consultant.
But the timetable has slipped badly and it now seems unlikely that this
year's budget forecast of Dr200bn (Dollars 1.2bn) in privatisation revenues
will be met. Only two small IRO companies have been disposed of, a
yachtbuilder and a plastics manufacturer. One partial privatisation has
taken place with the sale of a 49 per cent stake in Olympic Airways'
catering subsidiary to Abela, an international industrial caterer.
Valuations and appointments of financial advisers took longer than expected,
while potential buyers were fewer than anticipated given the surge in
acquisitions of Greek manufacturing units by both local and foreign
companies over the past two years.
Mr Yiannis Piperoglou, an independent consultant serving as secretary to the
government's privatisation committee, says: 'When we started, I was looking
forward to putting some deals together. But we all underestimated the legal
complexities of privatisation. The process will take years and getting rid
of the IRO companies is only a small part of it.'
Government officials admit that chairmen and managing directors of some
companies on the privatisation list have resorted to delaying tactics to
keep their jobs for as long as possible. Last year the IRO companies' losses
totalled Dr45bn and their accumulated debts reached Dr215bn.
Mr Mitsotakis remains adamant that the IRO must shut down at the end of the
year. This means in effect that a number of companies will be have to
liquidated since the IRO will be unable to continue its current practice of
extending deadlines in the hope of attracting better offers.
Further delays may be caused by a European Court of Justice decision in a
case brought by the former owner of an IRO company. The court is expected to
rule that the socialists' method of nationalisation, through a compulsory
increase of share capital, flouted Community directives on company law
because shareholders were not consulted.
Such a ruling could bring a spate of lawsuits against the IRO as other
former owners see a chance to recover control of their companies, or at
least to demand compensation from the government.
At the same time, Greek officials are having to stay in close touch with the
European Commission to make sure that terms of sale for larger industrial
companies, such as the heavily subsidised shipyards, do not run foul of
directives on fair competition.
Much attention is being focused on the upcoming sale of Heracles General
Cement, by far the best buy among the IRO's holdings and one of the few
companies slated for privatisation that has posted operating profits in
recent years.
While Heracles was being valued, the statist faction in the government
argued in favour of keeping it in the public sector. The company was
nationalised in 1983 with a capitalisation of debts totalling Dr27bn. The
move later allowed the IRO to gain control of 70 per cent of its shares.
Even before the government committed itself to selling Heracles, the
Commission had decided that this method of writing off debt violated
competition rules.
Despite the legal complications, there is no shortage of interest in
Heracles, said to be Europe's largest single cement exporter, among
international producers. The company's pre-tax profits totalled Dr11.9bn
last year on Dr41.6bn turnover.
The recent appointment as chairman of Mr Stelios Stavridis, a former
Heracles executive who left shortly after its nationalisation, is seen as
underlining the government's intention to speed up its sale.
'The company has deteriorated while under state control, but it is still in
reasonably sound shape. My job is not to get involved in running Heracles
but to accelerate the pace of privatisation. I don't intend to have to stay
here longer than nine months,' he says.

FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of Greece (10): A family business - The country's
political dynasties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A QUICK glance at the list of members of Parliament suggests that Greek
politics is still very much a family business.
The present and former prime ministers, Mr Constantine Mitsotakis and Mr
Andreas Papandreou, have a daughter and a son respectively in the House.
This is not really a coincidence considering that both leaders launched
their own political careers from similarly privileged backgrounds. Mr
Papandreou's father was a centrist prime minister. Mr Mitsotakis's
great-uncle, Eleftherios Venizelos, was Greece's leading modern statesman.
Descendants of the old tzakia, prominent political families whose influence
stretches back a century in some cases, are scattered around the front
benches in Parliament.
On the other hand, a political dynasty can be founded by present head of
state, Mr Constantine Karamanlis, a schoolmaster's son from Macedonia who
served as prime minister for 15 years. His youngest brother is a cabinet
minister and two of his nephews are up-and-coming deputies.
But the rumbles of complaint from members of Mr Mitsotakis's conservative
New Democracy party when he gave his daughter, Mrs Dora Bakoyannis, a junior
ministerial post, were an indication of how attitudes are changing.
As under-secretary to the prime minister's office, Mrs Bakoyannis is
responsible for co-ordinating government activities. She took over her
husband's parliamentary seat after he was killed by a local terrorist group
in 1989.
'I've been working for Mitsotakis for years. Now I represent one of the
poorest constituencies in Greece where a lot needs to be done,' she says.
'Politics is my life, and I'd like another cabinet job when I've got more
experience.'
Greek political parties have rarely outlived their founders, but both ND,
established by Mr Karamanlis, and Mr Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist
Movement (Pasok) may have put down strong enough roots over the past 17
years to survive changes that are inevitable in the next few years.
Following Pasok's earlier example, ND constructed a more effective
grassroots organisation during its years in opposition. More younger members
of Parliament were selected originally as candidates on the basis of local
popularity rather than connections with the party hierarchy in Athens.
The frontrunner to succeed Mr Mitsotakis as ND leader, Mr Miltiades Evert,
is a seasoned Athenian politician but not from one of the old families. As
minister to the prime minister's office, he looks after civil service reform
and makes a point of keeping a distance from the party machine.
A year in opposition has taken its toll on Pasok. Funds are low and the old
populist enthusiasm is gone, especially in the countryside where the party
built its power base.
Mr Papandreou's personal grip on Pasok has slackened, but there has been no
attempt to unseat him. On the contrary, the start of his trial - in absentia
 -for alleged corruption while in office brought a closing of socialist
ranks.
The succession battle could turn out to be a long drawn-out affair, given
the doubts about Mr Papandreou's health since he underwent major heart
surgery in 1988 and the number of potential candidates.
Half a dozen former cabinet ministers are frequently mentioned, but it is
not at all clear which of them would appeal to both radical and social
democrat wings of the party.
Potential contenders are keeping a low profile until the court reaches its
decision, which may be several months away.
'The outcome of the trial will decide Mr Papandreou's political future,'
says Mr Costas Simitis, a former economy minister and the leader of Pasok's
social democrat faction.

FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of Greece (8): A new look emerges on the Piraeus
waterfront - There is something of a revival in shipping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By A Special Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOMETHING OF a 'new look' has emerged on the Piraeus waterfront in the year
since the conservative New Democracy party came to power. It started with a
decision by Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, the prime minister, to take on the
shipping portfolio himself, a move seen by the community as long overdue
recognition for its contribution to the economy, as major employers and
earners of foreign exchange.
Day-to-day running of the Merchant Marine Ministry was left to Mr Aristotle
Pavlides, who eventually took over as minister six months later. By that
time, the prime minister's promise to address the shipping industry's
problems with 'imagination and daring' had resulted in new measures intended
to boost the competitiveness of Greek flag vessels in the international
market.
Tonnage tax on vessels of 80,000 gross tons was slashed by 75 per cent,
while ships from 40,000 to 80,000 gt were granted a 50 per cent reduction.
An extension of the tax breaks to smaller vessels is now under consideration
by the ministry.
The crew reductions removed up to five members from the complements required
on Greek flag vessels. To counter the outcry from seafarers' unions, Mr
Pavlides made it clear that this was mainly a paper exercise to normalise a
situation in which companies applied individually to use reduced
'experimental' crews.
The government has also acted on shipowners' long- standing complaints about
the dismal state of telecommunications in Piraeus. Efforts by the Greek PTT
to upgrade the system include a pilot project giving the port priority. By
June an extra 17,000 lines should become available, together with other
improvements.
Maritime education, another nagging problem in the eyes of owners, is also
being tackled. Some training schools that were expensive to maintain and not
fully used have been closed. Now the British sandwich-course training system
is being adopted and the ministry is consulting owners on further reforms to
be implemented in the 1991-92 academic year.
Though the government's moves were favourably received by the shipping
community, the number of vessels attracted to the national flag has remained
relatively small. This is largely because of factors over which the
government has little control.
Just as the tax and crew cuts were announced, a wave of strikes paralysed
banks, communications and power supplies for a three-week period. The
walk-outs underlined all too clearly the kind of problems that owners had
been pointing out for years. Piraeus shipping offices were forced to
relocate staff abroad temporarily, to keep in contact with their vessels.
In addition, a weak freight market and an uncertain outlook worldwide
following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait were more than enough to induce
hesitation about changing office location or flag.
Nonetheless, figures have improved. At the end of 1990, the Greek flag fleet
stood at 2,031 vessels totalling 22.53m gross tons, compared with 2,003
vessels of 21m gt at the end of December 1989.
Foreign exchange earnings from shipping soared by 29.3 per cent over the
same period to Dollars 1.79bn, the highest total since a 1981 peak of
Dollars 1.82bn. The trend continued in January this year with earnings
increasing by 21.1 per cent to Dollars 139m, against Dollars 111.5m in the
same month last year.
The fleet's accident record also improved, with incidents involving Greek
ships falling in 1990 to 54 from 58 the previous year. However, 51 lives
were lost compared with only nine in 1989, principally because of two
disasters.
Mr Pavlides stresses the need to rebuild a climate of trust between owners,
seafarers and the government. Unquestionably, the government's efforts have
made a difference. But Greek owners will continue to be market-oriented on
the whole. Unless it makes sound business sense, they will not opt for the
home flag or a Piraeus office.
Still, one indication of a revised perception of the situation in Greece
came with the announcement by the London-based Papachristides Ship
Management Services that it would transfer its ship management operation to
Piraeus this spring.
The shipowners' associations continue to emphasise their stated aim of
attracting new shipping and financial activities to Piraeus. But Greek
owners, individualists to the last, always look at the bottom line where
their own business is concerned.
One of the major issues, especially for smaller owners, is fleet
replacement. By the end of 1990 Piraeus banks were offering new types of
facilities to clients such as standby lines of credit for future vessel
purchases.
As ship values dropped in the second half of the year, Greek owners, with
their traditional knack for spotting a good buy, began to inspect vessels
with a view to purchasing. The Gulf war put a temporary brake on plans, but
since late February, owners have come strongly into the second-hand market
again, showing interest in a wide range of vessels.
At the same time, two Piraeus-based companies have revealed new building
orders for products carriers. One, Eletson Corporation, is already the
largest dedicated products shipping company in the world. The other, Forum
Maritime, is only now preparing to enter the wet trades.
Both new building contracts are for modern, highly sophisticated tonnage in
line with standards required for trading with the US. They are an indication
of the moves being made in the Greek shipping industry to slough off an
unflattering image of operating an elderly fleet, kept under tight family
control.

FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of Greece (7): Ending the nightmare - Investing in
the country
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKING IN Greece is not an easy business. One of the main hiccups is
communications. The telephone network, starved of investment for the last
two decades, is overloaded and outdated. Banks in the state sector are
chronically overstaffed. Labour problems are a common occurrence.
For the customer, even the simplest transaction can take a great deal of
time as tellers wrestle with telephones that don't work and piles of
paperwork.
Mr Panagis Vourloumis is the managing director of Alpha Finance, 'the
closest thing to a merchant bank in Greece', as he puts it.
'Our communications technology is years out of date. People cannot get in
touch with us so we lose business,' Mr Vourloumis says.
He feels that if there is not substantial investment and reform in the
banking sector soon, Greece risks being left behind not only by the more
advanced countries in the European Community but also by Spain and Portugal
which are already putting into place new banking systems. He believes that
Greece has expertise in many areas and could develop a proper financial
services industry.
'At the moment financial services are only an appendage of the banks. But
they could develop independently, for instance if offering banking expertise
and services to countries like Bulgaria and Romania - places where Greek
banks, more than the more developed institutions in Germany or the UK, have
a knowledge and feel for the way business is done.'
Alpha Finance has been approached by various east European countries but, Mr
Vourloumis says, it already has more than enough business in the home
market. 'Even with our communications problems, we can compete with the
foreign banks.'
Set up two years ago, Alpha Finance belongs to a group of financial services
companies founded by Credit Bank, Greece's largest private bank, which
include stockbroking, leasing, insurance and financial information services.
Credit Bank is the largest shareholder. Samuel Montagu also has a small
stake, with the rest of the institution's equity held by employees - an
innovation in the Greek banking sector.
In the past two years, with a dramatic rise in business on the Athens Stock
Exchange, Alpha Finance has been closely involved in helping several
companies go public.
Together with Credit Bank, it launched two mutual funds, a diversified
equity and a fixed income fund, the first of its kind in Greece. The two
funds manage more than Dr20bn (Dollars 110m) in assets.
Alpha Finance is also involved in the government's privatisation process,
carrying out valuations and acting as financial adviser on the sale of
several companies.
'Privatisation is a revolution in Greece. If it's successful, and for the
future of the country it has to be, then the whole economic outlook will
change,' Mr Vourloumis says.
He points out that as the recession bites deeper, 'some foreign institutions
have come to pick the crumbs from the Greek table - something we welcome
because it broadens the market.'
But Mr Vourloumis and other bankers accept that Greece is still viewed as a
bureaucratic nightmare for some foreign institutions.
While profit repatriation is permitted, bureaucratic stipulations result in
tortuous hold-ups. A combination of labour problems and telecommunications
difficulties has held up progress on automated banking. Cheques are almost
as rare as a free taxi in the Athens rush hour. The black economy encourages
cash transactions. It is not uncommon to see customers carrying briefcases
bulging with drachma in and out of banks.
'Setting up Alpha Finance was an expression of our faith in the future,'
says Mr Vourloumis. 'I am an optimist - things are going to change.'

FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of Greece (5): Wealthy uncle becomes less indulgent -
The economy, Kerin Hope says it will be hard to avoid a revenue shortfall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE

<TEXT>
WHEN A Greek is in dire financial straits, he remembers his barba stin
Koroni - a wealthy uncle in a distant town.
Twice in the past six years, the government has done much the same thing,
seeking assistance from Brussels in the form of an emergency balance of
payments loan.
But the European Community, which granted Greece an Ecu2.2bn (Dollars 2.7bn)
loan in February, is much less indulgent than it used to be. Stringent
conditions were attached before the first tranche of Ecu1bn was paid.
If Greece is to participate in the next phase of European monetary union, it
must meet ambitious targets for reducing a chronically high inflation rate
and public sector borrowing requirement in the next three years.
Mr Efthymios Christodoulou, the economy minister, says: 'It's a basic
choice. Either you follow the other 11 (EC members) and make an effort to
submit to painful measures, or you stay on the periphery and see what
happens.'
To ensure the drachma can enter the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the EMS by
the end of 1993, inflation must come down to 9.5 per cent that year, from
22.8 per cent in 1990. This year's target is 17.5 per cent.
Central administration borrowing, which totalled 13.1 per cent of GNP last
year, is expected to shrink to 10.5 per cent this year and reach a minimal
1.5 per cent in 1993.
The current account deficit must be limited to 3 per cent of GNP, compared
with an average of over 4 per cent for the past two years.
Other conditions call for the kind of reforms that Greek economic analysts
have advocated for years but governments were always reluctant to apply
because of the political cost.
They include a 10 per cent cut in civil service staffing levels by 1993, a
broadening of the tax base to include more farmers and an effective
crackdown on tax evasion by restructuring revenue collection.
Such strict conditionality is the result of the former socialist
government's failure to keep the terms of an Ecu1.5bn Community loan in the
mid-1980s.
Structural reform was largely ignored but the government managed to cut the
PSBR from 18 to 13 per cent of GDP and bring inflation down from 22 to 12
per cent before yielding to pressure for substantial wage increases.
These, together with an extravagant campaign to find public sector jobs for
socialist supporters in the run-up to the June 1989 election, quickly
dissipated the gains from two years of tight austerity.
Crucial economic decisions were postponed during almost a year of political
stalemate before the conservatives' narrow election victory last spring. Now
the government cannot afford any delay at all in implementing reforms if it
wants to benefit from a recovery forecast for 1993. By that time, another
election will be imminent.
One encouraging sign has been union willingness to accept pay rises well
below the inflation rate, following the abolition of automatic index-linking
of wages at the end of 1990. This year public sector employees will receive
nominal increases of 8 per cent.
In the private sector, a landmark agreement was struck that seems to
guarantee smooth labour relations for the next two years. The unions agreed
to a basic 12 per cent increase for this year and 9 per cent in 1992, when
inflation of 14 per cent is forecast.
In fact, inflation could drop below 17 per cent this year. 'Underlying
inflation, especially labour costs, is below the consumer price index, and
this year's target was set when the outlook for oil prices was much
gloomier,' said one analyst.
Growth this year will be restricted to less than 1 per cent, but even that
would be an improvement. Revised estimates for 1990 show negative growth of
minus 0.4 per cent, largely as a result of a sharp drop in agricultural
production after a disastrous drought.
The main challenge for the government is to meet its budget targets for
curbing public sector expenditure and increasing revenues.
There has been little sign so far that the deficit-plagued public sector
enterprises have reined in spending, though a new scheme requiring them to
submit monthly accounts to the Economy Ministry should impose more
discipline.
About 35 per cent of budget revenues are already earmarked for serving the
public debt. Even if the stabilisation programme meets all its targets,
overall debt will still total more than 90 per cent of GDP in 1993.
On the revenue side, the Finance Ministry is confident of maintaining last
year's growth in tax income of more than 30 per cent. But tax evasion
deprived the government of Dr350bn in revenues last year (Dollars 1.9bn),
equivalent to about 3 per cent of GDP.
Mr Yiannis Palaiocrassas, the finance minister, says: 'Much of the present
evil in the tax system stems from apparently contradictory provisions and
regulations that make it hard to determine when an enterprise is outside the
law. But it's true there is a lot of corruption everywhere.'
The black economy, estimated at 30-40 per cent of GDP, is under attack.
Buoyed by the success of its raids on night clubs and restaurants, the
ministry is setting up a 'tax commando unit' to frighten more proprietors
into producing correct receipts on their newly installed cash registers.
But the new income tax structure will not come into effect until 1993. In
the meantime, tax returns will be systematically cross-checked this year for
the first time.
It is becoming increasingly clear that the government is unlikely to collect
the expected income from its privatisation programme. The Industrial
Reconstruction Organisation was expected to sell about 20 companies under
its control this year. Due to lack of interest from buyers, it seems that
all but half a dozen may have to be liquidated instead.
Another important potential source of revenue, sales of land bonds
redeemable as building plots, is lagging behind schedule. If, as seems
likely, they are not introduced until late in the year, it will be hard to
avoid a revenue shortfall.

FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of Greece (6): Out go curbs, out go funds? - Banking

BANK OF Greece officials are professing confidence that when restrictions on
long-term capital outflows are finally lifted next month, there will be no
large-scale flight of funds. But if a note of trepidation creeps into their
voices, it is hardly surprising.
The liberalisation, which will bring Greece into line with its European
Community partners by permitting individual Greek investors to buy property
and securities abroad, is already more than a year overdue.
Successive governments obtained an extension, citing a steadily worsening
current account deficit that reached Dollars 3.6bn last year, over 5 per
cent of GDP.
The deficit is shrinking only slowly, but a commitment was made to freeing
outward capital movement this spring under the terms of the EC emergency
balance of payments loan to Greece.
Mr Dimitris Chalikias, the governor of the Bank of Greece, belives the
benefits of liberalisation will quickly outweigh any adverse effects on the
balance of payments.
'We're not very worried about the effect on the current account deficit. It
won't be so large. The important factor is the confidence it brings, which
will encourage capital inflows as well.'
There are no longer any restrictions on inward capital movement, or on
direct investment abroad. Greek companies are already allowed to borrow from
foreign banks, in foreign currency if they wish.
But until last year, total Greek purchases of foreign securities were
limited to Ecu50m (Dollars 60m) yearly in EC and European Investment Bank
issues. At present, Greek mutual funds can place no more than 25 per cent of
their portfolios in foreign stocks.
The average Greek businessman still aspires to owning property in England or
Switzerland and a portfolio of Wall Street stocks, though the flourishing
equity and property markets in Athens mean such investments may be as much a
status symbol as a hedge against the spectre of political or economic
turmoil at home.
The Bank of Greece view is that the serious money has already left because
wealthy Greeks have little difficulty in bypassing regulations in order to
transfer capital abroad.
Mr Chalikias says: 'If we consider the structure of foreign exchange
receipts, invisibles are the most important item and private capital inflow
is a very large item. This structure makes it relatively easy for capital to
be exported unofficially.'
Nonetheless, a steady trickle of funds abroad can be expected as smaller
Greek investors experiment with purchases of foreign securities or buy
second homes in parts of western Europe where prices compare favourably with
those in Greece.
On a lesser scale, lifting the current yearly ceiling of Dollars 300 on
credit card purchases abroad, also included in the liberalisation, will add
to the outflow.
Once the initial shock is absorbed, 'this move will prove a catalyst for
changing the entire Greek financial landscape,' according to Mr George
Zavvos, European Parliament member who chairs the recently established
committee for the reform of the Greek financial system.
The committee's aim is to implement EC policy on banking and securities as
swiftly as possible. This involves preparing a considerable amount of new
legislation. While the Bank of Greece has been steadily deregulating the
banking system over the past five years, little has been done to overhaul
its legal framework.
Mr Zavvos, who used to work for the European Commission, should be the ideal
person for the job: he was responsible for drafting the Community's Second
Banking Directive.
'We have one of the most antiquated banking systems in Europe, so we needed
a mechanism for change. The image of Greek regulatory institutions needs to
be reformed. Integrity and efficiency are terribly necessary if we are to
start competing with the rest of the Community.'
The committee has already prepared legislative decrees on solvency ratios
and capital adequacy arrangements that will bring Greece into line with
standards worldwide. A law is being drafted on banks' accounting plans; a
much-delayed scheme for guaranteeing deposits is nearly complete.
Improvements in prudential supervision are also high on the agenda.
Testimony in recent weeks by Mr Chalikias and other Bank of Greece officials
at the trial of several former cabinet ministers accused of involvement in a
Dollars 200m embezzlement scandal at the privately owned Bank of Crete
revealed that, without government support, the central bank was unable to
mount an effective investigation of its own.
Once the new legislation is in place, the state-owned Greek banks, which
still control more than 70 per cent of deposits but have largely failed to
grasp the opportunities offered by deregulation, will come under much
stronger pressure to modernise, Mr Zavvos says.
'The state banks have a competitive advantage in their proximity to the
client plus their networks all over Greece. Their unions are weaker than
they used to be, so there is a chance to improve efficiency. But they need
up-to-date technology and management.'
For the 22 foreign banks, the reforms will mean 'a more level playing
field,' according to one foreign manager. Though the foreign banks complain
about the vagueness of existing legislation, it has not deterred them from
expanding their retail banking operations or from becoming the leading
players in handling mergers and acquisitions.
The revised framework will also reinforce the position of the two leading
private Greek banks, which between them hold 14 per cent of deposits.
Both have carved out profitable niches, expanding into leasing and brokerage
activities in recent years, while avoiding involvement with the loss-making
public sector corporations.
'The private banks have already done well out of deregulation. We're more
flexible. It's a question of quality of services. Our bank is modelled on
the kind of helpful high street bank that doesn't exist any more,' says Mr
Constantine Capsaskis, chairman of Ergobank, which looks after small
businessmen and is one of the most profitable banks in Europe.

FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of Greece (3): The piper calls the tune - Relations
with Europe

IN THE wealthier parts of Athens, the mink coats come out during the short
spells of winter weather. The children of the wealthy - there are plenty of
them - while away their time in coffee bars or parade round the city in
expensive cars. House buyers still carry suitcases full of drachma to
complete cash purchases for properties which have recently risen to
London-style prices.
At times it is hard to reconcile life in Greece with the official
statistics: on a wealth per head basis Greece is now the poorest country in
the EC. It also has the worst economic health record in the Community. It
has been saved from financial pneumonia only by emergency treatment from
Brussels, in the form of a recently approved Ecu2.2bn loan - granted on the
strictest terms yet imposed on a member state.
1990 was the year when the EC finally ran out of patience with Greek
governments which seemed either unwilling or unable to put the country's
financial affairs in some sort of order.
Early last year Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission,
wrote a terse letter to the then 'ecumenical' government. He said the
deteriorating economic situation in Greece threatened the future not only of
the country but also jeopardised future developments within the EC. Greece,
said Mr Delors, was lagging behind the Community to the point where the EC's
'course towards the single market, monetary union and European unification
is in danger of being permanently undermined.'
Greece's creditworthiness was increasingly at risk due to a rapidly rising
public debt and other imbalances in the economy. 'We think it indispensable
that drastic measures be quickly taken to make clear the country's
willingness to reduce these imbalances for good,' said Mr Delors.
The direct language of the communication broke the delicate protocol the
Commission employs in its dealings with sovereign EC governments. The EC was
angry that Greece had failed to abide by the terms of a Dollars 1.7bn EC
emergency loan made in 1985. The message this time was clear: if Greece did
not put its economy in order, then the country risked being left behind by
the rest of the Community.
The new EC loan - finally approved in February this year - sets the
parameters of Greek economic policy for the next three years. The loan is in
three tranches and is set on what the Commission describes as 'strict and
comprehensive' conditions.
These include bringing inflation down from 17 to 7 per cent, cutting central
government borrowing from 17 per cent of GDP to 1.5 per cent in the 1990-93
period, a 10 per cent reduction in public sector employment, curbs on public
sector pay rises and a radical broadening of the tax base.
The government is in desperate need of the loan to cover a current account
deficit which totalled Dollars 3.2bn in 1990. The loan is also necessary to
ensure Greece's continuing creditworthiness as it goes to the market for an
estimated Dollars 3.6bn of foreign borrowing this year.
Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, the Prime Minister, denies that the terms of the
loan constitute an infringement of Greek sovereignty. 'What appears to have
been a set of conditions imposed from outside was in fact our policy,' says
Mr Mitsotakis. 'We told Brussels to tell us these things. Our economic
policy is a very courageous one and has various political and social risks
attached to it. But we are determined to carry out these vital reforms.'
Some Greek officials admit that the fact that Brussels is seen to be
imposing its terms on the future course of the economy has made life easier
for the government. In the divisive world of Greek politics it would have
found it hard to act alone. There could have been a series of damaging
strikes and social chaos.
There was some disquiet within EC ranks about the loan. Mr Mitsotakis says
agreement was reached only after consultations 'at a very high level'. At a
meeting of EC finance ministers in Milan last December it was suggested that
Greece should turn to the IMF for help. But Mr Delors and others have argued
that a solution to Greece's problems should be found 'within the family' of
the EC.
If Brussels shows signs of impatience with Athens, then many Greeks also
feel that the rich, well-developed countries of the EC do not have
sufficient regard for their country's particular problems - whether they are
ones of geography, politics or culture. 'We Greeks have been slow to learn
the intricacies of dealing with Brussels and have had difficulty in
co-ordinating our policies,' says one official. 'For that we are penalised.'
Like other countries on the EC's periphery, Greece feels it must be granted
some special treatment if, in the words of the Brussels bureaucrats, there
is to be 'a level playing pitch' between EC members.
On the macroeconomic level, Greece cannot be said to have made the most of
the opportunities offered by its 10-year EC membership. In 1981 Greek per
capita GDP was 58 per cent of the EC average: it is now 51 per cent. Large
inflows of EC money in the early 1980s were not used to make the fundamental
readjustments necessary in the economy.
Rather than modernise the agricultural sector by investing in agribusiness
industries, funds were used to import new cars or buy videos. As happened in
several other EC member countries, there was no proper supervision of
spending. EC monies helped the former socialist government of Mr Andreas
Papandreou to carry on the tradition of making political appointments to the
civil service and give electorally beneficial pay rises.
Mr Costas Simitis was national economy minister during the middle years of
the Papandreou era but resigned in 1987 when the former government, faced
with an election, abandoned its austerity programme. He admits that mistakes
have been made and that as a result Greece only has 'a weak voice' within
the EC. 'The trouble now is that the government does not have any specific
plan as to how it will bring about the reforms Brussels is asking for. For
instance, it has no idea about how to levy taxes on farmers,' says Mr
Simitis.
There is little talk of the unified market and 1992 in Greece. Ecu7bn of EC
structural funds covering the 1989-93 period may not be fully utilised due
to the lack of public and private matching investment. Of more immediate
concern are the implementation of wage agreements and bringing down
inflation.
Greek attitudes have changed. Greeks are firmly in favour of EC membership,
even if many still refer to Europe as 'over there'. 'We must make sacrifices
and fight hard to play our full part in Europe,' says a Greek official. 'If
we fail now, we risk being permanently marginalised.'

Kieran Cooke looks for changes in the country's foreign policy
</HEADLINE>

OPEN THE history books. Dust off the old maps. There is trouble again in the
Balkans.
The priorities of Greece's foreign policy have traditionally been Turkey,
Turkey again and then the US. Things are changing. Turkey is still top of
the list. But now the Balkans, a l o n g with the European Community, have
assumed greater importance.
In recent months foreign policy debate within the EC has been dominated by
the break-up of eastern Europe and the consequences of German unification.
But for Greece, problems in the Balkans are of far more concern.
'Our geographical position has always meant that we have special worries
about the Balkans,' says Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, the Prime Minister. 'Now
the problems in the region are acute.'
There is great concern about the possible break-up of Yugoslavia. Macedonia,
perched on Greece's northern borders, might become a break-away republic and
try to pursue what Athens terms as irredentist claims on Greek territory.
Turmoil in Yugoslavia would also have serious economic consequences. It
could put in jeopardy Greece's vital road links with the rest of the EC.
Mr Mitsotakis's government has worked hard to promote good relations with
the new regimes in Bulgaria and Romania. But Greece has been in something of
a quandary over recent events in Albania.
Earlier this year Mr Mitsotakis became the first Greek premier to visit
Tirana. A breakdown of Stalinist-type controls in Albania has meant a
partial opening of frontiers. Greece has suddenly found itself the rather
reluctant host to thousands of members of the Greek minority in southern
Albania. Having talked for years about the plight of this group in what is
known in Athens as North Epirus, the government cannot very well turn the
refugees back: Mr Mitsotakis has instead pleaded with them to stay in
Albania and await political changes.
But, as ever, Turkey remains at the centre of Greek foreign policy. 'The
problems between Greece and Turkey are still in the same old rancid state,'
says Mr Thanos Veremis of the Hellenic Foundation for Defence and Foreign
Policy. 'After Mr Papandreou (the former Greek premier) and Mr Ozal (the
then Turkish Prime Minister, now president) met in Davos in 1988 there was
talk of a rapprochement between the two sides, but nothing has come of it,'
Mr Veremis adds.
Greek a r g u m e n t s with Turkey focus on two issues. One is the
continuing Turkish presence in northern Cyprus, dating from the 1974
invasion. The other concerns various territorial claims - on the delineation
of the Aegean continental shelf, the extent of territorial waters and flight
controls in Aegean air space.
While the arguments might appear somewhat stale, they still have the
potential to erupt into open conflict. As recently as 1987, Greece and
Turkey were brought to the brink of war over rival oil exploration claims.
Suggestions that Greece has lessened its resolve in any way on the Cyprus
question are firmly dismissed by Mr Mitsotakis. He draws parallels between
recent events in the Gulf and the Cyprus question. 'I feel now that
conditions are better than ever for a settlement. The world reacted strongly
to the occupation of Kuwait. There is a foreign occupation in Cyprus. The
Security Council resolutions on the issue m u s t be i m p l e m e n t e d,'
says Mr Mitsotakis.
This view is unlikely to be echoed in Ankara. There are fears in Greece that
Turkish attitudes are hardening. The theory is that Turkish self-confidence
has been bolstered by its role as a vital support base for the allied forces
during the Gulf conflict.
Mr Antonis Samaras, the Greek foreign minister, has lobbied energetically in
western capitals to try to ensure that Greek interests are not forgotten. At
the same time, Mr Samaras has sought to reinforce relations with many
governments in the Middle East.
Greek officials admit that foreign policy, with the exception of attitudes
to Turkey, has lacked consistency. Mr Papandreou sought to weave a complex
set of relationships with the third world, with the countries of the Middle
East and with some of the now disgraced governments of eastern Europe.
During his term of office, there was much anti-US talk but behind the scenes
Athens remained close to Washington.
In the middle of last year Mr Mitsotakis became the first Greek premier to
make an official visit to the US in 27 years. He describes relations now as
'excellent'. A new agreement on US bases in Greece has been signed. Out of
the four bases one has already been closed through Pentagon cost-cutting
measures, while another is due to stop operating later this year.
But there are still some political difficulties between Athens and
Washington. Greece was angry about a State Department directive issued
during the Gulf war advising US nationals not to visit Athens.
More broadly, Greece is concerned that a Washington which is now more well-
disposed towards Turkey might try to upset the seven-to-10 ratio in military
aid given to Greece and Turkey. However, this ratio is more myth than fact -
for some time more US aid has been flowing to Turkey.
American officials in Athens say it is clear that the EC is now seen as 'big
brother' in Athens, rather than the US. Greece is among the most ardent
integrationists in the EC. It wants a common defence network and to become a
full member of the Western European Union (WEU). Some officials in Athens
say Turkey has been actively lobbying against the latter move.
Greece has been heartened by what it s e e s as increased EC interest in the
Cyprus question. Luxembourg, the present holder of the EC presidency, has
proposed some form of initiative on the issue: however, some EC members
clearly do not want the Community to be dragged into what is seen as an
argument between Greece and Turkey.
Last month Greece again used its veto within the Community to block Ecu600m
worth of EC aid to Turkey. The aid had been linked to progress on the Cyprus
issue. Greece said that if Turkey were to receive the funds, it would be
seen as 'a reward for Turkish intransigence.'
Again, some EC members were unhappy at this development. Greece recognises
that its interests are best served within the EC. But it is also beginning
to realise that there are limits to EC patience when it comes to old and
seemingly intractable arguments between Athens and Ankara.

FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of Greece (1): Awkward, but essential - After a year
in office, the Mitsotakis government is still trying to restructure the
economy and modernise public institutions. The challenge it faces is to keep
up the pace of reform without endangering the prevailing political consensus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
AT AN age when most politicians are putting the finishing touches to their
memoirs, Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, the 72-year-old Greek prime minister,
has undertaken the awkward task of making Greece more like other European
Community countries.
To succeed, he will need all the tenacity acquired during a career in which
the highest office always seemed to remain just beyond his grasp.
Though the socialists who ran Greece during the 1980s were mired in scandal
and clearly running out of steam, it was only after three elections and
almost a year of political uncertainty that the conservative New Democracy
party managed to scrape a one-seat parliamentary majority last April.
Mr Mitsotakis' chances of heading a stable government improved soon
afterwards when Mr Constantine Karamanlis, the veteran conservative
statesman who led Greece into the European Community a decade ago, was
elected president by parliament.
Mr Karamanlis has no executive powers as president - they were abolished by
the socialists - but as the founder of New Democracy, he wields considerable
influence in the party, especially among potential contenders for the
leadership.
He would almost certainly try to dissuade anyone who felt tempted to lead a
party rebellion aimed at forcing Mr Mitsotakis to retire and provoking a
fresh election. But given the magnitude of the country's economic problems
and the unpopular choices necessary to solve them, this is not likely to
happen in the near future.
Nor are the socialists putting up any serious opposition to the government's
three-year stabilisation programme. Indeed, Mr Andreas Papandreou, the
former prime minister, who was a keen advocate of state ownership while in
office, complained recently that the government was dragging its heels over
privatisation.
Mr Papandreou, also 72 and in uncertain health, has had some ups and downs
with his Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) in recent months as would-be
successors started manoeuvring for position. There are several strong
candidates but, like their conservative counterparts, they seem prepared to
play a waiting game.
In any case, the start of Mr Papandreou's long-awaited trial, together with
three former cabinet ministers, on charges of involvement in the Dollars
200m Bank of Crete embezzlement scandal rallied the party behind him. Mr
Papandreou's refusal to take part in the proceedings, which he claims are
the outcome of a political conspiracy against him, have taken much of the
drama out of the case.
The vengeful mood of two summers ago, when the conservatives joined forces
with the communist-led Left Alliance in a short-lived coalition government
for the exclusive purpose of prosecuting Mr Papandreou and his closest
associates, has faded away. Mr Mitsotakis has nothing to gain from reviving
past bitterness if he wants to keep austerity on track and at the same time
project an image abroad of responsible leadership.
Were it not for a recent shake-up in the Left Alliance, Greek political life
would almost be dull. After a contentious Communist Party congress where he
helped the Stalinist old guard re-establish control, Mr Harilaos Florakis,
the elderly communist leader, finally stepped down. Even more surprising in
a country with only a handful of female politicians, both Communists and the
Left Alliance elected women leaders who have scarcely turned 40. However,
continuing internal battles suggest the Alliance is now more likely to split
than to play a more significant role.
In foreign policy, relations with the United States, always unpredictable in
the Papandreou era, have shown a marked improvement. The signing of new
agreement for the US military bases, once a focus for acrimonious political
debate, was barely commented on. After contributing a frigate to the
multinational force in the Gulf war, Greece is participating for the first
time in a UN peacekeeping force, on the Iraq-Kuwait border.
But Turkey's increased regional importance following the war is causing
concern, while long-buried Balkan issues have resurfaced amid increasing
instability along Greece's northern borders.
Criticism of the government's performance during its first year in office
centres on the sluggish pace of reform. At the political level, Mr
Mitsotakis had little difficulty in obtaining a special European Community
loan to avert an impending balance of payments crisis and also provide some
seed money for long-overdue infrastructure projects.
But fulfilling the terms of the EC loan, essential if Greece is to
participate in the next stage of European economic and monetary union, does
not just mean improving the economic indicators - though this is hard enough
after a decade marked by stagnating industrial output, runaway deficit
growth and a growing black economy.
As a former economy minister, Mr Mitsotakis knows that cutting civil service
payrolls, being less generous with state pensions, broadening the tax base
and curbing tax evasion will require a radical overhaul of the public
administration - and of attitudes among its employees.
The price of failure, the government is beginning to fear, could be Greece's
relegation to satellite status within the Community.
Mr Mitsotakis says: 'We have to apply these policies. I'm prepared to lose
the next election if I have to, but this is the only way forward.'
In fact, the fiercest opposition to change comes from within the
conservative party. New Democracy supporters, together with a number of MPs
and party officials, feel resentful that their leader is trying to break
with the traditional rousfeti system by which public sector positions, from
cleaners to bank governors, were redistributed by the winning party after
each election. After eight years in opposition, and with unemployment
rising, they want a share of the cake.
But if Greece is to bring the economy in line with single market
requirements, let alone catch up with Portugal and Ireland, old habits will
have to be cast aside. A new class of efficient, non-partisan administrators
must be found.
Improving the state education system is crucial: state schools are
ill-equipped and badly-paid teachers take out their grievances in prolonged
strikes. Last winter high school students around the country staged a
three-week sit-in. The protests flared into disturbingly violent street
protests in Athens after a teacher was killed in a riot.
As a short-term solution, the government is trying to attract younger Greek
bankers and economists back from abroad with a fair degree of success. But
only a limited number of talented diaspora Greeks can be expected to put
their careers on hold for the sake of helping out at home.
It will be much harder, for example, to train several thousand tax
inspectors and motivate them to remain honest in a system where superiors
often turn a blind eye to corruption.
And just in the year since the conservatives took over, a new generation of
kareklokentavroi, administrators who cling to their jobs at all costs, has
sprung up among the temporary managers appointed to oversee the
privatisation programme.
Still, Greek businessmen are feeling more cheerful. There is persistent
grumbling about interest rates that hover just below 30 per cent, but the
more efficient companies in the private sector are busy positioning
themselves for an expected surge in growth after 1992. Deregulation of the
labour market, with the introduction of flexible hours and part-time work is
also making life easier.
'There are problems in co-ordinating policy, between the public sector, the
private sector and local government for instance. The government lacks
management skills. But it's moving in the right direction,' says Mr Stelios
Argyros, president of the Federation of Greek Industries.

FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of the Electricity Industry (9): Pressures mounting -
The US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT SOUNDS like the antithesis of capitalism: in several US states
electricity supply companies can now raise their profits by persuading
customers not to buy their product.
The move is part of an energy conservation effort that underlines the severe
economic and environmental pressures facing the US supply industry in an era
of increasing competition, rising anti-pollution costs and huge capital
spending demands. A combination of all these forces has started to produce a
merger wave in the highly fragmented industry.
Since the early 1970s, US electric power utilities have been battered by a
combination of rising costs and increasing regulation on pricing, new plant
construction and other issues. Many are still paying for the nuclear power
plants ordered in the 1970s but then, abandoned or not, built on time or to
cost. According to the Edison Electric Institute, an industry body, the
companies are producing an average return on equity of about 10 per cent,
compared with the 13 per cent that state regulatory commissions usually
allow.
Foremost among the new challenges facing them now is the cost of complying
with last year's Clean Air Act which mandates that sulphur dioxide
emissions, a key component of acid rain, be reduced at coal-fired power
stations by about half by the end of the decade.
Utilities make some 60 per cent of their power from coal and they have two
choices in complying with the legislation. They can switch from burning
soft, high sulphur coal to hard coal, but this will push up transport costs.
Alternatively, they can install expensive flue gas desulphurisation systems,
otherwise known as scrubbers, or experiment with newer technologies such as
fluidised bed combustion. The Edison Institute says that meeting the demands
of the act will cost the industry up to Dollars 105bn (Pounds 58.60bn) by
2010.
In addition to modifying old plant, the industry is going to have to build
much new capacity over the next 10 to 20 years to replace old plant and meet
new demand. It is expected to add more than 90,000 net megawatts of new
capacity by the end of the 1990s.
Several factors have made the business climate more helpful to non-utility
companies which wish to generate power. The Bush administration, keen to
foster competition in the wholesale power market, has proposed in its
recently unveiled energy strategy to remove 55-year-old restrictions on
companies owning independent power stations.
The Public Utility Holding Act of 1935 has kept industrial companies out of
the power business and prevented utilities from building generating plant
outside their territories and then selling that power on the open market.
Other groups have been free to jump into this market: the Public Utility
Regulatory Policy Act of 1978 opened the door for small producers of
alternative energy to sell power on the open market.
Repeal of the 1935 law has stirred up controversy within the utility
industry, with some wanting the freedom to build stations around the country
and others unhappy at the presence of independents in their areas.
Federal regulators also want changes in control of utilities' transmission
lines. At present, while the utilities are required by law to buy power from
independents, they control the electricity after that.
The regulators would like to allow the independents to find their own
customers. That has brought howls of outrage from the industry, which argues
that the interlopers will simply steal their best clients.
All these factors are forcing some radical changes on the industry. The more
far-sighted utilities have been slashing costs and many have set up their
own independent power ventures. They have also turned to management of the
demand side through energy saving, prompted by changes in the regulatory
climate: regulators have begun to offer the companies a return on their
energy savings outlays which is broadly the same as the investment they have
been making in power plants.
The rule changes - instituted in states such as Massachusetts, New York and
California - have turned conservation from a costly chore for the utilities
into some of their most profitable operations. The so-called 'megawatt'
business involves handing out to customers efficient new equipment and
sharing in the savings by charging higher rates. The trend has brought
together some unusual bedfellows, with conservationists pleased that this
means less power station construction and utilities pleased that they are
spared the capital costs of new facilities.
The new competitive pressures are forcing the utilities to consider the
once-outrageous suggestion that they should get together in mergers. There
has been a rash of bids over the past year, including the industry's first
important hostile offer, when Kansas City Power &amp; Light made a run at
neighbouring Kansas Gas and Electric. Behind the merger wave lies a drive
for greater efficiency. Mr Edward Tirello, an analyst at Smith, Barney
Harris Upham, and a long-time merger advocate, estimates that about Dollars
3.6bn of annual cost savings for the industry could be generated through
more economic and efficient operation of plant.
The largest economies from consolidation would come from pooling - the
ability to use a more economic generating plant mix in the consolidated
service area during periods of low demand.
The long hand of the regulators could slow down this movement. Only last
month officials of the California Public Utilities Commission dealt a heavy,
though not yet fatal, blow to the 1988 proposed merger of South California
Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric, which would create the largest
utility in the nation. The officials agreed that the deal would provide
about Dollars 1bn of benefits to customers but complained that its
anti-competitive impact outweighed this.

FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of the Electricity Industry (8): Investment will cut
the bills - Demand for energy efficiency is focusing on the generators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
SOME 20 per cent of the UK's energy bill could be saved by investing in
'cost-effective energy efficiency measures', according to Mr William
Rickett, director-general of the UK Energy Efficiency Office.
The scope for reducing energy use is not in doubt. Nor is the need to do it.
Carbon dioxide (CO), the main 'greenhouse' gas causing global warming, can
only be tackled by reducing energy consumption. Rather than meeting
increasing energy demand with increasing supply, existing supplies must be
used more efficiently. Demand for change will focus on the electricity
industry, an important contributor to CO emissions.
The UK has radically re-structured its electricity industry over the past
two years in preparation for the private sector. The restructuring arguably
offered a unique opportunity to incorporate incentives for energy efficiency
into the licences and the regulation of the new companies. The opportunity
was not taken.
Under the system in England and Wales, it is in everyone's interests to sell
electricity, and in no one's to save. The profits of the generators depend
on maintaining their market share. The profits of the 12 regional
electricity companies (RECs) depend on the amount of electricity they
distribute and sell. The duty to 'promote', not enforce, energy efficiency
lies with the regulator, Professor Littlechild. So far this regulation
consists of ensuring the RECs provide their customers with adequate
information on ways to cut consumption.
What privatisation may do is open up the generation side of the market for
new, more efficient technologies. Nearly all of the plant being built or
proposed today is based on combined cycle gas-fired turbines (CCGT) which
achieve greater efficiency levels than conventional coal-fired plant. It has
also raised the profile of combined heat and power (CHP), which has
potential efficiency levels of more than 80 per cent.
Critics point out that by splitting generation and distribution, and by the
regulatory formula used, the government has removed the potential to
introduce measures to curb demand, such as least-cost planning. This
involves a utility considering whether improving the end-use efficiency of
its customers is more cost-effective than building new generating plant.
Least-cost planning is being 'aggressively pursued' in about 20 US states,
according to Mr Mike Foley of the US National Association of Regulatory
Utility Commissioners (NARUC). Some state regulators require utilities to
explore both demand and supply-side options before licensing new capacity.
In most cases, utilities are then allowed to claim back a rate of return on
their investments in energy efficiency.
The employment of demand-side management is due to be expanded as part of
the new US National Energy Strategy (NES). Although the power industry at
first resisted this approach, many utilities are now finding it profitable.
These include New England Electric, Boston Edison and Pacific Gas and
Electric, three large, privately-owned utilities.
According to Mr Mike Monahan of Boston Edison, such demand-side management
is Edison's main focus because at 'the bottom line it is more cost-effective
to buy back electricity than it is to build new generating plant'. Boston
Edison will spend Dollars 250m (Pounds 139.6m) to 1995 on energy
conservation measures for its customers, including distributing compact
fluorescent lightbulbs, and offering free energy audits. In this way, it
shaved some 130MW off its peak demand growth in 1990; by 2000, it expects
the figure to be closer to 300MW-400MW.
One of the reasons this strategy works is that most US utilities are
vertically integrated and have a mandate to serve a particular area. They
therefore have an incentive to cut demand. The UK RECs, on the other hand,
are distributors and suppliers whose franchise market is due to disappear
over the next eight years. An attempt by the House of Lords to enable the
regulator, under the Electricity Bill, to enforce energy efficiency measures
before approving tariff increases was overturned in the Commons.
The structure of the European electricity supply industry is diverse, and
consequently the potential for least-cost planning patchy. Swedish
state-owned utility Vattenfall believes it could cut 12TWh-19TWh out of a
commercial and residential demand of 70TWh a year. The next phase, due this
autumn, is to discover how much of this potential can be realised.
According to Mr Morgan Andersson, project manager, the recent decision by
the Swedish government to delay the phase-out of nuclear power means that
'it is still vital to keep conservation measures going, but the commercial
incentive has changed'. Vattenfall now has no need for new generation until
2000.
Other Swedish utilities, notably Stockholm Energi, and some German utilities
have implemented demand-side management measures. Italy's state-owned
utility ENEL is a vertically-integrated monopoly supplier faced with growing
demand and increasingly unable to site new plant due to environmental
opposition. It has started to look at how to cut domestic demand by working
with manufacturers to promote more efficient electrical appliances.
A recent study for the UK Energy Department by the March Consulting Group
estimates that in the UK alone, replacing appliances with the best available
on the world market could save 24,000GWh of electricity.
The MCG report, along with the recently released Energy Select Committee
report on energy efficiency, comes to the now familiar conclusion that
improvements are unlikely to happen without government intervention. Schemes
to label appliances according to their efficiency have been introduced by
France, Denmark, and Germany with varying degrees of success, but no
European country has implemented labelling fully.
Again, the US record is impressive, with the 1987 National Appliance Energy
Conservation Act setting minimum standards for domestic appliances. The
recent NES is set to expand this. A number of US utilities also offer
customer rebates for buying efficient electrical appliances.
Meanwhile it may be left to international legislative moves to take energy
efficiency to the top of the agenda. Movement may be slow, but environmental
legislation is set to grow increasingly stringent. The European Commission
has already issued a directive setting standards for SOx and NOx emissions
from power plants.
An EC draft directive calls for compulsory labelling for most domestic
appliances in member states from July 1992. Minimum standards are set to
follow.
Future pressure from the Intergovernmental Panel for Climatic Change to cut
global CO emissions may force utilities and governments to try a little
harder.

FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of the Electricity Industry (6): Energy policy
divided - Japan is torn between nuclear commitment and green issues

<TEXT>
CAUGHT BETWEEN surging demand for electricity and the government's
commitment to environmental protection, Japan's electric power producers and
the ministry that rules them can see only one panacea: nuclear power.
Japan lacks energy resources, so nuclear power generation is vital because
otherwise the nation depends on foreign sources and is vulnerable to
unpredictable fuel costs.
In late February, in Niigata prefecture, the No 2 reactor of Tokyo's
regional electric power supplier was shut for six days and restarted at the
end of the month after an accident attributed to human failure.
Earlier that month, a nasty contretemps at the Mihama Nuclear Power Plant
occurred when the day after a minor accident at the plant, local residents
received leaflets from the power company declaring the facility
accident-proof. While neither incident seems to have caused injuries or
contamination outside the plant itself, they may help to revive the agendas
of anti-nuclear groups.
It has been nearly five years since the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry (Miti) began reducing power companies' rates, to pass to consumers
the benefits of soaring profits ushered in by the strong yen and cheap oil
prices. But then the price of oil went up. In the year ending March 31 1990,
pre-tax profits at Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco) fell to Y185bn
(Pounds 770.83m) from the previous year's Y275bn-plus, a far cry from 1987,
when the company raked in more than Y444bn. Pre-tax profits for the year
ending March 31 are estimated at a dismal Y95bn.
Add to that the likelihood that the government will slap a tax on petroleum
products to cover around 10 per cent of the Dollars 9bn to be provided in
support of the allied forces campaign in the Gulf, and things could get even
worse. An industry report from Jardine Fleming Securities in late January
said: 'Doubling the tax rate could plunge EP (electric power) companies into
the red and necessitate a rate hike.'
Rate negotiations between the government and the companies occur annually.
An increase could be approved this spring, depending on the direction of
interest rates and oil prices, the report added.
According to Tepco, the company can still make 'reasonable profits' without
a rate increase, thanks to Japan's continuing economic expansion and
enormous demand from the Tokyo region. Underscoring its long-term resilience
are the triple-A ratings assigned to the company's outstanding foreign and
domestic bonds (total: around Dollars 11bn), and the high rating of its
Y300bn in commercial paper.
The Jardine Fleming report noted Tepco's high 71.5 per cent ratio of
interest-bearing debt to capitalisation, but added that 'interest rate
movements cannot justify all the changes over time in EP company
profitability'.
Tepco says it will 'overcome' and 'survive' the risks ahead. The company is
reducing dependence on oil, while capital outlays for nuclear power plant
construction since the 1970s are claimed to have made it less vulnerable to
fossil fuel price vagaries.
The biggest private sector electric power concern in the world, Tepco is one
of nine Japanese regional publicly-held electric power companies which
together produced almost 75 per cent of the country's 798,756m kWh of total
electric power output in 1989-90.
All the regional power companies are dealing with intensifying competition
by diversification into such fields as heat supply services,
telecommunications and urban development.
Tepco used nuclear fuel sources for nearly 30 per cent of its total
generation (205bn kWh) in 1989. The company relied on LNG-based generation
for 36 per cent of output, while oil dependence was 28 per cent. In the
electric power industry as a whole, nuclear powered electricity output
accounted for around 23 per cent of total electricity generated in Japan in
1989.
The government's fixation on nuclear power generation is not new. The
country revved up its first commercially operated nuclear power station in
July 1966. The 1970s oil shocks were something of an apocalypse:
construction started on no fewer than 22 nuclear plants during the 1980s. At
present the country has 38 nuclear power plants with another 13 under
construction and several more on the drawing board.
Already three other regional electric power companies - Kansai, Kyushu and
Hokuriku - generate more than 40 per cent of their total outputs from
nuclear sources, while Shikoku Electric Power generates 38 per cent from
nuclear. The heavy reliance by the regionals on nuclear-sourced power has
made them prime targets for anti-nuclear protesters, who have successfully
stalled construction of several new reactors.
By 2010, Miti, which regulates and sets strategy for the power companies,
intends to double the number of reactors to 78 and boost nuclear power
supply to 43 per cent of total electric power generation.
While Miti officials claim the anti-nuclear movement has lost momentum since
the Chernobyl disaster, the ministry is not taking the opposition threat
lightly. It plans a nationwide three-year PR project later this year
directed at specific groups, including housewives, teenagers and company
employees.
The ministry's strategy is to target the moderates, instead of reacting
directly to the anti-nuclear movement. The project includes a personal
computer-style network that provides information and news on nuclear power
in public places and at nuclear plant sites. PC-owners can dial a phone
number to access the network and the ministry will monitor public opinion
through questionnaires and by telephone.
As part of its effort, the ministry is also distributing free about half a
million copies of a glossy, 100-page brochure crammed with pictures,
diagrams and flow charts.
In spite of having to close a reactor at its plant in Fukushima, north of
Tokyo, for nearly two years after a breakdown in January 1989, Tepco's
current nuclear construction schedule has 'no symptom of delay,' the company
says.
A shift in Japanese political balance appears to brighten the future of
nuclear power generation. The Social Democratic Party of Japan (formerly the
Socialist Party), a strong foe of all things nuclear, seems to have
squandered the opportunity it gained in elections last year. Amid its
disarray, the SDPJ looks incapable of mounting public support to counter the
government's nuclear power commitment.
But short-term difficulties persist. If this summer is as hot as the last,
the industry could blow a fuse. Last July, Tepco met a record surge in power
demand by reportedly getting a big kilowatt injection from other regionals
and by urging consumption restraints to ward off power cuts. Miti says it is
boosting needed transfers of AC from one generating plant to another when
shortages occur.
In a further effort to take the heat off electric power companies, Miti says
it is expanding its policy of offering discounts to big industrial
consumers, such as steel, car and chemicals producers, that agree to cut
power use during peak demand times.
A recent Credit Suisse industry report said 65.7 per cent of the country's
total electric power demand (including supplies from independent generators)
in 1989 was for commercial and industrial use.
The ministry is also trying to curb residential demand that has rocketed
owing to the rapid proliferation of home air conditioners.

FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of the Electricity Industry (7): New image for state
monolith - France, EdF
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH state-owned power utility, Electricite de France is striving to
break away from its past as a relic of central industrial control.
The group's independent-minded managers are acutely conscious that EdF
stands out in a world where governments are tending to withdraw from public
utilities. They want to change that image, to help EdF advance in the export
markets it sorely needs.
After the privatisation and break-up of Britain's electricity industry, EdF
is left as the only electricity monopoly in Europe responsible for all of
its system, from power generation through to the distribution to customers.
It is this strong central organisation, under the continued control of the
Industry Ministry, which has allowed EdF to pursue a consistent pro-nuclear
investment policy since France's decision to build its own nuclear energy
source in the wake of the 1973 oil price crisis.
This has left France today more dependent on nuclear power than any country
in the world. EdF draws more than 80 per cent of its electricity from its 57
reactors, providing the cheapest electrical power of any European Community
country apart from Denmark, a significant advantage for French industry.
Yet the French nuclear power programme has been criticised as
over-ambitious, having produced a surplus of seven to eight reactors,
according to one official report. It attracts sporadic criticism from
France's vocal but surprisingly disorganised environmental lobby, although
not enough to cast serious doubt on France's nuclear consensus.
For these and purely technical reasons, EdF does not plan to increase its
proportional dependence on this source of energy, say officials.
While the state has reduced its influence on EdF's decisions, as it has
across France's nationalised industries, the utility's top managers are
beginning to see government control - especially on pricing - as a hindrance
to their bid to strengthen EdF as the EC's biggest energy exporter.
EdF's cross-border energy sales rose 8 per cent last year to 46.5bn kWh or
12 per cent of the total and the group wishes to raise exports to near 20
per cent of the total by the end of the decade.
At the same time, the group aims to play a significant part in the
replacement of ageing reactors in the Soviet Union and eastern Europe. Over
the past two years, EdF has delivered a computerised reactor safety
monitoring system to the Soviet Union and opened negotiations for joint
ventures to build reactors in Hungary and Czechoslovakia. It also looks set
to emerge in the next few months as the main foreign company to be allocated
a stake in eastern Germany's electricity supply industry.
The export drive is partly designed to help mop up EdF's nuclear surplus,
but also to help run down the FFr226.1bn (Pounds 22.3bn) debt load that EdF
has built up as a result of the nuclear programme, and to earn the cash
needed to update some of the older reactors.
Already, the French utility's international ambitions have caused anxiety in
politically influential German coal-producing regions, worried about the
threat of cheap imported nuclear electricity accelerating job losses in the
mines. And in Britain, EdF's attempts to sell excess power at advantageous
rates to industrial customers in France have attracted competitors'
suspicion.
Mr Jean Bergougnoux, EdF's managing director, points out that it is hard to
persuade EC competition authorities that he is not dumping electricity when
his government runs a pricing policy that squeezes EdF's profits. 'A company
like EdF must have balanced accounts if it is to be perceived as a fair
competitor,' he says.
In theory, EdF's contract with the Paris government obliges it to hold price
rises at 1.5 percentage points below the rate of inflation. Yet in practice,
the government has, until recently, tended to hold rates lower than that,
with the result that EdF has made losses for six out of the past 11 years.
The powerful Finance Ministry argues that cheap power helps curb inflation
and so supports the value of the franc, an idea which provokes the derision
of Mr Pierre Delaporte, EdF's sometimes outspoken chairman. 'If we were
convinced that the delay in allowing us to raise our tariffs was necessary
to keep the franc safe on the international foreign exchange markets, we
would gladly sacrifice on the altar of the fatherland, but we do not believe
it for a moment,' he said recently.
However, in February, EdF received the go-ahead to increase prices by 2.2
per cent, as against the 2.8 per cent general inflation rate forecast for
1991 - a rise greeted as 'moderate' by Mr Delaporte.
Certainly, EdF is gradually beginning to look more like a commercially fair
competitor than a state monolith. It is now 10 years since it last received
a subsidy from the government.
EdF even managed to produce a profit in 1990, partly thanks to an increase
in exports and also reflecting the first fruits of a plan to cut costs by
FFr1bn.
Mr Bergougnoux believes that it is only a matter of time before the rigours
of EC competition law force the government to give him a freer hand on
prices. As he pointed out in a recent interview: 'European competition will
in the end have its effect. Brussels will remind the government that the
electricity market will conform to competition rules.'

FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of the Electricity Industry (4): Moulding a
management culture - The UK's privatisation process puts it at the forefront
of changes in the industry: FT writers look at aspects of the new structure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID THOMAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE run-up to its privatisation last month, National Power, the largest
electricity company in the UK, issued its managers with a little blue book.
'Transforming National Power' was a hymn of praise to change. It was written
by a management consultant who had been appointed as the personal adviser on
new working practices to Mr John Baker, National Power's chief executive.
'Lean', 'flexible', 'open', 'entrepreneurial' and 'commercial' are the
buzzwords running through the booklet.
'Committee Rule was the old philosophy,' it enthuses. 'Now the ability to
take individual management decisions must become accepted behaviour - in
fact, people who respond quickly and effectively without going through the
hierarchy will be encouraged.'
It would be easy to poke fun at the often over-simplied homilies which make
up much of its 65 pages. Yet the message it contains would come as a shock
to most managers in many of the state-owned, monopoly-protected utilities
which still characterise much of the electricity industry worldwide.
Changing the management culture was one of the most important tasks that
National Power's top executives set themselves in preparation for
privatisation. Mr Baker and his immediate lieutenants have been stung by
frequent taunts, not least from the City, that National Power was slower
moving and more bureaucratic than PowerGen, its smaller rival. If that were
not bad enough, the lessons of previous privatisations, such as those of
British Gas and British Telecom, spoke volumes about the difficulties facing
utilities in adjusting to the cold wind of the private sector.
Each of the company's 35 power stations has been turned into a profit
centre, with the station manager held clearly responsible for financial
performance. A sharper system of financial reporting links power station and
head office. And ramming the message home is a new performance pay scheme
which can determine up to 30 per cent of a manager's salary.
Such initiatives will inevitably take time to work through. Meanwhile,
National Power has articulated a range of other strategies for improving its
performance in the private sector. Top of the agenda is cost cutting.
National Power has already shed about 1,000 jobs, reducing its workforce to
just over 15,000. That leaves its stated target of losing another 4,000 jobs
over the next five years, although industry observers will not be surprised
if that target is exceeded.
Two thirds of the job losses are likely to come from power station closures,
with the rest from more efficient working across the company. In the past
year, National Power has shut five of its coal-fired stations, contributing
just over 1,000MW towards its stated goal of closing 3,000MW of capacity by
the middle of the decade - a target which the prospectus warns might be
exceeded.
Not only does closure help cut costs; it is also central to National Power's
fuel strategy. The company wants to reduce its dependence on fuel from
British Coal, switching instead to gas, because gas-fired stations using
combined cycle technology are quicker to build, cheaper to run and more
environmentally friendly.
The other plank in National Power's fuel strategy is an increase in coal
imports, which are typically cheaper than supplies from British Coal.
Overall, Mr Baker plans to cut National Power's fuel bill by about Pounds
250m, or 10 per cent, within about five years.
But National Power is bound to remain heavily dependent in the medium term
on British Coal, which will supply National Power with about 43.6m tonnes of
coal this year.
Indeed, National Power's directors were only prepared to commit themselves
in the privatisation prospectus to 'a progressive dividend policy' until
1993, the expiry date for the coal contract and the other arrangements
nailed in place by the government to give the industry stability in its
early years in the private sector.
After 1993, the prospectus warned, 'National Power will be operating in a
more competitive market, and revenues will be sensitive to the balance
between demand and available capacity and to other market conditions.'

BEING SMALL has its advantages. As Napoleon, Tamburlaine, and countless
famous others have found, it can strengthen the resolve.
PowerGen, the smaller of the two electricity generating companies, has
already proven both shrewd and assertive. Since the early days of its
privatisation, it has come across as the friendly face of generation. But
within the velvet glove the management is keeping a firm, if not an iron,
grip on the newly created electricity market.
There are few signs of a public sector mentality at PowerGen. Chief
executive Mr Ed Wallis, who has been in the industry since he was fifteen,
is no bureaucrat, but a sharp and direct, hands-on manager.
Having got over the fracas when Mr Robert Malpas, the company's chairman,
left the company just before its privatisation, the board is now a
close-knit team.
Although smaller than National Power, PowerGen is by no means small. It
supplies around 9mMW hours of electricity, to 100 customers - on average
slightly smaller customers than National Power - and has 21 power stations.
It will make a pro forma profit before tax of Pounds 264m in the year ending
31st March 1991, and expects to pay dividends of Pounds 43m, according to
the flotation prospectus.
But it has done its best to capitalise on seeming small and approachable.
'The customer is king,' says Mr Wallis, and the company made a point of
offering the regional electricity companies, its largest customers,
customised packages of electricity.
It has won other customers like this: Toyota was seduced with a tailor-made
contract and was the first large industrial customer to sign to take
electricity directly from a generator.
But this accommodating philosophy did not stop PowerGen from competing
fiercely with the regional companies to supply large customers, during
recent bargaining rounds. PowerGen had been very aggressive, several
regional companies reported, and was undercutting their offers.
Not so, says Mr Roberts. 'We offered the same prices to the regional
companies as we did to direct customers.' But PowerGen does not deny it is
keenly interested in winning more large customers.
The company's attitude to price is, similarly, hardheaded. Electricity is,
Mr Wallis says, a commodity, and despite all the talk of customer relations
there is no chance the company will forget the importance of competitive
pricing.
PowerGen has been equally vigorous in its approach to fuel purchasing and
particularly in diversification away from traditional coal-fired generation.
It was the first generator to commission a new combined cycle gas turbine
power station, and has secured gas supplies for a 680MW station at Rye House
in Hertfordshire, as well as the 900MW Killingholme station on Humberside -
which will take all the gas from the North Sea Pickerill field in the first
such single field deal.
PowerGen's commitment to new gas technology is matched by its interest in
the latest coal technology. It has invested in a British Coal project at
Grimethorpe in Yorkshire, which is developing combustion technology to burn
coal more cleanly, and has joined the US electrical power research
institute, EPRI, which has made considerable investment in clean coal
technology.
The company has already invested Pounds 250m in flue gas desulphurisation
(FGD) technology which scrubs the gases that leave coal-fired stations for
its Ratcliffe-on-Soar power station in Nottingham.
But PowerGen is also looking hard at importing foreign, low sulphur coal.
Four out of its five large coal-fired power stations have easy access to
coastal terminals, making it easy to import, as the company has pointed out.
It is pursuing a policy of diversification away from UK coal.
Whether innovation will actually help PowerGen compensate for its size is
another question.
It is already true that National Power has more control over the bidding
which sets the electricity price in the pool, or spot market, simply because
it has more power stations than PowerGen. This, however, may begin to change
as more independent power stations come onstream.

'LIKE A system of outdoor relief for the City,' is how Mr Frank Dobson,
shadow energy secretary, has scornfully described the long list of advisers
involved in the complex privatisation of the electricity industry.
Certainly the number of people who have been drafted in is large. Last
autumn, one estimate put the total on the government's side at about 700,
and that was excluding those working on the Scottish sale.
Yet the merchant bankers, solicitors, accountants, stockbrokers and printers
involved in the privatisation process hotly deny they are overly rewarded.
'It has tied up lots of our people and frankly we could have made more money
out of doing something else.' said one merchant banker.
It is not surprising that advisers have found it irksome. The telephone
directory-sized prospectus for the 12 regional electricity companies (Recs)
had advisers working a seven-day week from last August to the start of
November.
But while in the run-up to the Recs' Pounds 5.2bn flotation there were no
conflicts of interest between government advisers and those looking after
the companies, during negotiations over the generators, relations between
the Department of Energy and Lazard, representing National Power and SG
Warburg for PowerGen, became ever more fraught.
This was partly because the government kept changing its mind about how to
sell the companies, before they were eventually floated jointly on the
market in February.
Mr John Wakeham, energy secretary, sprung a nasty surprise on PowerGen last
summer when he flirted with the idea of selling it in a trade auction,
underwritten by Hanson, the industrial conglomerate.
SG Warburg had found itself in the complicated position of being told to
erect a Chinese wall inside its corporate finance department, between those
people advising the independent directors of PowerGen and those advising the
managers on a mooted MBO. Then in August Mr Wakeham executed an about-turn
and reverted to the idea of floating the company.
Another surprise came in January when the Department of Energy decided to
sell 60 per cent instead of 100 per cent of the shares in the companies'
combined flotation.
The companies' advisers complained that they had not been properly consulted
on the decision. Many felt the decision had been taken against the advice of
Kleinwort, the government's financial adviser.
But despite all the bitterness that had arisen, the department still
believed it could congratulate itself on its handling of the City during the
sale
because it managed to introduced a number of unusual features into the
flotation structure.
These altered the relationship between the government and the underwriting
institutions, marking a departure from the traditional underwriting method,
whereby investors were allocated shares simply in relation to their
weighting in the London equity market.
However, this would not encourage institutions - who know they would get a
certain amount whatever ludicrous level they suggested - to be forthcoming
in discussions about how the shares ought to be priced. Instead, Kleinwort
carried out a bookbuilding operation based on practice in the Euro-equity
market. Here, institutions were asked to say precisely how much stock they
would take within a range of prices. Those prepared to buy at the keenest
prices were favoured when allocations were made.
There was a further reshuffling of shares between underwriters, just before
stock market dealings started. This so-called 'back-end tender' was designed
to ensure that at least part of the sale - 16 per cent - would be sold at a
price reflecting that at which the shares would start trading, some two
weeks after the 100p partly-paid issue price had been struck.
In the tender, underwriters were invited to rebid for shares at levels above
100p, being required to pay the price they bid. The tender added Pounds 42m
to the Pounds 2.16bn flotation proceeds.
Despite initial concerns that the City would not stomach these ideas, Mr
Wakeham was sufficiently encouraged by the results to declare the flotation
a 'text-book exercise'.
But another surprise was to come. Nomura, the Japanese securities house,
which had not bid aggressively in the back-end tender, began buying large
amounts of stock in the market. This for a short time, pushed the shares to
premiums as high as 140p compared with their 100p partly-paid price - just
what the department and Kleinwort had gone to such trouble to avoid.
Nomura's reasons are still not entirely clear, but it has said it was unable
to bid heavily in the tender to satisfy strong demand at home because of a
Ministry of Finance rule covering offers for sale - the method by which the
shares were being distributed in Japan while the tender was going on. This
would have prevented Nomura offloading shares acquired in the tender at
prices above 100p.
Daiwa, lead manager for Japan in the Scottish companies' sale, is currently
in discussions with the Ministry of Finance to find a way round this
problem.

FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of the Electricity Industry (2): Greens urge sales
reduction - The Environment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

DRAW YOUR curtains at dusk. Use a toaster to make toast. Dust your
lightbulbs frequently. They may sound like commonsense, but these household
hints are a central plank - although some say a shaky one - of the UK
government's environmental strategy for the electricity industry.
They come from Yorkshire Electricity's recently published Code of Practice
on the efficient use of electricity. Under the regulations of the new
electricity industry, each regional electricity company must publish such a
code, helping the public get more value from each unit of electricity.
The industry rarely talks about using less electricity, environmental
lobbyists such as Friends of the Earth point out. 'A reduction in
electricity sales is needed to reduce the threat of global warming,' the
group insisted in a document published in October last year.
Electricity is, Friends of the Earth says, 'Britain's number one
contributor' to both global warming and acid rain.
Every unit of electricity (kWh) used, the group points out, means the
emission of nearly 1kg of carbon dioxide (CO), one of the 'greenhouse'
gases. The UK electricity industry is responsible for around 33 per cent of
the CO released into the atmosphere every year.
It is also a leading producer of the gases that cause acid rain - nitrogen
oxides (NOx) and sulphur dioxides (SOx), annually releasing around 0.8m
tonnes of NOx - 71 per cent of the UK total - and 2.6m tonnes of SOx - 29
per cent of the national total.
There are two basic ways to deal with the problem - developing technology to
generate electricity more cleanly and efficiently; and using less of it, or
energy efficiency.
Japan is often held up as a model - its energy ratio is 2.7 compared with
the UK's 4.2, undeniably helped by the fact that energy is expensive. It
also has a package of stringent regulations enforcing energy efficiency such
as labelling for electrical appliances, setting building standards and
giving incentives for energy saving measures.
The UK government has begun to go the same way - although not far enough,
its critics say. It will spend Pounds 26m this year on grants to help low
income households use less energy, and will probably introduce a voluntary
appliance labelling scheme next year.
In addition, under the new electricity industry regulations, all users pay a
levy on electricity generated from fossil fuels which then goes to fund more
environmentally friendly methods of producing electricity. All the regional
electricity companies, moreover, must take a certain percentage of their
electricity from these 'renewable' sources, such as wind or wave power.
The government's white paper on the environment sets a target of 1,000MW to
be generated from renewables by the year 2000, and has further said they
could provide 24 per cent of UK energy by 2025. But from the electricity
industry's point of view, what really matters is finding ways to make fossil
fuel production of electricity cleaner.
The industry is under pressure - new UK legislation, under the auspices of
the EC, will require power stations to cut SOx emissions to 60 per cent
below 1980 levels by 2003, while NOx must be 30 per cent lower than in 1980
by 1998.
And the International Panel for Climate Change (IPCC), has set a target of
stabilising CO at 1990 levels by 2005, with which the UK has conditionally
complied.
There are three main options for the industry. First, it can clean up after
combustion of coal or oil, notably by fitting scrubbers known as 'flue gas
desulphurisation' or FGD units to the power station chimneys, which clean
the gas as it leaves.
This is the route the UK has so far adopted - 8,000MW of FGD are being
fitted at present. However, few people regard this as an adequate long-term
solution: FGD does not deal with NOx and critics point out that 8,000MW is a
negligible amount compared with continental FGD installations.
The second option is to switch into another fuel. Natural gas is the
frontrunner. It releases very little sulphur or nitrogen, and burnt
efficiently in a new 'combined cycle gas turbine' station (CCGT) which
recovers waste heat from combustion to drive a steam turbine, it is around
50 per cent efficient compared with 37 per cent at best for a conventional
coal fired station. This means less CO is released per unit of electricity
produced. Most of the new power stations due to come onstream in the mid-90s
in Europe will be CCGT.
The third option is to devise technology that burns coal more cleanly. In
Europe and the US a new generation of coal-fired power stations is being
developed. By the 1990s they will be up and running - and green enough,
their creators say, to compete with gas.
There are other variants: in the UK British Coal has masterminded a process
 -known as 'the topping cycle' which combines partial gasification with the
new combustion technology. These clean coal technologies can cut emissions
of sulphur by up to 99 per cent, and nitrogen by between 80 and 90 per cent.
By improving efficiency from 35 per cent to up to 46 per cent they also cut
CO emissions.
The UK has no plans for any clean coal plant. The government has invested
around Pounds 20m in clean coal research, and is currently conducting a
review of the area, which may result in further investment later this year.
So far the money to fund a clean coal plant - a new technology that involves
commercial risk so cannot win City backing - is just not there.
Ultimately, however, it will only be built when the two electricity
generators order it, and while gas continues to be cheap and available, they
are very unlikely to do so.
But environmentalists should take heart. A quiet revolution in industry's
use of electricity is taking place. CHP or combined heat and power systems,
which generate electricity and heat from a single source, are slowly
catching on.
These systems can be twice as efficient as conventional boilers and can cut
CO emissions by 70 per cent. If CHP capacity reaches 30,000MW by 2020, as
the government hopes, national CO emissions could fall by 15 per cent.

FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of the Electricity Industry (1): New market pressures
 -In addition to the rigours of recession, the electricity industry is
having to meet new demands. Growing competition in the market and the
pressure to protect the environment mean that utilities are being forced to
reshape their strategies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID THOMAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SLOWLY but surely, competitive forces are beginning to prise open the
monopolistic and nationalistic world of electricity generation.
Utilities around the world are beginning to feel the cold winds of
commercial pressures. 'The old watchwords of 'obligation to serve' and
'build new capacity to meet future demand well in advance' are being
replaced by an industry built on contractual relations and commercial
orientation,' a recent report on the European industry concluded.*
Governments are cutting back their funding support for the industry and
large industrial customers are increasingly chafing at high electricity
prices. Meanwhile, recession is forcing the industry to pare back its
projections of future demand: in western Europe, annual growth over the next
few years is unlikely to reach the 3.2 per cent recorded in the second half
of the 1980s, let alone the 7.2 per cent of the golden years in the 1960s.
The European Commission is casting an increasingly jaundiced eye over the
gamut of arrangements which hinder free trade in electricity within the EC.
Last month, the Commission gave Britain, Belgium, Denmark, France, Greece,
Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain two months to show that
they were not impeding the free flow of electricity across their national
boundaries. Failure to do so could result in legal action by Brussels.
'Competition and the freedom to import and export are essential components
of the policies needed to create an internal energy market,' argued Sir Leon
Brittan, European commissioner for competition. The moves are widely seen as
an opening shot in what is likely to prove a long battle with the utilities
to create 'open access' in electricity supply, thereby allowing large
business customers to shop around for cheaper power.
The UK industry has seen the greatest changes over the past year, as the
government's privatisation programme has come to fruition. The flotation of
the 12 regional electricity companies, together with National Power and
PowerGen, the conventional generators, completed the process in England and
Wales. They will shortly be joined in the private sector by Scottish Power
and Scottish Hydro-Electric, the two Scottish companies due to make their
stock market debut in June. That will leave only the industry in Northern
Ireland, which is scheduled for sale next year.
Radical though these privatisations are, perhaps even more innovative has
been the UK's attempt to create a new trading market in electricity known as
the pool. It is still too early to judge the success of this new market, the
heart of the government's attempt to inject competition into the industry.
Pessimists fear that the electricity regulator will find the new structure
inadequate for fostering full competition in the industry, just as his
counterparts in gas and telecommunications have found in their domains. Yet
the electricity companies have already begun to forge new strategies to meet
the demands of the private sector, notably by switching their power plant
ordering programme away from large coal stations towards gas.
The switch towards gas-fired generation has become a notable trend
throughout the industrialised world. Gas stations are quicker to build and
cheaper to operate than large coal or nuclear plants. Crucially, they also
have environmental benefits, emitting less sulphur dioxide (which causes
acid rain) and carbon dioxide (which causes global warming) for an
equivalent amount of energy as coal stations.
Indeed, green pressures are now the number one concern of many utilities, as
public awareness of the environment, the flow of eco-regulations and the
cost of cleaning up plant mount in almost equal measures. Nowhere is this
more true than in eastern Europe, where the newly democratic countries face
the twin task of reducing their dependence on inefficient coal-fired
stations and dealing with the aftermath of inadequate safety standards in
Soviet-designed nuclear plant.
Collaboration between the two formerly divided halves of Europe is likely to
mount. Czechoslovakia has already signed a technical accord with France,
whereby Europe's premier nuclear nation will help the Czechs to upgrade
their eight Soviet-designed reactors to EC standards. Germany has been
putting together a powerful consortium of west German utilities, leavened by
some non-German firms led by Electricite de France, to modernise east
Germany's industry. One estimate suggests that investment of DM30bn-DM50bn
(Pounds 10bn-Pounds 16.6bn) will be needed in east Germany's industry over
the next six years.
While prospects are good for gas-fired and combined heat and power plants,
the nuclear industry worldwide remains in the doldrums. Having braced itself
for a burst of bad publicity to coincide with the fifth anniversary of the
Chernobyl nuclear disaster, the industry has to cope with an even more
intractable problem: a continuing dearth of orders over the next decade.
Those countries, such as France where public acceptance of nuclear power
remains high, tend to have a surplus of capacity; whereas in others, notably
the US, there is no sign of the public distrust of the nuclear option
waning.

</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE DRIVE in the US Congress to reduce taxes for the US old-age insurance
system yesterday suffered a jolting setback on a 60-38 vote in the Senate to
shelve the proposal.
Senator Daniel Moynihan, the New York Democrat who is the leading proponent
of the Social Security tax reduction, said the movement for lower social
security taxes had gained ground because the other side had admitted that
the tax funds were being used inappropriately.
However, support for the measure has apparently diminished since last year,
when 54 senators voted in its favour. Senator Moynihan will try again later
in the session but he will have to get the votes of 60 senators instead of a
simple majority.
The vote was a victory for President George Bush, who along with Republican
and most Democratic leaders, contended that a reduction in social security
taxes would jeopardise the entire system.
A majority of the Democrats supported Senator Moynihan, agreeing with his
contention that regressive social security tax is being used to mask the
size of the federal budget deficit.
They propose to make the system more progressive by increasing total
payments by wealthier citizens.

   NICOSIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOUR Israelis, two men and two women, arrested on suspicion of tampering
with a telephone junction box serving the Iranian embassy were remanded in
custody for eight days by a Nicosia court yesterday.
There were no formal charges but a police officer told the court they were
investigating conspiracy to commit a felony, possession of burglary tools by
night, fraudulent appropriation of power (meaning the electric current in a
telephone) and violation of a prohibitive order.
The two men, Debi Dave, 40 and Faf Souf 33, and the two women, Anna Dolgin
and Amit Litvin, both 28, looked quite relaxed as they were brought to court
in handcuffs.
Police said the four had arrived in Cyprus on Sunday and were due to leave
tomorrow, Friday. The two couples were staying in two luxury hotels in the
coastal town of Limassol.
The four Israelis were apprehended late on Tuesday night when police making
a routine security check on the building housing the Iranian Embassy (which
adjoins a central Nicosia police station) found them 'interfering' with the
telephone junction at the entrance to the building.
They allegedly had with them burglary tools that included a pair of pliers,
a tiny torch, a screwdriver, a battery-operated welding tool used for fixing
cables and several cables with connectors. They told police they were
'looking for a toilet'.
The four suspects appeared in court without a lawyer and one of them, Dave,
said they did not accept the facts presented by the police.
Legal sources say there is no specific law in Cyprus against telephone
tapping.
An Israeli embassy official met the four suspects before yesterday's
hearing.
The Iranian embassy in Nicosia, set up two years ago, is headed by a charge
d'affaires and has about 10 staff.
Iranian diplomats have said they plan to expand. But, unlike some foreign
missions on Cyrpus, the embassy is not a major Middle East listening post.
It occupies the top three floors of a five-storey office building next to a
police station on Santa Rosa Street.

FT  25 APR 91 / World Trade News: South Korean trade plans fail to impress
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH KOREA met a frosty reception from its fellow-Gatt members yesterday
when it launched a programme to liberalise trade in a further 133 products,
mostly agricultural, as part of a phased move to unwind curbs allowed to
developing countries with balance-of-payments problems.
Mr Lee Bong-suh, minister for agriculture, said that South Korea would give
more priority to expanding world commerce than to protecting its farmers in
revived global trade talks.
South Korea was blamed as one of the culprits when the multilateral Gatt
talks collapsed on the question of farm subsidies last December, but in
renewed talks 'you will notice that Korea's position . . . even in the
agriculture sector will have changed considerably,' Mr Lee said.
Mr Young Woo Park, Seoul's deputy ambassador to Gatt, said his government
faced opposition from farmers to the liberalisation.
The US joined other countries including Canada, the EC and New Zealand in
calling the offer disappointing.
Mr Lee said he intended to pledge cooperation toward a successful conclusion
of the Uruguay Round, in meetings with Ambassador Carla Hills, the US trade
representative.
Besides the Uruguay Round, they also discussed trade issues involving the
sale of US cigarettes, current negotiations involving South Korean
shipbuilding, and South Korea's recent austerity campaign, which has drawn
US accusations of import exclusion.
South Korea, which returned to current-account deficit last year for the
first time since the mid-1980s, has resisted attempts to open its farm
imports in the Round.

FT  25 APR 91 / Sinclair Research: Correction
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN TUESDAY'S computer industry survey, we suggested incorrectly that
Sinclair Research was part of the Amstrad organisation. In 1986, Amstrad
purchased the right to use the Sinclair trade name together with Sinclair's
intellectual property rights, patents and stocks of home computers. Sir
Clive Sinclair, however, retained ownership of Sinclair Research.

FT  24 APR 91 / Survey of China (17): Peking distrust of UK may hit Hong
Kong's prosperity - Political sniping accompanies countdown to 1997 handover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ELLIOTT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA has turned the tables on Hong Kong since the Tiananmen Square crisis
in June 1989 when tens of thousands of local ethnic Chinese marched through
the streets in support of the Peking students' demands for democracy on the
mainland.
That support made China fear that the colony would develop into a centre for
subversion before the UK handed over sovereignty in 1997. Consequently,
Peking has become much more sensitive about developments in the colony and
about plans and policies drawn up by the British and Hong Kong governments,
which it distrusts.
It has launched outspoken and threatening criticisms of Hong Kong's
pro-democracy movement and it has also attacked three measures announced
late in 1989 to boost Hong Kong's confidence in the wake of the crushing of
the Tiananmen Square student movement - a Bill of Rights, the provision of
British passports for up to 225,000 people, and a massive HKDollars 127bn
(at 1988 prices) port and airport development scheme.
During the past 16 months, this approach has escalated into a crisis over
plans for the airport which is now costed at HKDollars 100bn in 1990 prices,
excluding port developments included in the original 1989 plans. In
particular, China has criticised the size and cost of the project and its
impact on Hong Kong's post-1997 financial reserves and debt.
But behind the detailed airport arguments, China has been establishing a
precedent to exert increasing influence over Hong Kong government decisions
in the run-up to 1997. It has won a say over the use of the government's
HKDollars 73bn financial reserves for funding the airport, and it has
demanded consultations leading to consensus on a wide range of other issues
connected with the project, which it would want to scrutinise.
This is causing considerable concern in Hong Kong because it has
demonstrated how easy it is for China to interfere in the colony's affairs
and slow down free-market developments before and after 1997. After initial
resistance, Hong Kong has accepted the need for consultation on issues such
as the airport which straddle 1997, but it has been reluctant to concede
demands for anything approaching consensus which could give Peking an
effective veto.
China and Britain agreed in 1984 that Hong Kong would enjoy a 'high degree
of autonomy' as a Special Administrative Region for 50 years after 1997
under a formula called 'one country two systems'. This was intended to leave
economic and political traditions intact.
There has always been concern that China would try to fudge this agreement
and interfere for a mixture of political and bureaucratic reasons after
(1997, and that this would probably slow down the growth and effectiveness
of Hong Kong's economy. But few people expected China to show its hand so
early.
China claims it has a right to a say because the 1984 Sino-British agreement
requires increased consultation in the second half of the 1984-97 transition
period, which is just beginning. It also says that it has a duty to the 6m
population to ensure that Britain leaves the colony and its economy in good
order.
Basically, China does not trust Britain, and senior officials suspect that
the UK will behave like other departing colonial powers and cream off the
riches before it goes. Similar suspicions are attached to the nearby
Portuguese enclave of Macao, which goes back to China in 1999, and which is
also running into problems with an airport project.
In the Hong Kong scenario, the UK is suspected of organising the airport so
that the colony's financial reserves could be drained to pay British
companies' for money-spinning construction contracts.
There is also a lack of understanding in China about capitalism and
wheeler-dealing traditions. Peking officials are concerned that Hong Kong
and Macao might be behaving like other Chinese provinces which launch
over-ambitious projects that cannot be completed prof itably and could then
land Peking with the debt.
Peking is widely acknowledged to be justified in its demands for
consultation and increasing involvement in Hong Kong's affairs as 1997
approaches. But the way it has pursued this target since the Tiananmen
Square crisis has seriously knocked confidence in Hong Kong's chances of
survival as a thriving international entrepot and financial centre after the
sovereignty handover.

FT  24 APR 91 / Survey of China (18): Things to do and avoid - Trading in
China is not for the light-hearted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNNE CURRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA is a difficult place to do business. It has a lot of idiosyncrasies
and doing business here takes a lot of time and effort. That is why to deal
in it successfully, it is often not a place for a small company.
However, to ignore China can be a serious mistake. For experienced business
people there is money to be made here.
What follows are some guidelines from veteran China traders and from
Peking-based diplomats about how to do business in this complex market.
Trips should be well planned. Visas are necessary. Business visas can be
obtained from any Chinese embassy, but travellers need a letter of
invitation from a Chinese host organisation. For those lacking a Chinese
sponsor, some embassies will help their nationals obtain one. Most, however,
will not get involved.
Yet a business visa is not always necessary. For those who are coming to
China for their first or second time, a tourist visa will suffice and is
readily obtainable in Hong Kong.
Travelling around the country used to be a nightmare for anyone with a fixed
schedule.
That has begun to change as the Civil Aviation Administration of China
(CAAC), China's national airline, has gradually computerised its operations.
It is now possible to buy round trip tickets to a handful of major cities in
China.
Interpreters are vital for those who cannot speak Chinese. The Chinese host
will always supply an interpreter, but it is better to bring their own to
any business meeting.
One way to find an interpreter is for the business traveller to ask at his
or her country's business trade council in Peking. For British citizens, the
China Britain Trade Group in Peking and Shanghai will help at minimal cost.
Newcomers to China should be aware of significant cultural differences in
the Chinese and Western ways of doing business. Patience, determination and
strong financial backing are essential, but equally important is recognition
of the fact that the Chinese concept of time differs dramatically from that
of the west.
Negotiations with the Chinese take time and time is only occasionally
important to the Chinese, a western diplomat says. First or even second time
business people should not expect to conclude a deal.
During the first visit, the businessman needs to obtain from the relevant
commercial sections of embassies or from the Ministry of Foreign Economic
Relations and Trade (MOFERT) some idea of the official policy towards his
product.
If the products are in a priority sector that is part of the government's
eighth Five-Year Plan, significant opportunities may be developed. However,
some products fall in a grey area or are actively discouraged by the
government and banned from being imported.
There are many ways of blocking imports. China has a complex system of
tariff and non-tariff controls to restrict foreign companies' access to its
domestic market.
Some of the barriers include:
import bans;
import licenses (which can be denied if domestic alternatives are available,
or if the goods are considered incompatible with China's goals);
a strict import substitution policy that restricts competition;
foreign exchange allocation;
testing and certification of foreign products to specifications not applied
to domestically-produced goods.
Once a businessman has decided to be in the China market, he should remember
a few basic rules:
never sign a loss leader. The Chinese are tough, organised negotiators who
know the real value of any product.
don't begin the first sale on the basis of losing money in order to gain
access.
know your end user's needs well. Rely on multiple channels for information
and never use only one source.
build a coalition of relationships with people involved in making the
decision.
For those serious about being in the China market, but who cannot afford to
staff it with their own representative, there are various alternatives.
China's telecommunication links with the rest of the world have improved
dramatically in the last decade, and calling or sending a fax is now simple.
But there is no substitute for a good agent in a country where personal
relationships are extremely important.
Agents provide contacts. Just as selecting an agent is important for those
exporting to China, choosing a partner in a joint venture operation is
perhaps the single most important decision a foreign company will make.
Finding a suitable partner takes time and knowing where to start can be a
daunting process, but much depends on the foreigner's line of business and
whether the goal is to export or manufacture.
Generally, big cities, the coastal provinces, and the south are favourite
areas of business for foreign trade.
'Anywhere but Peking, and the farther south you go the better,' a western
businessman says.
Other points to consider in selecting a partner include the organisation's
proximity to raw materials, electrical supply and shipping facilities.
Finally, don't let the system wear down your mental and professional
faculties, as happened to a French businessman who had been negotiating with
the Chinese over a problem for a year and a half.
When he believed he had finally resolved the matter and was preparing to
board his aircraft for home,the Chinese came to him at the airport, saying
another organisation had not agreed to the terms and problems remained.
This was too much. The Frenchman was subsequently found running naked around
Tiananmen square and was taken out of China in a straitjacket.

FT  24 APR 91 / Survey of China (14): Where the papers come three days late
 -Wuhan is China's natural crossroads, but is cut off by poor communications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF WUHAN, the capital of Hubei province, is set to become one of China's
main communications hubs - as local officials claim, and a glimpse at any
map would endorse - how is it that Peking newspapers take three or four days
to arrive?
'We are the Chicago of the Orient,' Zhao Baojiang, the mayor of Wuhan,
claims in a grand hyperbolic sweep.
Wuhan is also at a critical midpoint on the Yangtze river, and sits abreast
China's main north-south railway, linking Hong Kong and Guangdong in the
south with Peking and the land-bridge to Europe in the north.
In a country with normal communications, Wuhan's pivotal location would
project it to the commercial and industrial centre-stage. Peking papers
would be available on the day of publication. But in China, it stands as a
monument to the awful impoverishment of the nation's communications.
The city's time may indeed come. But it will take considerable improvements
in the national transport infrastructure to transform its prospects. It will
also require the creation in China of a true national market. At present, a
labyrinth of bureaucratic obstacles to trade across provincial boundaries -
which amount to nothing less than provincial protectionism - make Wuhan's
central location in China a commercial irrelevance.
This perhaps explains why Hubei province has slipped in the past five years
from China's ninth most important exporter to its 13th.
It also explains why a province that is among the best endowed in China in
terms of agricultural and mineral resources, and in terms of industrial and
commercial capacity, has failed to make a more powerful mark among the
country's magnets for foreign investment.
Hubei's endowments are prolific: the Jianghan plain which straddles the
Yangtze in the heart of the province is among the most fertile in China. Its
red alluvial soils grow about one fifth of the country's cotton and makes
Hubei China's fifth largest grain producer.
Lakes spread across the south of the province - some of them more like
inland seas - provide a living for almost a quarter of a million fish
farmers, and underpin an industry in aquatic products that ranks third in
China.
These together make Hubei one of China's leading textile manufacturers and a
leader in food processing.
Rich supplies of iron, copper and an array of rarer minerals mainly in the
east of the province around Huangshi supply one of China's largest steel
complexes and a leading special steels manufacturer. These in turn underpin
the country's second largest automotive manufacturer, in Shiyan in Hubei's
north-west.
A combination of these resource-riches, and Hubei's pivotal location at the
heart of China, make it clear that few provinces would stand to gain so much
from the dismantling of centralised controls over China's economy, and the
loosening of the domestic market.
Local officials may not yet be fully aware of the riches liberalisation can
bring but in the meanwhile are committed to infrastructural improvements
over the decade ahead that will be of significant help when the virtues of
Hubei's prime location at the heart of China's market are allowed to come
into play.
A new RMB Yuan 600m international airport will be opening in 1993. A second
Yangtze road bridge joining Hankou and Wuchang will enhance north-south
communications in the province and ease traffic congestion in Wuhan itself.
Railway electrification is planned. A new 50,000-line telephone exchange is
being installed. Massive investment in both thermal and hydro power stations
is being made.
Economic zones are being established in Wuhan and in Yichang and Huangshi
along the banks of the Yangtze. They are intended to capitalise on the
creation of Shanghai's Pudong special economic zone over the coming decade.
This development underlies one of the most exciting changes now underway:
the re-establishment of the Yangtze, after half a century of neglect, as a
critically important commercial artery in central China.
A new foreign trade port is under construction, a companion to Baihushan
completed just east of Wuhan six years ago. New local shippers like Datong
and Qingchuan are vying with former state monopolies and the fast-growing
private shipper, Minsheng, to provide competitive services along the length
of the Yangtze for the first time since 1949.
While Hubei has until recently had only modest success in attracting foreign
investment, lagging in particular behind coastal provinces, recent deals
provide encouraging signs. A joint venture with Citroen, agreed last year,
will lead to the production of 300,000 cars a year in Wuhan and Shiyan,
further enhancing the province's importance as a supplier to the national
automobile market.
An optical fibre plant, to be built with help from Philips, will also be
important in enhancing China's domestic telecommunications capacity.
Foreign capital used for new equipment at the Wuhan Iron and Steel works is
intended to boost annual output from 5m tonnes of rolled steel to 7m tonnes
by the year 2000, boosting the company's role as one of China's four main
suppliers of high-quality steel.
If approval is given to the environmentally controversial Sanxia
hydroelectric project, which would be built across the Yangtze in the Three
Gorges on Hubei's western border with Sichuan, Hubei would become a critical
supplier of power to all of central China. The 13,000MW generated by Sanxia
would dwarf the recently-completed Gezhouba dam in Yichang, which generates
2,700MW and is already a critically important supplier to the Yangtze
region.
All these developments point to Wuhan's preparedness for the larger role
which would result from the creation of a nationwide market economy.
Local leaders pay lip service to the need for less central control of the
economy and more market freedoms.
But behind the brave rhetoric, the provincial authorities are not yet
willing to end subsidies to bankrupt factories.
In Wuhan, the leadership appears to have taken the first significant steps
towards unleashing market forces, and lifting the burden of company
subsidies from the shoulders of the government. Mayor Zhao Baojiang, who
estimates that one in 10 Wuhan workers is employed in a loss-making factory,
says: 'We are asking workers to move into the individual enterprise sector
if their factory is a 'losing money factory'.'
Chinese historians say that Wuhan has often been fortunate - but only in
unfortunate times.
With the ground now being well laid, a significant opening up of China's
economy to market forces could bring fortune in fortunate times. Yet Wuhan
would still have a long haul to become Mayor Zhao's 'Chicago of the Orient'.

FT  24 APR 91 / Survey of China (15): Natural magnet for Taiwan - John
Elliott visits Xiamen, a buoyant city with its face to the sea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ELLIOTT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE old foreign trade and fishing port of Amoy in the south eastern province
of Fujian could develop during the next decade into one of China's most
important coastal industrial cities. Now called Xiamen, it is a special
economic zone and has become a focal point for investment from Taiwan, 156
nautical miles away across the South China Sea.
More than 400 Taiwanese companies have received approval during the past
three years to set up light industrial labour intensive factories involving
investment of more than Dollars 1bn. Goods ranging from Prince and Slazenger
tennis racquets and Phillips coffee pots to folding umbrellas, electronic
gadgets and textiles are being turned out in about 100 factories which have
started production.
Fujian and Taiwan have had close links for centuries. More than 70 per cent
of Taiwan's total 20m population originate from southern Fujian and the
dialects are similar. So the area is a natural choice for Taiwan's
businessmen who want to tap China's cheap labour and land, thus escaping
from Taiwan's escalating costs and restrictive environmental controls.
But the investment take-up has been slow, partly because Taiwan only allows
its businessmen to deal indirectly with China. This adds to costs because it
involves transporting goods through Hong Kong and channelling money through
New York and other financial centres.
The local economic growth rate has been between 16 and 17 per cent annually
for the past two years, according to officials, with industry growing by 20
per cent - despite China's economic and political problems. Targets for the
next five years have been set at the same levels.
This reflects the sudden entry of the Taiwanese, but the breakthrough that
Xiamen is waiting for is an investment decision from Taiwan on a Dollars 7bn
petrochemical plant which would dramatically change the city's fortunes. It
would provide a primary industrial base and would make Taiwanese involvement
take off with extensive down-stream industries.
The decision rests with the Taiwan government and with the industrialist
involved, Mr Wang Yung-ching, head of Formosa Plastics which is one of
Taiwan's largest companies. Mr Wang, whose family comes from the area, is in
negotiations with Peking and Taipei and has also talked about developing
ventures in banking, shipping and transport.
Taiwan, which regards itself as the rightful government of all China, is
softening its policies but seems unlikely to permit full and direct
investment, transport and communications for a year or so. It wants to use
Mr Wang's and other possible investments as a lever to persuade China to
provide some sort of overall investment protection agreement and to reduce
problems of bureaucratic corruption and scarcity of raw materials.
Meanwhile, Mr Wang is in negotiations on the extent and ownership of the
petrochemical plant, and Xiamen's government has started preparatory ground
works on the site, financed according to some reports by Mr Wang.
The centre of Xiamen, which consists of a series of islands adjacent to the
mainland with a population of 1.12m, was made a special economic zone in
1980. But it failed to develop significantly until Taiwan started to allow
the indirect industrial investment in 1987-88.
According to local government figures, a total of 980 projects, initially
mostly from Hong Kong and Macao, have been approved since 1980 for projects
costing Dollars 2.92bn. They include Dollars 2.12bn foreign investment, and
Taiwan accounts for 410 projects worth Dollars 1.07bn.
But only Dollars 500m foreign investment has actually gone ahead and this
includes Dollars 200m on a single project - a Taiwanese chemical fibre
plant.
An unusually high proportion of the projects are wholly foreign owned - 309
out of the 410 - indicating that the Taiwanese want to control the
businesses and do not want to delay investments while joint ventures are
negotiated. Most of the production is for export, supplementing the factory
owners' operations in Taiwan which often continue producing high-quality
ranges.
Factory managers say that labour costs are 75 to 90 per cent lower than in
Taiwan but that there is only an overall production cost saving of around 10
per cent after transport, lower levels of productivity, and other problems
are taken into account.
Keen Find Sporting Goods, for example, employs 400 people to turn out 2,000
tennis racquets a day using frames imported from Taiwan via Hong Kong -
international trade rules ban the import of the raw material into China.
Mr Golden Ehang, th general manager, says wages are 12 per cent of Taiwan's,
but he makes only 8 per cent on overall costs. 'I have come here only
because the costings will improve when Taiwan's rules are eased - it's not
worth it otherwise.'
One of Xiamen's strengths is that there are 350,000 overseas Chinese for
whom the city is an ancestral home. They include members of such famous
families as Mr Lee Quan Yew of Singapore and Mrs Cory Acquino of the
Philippines.
It has ambitions as a tourist destination, primarily based on the
attractions of a small island adjacent to the city centre called Gulang yu
which is full of colonial villas built for foreign consulates and companies
100 years ago.
To help attract investment, urgently needed infrastructure projects are now
being planned. They include a Yuan 1.5bn 600 megawatt power station which is
to be partly funded by Hong Kong Macao International Investment, a
part-China owned Hong Kong company.
Other projects include: a Yuan 340m water supply plant, supported with loans
from Japan that will cover 35 per cent of the cost; a Yuan 350m harbour
development financed domestically; a Yuan 320m airport extension which is
now seeking fresh finance after losing loans of at least Yuan 100m from
Kuwait; and a Yuan 350m telecommunications expansion which has yet to be
financed.
The real breakthrough, however, will only come when, eventually, Taiwan
permits direct investment, air flights and other links with China.
In the meantime, Taiwan adopts a confrontational diplomatic offensive
against China.
The real breakthrough will come only when Taiwan permits direct investment,
flights and other links

FT  24 APR 91 / Survey of China (16): Revival of a 70 year-old dream - Plan
to dam the mighty Yangtse stirs environmental fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLINA MACDOUGALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of the most beautiful and romantic stretches of water in the world is
the Yangtse river where it flows through three massive gorges below
Chongqing, in the south-west province of Sichuan.
The misty cliffs which overhang it have figured in many a famous Chinese
painting and the trees and wild life up the side valleys are increasingly
precious in a country near-devastated by industrial pollution.
The Yangtse, or Changjiang, as the Chinese call it, is the third longest
river in the world with a mean annual runoff of 9.8bn cubic metres. Flooding
is a perennial threat to the tens of millions who live downstream, and in a
country short of energy its waters are keenly viewed as a source of
hydropower.
In 1923, Sun Yat Sen, China's first president, proposed a huge dam across
the lowest gorge to control the floods. Since then the project has been
endlessly debated and researched by politicians, engineers and
hydro-electric specialists. The scheme surfaced again last year, though
subject to further approval by the rubber-stamp National People's Congress.
Now Han Hongshu, vice-governor of Hubei province, speaks as if work is about
to begin. Hubei has already done well out of the Gezhouba dam at Yichang,
downstream of the gorges, which created new jobs and now provides power. In
Sichuan, they are not so sure: 'Of course the central government must
decide, but we here think it would be better to spend the money on dams and
hydropower projects upstream on the Yangtse tributaries", says Ma Lin, the
Vice-governor.
Advocates of the dam point to the reduction in flood risks, the 18bn units
of electricity a year that the scheme would generate and the improved
navigability of the river, enabling ocean-going ships to reach Chongqing.
The Ministry of Water Resources and Power set up a committee of 412 experts,
of whom more than 400 supported it, while a detailed Canadian feasibility
study also found in favour.
Opponents stress the enormous cost (yuan 36 bn), the number of people to be
resettled (a million or so), the risk of earthquake or (in the event of a
war) bomb damage and unpredictable environmental consequences. They also
point to illogicalities in the concept: for power generation the reservoir
upstream must be full, for flood retention empty.
In 1989, the year of the Tiananmen demonstrations, the dam became a
political issue. A group of writers led by Dai Qing, later put under house
arrest as a dissident, published a book opposing it as a 'Stalinist folly'.
They accused Li Peng, the premier, a Moscow-trained electrical engineer (and
a one-time head of the ministry in charge of hydro-power) of trying to
bolster his own prestige by linking his name with a project once favoured by
Chairman Mao.
These intellectuals are silenced now, but the questions remain. Where will
the resettled population go? ('Further up the mountains' said Ministry of
Water Resources officials). Could silting gradually fill the 500 km
reservoir behind the dam, leaving Chongqing literally high and dry?
Wouldn't it be better for Peking to spend the money on installing equipment
nationwide to save electricity rather than providing more?
One look at China shows how little care is given to the environment. The
builders of the Gezhouba dam seem not to have known of the existence of the
Yangtse sturgeon (now proudly displayed at the Yichang breeding station )
until they bumped their noses on the new barrier going upstream to spawn.
It seems unlikely enough research has been done on river and marine life,
climatic consequences, loss of land fertility or the greater scouring
effects caused by a less silt-burdened river.
While China seems unlikely on grounds of cost to build the dam in the near
future, it remains a threat as long as a totalitarian government in Peking
can in the last resort overrule opposition.

FT  24 APR 91 / Survey of China (10): Central planners who cannot let go -
State industries losses spiral out of control / David Dodwell examines the
parlous state of Chinese industry and its continuing decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA'S state industry is in a parlous condition. Everyone from premier Li
Peng, through finance minister Wang Bingqian to the State Statistical Bureau
is in agreement on this.
But the narrow gap between listing industry's failings to formulating
solutions seems to be unbreachable since the leap involves espousing market
forces and dismantling control over giant industrial machines that have for
decades been the focus of political power and patronage.
According to the State Statistical Bureau (SSB), more than one third of
China's state enterprises - which employ 50m of the country's 150m urban
workers - are making losses. Wang Bingqian, finance minister, noted in the
recent National People's Congress that the government spent the equivalent
of Dollars 11bn in 1990 subsidising state factories, with another Dollars
7.3bn spent on price subsidies for workers.
Noting that more than one third of the government's budget is now consumed
by subsidy payments, Wang admitted that enterprise losses 'have already
reached the point where the state treasury cannot sustain them.' Urgent
needs to improve housing, medical care and the country's rudimentary welfare
system - not to mention modernising industry - are being preempted by the
political imperative of keeping state factories on life support machines.
While the gross value of industrial output (GVIO) rose 7.6 per cent in 1990,
the impetus for growth came from light industry (+9.1 per cent), private
industry (+21.6 per cent) and joint ventures (+56 per cent). State industry
lifted output by 2.9 per cent, according to the SSB.
Even these figures mislead, since much of the rise in output was fuelled in
the middle of 1990 by a bank lending spree that was intended to lift output
to the level that would allow the central government to argue that state
plan targets for the five year plan ending last December had been met. Much
of this additional output went straight on to stockpiles - which increased
by RMB 30bn in 1990, according to the SSB.
While state enterprise losses doubled from 1989 to RMB 28bn, profits fell 58
per cent, and government tax receipts from state industry fell 18.5 per cent
between 1989 and 1990 to RMB 127bn, the SSB said. Over the five year period
from 1985-1990 the economic return on every RMB 100 of working capital fell
from RMB 23.8 to RMB 16.8, while profits fell from an average of 11.8 per
cent to 6.3 per cent.
The present leadership talks of the need for reform, but appears unable to
accept the loss of central control that would follow. Leaders are also
traumatised by a fear that the upheavals inevitably associated with
root-and-branch reform would foment political rebellion.
Small steps have been taken: the price of basic inputs such as coal, steel
and electricity is being raised closer to real market prices. A rudimentary
and confused tax system has begun to give companies more independence to
invest profits as they think best. A free market in most goods is beginning
to grow up as companies are allowed to sell for themselves goods produced
above plan commitments.
Collective and private enterprises have also come to play a bigger part in
the economy, particularly in the coastal provinces and southern China,
reducing the political clout of state enterprises, as well as their dominant
impact on the national economy. However, there is cold comfort in this
growth, since many of these collective enterprises have little intrinsic
economic value, thriving mainly because of the monstrous inefficiency of the
state industrial machine.
The World Bank, in a recent analysis of China's economy*, praises the
government's success in progressively increasing production of industrial
raw materials such as oil, coal and steel, but then argues that none of this
massive investment in raising output would have been needed if industry used
these materials more efficiently.
It points to 'high energy and steel dependency' that is a result of being
sheltered from external competition, being technologically backward, using
obsolete capacity, and achieving very low productivof factories producing
one-thirtieth of the output possible using more efficient technologies.
Staff at Wuhan Iron &amp; Steel, one of the country's leading high-quality steel
makers, endorse this view. They say only 25 per cent of China's 66m
tonnes-per-year steel output is usable in modern industry.
'Heavy industry absorbs far too much capital,' the World Bank says: 'It
provides below average returns, and its appetite for energy is one of the
root causes of chronic shortages.
'By targetting machinery and metal industries for promotion, China will
starve more deserving sectors of capital, perpetuate an artificial shortage
of investment funds in a situation of resource availability few countries
can rival, and limit its growth potential.
'The quantum of investment alone is not enough.'
Rather than spend more on power generation, the government should spend on
replacing old and power hungry machinery, the Bank says: rather than pay
subsidies for factories to produce for stockpiles, government should spend
on redeploying workers in new and more efficient factories.
Enterprise reform is at the heart of this debate. For western economists,
this means plant closures on a significant scale, and willingness to allow
market forces to sort the survivors. Peking's central planners have
preferred to investigate 'enterprise groups', where profitable companies
absorb chronic loss-makers with the aim of turning them round.
For example, Shanghai Vacuum, the largest of the seven companies publicly
quoted on the infant Shanghai stock exchange, was forced by the municipality
to take on 2,400 workers from failed local enterprises in 1989. This added
RMB 7m to its annual payroll, and did nothing for profits.
Yanzheng Industrial, a smaller quoted stock on the Shanghai exchange, had
just 100 staff until the local Jing An district government forced it to
assume responsibility for 100 workers from a failed factory nearby. Because
there is no work for these people, they have to stay at home on full pay at
Yanzheng's expense. A further 200 retired workers from the failed factory
were put on Yanzheng's pension scheme.
Chinese companies complain this practice is like 'whipping the fast ox'.
In place of practical proposals aimed at resolving the crisis at the heart
of China's industry, leaders in Peking have invoked the slogan of 'Quality,
Variety and Efficiency' in 1991. The slogan's principal virtue is that it
inflicts no damage on the icon of Marxist central planning. The longer
leaders indulge in slogans rather than face head-on the problems of China's
industry, the more painful the solutions are likely to be.

FT  24 APR 91 / Survey of China (11): Old tune is heard again - Stock
market's quiet return in an old hotel ballroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ELLIOTT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHANGHAI'S old and distinguished Astor Hotel, located at the end of the
riverside Bund which housed the city's former financial centre, has a new
lease of life, writes John Elliott.
With a nice touch of irony which officials insist is accidental, half of its
premises (now renamed the Pujiang Hotel) have been converted to house
Shanghai's fledgling stock exchange which was formally opened with much
fanfare last December.
A grand and renovated wood-panelled entrance hall leads to the old Astor
ballroom where the tunes of foxtrots and waltzes have been replaced by the
silence of numbers flickering on a large prices screen and about 25 or so
computer terminals, surrounded by red-jacketed jobbers.
Poorly dressed men and women queue on the pavement outside to place their
savings, while others less well off peer uncertainly through the front door
at this rather unlikely re-emergence of capitalism in Communist China.
But this does not mark an imminent conversion of China's centrally planned
and provincially controlled economy into a share-owning society  - and it
may well be years before one can safely forecast whether this very cautious
and hesitant experiment will have any significant impact on the country's
economy.
In a small way, however, it is a significant development - along with a more
unruly stock market in the southern special economic zone of Shenzhen,
adjacent to Hong Kong, and a nation-wide treasury bond trading system,
called Securities Automated Quotations System (STAQ) which was launched in
Peking last December, linking six cities and 18 licensed trading
corporations. Guangzhou, capital of the southern province of Guangdong, is
also considering a stock exchange.
The significance is that there are sufficient economic reformers in Peking
and elsewhere to push the experiments through, despite the ideological
opposition of officials who fear both the economic and social implications,
and despite the country's political uncertainty which deters bureaucratic
initiative.
The central government wants to try to ease its acute cash shortage by
encouraging secondary markets for about yuan 114bn bonds already in
circulation, and by tapping an estimated total of yuan 700bn-1,000bn
personal savings.
In Shanghai, there were extra reasons last December for formalising local
bond and share trading which had been taking place since the mid-1980s
across banking counters and on kerb-sides in seven or eight company stocks
and 25 bonds issued by the government, financial institutions and companies.
Peking wants to recreate Shanghai as China's financial capital and it also
wants to attract funds for an ambitious Dollars 10bn industrial and
commercial development planned in an area of Shanghai called Pudong.
'The securities market is a long term aim to develop a financial market
which will help to finance Pudong and will introduce market mechanisms into
resource allocation and company management,' says Mr He Gaosheng, director
of the Office of Shanghai Economic System Reform.
'But public ownership will remain the mainstay, and the share system will
not become very important - it is only on trial at present and that will
last for perhaps five or ten years or more.'
At least some claim of the quoted companies say they have new managerial
freedom, even though the government is still effectively in control.
'We have more autonomy in our management and less direct intervention by the
government so we make quicker decisions on investment and other issues,'
says Mr Liang Zhengsheng, vice general manager of Shanghai Vacuum Electron
Device, an amalgamation of six factories producing television tubes and
other electrical goods which in 1987 became the first government-owned
enterprise to have shareholders.
Shanghai's Developments were held up by China's economic rectification
policy of the past two years, but the potential has been demonstrated since
December.
Trading, which is dominated by the bond market, has rocketed from an average
of yuan 6m a day in December to yuan 42m a day last month. Mr Wei Wenyuan,
general manager of the exchange, forecasts that it could reach yuan 6bn this
year, up from yuan 2.4bn last year and yuan 800m in 1989. An estimated 1m
people out of Shanghai's 13m population are believed to have participated in
securities transactions.
Institutions such as insurance companies, labour unions and workers
retirement funds are estimated to account for about 40 per cent of the
trading, and the rest is by individuals.
There are various forecasts about how fast the market will grow. The bond
business might double in a year or so but the speed of the introduction of
new companies is less clear.
Plans are being drawn up - but could take some time to come into force  - to
allow foreign investors to buy a special designation of B shares in certain
companies and at least one foreign joint venture has applied to be quoted.
In Shenzhen, where trading began in 1987, transactions last year totalled
yuan 1.77bn, mainly in equities. There are only five listed companies and
there was such rampant speculation last year, much on a kerb-side black
market and involving local officials, that government restrictions were
imposed and formal approval for the opening of a new stock exchange
headquarters and trading floor was delayed.
Such problems underline why there is deep suspicion and concern about
allowing any rapid expansion.

FT  24 APR 91 / Survey of China (12): Determined to go its own way - Colina
MacDougall takes the pulse of Sichuan province
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLINA MACDOUGALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'SICHUAN is the poorest province in China', says bouncy and fast-talking Ma
Lin, the vice-governor in charge of the economy. 'We're worse off even than
Tibet - our yearly per capita income is only yuan 104. Tibet gets yuan 1bn a
year in aid from Peking, and we're given nothing, although our population of
minorities is twice that of Tibet's'
His solution is more reform. Sichuan was famous as the launching pad for the
successful rural reforms of the late 1970s, under its then leader, the
now-disgraced former party boss, Zhao Ziyang. Vice-governor Ma, who hails
from one of China's richest east-coast provinces, Jiangsu, wants a greater
'opening to the outside world' - more foreign trade and investment.
Exports are already doing well. Mainly agriculture-based, they rose from
around Dollars 300m in 1985 to Dollars 1.1bn in 1990.
Foreign investment has made a start, despite Sichuan's inadequate rail links
and limited use of its main east-west artery, the Yangtse.
The provincial government still has the wrong idea about foreign investors.
'Pepsi is eager to set up a factory in Sichuan as the population is huge and
it's the centre of south-western China', said Mr Wang Chongming,
vice-director of the province's commission of foreign economic relations and
trade.
'We've offered them a package - if they want to come, they must renovate a
steel plant and build us a TV tower with a revolving restaurant'. Conditions
like these seem unlikely to tempt westerners. Most of Sichaun's existing
joint ventures are with Hong Kong companies who can usually make a
profitable deal. A dozen or so apiece are with the US and Taiwan, and a
handful with Japan. On the agenda for the future is a zinc plant, currently
under discussion with Australia's BHP.
Despite the poverty, emphasised by vice-governor Ma, to the casual foreign
eye Sichuan seems prosperous. Markets in Chengdu, the provincial capital,
are overflowing with food, flowers, pet song-birds, fluffy jumpers and
hi-fis. Guanghan county, 35 kms away and the site of a new reform
experiment, is bursting with smart-looking busy shoppers.
On the other hand, Chongqing (wartime capital of Chiang Kaishek and now, at
a population of 14m, China's largest city) and the neighbouring towns along
the Yangtse are dilapidated and filthy. Sichuan has been officially ranked
as fourth poorest province and may have slipped further.
It has serious problems such as a huge population (now 107m) and limited
arable land. Half its area is mountainous, inhabited by only 6m or 7m,
mainly ethnic non-Chinese, and the remaining 101m, 80 per cent of whom live
off the land, are crammed into the rest.
'Our farmers are getting poorer', says Ma. 'We must get on with reform.'
Commented one westerner with business connections in Chengdu, 'Sichuan is
determined to go its own way, though unlike Guangdong (where powerful
Governor Ye Xuanping has ignored central government directives to cut back
on reform) it hasn't openly defied Peking.'
Officials are discreet, but hint at their differences with the centre. For
instance, they were critical of the reflation applied to the economy last
year after a massive slowdown resulting from a loan freeze. 'The new credit
came too late and it didn't solve the problem', said an economist with the
provincial economic commission.
As in the rest of China, Sichuan's industry suffered in 1990. Adding to the
burden are the hundreds of old heavy industry factories moved there under
Mao Zedong's dispersal strategy of the 1960s. These are many miles from raw
materials sources and markets and lose money at the best of times.
The farming population has also been hit this year, ironically by the
excellent harvest. In 1990, Sichuan produced an all-time high of 42.5m
tonnes of grain compared with 40.8m tonnes in 1989, but in the free-market
prices fell and the state commercial departments would not buy more than
agreed quotas. This means financial loss for farmers who had already bought
diesel and fertiliser.
But this plenty has given the provincial government the opportunity to
experiment with freeing grain prices, currently subsidised at huge cost to
the central government. In Guanghan County, 35 kms from Chengdu with a
population of half a million, from April 1 this year all grain was to be
sold at market prices. This meant an end to farm quotas and ration tickets.
Guanghan's wage-earners will receive a subsidy to make this more palatable:
it means a price-rise to around 50 fen (Chinese cents), from around 13 fen
per half-kilo. Little protest is expected - in Guanghan city in mid-March
shoppers at the grain store were unconcerned.
'We'll get an idea straight away of whether it induces farmers to plant more
grain or less', said Mr Zhou Jiapei, director of Guanghan's Economic
Restructuring Office. 'Then in a few months we can see what the urban
customers think.' This experiment might then be applied in other parts of
the country.
Sichuan's reform principles are reflected in one of China's most successful
private businesses. The Minsheng Shipping Co. in Chongqing, which ran
Yangtse and mainly coastal shipping before the communist victory in 1949,
re-emerged after 1978 to resume its business. Now managed by 68-year-old Lu
Guoji, son of the founder, this family business jumped from a turnover of
Dollars 1.2m in 1985 to Dollars 40m in 1989.
The registered capital is yuan 50m, of which employees hold yuan 2m. and the
rest is in family hands. Mr Lu has put his son in charge of the Hong Kong
office and a cousin (a former researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences)
into one of his light-industrial joint ventures.
Now handling about 50 containers a month, he plans to build his own
container wharf and raise the number to 3,000 a month. HIs other businesses
are multiplying. He is making piles of money where the three other
(state-run) shipping companies in Chongqing are losing it. It is a pity
Sichuan is not free to apply Mr Lu's private enterprise principles in other
areas.

FT  24 APR 91 / Survey of China (13): Front line for reformers - Shanghai
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ELLIOTT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW and bleak 30-storey hotel extension to the old Jingjiang Hotel in
China's former commercial capital of Shanghai is said to epitomise a flashy
version of the country's four economic modernisations - it has a steel
structure, a multi-storey design, a revolving restaurant, and lifts going up
the outside of the building.
As China struggles forward with its economic reforms, Shanghai also has two
other fashionable modernisations - a proposed yuan 12bn special economic
development zone called Pudong, and a new stock exchange.
Whether any of them will succeed is open to question. The Jingjiang's
revolving restaurant, like those in many of Shanghai's half empty hotels,
has scarcely any customers and it jerks between revolving too quickly and
not moving at all. External lifts in China tend to break down. The fledgling
stock exchange has taken off in a small way since it was officially launched
last December, trading on the Chinese love of gambling, but little has
happened yet in Pudong.
Nevertheless Shanghai, with its population of more than 12m, is the place to
watch in the next few years because it has been picked out for special
treatment by Peking. The idea is to use the Pudong plan as a catalyst to
restore the city to its old position as the financial and business heart of
China, and to start a new modernisation drive inland up the Yangtse River.
This is backed both by economic reformers, who want to breathe new life into
the 1980s opening-up policies, and by older conservatives who support
Shanghai's emerging mixture of limited free enterprise in a planned economy.
It therefore provides an alternative focus to the highly prosperous
free-wheeling southern province of Guangdong, of which Peking
traditionalists disapprove - and it might in the distant future even
challenge Hong Kong.
It has been led since April 1988 by Mr Zhu Rongji, a charismatic and
strong-minded 62-year old mayor, who was promoted early this month to Peking
to be one of China's five vice premiers. He is a reformist and is expected
to continue to be involved in the development of Shanghai, especially
Pudong, but will probably be succeeded as mayor by Mr Huang Ju, a vice mayor
who has been in charge of financial policy including foreign investment.
His support in Peking is assumed to be based on firm backing from Mr Deng
Xiaoping, China's veteran leader, supported by Mr Jiang Zemin, the Communist
Party general secretary who used to be in Shanghai.
This has helped him to: shake up the bureaucracy (making marginal inroads
into entrenched inertia); begin to tackle creaking infrastructural problems
with major projects; encourage foreign loans and investment; pave the way
for six new foreign banks; improve the lot of foreign joint ventures; open
the stock exchange; and launch Pudong as a symbol of a new future.
The main reform now being finalised is for housing. The aim is to tap
private savings and create more funds for housebuilding, improve
maintenance, and encourage expansion of private housing which now accounts
for 20 per cent of the total. People renting or buying accommodation will
have to contribute to a central provident fund which they can then draw on
later, and rents are being raised.
But, despite all this, Mr Zhu has only scratched at the surface of an old
industrial city which almost defies modernisation. Economic performance is
hit by antiquated over-manned factories, and Peking drains the city of much
of its surplus funds.
While GNP grew by 3.1 per cent last year (down from 5.3 per cent in 1989),
according to government figures, the output from state sector enterprises
declined by 0.6 per cent. It was pulled down by municipally owned factories
which dropped 1.6 per cent, while those controlled and favoured by Peking
grew by 9 per cent.
Mr Zhu has not managed to in push through a policy of closing old
loss-making factories - there are some 10,000 old run-down enterprises -
though a little progress has been made by merging manufacturers of similar
products into about 30-40 enterprise groups.
But he has begun to change the climate for foreign joint ventures and two of
the country's most successful (rated by a government newspaper) are in
Shanghai producing Volkswagen cars and Pilkington glass. Foreign managers
say that, despite all the problems, Shanghai has definite benefits,
including an industrial base for component manufacture.
For nearly 40 years after the Communists came to power, Shanghai was used by
Peking as a cash cow for Peking's coffers. This was arrested three years ago
and a new 50-50 formula for sharing payments with the capital was
introduced. But Peking has continued to make extra demands and a total of
around yuan 13bn has been handed over in each of the past two years, leaving
only about 25 per cent of yuan 16-17bn total revenues for local spending.
This is however partly offset by Peking aid for Pudong which, in every way,
is Shanghai's main hope for the future.

FT  24 APR 91 / Survey of China (7): US Congress holds the key - David
Dodwell on China's need to guard its trade and investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MENTION MFN to Peking's trade officials and you get a beneficent smile and a
glib 'No problem'. Mention MFN in Hong Kong or Guangdong, and you see sweat
on the temples.
By June 3, President Bush must agree to renew for another year the Most
Favoured Nation status that assures China low-tariff exports to the US.
Signs are that in spite of deep reservations, President Bush will agree. But
within the following 60 days, it is likely that the US Congress will summon
the two thirds majority it needs to veto the renewal. All will then hang on
a Senate vote.
In spite of complacency in Peking, the consequences of losing MFN status
would be grave for China.
Exports to the US would fall by at least 50 per cent, according to the
American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong. Guangdong province, with most at
stake, would lose about Dollars 2bn in exports, with over 1m workers losing
their jobs. Guangdong's GDP would slump by 10 per cent.
Describing the 'deadly impact' of losing MFN privileges, Mr John Kamm, then
President of Hong Kong's American Chamber of Commerce, told Congressional
hearings last year: 'The open coastal provinces and cities - the China of
reform - will be hard hit. Their leaders - supporters of the deposed party
secretary Zhao Ziyang - severely undermined by rapid falls in living
standards which owe much to export earnings.'
This evidence, which played an important part last year in persuading US
congressional critics of China to renew MFN status, is about to be replayed
in Washington. If anything, the mood is even more grim. Regrets in the wake
of the Gulf war over the price paid for supporting Saddam Hussein over past
decades have prompted US leaders to toughen their stance against regimes
they regard as tyrannical.
Protectionist sentiment in the US has also hardened. China admits a trade
surplus with the US, even though it does not acknowledge that a large
proportion of China's re-exports through Hong Kong are in fact exports to
the US.
An array of administrative measures in China to trim imports have also
aroused Washington's anger. They were introduced to tackle rampant inflation
inside China, as well as to shore up foreign exchange reserves ahead of a
debt-repayment peak in 1992-93.
The result has been to give China its first visible trade surplus since
1984. Exports rose 18.1 per cent in 1990 to Dollars 62bn, while imports fell
9.8 per cent to Dollars 53bn. A surplus on invisibles boosted the current
account surplus to Dollars 13.1bn.
While textile exports have struggled against competition particularly from
Pakistan, and petroleum exports have slipped because of mounting domestic
demand, China is expected to retain a strong competitive advantage in coming
years in the export of consumer electronics - including TVs, radios,
microwaves and computers - and in pharmaceuticals and machine tools.
Tourism has also begun to recover after Tiananmen. After a 23 per cent slump
between 1988 and 1989, more than 27m tourists visited China last year, a 12
per cent improvement on the year. Tourism revenues have recovered to the
1988 level of Dollars 2.2bn after a 20 per cent fall in 1989.
Perhaps to the alarm of Peking's more conservative economic planners,
international trade has risen in importance to assume a considerable
significance in the domestic economy.
Foreign investment flows have played a parallel role to trade. Peking says
foreign investment amounted to a record Dollars 6.57bn in 1990, a leap of
17.3 per cent from 1989. Since both Japan and the US say their investment
was down, the impetus came largely from Hong Kong and Taiwan.
Even more encouraging from Peking's point of view is that hotel and property
deals - which accounted for a large share of investment through the 1980s -
have slumped. According to the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and
Trade, about 90 per cent of investment last year was in manufacturing,
regarded as being of much greater intrinsic benefit to the economy.
In a bid to attract more high technology investment, China has set up 27 new
high-tech zones across the country, lifting the total to 38. Foreign
investors in the zones will pay just 15 per cent income tax - compared with
the standard rate of 33 per cent. If they export 70 per cent of their
output, tax falls still further to 10 per cent. The government's aim is to
boost high-tech output value from the current level of RMB7bn to RMB25bn by
1996.
Prospective investors nevertheless continue to complain that doing business
in China remains testing. Many fail to anticipate how many years it can take
to conclude a deal.
Equally commonly, 'cheap' labour can become expensive when undisclosed
bonuses and subsidies are added. A lack of control over land-use fees,
energy costs, or provisions for infrastructure can also provide nightmares
for financial controllers back at company headquarters.
These and more general factors point towards a bleaker investment climate in
the early part of the 1990s: the higher priorities of reconstruction in the
Gulf, forging links in eastern Europe, or simply battening down against
domestic recession, mean that many traditional western investors will not be
running hotfoot to China.
However, strong and ongoing investor interest from Hong Kong and Taiwan in
China's south, and perhaps from Japan and South Korea in the north, may help
to insulate the country from an otherwise more difficult foreign investment
climate.
Either way, whether Peking's conservative leaders like it or not, China's
doors to the outside world have been firmly opened. The importance of trade
and investment to the national economy is now so great that the price of
closing the doors is probably too high to contemplate. This in the longer
term has to provide reformers with confidence that economic trends will
eventually play into their hands.

FT  24 APR 91 / Survey of China (8): Pudong - gamble for growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ELLIOTT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW word has appeared on the lips of almost every Chinese official
discussing the country's hopes for the future - Pudong, writes John Elliott.
It is the name of a 350 sq km area of Shanghai, China's second city, which
is to be developed over the next 20-30 years with a series of special
industrial and trade zones.
But Pudong - or Pudong New Area as it is called - is not just for Shanghai.
Backed by the country's top leaders, it is the symbol of China's plans for
economic development into the next century.
Dong means east and Pu is an abbreviation for Shanghai's Huangpu River, so
Pudong lies on the eastern bank of the river across from the current city
centre.
Mr Zhu Rongji, the city's mayor who has just been promoted to be a vice
premier in Peking, is the driving force behind the development which was
announced last year. Some yuan 12bn projects are planned but total
expenditure could reach yuan 30bn.
'Pudong will be a place for experimenting in new policies which maybe we can
later apply elsewhere in China,' says Mr He Gaosheng, director of the
Shanghai Office of Economic System Reform. 'It will not be capitalism but we
will bring market mechanisms into a planned economy, with public ownership
remaining the mainstay. With Pudong we can develop the whole of Shanghai and
promote development throughout the country.'
But it is difficult to envisage the plans materialising. At present Pudong,
which lies between the Huangpu and Yangtze rivers, is an uninspiring area of
broken roads, 2,000 (mostly small) factories, ramshackle chemical and gas
plants, shabby flats, and traditional-style houses.
The aim is to double the present population of 1m. The yuan 12bn expenditure
will be spread over five years or longer on a free trade zone and 10
infrastructure projects, some already started, including a four-berth deep
water port, two major river bridges, an 8km inner ring road, and new plants
for water, electricity, gas and sewage treatment.
Officials say yuan 5bn will come from Peking, yuan 4bn from domestic bank
loans, and yuan 3bn from the Shanghai government. They are looking for
foreign finance - for example from the Asian Development Bank - but do not
expect substantial international investment until the infrastructure
projects are completed.
Currently there are about 40 factories with foreign investment. They include
one of China's most successful joint ventures - a float glass plant started
with Pilkington of the UK four years ago when Pudong had no special
significance - and a Dollars 25m agricultural chemical plant planned by Du
Pont.
A showpiece multi-storey financial and trade centre is to be built across
the Huangpu River from the old Bund (or promenade). This is intended to help
Shanghai's drive to boost its service sector from 30 per cent of GNP.
China's first foreign-owned wholesale and retail businesses are also to be
admitted - Yaohan, a Hong Kong-based Japanese department store group, plans
a HKDollars 780m joint venture to open in 1995. An area has been designated
for an international airport.
It is difficult at this stage to assess how much of the grand Pudong scheme
will actually materialise. But whatever happens in the longer term, Shanghai
will at least benefit from the infrastructure projects.

state of economy

<TEXT>
CHINA could face economic disaster in a year or two, even though, in
contrast with the tired old economies of the former Soviet bloc, it is
superficially prospering.
Wang Bingqian, the finance minister, speaking at the National People's
Congress in March, for the third year running called the financial situation
'extremely grim'.
Unless Peking can work a near-miracle, inflation will take off, workers will
demonstrate on the streets and the house of cards built on subsidies that is
China's current economic structure will collapse. Since even Peking's
conservatives recognise the dangers, the leadership is moving with
reluctance towards cautious reform.
Small experimental reforms are springing up all over China on a strictly
local basis, such as the introduction of stock exchanges in Shanghai and
Shenzhen. Officials such as vice-governor Ma Lin of Sichuan province enthuse
about the 'ideal way' a stock exchange raises investment funds. Secondary
markets for state bonds, previously confined to Shanghai and Chongqing, have
been successfully launched elsewhere.
Deregulation of grain prices, as in Guanghan near Chengdu, capital of
Sichuan, is happening on a trial basis. This follows price rises last year
in previously tightly controlled items such as cooking oil and cotton cloth.
The yuan was devalued on April 10 for the third time in 16 months, bringing
it to yuan 5.26 to the dollar from the late-1989 figure of yuan 3.72.
Foreign bankers in Peking were expecting a further cut of about 10 per cent.
A kind of convertibility increasingly functions through the Foreign Exchange
Adjustment Centres, where joint ventures can trade foreign exchange freely
at a market rate. Some housing reform, which either encourages tenants to
buy their apartments or permits enterprises, the main providers, to set up
separate self-financing corporations, is already under way, though this is
proving easier with new housing than apartment blocks inhabited through
several generations at peppercorn rent.
Insurance-based pensions, health services and social security payments are
also on the agenda as devices to lessen the load of the over-burdened state
enterprises which currently provide them. This would allow enterprises to
sack workers and focus on the profitability of their core activities.
But there is no sign yet that Peking will bite the bullet of abolishing
subsidies which featherbed the industrial worker and cripple state finances.
Nor will it adopt a true price reform, adopting a market system which would
help to allocate resources correctly and cut waste.
Yet an apocalyptic scenario is hard to believe when the streets are orderly,
markets appear to be booming, new office blocks and hotels adorn Peking and
provincial capitals and the shops are full of the latest electronic goodies.
Last year, China turned in a creditable economic performance with a record
harvest of 435m tonnes and a respectable GNP and industrial growth rates (5
and 6 per cent respectively). Foreign trade was up, with exports performing
well.
But, said one westerner in Peking, 'China is still living on the impetus of
the mid-1980s. While major reforms have not been rolled back, the
innovations are minor. Two years of good harvests have given economists a
chance to push for small reforms, but this year's weather is less
promising.'
When Li Peng, the hard-line premier, took over economic management from Zhao
Ziyang, the now-disgraced former party leader, in late 1988, fundamental
reform was effectively shelved. But the policies then applied (mainly an
administrative price freeze and credit controls) did nothing to solve
China's huge underlying problems of suppressed demand and inefficiency.
Potential inflation is still ticking away under the surface, fuelled by
China's growing deficit financing and subsidy policy. In 1990, Wang Bingqian
told the recent Congress that the budget deficit was, according to Chinese
accounting (which reckons government borrowing as revenue), yuan 15bn. This
was bad enough by Chinese standards, but when adjusted to reflect normal
practice was much worse at yuan 48bn.
On top of that, nearly a third of the yuan 340bn budget expenditure went on
subsidies. The central government forked out nearly yuan 58bn to the
loss-making state sector plus another yuan 38bn in individual subsidies to
compensate for price rises.
Peking is short of money anyway because of its revenue sharing system. Under
the existing semi-reformed fiscal structure, a fixed tax amount is paid by
enterprises to local authorities who then hand only a percentage to Peking.
Not only is Peking's slice relatively small (a source of serious dispute
with provincial leaders) but the fall in state enterprise profits last year
(58 per cent) meant less for everyone. This is likely to get worse since
more inflation is on the cards for this year. In 1990, credit estimated at
yuan 250-290bn was pumped into the economy to fuel industry after Li Peng's
inexpert 1988-89 freeze caused near-collapse. This enabled the government to
meet its industrial growth target for the year, but bodes ill for the
future.
Meanwhile, subsidies paid to workers continue to rise. This is seen as
essential by the unpopular leadership, which is deeply concerned to keep the
urban workforce happy and loss-making factories open. Wages are also rising
 -up by over 18 per cent in the last quarter of 1990 compared with the same
period of 1989.
Protected by Peking's reluctance to implement its bankruptcy laws, state-run
industry is growing more inefficient by the hour. Mostly old and badly run,
it is responsible for what Li Peng, in his report to the NPC, called the
'high consumption in production, low product quality, enormous waste in
construction, slow capital turnover, low labour productivity and serious
losses'.
Attempts at change are hampered by the post-Tiananmen commitment to
ideology. At the top are leaders determined to avoid the fate of the
Ceausescus by exerting party dominance. Li Peng made a special point of
stressing Marxist-Leninism in his report, though he had to signal for
applause during his three-hour speech by shouting his words to the dozing
delegates.
Still, a kind of compromise has been reached between the hard-liners and
reformists which is evident in China's new plans. Five-year programmes
(1991-95) and ten-year plans to cover the years to the end of the century
set out Peking's intentions in traditionally imprecise style. The main focus
is to be a move to give state managers more powers to deal with
inefficiencies, the improvement of infrastructure and some expenditure on
new special economic zones such as Pudong in Shanghai.
But the unhappy history of Chinese five year plans (most have been overtaken
by political upheavals before completion), inspires little confidence. If
this one avoids that fate (unlikely, in view of the extreme age of Peking's
key leaders), inflation may destroy it.

FT  24 APR 91 / Survey of China (9): Weather has the last say - Farmers
prepare for a year of lower harvests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLINA MACDOUGALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'CHINA'S harvest last year was the best in history, but it won't be so good
this year', says Mr Zhang Shaogong, of Peking's agriculture ministry. A
serious drought gripped north China through last winter, and though snow
fell in March the year's total may fall short of last year's.
Drought has affected areas in the south, too, and these will need heavy
spring rains to replenish water supplies.
As a result, the summer-harvested crops - which make up a third of the
annual total - will definitely not reach last year's peak, and the autumn
harvest is unlikely to fill the gap. This can only aggravate China's other
economic difficulties.
Unpredictable weather explains why Peking's leadership is permanently
concerned over agriculture. 'Last year, the rains came when the crops needed
it. We dare not count on such weather again', comments Mr Zhang. 'Experience
shows we only get two good years in five.'
All agricultural sectors shone in 1990. Cotton output rose by more than 18
per cent to 4.47m tonnes, and oilseeds, which in the form of cooking oil
provide an indispensable part of Chinese cuisine, by nearly 25 per cent to
16.2 m tonnes. Meat, milk, fruit and sugar crops, increasingly adding
protein and diversity to the diet, were up substantially.
But all this plenty, especially of grain (435m tonnes), brought serious
headaches.
At the end of last year, tens of millions of tonnes were being kept in the
open air, twice the amount lying outdoors at the end of 1989, said Bai
Meiqing, vice-minister of commerce, last month. Damp and pest-ridden grains
were up by a quarter and a third respectively, he noted.
Because of cash shortages last year (the consequence of China's nationwide
financial difficulties), Peking's commercial departments could not afford to
buy more than the set quotas for storage, and the peasants were left with
grain they could not sell. This surplus is a strong disincentive to growing
more this year.
Currently the state makes contracts with the peasants to buy 50m tonnes of
grain yearly at a fixed price and in return supplies subsidised farm
chemicals and fuel. But since 1988 official policy has put pressure on
peasants to grow as much as they can, though without providing the cheap
inputs to facilitate it. Disappointed, many are now out of pocket.
As a result, said vice-premier Tian Jiyun at a conference in March, the
peasants last year won no extra income and some even sustained a loss. 'Our
farmers are getting poorer', says Ma Lin, vice-governor of Sichuan province.
Peking is right to be concerned over feeding its huge population. The
question is whether this concern is being demonstrated in the right way. The
return to individual farming (the so-called 'household responsibility
system') brought the enormous surge in farm production in the early 1980s,
but, in tune with the post-Tiananmen stress on control and ideology, the
collective is now back in vogue.
In any case, some western diplomats argue, China is worrying about the wrong
things. There is no need to stress higher grain output since enough other
foods are now produced to keep the country reasonably nourished. Allowing
market forces to operate more instead of less would bring better returns.
At least the central government is taking one sensible new approach. There
is a fresh emphasis on purchase and marketing which may enable China to
distribute grain more effectively.
Peking has set a production target of 450m tonnes of grain by 1995 and 500m
tonnes by the year 2000. This will be achieved by 'improving' (how is
unspecified) the household responsibility system, upgrading services to
farmers, stepping up the collective element in rural management,
streamlining food distribution and increasing agricultural investment.
The quality of the land itself is under scrutiny. China has many hectares of
marginal land which will be the target of investment over the current five
year plan. 'Production bases' in which Peking will invest yuan 10 bn are
being set up for grain and cotton, and more grain markets will be
established.
Some scepticism is in order here since, from the 1950s onward, in its more
apocalyptic moods Peking has urged the development of marsh and
mountainside. Similarly, grain markets have been on the agenda ever since
the mid-1980s, but without so far performing.
Today, however, there is hope since China is more aware of the environmental
damage which may result from unwise cultivation. But optimism is not
reinforced by the statement of Song Ping, one of China's top six leaders on
the Politbureau Standing Committee and its chief Marxist-Leninist guru, at a
recent agricultural conference, that 'Using socialist ideology to arm the
cadres and people of rural areas and guiding the 800m peasants to firmly
take the socialist road are the basic assurance for doing a good job in
rural work.'
This old-fashioned hard-line policy is reflected in the Central Committee's
recent order that the grassroots bureaucracy be improved, first and foremost
the party branches. Socialist ideology and spiritual construction should
take the lead. This is a far cry from Deng Xiaoping's slogan 'it is glorious
to get rich]' promulgated just a few years ago.
China would do better to forego attempts to organise its vast rural
territories and simply free the prices paid for farm products, argue some
western diplomats.
The market principle would soon beget a higher output and a better
distribution system. But this seems unlikely to happen in the present
political climate. Minor experiments in freeing the price of grain are in
progress, for instance in Guanghan county in Sichuan province, but transfer
to wider arenas does not seem likely yet.
The big success of rural China is the town and village enterprise sector.
This grew up in the heady days of the economic freedoms of the early 1980s,
when farmers were encouraged to set up small businesses. The total value of
rural output last year reached yuan 1.625 bn, of which nearly 55 per cent
was generated by local enterprise.
This is recognised nationally as the single most important factor in raising
the standard of living and even the hardest-liner has so far shown no sign
of trying to roll it back.
It is a pity Peking cannot apply the same successful principles to food
production and sales, which would obviate the need for the new stress on
village control.

FT  24 APR 91 / Survey of China (4): Two economies that overlap - Guangdong
eyes Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ELLIOTT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Mr Ye Xuanping vacates his post as the liberal governor of the southern
province of Guangdong to take up a less powerful post in Peking during the
next few months, an almost revolutionary dream which he is believed to have
wanted to write into the eighth five-year plan may go with him, or at least
be diluted. It is to merge the economies of Guangdong and Hong Kong.
There is, however, strong opposition from hardliners in Peking who
disapprove of Guangdong's independently free-wheeling market-oriented ways.
Hong Kong also has serious reservations, partly because it does not want to
endanger its current autonomy, nor make it easy for China to renege on its
promise of a 'high degree of autonomy' after 1997.
'There are, of course, problems of our different economic and social systems
and I would not talk about merging the economies, but we would like to have
some sort of planned development,' says Mr Yi Zhenqiu, director of the
Guangdong Office of Economic Systems Reform. He envisages the creation of a
Hong Kong-Guangdong economic and trade promotion committee to act as an
industrial investment 'match-maker'.
In the past decade, Guangdong, which has a population of 64m, has become
China's most open and prosperous province, thriving on close economic links
between its Pearl River Delta area with Hong Kong. About 1.5m-2m workers in
the province are employed in factories processing partially-manufactured
foreign goods (mostly from Hong Kong) for re-export, and another 1m are in
associated activities.
As many as 50,000 technical and managerial staff from Hong Kong work
regularly in China, a lot of them in Guangdong, and 15,000 vehicles cross
the land border every day, four times as many as six years ago.
Economists estimate that 20 per cent or more of Hong Kong's currency is
openly circulating in Guangdong tourist and business outlets.
This co-operation has been good for both areas. Hong Kong companies have
gained access to cheap labour and factory premises.
Guangdong has benefited because of the consequential wealth and economic
expansion. Foreign investment totalled some Dollars 7bn during the 1980s, 90
per cent via Hong Kong.
It went into more than 10,000 joint ventures and other enterprises, mostly
involving labour intensive light industry, plus thousands of the processing
factories. The productive end of this investment has suddenly come on stream
during the past two years, so that between 25 and 30 per cent of both
Guangdong's yuan 189bn industrial output and its yuan 43.29bn industrial
exports last year were generated by factories with foreign involvement.
But there has been a price to pay in social terms because hundreds of
thousands of people regularly pour into the province looking for work. Some
make up a floating labour population of more than 1m in the processing
factories; others cannot find work and fuel a crime wave of armed robberies
and prostitution.
Guangdong is also frustrated that most Hong Kong businessmen only cash in on
the cheap unskilled processing factory labour. They rarely lay down
significant long-term industrial investment and look to other countries for
high technology.
Some labour processing factories do develop into joint ventures and so
become more permanent investments.
But relatively little progress has been made on the creation of a
technological and industrial base in relation to overall economic growth,
which last year amounted to 16 per cent. The new five year plan includes
projects which should help by improving both electricity power supplies and
road and rail transport and by creating three petro-chemical plants. The
capital of Guangzhou also wants to boost its service sector by admitting two
new foreign banks and by setting up a stock exchange.
Problems such as these prompted the idea of somehow merging the economies so
that Guangdong would benefit more, and Mr Ye also talked about relaxing
restrictions on the entry of goods from the colony into Guangdong's most
successful special economic zone of Shenzhen.
'We have not yet put forward any firm policies to Peking, but we would like
to consider using Hong Kong money to help finance raw materials plants. We
also have scientific ability which could be used to help Hong Kong
industries develop high technological products,' says Mr Yi, floating an
idea which has yet to catch on in Hong Kong.

FT  24 APR 91 / Survey of China (3): Rivals wait as the Old Guard slowly
crumbles - While crushing all dissent, the regime is split on many issues
</HEADLINE>

AS the second anniversary of the crackdown at Tiananmen Square approaches,
the Chinese leadership has reasserted its authority over a sullen but
subdued population. However, the government faces many intractable problems,
compounded by acute factional infighting which has produced a deadlock on
important decisions about policies and personnel.
Adding to the uncertainty is the advanced age and frail health of the
country's most powerful leaders, 86-year-old Deng Xiaoping, 83-year-old
economic theorist Chen Yun, and 84-year-old president Yang Shangkun. Because
of their age, many observers believe a succession struggle is already
underway. 'There is nobody in the younger leadership who has a decisive say
on policy decisions,' says a western diplomat. 'All are jockeying for
position , but they are holding back. The active phase - when Deng is dead
or incapacitated - hasn't arrived.'
The Chinese leadership is a collection of interlocking, overlapping, yet
distinct factions, now uneasily balanced, but prone to frequent conflicts,
depending on long term interests, connections and personal relationships.
Dominating the leadership today are octogenarians Deng, Chen, and Yang.
Long-time comrades and rivals, each has independent power networks
stretching back 50 years.
Deng's relationship-building dates from his early associating with Mao
Zedong in the 1930s and 1940s. Chen's connections stem from his role as the
central architect of economic planning in post-liberation China. Yang has
strong ties to the military, from the years he served as vice chairman of
the central military commission under Deng. These powerful relationships
have been further enhanced by those of his half-brother Yang Baibing, who is
head of the general political department of the People's Liberation Army.
Today, each of these aged revolutionaries has younger proteges whom they are
cultivating for the future. The most significant at the moment is Premier Li
Peng, whose patron is Chen Yun. Since the massacre in Tiananmen Square, with
which he is closely associated, Li's stature has as a consensus maker, an
economic thinker, and politician.
Although he is not Deng's chosen man, observers say Li is a leader with whom
Deng can work.
The premier has identified himself with improving the country's economy and
can take credit for reducing inflation and turning around China's balance of
payments.
But he has not addressed the country's basic structural problems, and if the
economy falters, he could become the scapegoat. Moreover, he is still
tarnished by his association with the Tiananmen Square massacre.
Jiang Zemin, secretary-general of the Communist Party, is widely seen as
Deng's protege. Formerly Communist Party secretary in Shanghai, he was
promoted by Deng to head the party after Zhao Ziyang was ousted in May 1989.
'He's got the titular crown - all he has to do is maintain it,' a western
diplomat says.
Others to watch are Shanghai mayor Zhu Rongji, Ye Xuanping, the governor of
Guangdong province, both considered reformists and Li Ruihuan, former mayor
of Tianjin and now a politburo member, who is a middle of the road figure.
At a meeting of the Chinese parliament in late March and in early April,
both Zhu and Ye were given new posts in the central government in Beijing,
with Zhu approved vice premier and Ye as vice-chairman the Chinese people's
consultative conference, an advisory council to the government. While they
may differ on many policy issues, virtually the entire leadership is said to
have agreed on the need to put the massacre of June 1989 behind them.
Closing the book on Tiananmen Square is thought to be the reason for a
series of trials this past winter in which about two dozen prominent
activists were sentenced to terms of up to 13 years on charges ranging from
counterrevolutionary propaganda and incitement to sedition.
The trials and the muted public reaction to them demonstrated the
effectiveness of the government's campaign of repression. With nearly all of
the student leaders who participated in the demonstrations of spring 1989
having fled abroad, here in China the dissidents lack a broad based
movement. So few are in prison that they are unlikely to become lightning
rods of dissent. However, should opposition erupt again, these proceedings
will be used as ammunition by those voicing discontent. United as the
leadership may be on the need to quell dissent, it remains divided on many
other issues, such as disputes over price reform, the power balance between
the central government and the provinces, and the question of whether to
emphasise coastal development rather than channelling investment towards the
more backward interior.
The most critical problem is economic reform. The party recognises that
staying power rests upon its ability to provide a higher standard of living
and more consumer goods. However, that requires correcting the economy's
structural problems, such as eliminating inefficient, overstaffed and
money-losing state enterprises, stimulating a largely unmotivated work
force, and preventing the waste of precious raw materials.
But any meaningful effort to deal with these problems could erode the
party's authority and eventually lead to its downfall.
While the power of the 45m-50m member communist party is still strong,
public enthusiasm for orthodox Marxism-Leninism has already been seriously
eroded by a decade of market-oriented reforms. With traditional Chinese
social values having also been destroyed by the communists, many Chinese
have been put off by the attempt to revive ideological indoctrination after
the Tiananmen Square massacre.
Some have even turned to religion. Although the party has sanctioned this to
a limited degree, the authorities are thought to fear that the revival of
religion creates a competitive world view.
Those who now join the party now are primarily opportunists. Apart from this
battle for hearts and minds, the role of the military will also be critical
in the succession struggle. The composition of the various factions within
the armed forces is not entirely clear, but certain issues have emerged that
are challenging it to its core. Foremost is the debate over whether military
modernisation should take priority over ideological indoctrination.
There is a generational split over this issue, and divisions already present
before the Gulf war are believed to have widened. For the younger
generation, some of whom have travelled outside China, the overwhelming
American technological superiority in the Gulf war is thought to have made a
deep impact.
For them, professional competence and acquiring more modern equipment are
more important than ideological purity.
Moreover, most of the funds from a recently announced 12 per cent increase
in the defence budget are believed to be earmarked for acquiring more modern
equipment for the air force and navy. But the PLA's older generation still
believes in Mao's doctrine of a 'people's war', with its superior numbers
and greater morale being more important than technology.
Yang Baibing, the secretary general of the central military commission, is
believed to have spearheaded the drive toward s re-politicising the PLA.
Apart from modernisation, questions have been raised about the military's
role in internal security. Some feel the army should have been a last resort
in the crackdown at Tiananmen Square. After the massacre, the army was
reorganised and regional commanders loyal to the forces of Yang Shangkun
were put in charge.
However, it remains unclear which group the military will support once the
octogenarians begin to die. Both western and east European diplomats foresee
a situation comparable to 1976 when Deng Xiaoping and senior military
leaders staged a coup d'etat by arresting chairman Mao's widow and the Gang
of Four shortly after Mao's death.
Until Deng leaves the scene, the leadership remains in a political gridlock,
unwilling to take risks to face the future.

FT  24 APR 91 / Survey of China (5): US complains China has dollars 10.4bn
visible surplus on trade
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The US complains that China has a Dollars 10.4bn visible surplus on its
trade with the US. It says that only Japan and Taiwan maintain larger
surpluses. As a result, US officials are pressing China to import more from
the US.
However, China claims that trade is more or less in balance, with a Dollars
1.4bn surplus in the US's favour in 1990.
One must look to Hong Kong to understand this startling difference. The US
trade figures include imports that transit the colony en route from China to
the US, and vice versa. But China regards its sales to the US via Hong Kong
as exports to Hong Kong. US products entering China from the colony are seen
as imports from Hong Kong, not the US. Neither side is ready to alter its
trade accounting practices.

FT  24 APR 91 / Survey of China (2): Quest for allies in an uncertain world
 -Foreign policy is in turmoil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR China, as for many other countries who have for decades preyed on the
superpower conflict between the Soviet Union and the US, these are
distressing times.
Where is the counterweight to 'American hegemony', so amply and effectively
demonstrated, from Peking's point of view, in the Gulf War? Is Japan about
to rise afresh, encouraged by the US, as a military force in the Pacific?
How are the European powers, obsessed with upheavals in eastern Europe,
altering their perceptions of Asia? And how will demands for independence by
Soviet republics in central Asia upset Peking's grip on Tibet, Xinjiang and
Mongolia?
China's first instinctive response has been to offer succour to President
Gorbachev. Peking cannot feel comfortable as the sole remaining torchbearer
for international socialism. Whatever the differences with Moscow over the
correct path for the development of a socialist state, the wholesale
discrediting of the socialist model is of as little comfort to China as it
is to Moscow.
Aggravating Gorbachev's misfortunes would only increase the risk that chaos
inside a disintegrating Soviet Union would spread up to, and across, China's
central Asian borders, perhaps fomenting unrest in its own minority areas.
By standing firmly for stronger central control, and by resorting to the
military for help, Gorbachev has struck a resonant chord among China's
leadership.
There is, therefore, powerful symbolism in China's recent SFr1.5bn
'commodity loans' to Moscow - the first made to the Soviet Union by its
one-time protege, and Peking's friendliest gesture to Moscow in decades.
Next month's visit to Moscow by Jiang Zemin, China's Prime Minister, is also
the first of such seniority since Mao Zedong went there in 1957.
Alongside the symbolic succour, there is also powerful self interest. China
is keen to acquire sophisticated Soviet military hardware, in particular Su
27 aircraft. Jiang Zemin is expected to discuss the matter while in Moscow,
and a deal is expected to be signed before July.
The Gulf War has also provided a sharp shock to China's foreign policy
planners, but in diplomatic terms has been handled with dexterity. Support
for the allied cause in the UN won support in Washington. Even when Qian
Qichen, the foreign minister, opted to abstain in the UN vote authorising
the use of force against Iraq, he managed to do this without antagonising
the allies: President Bush agreed to see him on the day following the vote,
apparently against the advice of advisers. He took the view that China could
have vetoed the resolution.
At the same time, Qian managed to demonstrate through its abstention that
China remains committed to an independent foreign policy, and to its support
for Third World countries. He also preserved China's relationship with Iraq,
an important customer for Chinese arms.
China is nevertheless walking a tightrope in its relations with the US,
which were traumatised following the Tiananmen massacre two years ago. Qian
has said that the war against Iraq was 'a big hegemonist power versus a
small hegemonist'. The US in turn is harbouring anger over China's extensive
arms trade with volatile countries in the Middle East.
For China, the Gulf War was not just a striking demonstration of US military
might: it heightened anxiety over the emergence of the US as the single
dominant world superpower. There is also a nagging awareness that in the
post-Cold War era, the US needs China less than it used to.
American keenness to get Japan to take on a bigger peacekeeping role in the
Pacific - in particular through a larger naval role - also prompts alarm.
Memories of Japan as a regional military power are painful still.
Closer at hand, conflict looms with the US in the improbably-linked areas of
trade and human rights. Ever since the Tiananmen massacre, the US Congress
has put China's poor human rights record under the microscope. The recent
visit to the US by the Dalai Lama has heightened antagonism.
These issues have become linked with trade ever since Congress opted to use
the annual debate over extension of Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status to
trading partners as a means of punishing tyrannical governments. China
argues that this is an unacceptable intrusion into its internal affairs.
US Congressmen argue in turn that it is an internal US affair whether it
gives favourable trading status to a country or not. The fact that China now
has one of the largest visible trade surpluses with the US - more than
Dollars 10bn last year - only exacerbates the conflict.
The MFN debate starts in earnest early in June. Betting men say that, after
a bumpy ride, China will regain MFN privileges for another year. To lose
them would inflict immense damage to China's external trade and would savage
Sino-US relations.
China's response to uncertainties in relations with both the US and the
Soviet Union has been to forge new friendships where possible. A recent tour
of seven European countries by Qian Qichen was part of such a strategy.
Improved relations with India - which have been in deep chill since a short
border war in 1962 - are likely to be symbolised by a visit to Delhi later
this year by Li Peng, China's prime minister. This would be the first visit
to the Indian capital by China's head of government since the late Zhou
Enlai in 1960.
Other significant developments include decisions over the past year by Saudi
Arabia, Indonesia and Singapore to abandon diplomatic recognition of Taiwan
in favour of Peking. These constitute an important breakthrough in China's
long term diplomatic strategy of isolating Taipei. They also reinforce
China's position at the heart of the Third World community of nations, and
symbolise an easing of fears in south east Asia over expansionist communism.
These improvements give much-needed solace as China nurses anxiety over the
global power balance, but do nothing to alter the country's reflexes in
times of uncertainty. As Li Peng emphasised only two weeks ago: when 'the
old global structure has disintegrated', the priority must be to 'rely on
ourselves, work hard, and build the nation through thrift and diligence'.

FT  24 APR 91 / Survey of China (1): Slowly burns the fuse - Two years after
the Peking massacre, democratic reform is still a potent and unresolved
issue. And in the fog surrounding the demise of the Communist Old Guard the
only certainty is China's growing sense of insecurity in a changing world

PEKING is a city with an earthquake waiting to happen. Last month, it was
a-buzz with seismologists reporting that the earth's crust in north China
had been immobile for too long.
This portended a catastrophic tremor like that of 1976 which killed around a
quarter of a million people in the nearby city of Tangshan and - as it
seemed to traditionally-minded folk - foretold the death of Chairman Mao
Zedong a few weeks later.
As it happened, there was an earthquake this March, but it was several
hundred miles from Peking and has so far not rocked the leadership.
The octogenarian patriarchs who, though mostly without official posts,
effectively rule China, cling grimly to life, according to Peking stories,
by means of monthly blood transfusions and the attentions of China's most
famous 'Qigong' (traditional deep-breathing) masters.
Their relatives, retainers and vassals circle like vultures, awaiting a
death which will shift the balance in the divided leadership between the
aged reformist Deng Xiaoping and the conservatives headed by Chen Yun.
Though the present jockeying depends more on personal ties than policy, how
far to permit reform is still a potent issue.
The current balance between reformers and hard-liners is nicely illustrated
by the appointment at the recent National People's Congress of two new
Vice-premiers, Zhu Rongji, mayor of Shanghai (reformist), and Zou Jiahua,
minister in charge of the State Planning Commission (hard-liner).
But it also illustrates the near-unfathomable inter-connections between
personalities and policies.
Zou Jiahua is brother-in-law to reformist Ye Xuanping, governor of Guangdong
province. Ye, powerful son of China's now-dead head of state and Long March
general, Ye Jianying, was also appointed to a post in Peking (though a
purely formal one), apparently to remove him from his freewheeling fief in
south China where he was resisting Peking's interference.
But who is doing what to whom by these moves? Has Ye increased his power in
moving to the centre or lost it now that he's away from his home support?
Are Ye and Zou at daggers drawn because of politics because of family
relationships? If it was a loss of power for Ye to be posted to Peking, is
it not the same for Mayor Zhu Rongji? Do these appointments mean that the
reformers have gained, or the hard-liners?
The one certainty in the political fog is the growing stress on security,
particularly in Peking. Many provincial cities are relaxed and a fair number
of the reform policies of the mid-1980s continue, if sporadically.
But in the Chinese capital, police and video cameras are thick on the
streets. Particularly monitored, by video cameras, bugs or simple tailing,
are local Chinese contacts with foreigners.
In March, a new top level security committee was set up under Qiao Shi,
Number Three in China's party leadership and a lifelong policeman. Its first
meeting was held just two days after the People's Daily published a poem
which, when read diagonally, contained this hidden message: 'Li Peng (the
hard-line premier who masterminded the Tiananmen crackdown in 1989) must be
removed from power to assuage popular indignation'. Reports from Hong Kong
last week said the editor responsible was later arrested trying to flee the
country.
The leadership has reason to feel insecure. Xu Jiatun, a senior party member
and, till last year the head of the Xinhua news agency in Hong Kong, China's
de facto embassy, has defected to the US. Provincial leaders such as Ye
Xuanping are strong enough to defy the central government over issues such
as taxation.
Disaffection is rife in China's border territories of Tibet, Xinjiang and
Inner Mongolia. While China has no problem marshalling the force to deal
with this (demonstrations have been ruthlessly put down), it fears the
growing influence in the outside world of Tibet's exiled spiritual leader,
the Dalai Lama, and the effects on its other minorities of Islamic
fundamentalism and growing democracy in the former Soviet empire.
The leadership is watching the Soviet Union anxiously, backing President
Gorbachev because, unlike Boris Yeltsin, he is resisting independence for
the republics.
Alarmed by Washington's military might as displayed in the Gulf, Peking is
looking for new weaponry and hopes to buy some of the relatively advanced Su
27 Soviet combat aircraft in the next few months. The deal is likely to
figure prominently in the visit of Jiang Zemin, China's party leader, to
Moscow next month.
Peking has seen its relations with the US slide since it put down the
student demonstrators of Tiananmen in 1989. While the economic sanctions
applied thereafter were gradually repealed last year and China regained some
standing by supporting Kuwait rather than Iraq in the Gulf crisis, its arms
sales in the Middle East have earned it American fury.
This, plus its brutal handling of Tibetan and Chinese demonstrators since
and its flood of cheap exports to the US are making the re-confirmation of
its access to Most Favoured Nation treatment an uncertainty for the second
year running.
If Washington takes MFN away, Sino-US relations will nose-dive to levels not
seen for nearly two decades.
Sino-British relations are cool in the wake of the dispute over Hong Kong's
proposed new airport. Germany, previously in keen pursuit of trade and
investment with China, is preoccupied with the problems in its eastern half.
Japan, once dazzled by the size and proximity of the Chinese market, is
being actively courted by the USSR as potential fairy god-mother to Siberia.
China, for over a decade a favourite with western governments, is in danger
of being left on the shelf as the world regroups after the collapse of
Soviet communism and the Gulf war.
This comes at a time when Peking faces serious domestic economic problems.
Food shortages, inflation and unemployment are all possible flash points for
urban unrest.
In the inevitable grim comparison with the Soviet bloc, the economy is
thriving, but this is probably temporary. China has had record harvests two
years running, which have boosted light industry and food markets, but a
harvest downturn is now threatened because of damaging drought in many parts
of China.
On top of that, Peking's inability to deal with serious price distortions is
now coming home to roost.
In industry, the collective and private sector is booming but the state
sector - the backbone of China's heavy industry - is a disaster area. More
than a third of state enterprises last year made a loss, and subsidies to
featherbed industrial workers (by maintaining jobs and cheap food) came to
nearly RMB yuan 100bn, almost a third of the state's budget expenditure. The
alternative to subsidies is to close factories and raise food prices, which
the party leadership believes would enrage the urban population.
Reluctantly the hard-liners in the leadership have had to agree to some
reform as the lesser of two evils. Two small stock exchanges, plus half a
dozen centres where grain prices have been freed, a proper income tax system
and a move to give state factory managers more independence are all
currently on test. The most hopeful sign in China today is that many young
officials (educated, they'll sometimes tell you, on courses in unlikely
places like Bath, in south-west England) long to try these on a wider scale.
If China can surmount its present difficulties, they might get the chance.
But not a lot is likely to change until the present gruesome stalemate is
resolved over who in the top leadership dies first, and when.

FT  24 APR 91 / Fleet upbeat on profits at failed BNE
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FLEET/NORSTAR Financial Group, the new proprietor of the bankrupt Bank of
New England, is forecasting that BNE will generate annual earnings from
operations of about Dollars 150m-Dollars 200m between 1993 and 1995.
The prediction comes less than four months after BNE was declared insolvent
and seized by federal regulators in one of the biggest bank failures in US
history.
Fleet, the Rhode Island-based bank, tempered yesterday's optimism with the
warning that it expects BNE to post a loss of Dollars 10m-Dollars 15m in the
first six months after the acquisition and to break even for the first 12
months.
Fleet, in partnership with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the New York buy-out
investment boutique which is one of the most powerful takeover players in
the US, was awarded BNE's assets on Monday.
Fleet will pay the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Dollars 125m
as a premium, made up of Dollars 100m in preferred stock and Dollars 25m in
cash. It will also inject Dollars 500m capital into the failed bank.
In exchange, Fleet will take control of three BNE 'bridge banks', with
combined assets of about Dollars 15bn. To finance the deal, Fleet will raise
Dollars 683m of new capital, including Dollars 283m to be provided by
investors advised by KKR.
The FDIC said Fleet's offer was the least costly to the federal bank
insurance fund. However, the FDIC will absorb most of the risk associated
with the commercial property loan losses which drove BNE into liquidation.
The FDIC will assume about Dollars 5.5bn of BNE's problem assets.
Fleet will also be able to turn any additional problem assets over to the
FDIC with minimal penalties during the next three years.
Mr William Seidman, chairman of the FDIC, yesterday said the agency plans to
borrow between Dollars 5bn and Dollars 5.5bn from the US Treasury's Federal
Financing Bank (FFB) as a result of resolving the BNE collapse.
This is the first time that the FDIC has taken advantage of changes last
year, authorising it to borrow working capital from the FFB. Mr Seidman said
about Dollars 3bn will be repaid from the sale of assets and about Dollars
2bn will be losses.
The FDIC has taken great pains to stress KKR's distance from the deal. It
described KKR's involvement as 'a passive investor'. But this one of the
first times that a group which is not a bank has been allowed to make a
significant capital infusion into a leading US bank.
KKR has been thwarted before in its attempts to invest in financial
institutions, including its 1989 bid for the failed Texas banks of MCorp.
In the case of the Bank of New England, KKR has already met political
opposition from Representative John Dingell, the formidable chairman of the
House Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr Dingell warned regulators that a
joint KKR-Fleet bid might violate laws which prohibit commercial companies
from owning banks.
Under the terms of the Fleet deal, KKR investors will buy Dollars 283m of
dual convertible preferred stock. This will be convertible into 16.03m
common shares of Fleet/Norstar at Dollars 17.65 a share in no less than
three years.
In addition, KKR has warrants to buy 6.5m Fleet common shares.
On a fully-diluted basis after Fleet's common offering, KKR's investors will
have about 16 per cent of Fleet's non-voting stock.
A KKR spokesman said the firm was attracted to the BNE bid by the strength
of Fleet/Norstar's management. Fleet, which was founded 200 years ago and
has assets of Dollars 32.6bn excluding BNE, is considered one of the
best-run New England banks.
The BNE acquisition will transform it into the biggest player in the region.
Analysts said the FDIC's choice of Fleet against competing bids from
BankAmerica and Bank of Boston was a compromise decision, which would have
the least ramifications for the US banking industry.

FT  24 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: Firmer tone but volume remains thin
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK stock market turned its attention back to the domestic scene
yesterday, when the FT-SE climbed painfully above 2,500 again after Mr
Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer, made favourable comments on
the progress of inflation. But the immediate gain of 17.5 Footsie points,
following Mr Lamont's speech to the Institute of Directors, was trimmed
later and trading volume remained disappointing.
Equities opened lower, reacting to the further fall of 38 Dow points on Wall
Street overnight. Mr Lamont's statement that UK inflation is falling fast
revived hopes that the next cut in base rates may not be quite so far away
as feared; the market's swift response was also fuelled by firmness in stock
index futures.
The stock market topped off fairly quickly, however, also discouraged by
news of a widening in the UK monthly current account trade deficit to Pounds
432m in March. A further attempt to move forward when Wall Street opened
higher was checked when the Dow slipped back from its early high to show a
gain of about 8 points in London trading hours.
The final London reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,503.8 for a net rise of 13
points. Equity dealers found the recapture of the 2,500 area unconvincing,
largely because turnover was unimpressive.
Equity strategists continue to take a cautious view of the near-term outlook
for the equity market. However, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew said there are some
grounds for mild optimism about the UK economy, in spite of 'an exceedingly
grim first quarter'. It warned that political factors could unsettle
sterling and hence keep real interest rates high.
Seaq volume of 520.6m shares yesterday, against 403m on Monday, was inflated
by turnover of 101m shares in Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, comprised largely of a deal
of 45m shares in the advertising group, double-counted on Seaq. More
detailed data from the London Stock Exchange indicated that retail, or
customer, interest in equities continues to fall well below the Pounds 1bn
daily level still seen as the target for the London securities industry to
trade profitably.
The revived uncertainties in the industry were revealed by the decision of
Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the UK investment bank, to pull out of the US
equities market; Kleinwort Benson, the London merchant bank, disclosed
financial write-offs in its US arm. However, there was better news on
progress at County NatWest, the securities arm of National Westminster.
The stock market was also waiting for news on the proposals to merge the
London Traded Options Market with Liffe, the London International Financial
Futures Exchange. The market took on board two more rights issues, the most
significant being a call for Pounds 162m from Taylor Woodrow, one of
Britain's largest housebuilders. The construction and building sector also
had to face a disappointing trading statement from Tarmac.
The blue chip stocks were mostly a shade firmer on the day, responding to
the more optimistic views on inflation rather than to yesterday's moves by
central banks to sell the US dollar. ICI, with first-quarter trading figures
due tomorrow, edged higher.
There was a scattering of modest gains among the high street retailers,
which continued to respond to the unexpected improvement in sales volume in
March reported this week by the Confederation of British Industry.

FT  24 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: Confusion on volume in Saatchi
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING volume in Saatchi &amp; Saatchi ballooned to 101m shares, of which 90m
was accounted for by Hoare Govett bringing together a seller and buyer of
45m. The Seaq ticker indicated that the transaction price was 19p. Saatchi
shares firmed  1/2 to 20 1/2 p.
The level of business drew attention to a 9.1 per cent stake held by a group
including ESL Partners, a Dallas-based finance house, and Mr Lawrence Tisch,
the chief executive of CBS, the US media company. This group underwrote part
of Saatchi's rights issue, which was completed last week.
Since the rights issue was not registered under US securities laws, ESL
(which had a large block of Europreference stock) has entered into a private
agreement with Saatchi to buy 52.6m shares at the rights price of 10p. In
addition, on Monday the group acquired 90.1m Saatchi shares in exchange for
25.8m redeemable preference shares.
In spite of much speculation to the contrary, traders and analysts close to
the company concluded that the 45m-share block and ESL's agreement were
unrelated. With over 1 1/2 bn Saatchi shares now in issue, more high levels
of turnover are likely.
Building news
There were three big developments in the building sector: the unexpected
Pounds 162.4m rights issue from Taylor Woodrow, a steep decline in profits
at Tarmac, and news that Beazer, the construction and aggregates group,
plans to spin off its UK and European businesses.
Taylor Woodrow's rights issue, a one-for-four at 200p, came as a surprise to
the market, which responded by marking the shares down to 239p. After the
initial reaction, the stock staged a rally, eventually closing only 2 off at
251p. Specialists said institutions had indicated they would support the
issue because Taylor Woodrow is seen to be one of the best-managed companies
in the construction area.
Tarmac's preliminary profits - Pounds 190.7m against Pounds 377m - were in
line with expectations but did only minimal damage to the share price. What
did hurt the stock was a gloomy post-figures meeting with analysts, who were
told that the first half of the current year had begun badly in both the UK
and the US.
Big profits downgrades were instigated, with Panmure Gordon cutting its
current year number from Pounds 190m to Pounds 125m. Tarmac shares were
heavily traded (9.5m) and closed 16 off at 229p.
Beazer settled 4 higher at 185p on 2.5m, with specialists quick to point out
the company's 20 per cent market outperformance over the last month, 68 per
cent over the last three months and 13 per cent over the last year.
BET upgraded
Business services group BET was driven higher by two reports yesterday. The
one that could be confirmed was that UBS Phillips &amp; Drew had upgraded the
stock to a trading buy.
The broker said that with the likely sale of its Biffa waste management
operation, the dividend could be held and investors should buy for the high
yield. The second story suggested that a buyer had already been found for
Biffa.
Mr Bob Carpenter of Kleinwort Benson had expected the shares to recover as
buyers were drawn by the very generous return for a FT-SE Index stock. BET
shares rose to 169p before ending 7 ahead on balance at 167p on turnover of
2.2m shares.
Cannon Street up
The refinancing operation proposed by Cannon Street Investments (CSI), the
conglomerate, received an overwhelming vote of approval and the shares
responded strongly. Analysts backed the judgment, saying the raising of
Pounds 46.7m net through a rights issue and placing of convertible
preference stock seemed to be a very sensible move.
It removes a problem, they said, by transforming gearing from 400 per cent
to 82 per cent. CSI annual profits were lower, as expected, but the dividend
distribution was maintained. The shares closed at a 1991 high of 124p, up
18.
SmithKline Beecham continued to retreat on light profit-taking, not helped
by Nikko Securities' conclusion that investors had done enough switching
from Glaxo. The former slipped 5 to 817p and Glaxo added 4 at 1076p. Before
yesterday's fall, SmithKline had gained more than 10 per cent in a month,
making it the fourth best performer in the FT-SE 100 over that period.
Fisons, down 5 at 469p, also felt the force of profit-takers in spite of
news that Merck, the world's biggest drug company, had ended research on a
potential rival to Fisons' asthma treatments. At its annual meeting
yesterday, Merck announced the abandonment of Venzair, a drug it had once
forecast would become first line therapy for asthma.
The market has been concerned that Fisons was vulnerable to new developments
in the field. 'Venzair would certainly have worried Fisons,' said one
analyst.
The prospect of first-quarter figures tomorrow from ICI continued to
unsettle trading in the stock. The price slipped 5 in early trading, then
recovered its composure to peak at 1089p before easing once again. It ended
at 1083p, up just 3 on the day. Turnover was a solid 1.5m shares.
The bullish sentiment in the oil sector - a rising crude oil price coupled
with the recent strength of the dollar - continued to drive oil shares
higher. Aiding the latest upward move by the oils was a sharp improvement in
first-quarter earnings at Mobil, the US oil group.
The heaviest turnover in the sector, 5m shares, was in BP, which moved up 5
to 354p, closely followed by Shell, 4.9m, which climbed 9 1/2 to 522 1/2 p.
The latter was boosted by the oil team at Hoare Govett, whose latest Oil
Monthly reiterated its positive stance on the sector, and focused especially
on Shell, which it views as the prime beneficiary of record downstream
margins in the Far East.
The Water Package came under another barrage of selling pressure and closed
around the day's lowest, down 23 at Pounds 2945, as more institutions, both
in London and abroad, sold their holdings or unravelled the Package units.
'This market is still extremely vulnerable and we expect this to continue at
least up until the local elections,' said one trader, in a reference to the
Labour party's policy of renationalising the water industry if it wins the
next general election.
The electricity companies, on the other hand, responded to positive
recommendations from investment analysts, with Manweb and South Wales
heavily bought after being highlighted by one of the big US investment
houses. Manweb advanced 13 to 248p and South Wales 10 to 240p.
A late downward move by British Steel was attributed to a profits
downgrading by Smith New Court. The shares held steady until the last hour
of trading, when they turned off to close 2 1/2 down at 135p.
J. Sainsbury recovered from an early loss to close a penny better on balance
at 364p as the market pondered the company's decision to redeem a Pounds
150m bond convertible into preference shares. The rise in the share price
had already prompted some bond holders to convert and so the announcement by
Sainsbury did not take the market completely by surprise.
Hammerson continued to benefit from last week's figures, subsequent buy
recommendations from analysts and presentations to institutions. The shares
were 16 stronger at one point before closing a net 9 to the good at 639p.
Volume was above average for the stock at 545,000.
McKechnie, the industrial components group, slipped 6 to 291p as analysts
adjusted full year profits estimates in the wake of lower first-half
revenue. The setback was no surprise but researchers still erred on the side
of caution, with Mr Matthew Sutherland of County NatWest moving to Pounds
23m from Pounds 25m.
Bad sentiment from Monday's profits downgradings continued to unsettle
Gestetner, the office equipment and photographic products group, and the
close was down 6 further at 207p.

FT  24 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (America): Interest rate fears offset
good first-quarter results
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
COMMENTS from the Federal Reserve chairman about interest rate policy took
the shine off share prices yesterday after the market had opened firmer in
the wake of some strong first-quarter company results, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up just 2.73 at 2,930.45,
and then only thanks to a last-minute spurt of buying. In the morning the
index had been almost 18 points ahead, but steadily receded to stand down 11
points on balance at 3pm.
The broader-based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 moved in similar fashion, finishing
a marginal 0.81 up on the day at 381.76. The Nasdaq composite of
over-the-counter stocks held on to its gain more tenaciously to end 1.70
higher at 496.08.
Turnover on the New York SE remained light, totalling 168m shares, while
advancing issues only just kept ahead of declines by 829 to 777.
News of a much larger than expected 6.2 per cent fall in factory orders of
durable goods during March exerted a two-way pull on sentiment at the start
of trading. While the figures illustrated the extent of industry's slump,
they raised hopes that the Fed might reduce interest rates again to boost
economic activity.
Prices fell after Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, outlined his view to
a Senate committee that the current level of inflation did not justify
further cuts in interest rates.
Among a string of companies reporting good first-quarter results, RJR
Nabisco put on Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 11 5/8 on turnover of 3.8m shares.
The tobacco and foods group announced its first quarterly profit, of Dollars
5m, since it was taken private in 1989 in the world's largest-ever takeover,
via a Dollars 25bn leveraged buy-out.
The most improved results continued to come from the securities industry.
Salomon rose Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 32 3/4 on revealing a doubling in
first-quarter net income to a record Dollars 273m, and Morgan Stanley gained
Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 87 3/8 on a 46 per cent climb in quarterly earnings
to Dollars 120m.
The banking sector featured after Fleet/Norstar, the Rhode Island banking
group, won the race to buy the failed Bank of New England. The news lifted
Fleet/Norstar Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 21 5/8 in active trading, but left
Bank of Boston, which had been widely tipped as the winner, down Dollars
7/8 at Dollars 7 5/8 on turnover of 1.5m. BankAmerica, another possible
buyer, put on Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 38 1/2 .
Talley Industries eased Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 6 after the aerospace and
consumer products company missed Dollars 1.1m in interest payments on two
bond issues. Also lower was Bethlehem Steel, off Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 13
7/8 after reporting a deficit of Dollars 39m for the first quarter and
warning of further losses to come.
Square D advanced Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 81 1/8 on news that Schneider,
the French group, said it was willing to discuss improving its Dollars 78 a
share takeover offer.
Canada
TORONTO rallied in early trading but then lost momentum to leave the
composite index a modest 10.8 ahead on the day at 3,502.4.
Falls finally held a slight edge over rises, however, by 297 to 271. Volume
amounted to a moderate 20.3m shares.
Northern Telecom improved CDollars  7/8 to CDollars 38 3/4 in response to a
20 per cent rise in first-quarter earnings.
Ipsco put on CDollars  3/4 to CDollars 23 3/4 on volume of 74,000 shares in
anticipation of better first-quarter results, expected later that day.
TransCanada Pipelines, up CDollars  1/8 at CDollars 17 1/4 , reported
first-quarter earnings of 33 cents a share, little changed from the 32 cents
of a year ago.

FT  24 APR 91 / Foreign Exchanges: Data and bank sales hit dollar
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR fell back on weak US economic figures and co-ordinated central
bank intervention yesterday. The German Bundesbank led an attack by central
banks when the US currency was trading at around DM1.7540 during the
European morning. It later retreated to a low of DM1.7375 in the face of
unexpectedly weak US durable goods orders.
Data on durable goods orders are regarded as volatile and not a reliable
guide to economic trends, but dealers were still surprised that orders in
March fell 6.2 per cent against expectations of a 0.2 per cent increase.
It was the first time that the Bundesbank had intervened on the open market
since mid-March. Other European central banks, including the Bank of
England, appeared to sell dollars for D-Marks yesterday, although it was not
until after the durable goods figures were announced that the dollar came
under any pressure in the market.
Comments by US officials also had a depressing influence on the currency,
with Mr David Mullins, a Federal Reserve governor, saying the US economic
recovery may not be very robust.
In testimony before the Senate banking committee, Mr Alan Greenspan, Federal
Reserve Board chairman, said the economy appears to be still moving modestly
lower, but all indications are that the recession will bottom out within a
'reasonably short period'.
He added that the Fed is keeping its options open on interest rates and is
'looking at the economy on a day by day basis'.
At the close in London, the dollar had fallen to DM1.7420 from DM1.7660; to
Y137.90 from Y139.40; to SFr1.4590 from SFr1.4795; and to FFr5.8750 from
FFr5.9475. On Bank of England figures the dollar's index declined 0.6 to
66.5.
Sterling gained ground with other European currencies against the dollar,
but was replaced by the Italian lira as the second strongest member of the
European exchange rate mechanism.
Political risk is beginning to have a nervous effect ahead of next week's
local elections in England and Wales. Recent economic news has also caused
some concern.
Erratic items were blamed by the authorities for yesterday's news that the
UK current account deficit widened to Pounds 432m in March from the previous
month's Pounds 227m, but dealers regarded the rise of 3.5 per cent in
imports as worrying.
Mr Nick Parsons, economist at Union Discount, said the official explanation
was simply not good enough, given that the February improvement was entirely
the result of the fourth largest surplus on erratic items since records
began.
The pound regained 1.90 cents to Dollars 1.7115, but slipped to DM2.9825
from DM2.9900; to SFr2.4975 from SFr2.5050; and to FFr10.0550 from
FFr10.0650. It was unchanged at Y236.00. The sterling index improved 0.1 to
91.7. In New York the pound finished a further 15 points firmer at Dollars
1.7130.

FT  24 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC farm ministers focus on
imbalances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EC AGRICULTURE ministers yesterday put to one side their increasingly
sterile confrontation over this year's farm spending limits, and focused
instead on the specific market imbalances that threaten to break the
Community's agriculture budget.
The 12 ministers - in their third attempt to break the deadlock over price
cuts put forward by Brussels to keep spending within the mandatory farm
'guideline' - took their shopping lists to the Luxembourg presidency of the
EC and Mr Ray MacSharry, agriculture commissioner.
The hope is that the presidency and the European Commission can distill from
this a compromise to lay before the next council of agriculture ministers in
Brussels on May 21-22.
However, this looks optomistic because more than synthesis will be required
to resolve the central dispute - whether an increase of the Ecu32.5bn
(Dollars 40bn) guideline for this year is justified by the cost of bringing
east German farmers into the Common Agricultural Policy. The UK, backed by
the Netherlands, say no, while their colleagues, led by France and Ireland,
argue that it is.
A majority of delegations felt yesterday that some sort of agreement was
unlikely before June, a sentiment clear enough to become a self-fulfilling
prophecy.
Commission officials, although they believe that a settlement that late
means the CAP could run short of funds by October, were encouraged by the
sight of ministers engaging with the details of the price package for 1991.
There were, however, few signs of suggestions that would reduce spending.
One exception was the UK argument that milk quotas should be cut by 4-5 per
cent, instead of 2 per cent as the Commission wants. Mr John Gummer, the
British agriculture minister, said that farmers know a second cut will have
to follow one of 2 per cent.
Mr MacSharry said late on Monday that if no action was taken to reduce
prices and cut overproduction, EC stockpiles of surplus food would grow by
this time next year to 28m tonnes of cereals (from a record 20m now); to 1m
tonnes of butter and skimmed milk (725,000 tonnes); and a record 1m tonnes
of beef, from 750,000 tonnes now.
'The only limit on intervention stocks now is the lack of storage space,'
one Commission official remarked.

FT  24 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Botswana tries to loosen De
Beers' grip - The world diamond cartel faces strong calls for change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEGOTIATIONS FOR a new contract between Botswana, the world's most important
diamond producer in value terms, and De Beers, the South African group which
controls 80 per cent of the market for rough (uncut) diamonds, are taking
much longer than expected. The previous three-year contract ended on
December 31.
Some Botswana politicians want to change De Beers' exclusive sales contract
so that part of their country's output can be sold independently of the
South African group's international cartel. This would give Botswana its own
'market window' to see what its diamonds are worth in the free market.
De Beers is resisting any change. Mr Nicholas Oppenheimer, chairman of the
group's Central Selling Organisation, argues that if Botswana chose not to
sell its production exclusively through his organisation, the CSO's ability
to regulate the distribution of rough diamonds would be compromised.
He said: 'Because the major (diamond) producers freely consent to sell
exclusively through one channel, the CSO is able to preserve an orderly
market by matching rough diamond sales closely to consumer demand.'
However, IDC (Holdings), a London-based group which claims to be the most
experienced and substantial dealer in rough diamonds independent of the CSO,
suggests the CSO's attitude 'is unreasonable and based on a conceptual
argument with little substance in fact.'
In presentations to Botswana's Minerals Policy Committee and members of
parliament, IDC has been arguing that, not only was it commercially
essential for Botswana to understand the real value of its diamond output,
but that the country had a political responsibility to do so.
'Data accumulated independently of the CSO would put Botswana in a position
to have more input into the arrangements for the sale of its diamonds,' IDC
pointed out. 'On a political level this would enable the government to
answer its critics or its electors with confidence and sure knowledge when
questioned about arrangements for the disposal of the country's mineral
assets.'
If Botswana were to sell 10 per cent of its rough diamond production, worth
about USDollars 100m, independently of the CSO - which sells about Dollars
4bn-worth a year from all over the world - it would represent no threat to
market stability, IDC said.
It claims analysts have estimated that 50 per cent of De Beers' diamond
profits in 1989 came from Botswana. 'This profit is disproportionate to the
sale of diamonds by Debswana (De Beers' subsidiary in Botswana) to the CSO
as a percentage of the CSO's total sales profits,' IDC says.
'It is not unreasonable to reflect whether the fact that Botswana is the
only major producer currently selling 100 per cent of its production to the
CSO has any bearing on the substantial profits made by the CSO on the sale
of its diamonds.'
Other substantial producers such as the Soviet Union, Angola, Zaire and
Australia do not sell all their production to the CSO and therefore have
access to independent market information.
IDC does have a vested interest. It already markets diamonds for producers
in Guinea, Guyana, Brazil and the Central African Republic, and is offering
to do some marketing for Botswana.
It acknowledges that all sectors of the diamond trade welcomed the CSO's
efforts to keep the diamond market stable. But 'the fact that the CSO forms
part of an aggressive, profit-motivated public company with a primary
responsibility to its shareholders is often lost from view.'
De Beers says Botswana diamonds do not contribute half its diamond account
profits - but it will not divulge the true figure.
It suggests IDC's arguments are flawed because they are based on an
assumption that Botswana needs more market information. However, in common
with other producers selling diamonds to the CSO, Botswana has appointed
independent valuers who continuously monitor diamond production and the
prices paid.
According to the CSO, these valuers are fully informed about market
conditions and the prices received for Botswana stones.
Mr Geoffrey Leggett at IDC suggests, however, the valuer only ensures that
the assortment of diamonds from Botswana conforms to an agreed sample and
that the agreed contract price is paid. 'He is not a trader, he does not
know what the stones are worth in the market.'
De Beers insists it remains on cordial terms with Botswana and says the
country is still selling its diamonds through the CSO. It is not the first
time that contract negotiations have gone on past the theoretical deadline.
The Botswana government recently set up a diamond cutting centre with De
Beers' technical help, and this, too, should further the country's
understanding of the market.
There has been a special relationship between the CSO and Botswana since
1987 when the country sold its diamond stockpile to De Beers in exchange for
an estimated USDollars 250m and a 5.27 per cent shareholding in the South
African group.
Analysts suggest market conditions do not help Botswana press its case. De
Beers, which itself mines about 40 per cent of the world's annual rough
diamond output, markets stones from Angola, Australia, Namibia, Tanzania,
Zaire and the Soviet Union, as well as South Africa and Botswana.
Prices of rough diamonds, with few exceptions, have moved upwards every year
since the 1930s depression. But now De Beers is steering the world's most
successful cartel through depressed market conditions caused by the
recession in the US (the biggest single market for diamonds), sogginess in
Japan (the second-largest), and the Gulf war.
To maintain price stability, the CSO is stockpiling diamonds at great
expense, rather than releasing unwanted stones to the market. Its
promotional budget has been lifted by 20 per cent to more than Dollars 1m a
week - Dollars 53m for the year.
In addition, Botswana this year faces its first budgetary deficit since 1982
and, according to De Beers' calculations, one of its diamond mines  - Orapa
 -needs investment of USDollars 600m.
The CSO has also notched up some recent coups: bringing a big part of the
Soviet Union's and Angola's rough diamond output back into the cartel - or
what it calls its 'single channel marketing' - arrangements.
However, the CSO is also currently involved in contract negotiations with
Argyle Diamonds, the western Australian company which is the biggest
individual diamond producer in volume (but only sixth in value) terms.
Argyle, too, wants to stay with the CSO when its contract ends on May 1 -
but on more favourable terms.
A delegation from Botswana is to meet CSO representatives in London at the
end of this month for another attempt to break the deadlock. The industry is
betting that Botswana will give way, perhaps in return for De Beers helping
to finance the Orapa mine investment. However, the 'market window' idea is
unlikely to be dropped and will almost certainly be raised again when the
next contract negotiations start.

FARMERS are unlikely to be able to make money by diversifying into
production of materials for use in the energy, chemical and packaging
industries, according to a House of Lords select committee report out today.
The report says that though there is 'great promise' there are also many
technological difficulties. However, the major hurdle is the fact that
'agricultural feedstocks are not currently competitive with hydrocarbons and
other feedstocks. Without some convergence in prices, industry will not make
the investment necessary to enable new markets to be developed and
exploited.'
Non-Food Uses of Agricultural Products. Select Committee on the European
Communities. HMSO. Pounds 22.75.
The US Meat Export Federation estimates that it could sell between 30,000
and 50,000 tonnes of high quality beef a year to the EC if it were allowed
access to the market. But, said Mr Philip Seng, chief executive officer,
trying to get into the market was comparable to the myth of Sisyphus.
US beef imports to the EC are hampered by the ban on growth hormones and a
directive on the standard of slaughterhouses, as well as tariff and quota
regulations. 'Some US traders say Europe is more protectionist than the
Japanese market,' said Mr Seng, who is in London for the World Meat
Congress, which opens today.

FT  24 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil prices rise to nearly
Dollars 20 then fall back sharply
</HEADLINE>

   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OIL PRICES fell sharply yesterday after rising almost Dollars 1 a barrel
over the last two days in line with strong prices for gas oil in Europe and
gasoline in the US.
The price for North Sea Brent crude to be delivered in June slipped 0.2
cents to Dollars 19.425 a barrel yesterday after touching almost Dollars 20
a barrel at mid-session.
North Sea prices were depressed late yesterday by a weaker New York market
where the June futures contract slipped to Dollars 20.90 a barrel. 'There's
been a lot of technical buying over the last few weeks and as we go down
those people will be exiting the market, which will push it even lower,'
said Mr Andy Lebow at ED &amp; F. Man.
Gas oil prices have been boosted by the unseasonally cold weather in Europe
which has given a temporary fillip to demand, particularly from Germany. At
the same time, US petrol stocks have been run down to minimum operating
levels, giving rise to fears of shortages as the nation enters its peak
driving season in the next few weeks.
Imports of petrol to the US have been low as higher prices have sucked
deliveries into Europe. But cargoes are now arriving in the north-eastern US
again and are starting to relieve any tightness in the market with the
attendant depressing effect on prices.
North Sea Brent traders rushed to buy oil on Monday when Chevron announced
it would pull one of its cargoes from the May delivery programme in the
North Sea. The company will start maintenance work on the Ninian pipeline
next month.
But Mr Peter Gignoux at Lehman Brothers said, 'there is plenty of foreign
crude around and I think traders are beginning to realise this.'
Iranian tankers that were anchored off the Bay of Cadiz near Spain are
understood to have set sale, prompting traders to speculate that Iran is
beginning to sell its oil in floating storage.

Moody's
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
VENEZUELA'S foreign debt has been placed under review for a possible upgrade
by Moody's Investor Service, the US rating agency. Venezuela has outstanding
debt totalling around Dollars 1bn in the Euromarkets, according to the
agency.
The debt is denominated in D-Marks and yen, as well as dollars.
Moody's said the review was prompted by the Venezuelan government's efforts
to reduce macroeconomic imbalances and to liberalise the economy. The
government has also restructured its external finances with creditor banks,
Moody's noted.
The move marks a further step in the increasing acceptability of Latin
American borrowers in the Euromarkets. For example, Petroleos de Venezuela,
the Venezuelan oil company, raised DM200m last October.

FIVE Mexicans were accused yesterday by the US Securities and Exchange
Commission of profiting from inside information when buying shares in Anchor
Glass, an American glass company bought by Vitro of Mexico in 1989.
The five Mexicans include a former director of exports at Vitro, Mexico's
largest industrial company, and a prominent investor Mr Ernesto Tinajero.
According to the charges, the investors bought 150,000 shares of Anchor
Glass for USDollars 1.7m. After the Vitro bid for Anchor Glass was announced
the shares were sold netting the investors a profit of Dollars 1.2m.
Insider trading is widely believed to be prevalent in the Mexican bourse,
but Mexican authorities are much laxer than those in the US in enforcing
rules against it.
The Monterrey newspaper El Norte suggested that the Anchor Glass case should
be a lesson for Mexican regulators.

FT  24 APR 91 / Government Bonds: Treasuries firmer on drop in durable goods
orders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US GOVERNMENT bond prices firmed yesterday after a large decline in monthly
durable goods orders revived hopes of another interest rate cut.
In late afternoon trading, the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was up 5/16
at 95 5/8 , yielding 8.265 per cent. The two-year note was up 1/32 at 100
5/32 , to yield 7.016 per cent.
The morning news which sparked the gains was the 6.2 per cent fall in new
factor orders for durable goods in March, a decline well in advance of
market expectations.
The figures suggested that the economy remains depressed, and they add to
the pressure on the Federal Reserve for another cut in interest rates to get
the economy moving. However, at a Senate committee hearing yesterday, Mr
Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, hinted that recent inflation numbers did
not justify another rate cut.
His comments brought prices down from their highs, as did worries about the
effect on the market of the upcoming Treasury note auction.
NEWS that the Dutch state will launch its first 15-year bond boosted the
Dutch government bond market yesterday.
The new bond is due in June, 2006, has an 8.5 per cent coupon, and is not
callable. It will be sold through a series of tap sales starting on April
25.
Traders said there was strong demand among domestic pension funds and
insurers. Many switched out of 10-year Dutch government bonds to buy the new
15-year bond in the grey market as the longer maturity provides a better
match for their liabilities. The price of the new bond rose from 99.15 to
close at 99.8, yielding 8.52 per cent.
In Germany, bund prices edged up in what traders described as a technical
correction following Monday's fall. News that the Bundesbank left its
one-month security repurchase rate unchanged at 8.60 per cent also provided
some support for bunds, traders said.
The unchanged security repurchase rate was taken as a sign that the official
discount rate would not be raised. However, currency players interpreted
this as a lack of support for the D-Mark and wondered whether it would be
allowed to slide against the dollar or whether central bank intervention
would support it.
Several central banks intervened in the markets, selling dollars for D-Marks
yesterday.
IN London, gilts moved up in quiet trading ahead of today's auction for a
Pounds 1.2bn tranche of 10 per cent conversion stock due 1996. Bids are due
in the morning and traders expect most or all of the stock to be bought. The
spread of bids is expected to be rather tight given the probable strong
demand for the stock.
The existing stock is already trading at around 98.2 in the market, but the
auction stock has the advantage of being part-paid (investors need only pay
50 per cent of the price if their bids are accepted) with the rest of the
money due at the end of May.
JAPANESE government bond prices rose yesterday in quiet trading.
The market expects the auction today to be for another tranche of the No 140
bond which is due in December 2001 and has a 6.6 per cent coupon. Traders
expect about Y800bn of the stock to be auctioned but expressed concern over
the lack of appetite for new issues.
The yield on the benchmark No 129 opened in Tokyo at 6.735 per cent, moving
to 6.69 per cent, and trading in London at around 6.715 per cent.

<TEXT>
CRAY RESEARCH, the world's leading maker of supercomputers, yesterday turned
in first-quarter net income of Dollars 5.2m, or 20 cents a share, on
revenues of Dollars 143m, compared with net earnings of Dollars 9.5m, or 33
cents, on revenues of Dollars 135.9m a year earlier.
Mr John Rollwagen, chairman and chief executive, said the contract value of
orders signed in the first three months of 1991 fell to Dollars 67m from
Dollars 80m a year earlier. He attributed the decline to the limited
availability of new products and to the large number of orders signed in the
1990 first quarter.
The company's backlog at the end of the quarter was Dollars 315m, compared
with Dollars 300m a year earlier.
Mr Rollwagen said Cray's order backlog and prospect list 'continue to
indicate that we can meet our growth objectives for 1991. However, most of
our installation and order activity will occur in the second half of the
year.'

FT  24 APR 91 / International Company News: Pet food profits help 4% rise at
Quaker Oats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGHER pet food profits were a key contributor to Quaker Oats' 4 per cent
rise in earnings from continuing operations in the three months ended March
1991.
Earnings for the period, which is the Chicago-based food processor's third
fiscal quarter, rose to Dollars 63.1m, or 82 cents a share, from Dollars
60.4m, or 77 cents a share, a year earlier.
Net sales climbed to Dollars 1.33bn from Dollars 1.27bn.
Last year's third-quarter figures exclude a Dollars 34.8m loss suffered by
Fisher-Price, the toy maker which the group plans to spin off to
shareholders.
Quaker said yesterday that the deal is awaiting completion of an internal
audit required to transfer the business to a new corporation.
Nonetheless, it hopes to complete the spin-off by June 30.
Operating income dropped by 8 per cent, largely due to lower profits from
Brazil.
But this was more than offset by a near-halving in financing costs, due to
lower interest rates in Brazil.
Both North American and overseas operations were bolstered by strong sales
of pet food.
US sales were helped by a relaunch of a key dog food brand.
Mr William Smithburg, Quaker's chief executive, said he expects 'solid'
earnings growth in the current quarter and the largest percentage of
quarterly earnings for the year.

AN investment group controlled by Mr Suliman Olayan, the billionaire Saudi
financier, has increased its holding in Chase Manhattan Bank from about 4.2
per cent to about 5.2 per cent, writes Karen Zagor.
The Dollars 159m stake in Chase, the second biggest US commercial banking
group, is held by Crescent Diversified, a subsidiary of Mr Olayan's US
investment arm Olayan Group. The investment comes only two months after
Saudi Prince Alwaleed Bin Talel bought Dollars 590m of convertible stock in
Citicorp.
Unlike Prince Alwaleed, who had been a private customer of Citicorp for
about 10 years but only started buying Citicorp shares on the open market
last year, the Olayan Group has invested in Chase for many years.

in first quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A JUMP in Chevron's first-quarter refining and marketing income more than
offset a decline in US exploration and production, resulting in an 18 per
cent rise in net earnings for the San Francisco-based energy producer.
Earnings climbed to Dollars 557m, or Dollars 1.59 a share, from Dollars
473m, or Dollars 1.33, a year earlier. Revenues rose to Dollars 10.8bn from
Dollars 9.3bn.
Despite the sharp increase for the period as a whole, Mr Ken Derr, Chevron
chief executive, noted that earnings slid towards the end of the period as
crude oil prices settled at lower levels, US refining margins began to
erode, and prices and demand for natural gas moved down.
Refining and marketing income soared to Dollars 233m from Dollars 130m. This
year's profits would have been even higher without a Dollars 47m charge for
environmental provisions and asset write-offs.
Sales of natural gas in the US edged down to just under 3m cubic feet a day,
from 3.1mcf last year. Foreign gas output rose 8 per cent.
Income from chemicals dipped to Dollars 73m from Dollars 123m, but last
year's figure included a Dollars 59m gain from chemicals licensing
agreements. Operating earnings rose by 14 per cent.

DELTA, the third largest US airline, said yesterday that it was in
discussions with Pan Am, the smaller carrier which earlier this year filed
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, about 'potential asset acquisitions in
the airline business', writes Nikki Tait.
But, in contrast to recent speculation, Delta fell short of saying that it
was interested in a full merger of the two companies. It also emphasised
that no definitive agreement had yet been reached, and said that there was
no assurance that a deal would be struck.
However, it seems unlikely that Pan Am - which has been disposing of assets
for many years - would be willing to sell off its remaining business
piecemeal.
'We're not interested in selling parts of the company,' commented the New
York-based carrier yesterday, although it has previously said that its East
Coast Shuttle was up for sale.
There was further evidence of the turbulence which hit the airline sector
earlier this year when USAir Group, one of the middle-ranking US carriers,
revealed a Dollars 168.7m after-tax loss in the first three months. This
compared with a Dollars 38m loss in the same period of 1990. Revenues stood
at Dollars 1.58bn (Dollars 1.54bn), while the passenger load factor fell to
54.1 per cent (57.2 per cent).

The company said its US sales had benefited from special marketing and

Outside the US, sales continued to show strong growth.

FT  24 APR 91 / International Company News: Whirlpool sees earnings down
17.2%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROBLEMS in its difficult home market left Whirlpool, the world's largest
maker of home appliances, reporting a 17.2 per cent fall in first-quarter
earnings at Dollars 24m after tax, against Dollars 29m in 1990.
Sales fell marginally, to Dollars 1.62bn from Dollars 1.64bn last year.
Whirlpool said part of the decline reflected continuing difficulties with
its Brazilian affiliates. The Michigan - based company took in a net loss of
Dollars 17m from its equity interest here, and said operations were hampered
by a price freeze on many consumer durable items.
It added that, if the effect of the Brazilian business were excluded,
underlying earnings were down by 15 per cent from the first quarter of 1990.
Whirlpool distinguished between its European operations, which fared well
during the quarter, and the domestic position. On the former, it said sales
and earnings from its joint venture with Philips, the Dutch electrical
group, improved from the previous year, helped by volume growth and
favourable currency translation.
In the US, Whirlpool conceded that shipments declined - although it said its
own decline was less than the industry average , which showed a 16 per cent
fall.
Mr David Whitman, chairman, said he expected a 'gradual recovery' in this
area.

offer

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GROUPE SCHNEIDER, the French electrical products maker, revealed yesterday
it was willing to increase its offer for Square D, of Illinois, if a merger
along the lines it has proposed can be agreed promptly.
But, according to a trade paper report, Square D is seeking finance for a
leveraged recapitalisation.
In a letter to Mr Jerre Stead, Square D chairman, Mr Didier
Pineau-Valencienne, Schneider's chairman, urged the Square D board not to
enter into any commitment or course of action that would deny Schneider the
chance to negotiate its proposal 'on an equal basis'.
Square D has spurned a Schneider offer made last February of Dollars 78 per
share, or Dollars 1.9bn, which it considers inadequate. The offer has,
however, lead to Square D's shareholders tendering 78 per cent of the
company's shares.
In a March filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Square D said
it would pursue the possibilities of a leveraged buyout or reorganisation,
as well as finding another partner for a merger or alliance.
According to a report yesterday in the daily trade paper, The American
Banker, the US company recently asked seven US banks to consider providing
more than Dollars 1bn in financing for a leveraged recapitalisation.
The deal would be the largest leveraged recapitalisation in more than a
year.
A recapitalisation could be used to declare a special dividend which would
serve as compensation for not selling to Schneider. The price of Square D's
shares have appreciated some 50 per cent since the Schneider offer.
Although a large percentage of shares has been tendered, their purchase by
Schneider cannot be completed until the Square D board agrees to two
conditions: first, that it lift its legal obligation requiring a hostile
takeover bidder to acquire 85 per cent of the shares; and, second, that it
remove a poison pill provision from company by-laws. The board has so far
refused to do so.

STRONG markets, especially for central office switching equipment, and
inclusion of Britain's STC's results brought record profit, revenues and
orders for Northern Telecom in the first quarter.
Northern, controlled by BCE, the Montreal telecommunications holding
company, reported earnings of USDollars 88.1m, or 36 cents a share, up 20
per cent from USDollars 73.5m, or 30 cents, a year earlier, on revenues of
USDollars 1.85bn against USDollars 1.57bn.
Mr Paul Stern, chairman, said that, despite the recession, world political
and economic uncertainties and tough competition, demand was good for
virtually all Northern's products. STC and Northern have been integrated 'to
support our strategy of growth through globalisation.'
Overall expenses were up slightly to 19.8 per cent of sales, but this ratio
should improve later in the year. Total research spending was USDollars
207m, against USDollars 176m, or 11 per cent of total revenues, about
unchanged.

first quarter
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE WIDE refining margins prevalent throughout the oil industry lifted
Texaco's earnings by 26 per cent in the first quarter.
Thanks to a doubling in operating profits from refining and marketing,
earnings of the US's third biggest integrated oil company rose to Dollars
415m, or Dollars 1.51 a share, from Dollars 328m, or Dollars 1.15, a year
earlier. Revenues rose to Dollars 10.2bn from Dollars 9.2bn.
But operating earnings from exploration and production fell to Dollars 282m
from Dollars 317m. The company ascribed the drop to maintenance of UK
facilities, lower heavy crude prices in the US, and the impact of the mild
North American winter on natural gas volumes and prices.
These negative factors were only partly offset by higher crude output in
Indonesia and production from a new field in China.
First-quarter capital spending jumped by a third to Dollars 791m, due
largely to expanded exploration and production activity in the US and the
North Sea.
Phillips Petroleum suffered a sharp drop in first-quarter earnings due
largely to several non-recurring and non-operational items. Net earnings
fell to Dollars 160m, or 62 cents a share, from Dollars 259m, or Dollars
1.06, a year earlier.
Without these items, which include a Dollars 70m gain from asset sales this
year and special gains last year of Dollars 148m, earnings would have risen
to Dollars 149m from Dollars 107m. Revenues rose to Dollars 3.5bn from
Dollars 3.1bn.

<TEXT>
NCR, the Ohio-based computer company which has been fighting the bid
advances of AT&amp;T for the past five months, yesterday modified its lingering
opposition to AT&amp;T's revised all-share offer proposal.
In a letter to his counterpart at AT&amp;T, Mr Charles Exley, NCR's chairman,
said that he would be willing to recommend the offer if AT&amp;T was prepared to
ensure that it was worth Dollars 110 per NCR share while the AT&amp;T share
price stayed at, or above, Dollars 32.50.
The target company claimed yesterday that it was adjusting its position in
attempt to be 'flexible'. Its earlier stance had worried some investors - in
particular, the arbitrage community - who felt that its demands were
'onerous'. There was no immediate response from AT&amp;T.
AT&amp;T commenced the bidding for NCR five months ago with a Dollars 90-a-share
cash offer, while NCR said that it was looking for Dollars 125 a share.
However, NCR subsequently dropped this request to Dollars 110 a share, and
at the weekend AT&amp;T said it would meet this figure, but switched from cash
terms to a paper consideration.
Mr Exley then said that he was concerned about a fall in the AT&amp;T share
price between now and the stage at which the offer closed.

<TEXT>
HOLMES Protection, the New York-based security company which has missed
several payments on a Dollars 61m (Pounds 36m) loan note, hopes to hear
within days whether a crucial asset sale has received backing from bankers.
Mr John Flack, joint chief executive, said Alert Centre should inform Holmes
within a few days if it has secured financing to buy the New Jersey security
business for Dollars 18m.
The proceeds of this sale would go some way to placating institutions which
were due a total Dollars 24.6m loan repayment in January and March.
Mr Flack was speaking in London, where the company is quoted, after
reporting pre-tax profits of Dollars 4.02m for 1990, including a Dollars
5.05m profit on the sale of assets that was taken above the line, compared
to a loss of Dollars 20.31m in 1989.
Auditors have classified the Dollars 61m debt as a current obligation and
have qualified the accounts subject to the company's ability to continue as
a going concern. Earnings rose to 5 cents (losses of 30 cents) per share.
The dividend is passed.
Turnover fell to Dollars 68.70m (Dollars 76.05m) and interest charges jumped
to Dollars 7.29m (Dollars 5.84m).

FT  24 APR 91 / Kleinwort Benson in Dollars 23m write-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KLEINWORT Benson, the London merchant banking group, has had to write off
loans totalling Dollars 23m (Pounds 13.6m) to a US development capital
company founded by a former director.
The loss was disclosed in the group's latest annual report released
yesterday.
The loans were made to companies linked to Mr Kenneth McCormick, an American
banker who was hired by Kleinwort Benson in the mid-1980s to set up and run
a swaps business in Los Angeles called Kleinwort Benson Cross Financing
(KBCF). Mr McCormick became a director both of KBCF and Kleinwort Benson
Ltd, the merchant banking arm of the group.
According to the annual report, the Kleinwort group made a series of loans
beginning in 1987 to Ojai Capital, a partnership founded by Mr McCormick, to
finance start-ups and property investments in California. Loans were also
made to Kenneth McCormick &amp; Co, a company set up by Mr McCormick to provide
management services to KBCF.
The loans amounted to Dollars 15m by the end of 1989. Last year further
loans, plus unpaid interest and unreimbursed expenses amounted to an
additional Dollars 5.81m. In May KBCF advanced Mr McCormick's company a
further Dollars 1.92m.
But later last year Kleinwort decided that Ojai Capital was not financially
viable, and it decided to sever its connections with Mr McCormick's
companies. It made a full provision against the Dollars 22.73m owed by them.
It also terminated its operating agreement with Kenneth McCormick &amp; Co,
incurring in the process a Dollars 2.4m payment.
As part of a settlement agreement, Kleinwort has waived all claims against
McCormick and Ojai, and was itself also released from any claims from Mr
McCormick and his business interests. Mr McCormick resigned his Kleinwort
directorships in February.
He was not immediately available for comment last night.
The loss comes at a difficult time for Kleinwort. The group recently
reported an overall loss of Pounds 68m before tax for 1990, largely because
of a Pounds 34m loss on a misjudged block trade in Premier Oil shares.

FT  24 APR 91 / Time runs out for trading in the pit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and JIM MCCALLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PIT trading of equity options is to be abolished in favour of a screen-based
system, under recommendations to be sent to members of the London Traded
Options Market and the London International Financial Futures Exchange
today.
Officials said the merger of LTOM and Liffe was still planned before the end
of the year.
But certain issues, such as trading procedures at the new exchange, will
have to be re-examined if members agree to the proposal.
Only index-linked options - the FT-SE 100 contract and the FT-SE Eurotrack
100 contract due to be launched in June - will still be traded under the
open-outcry system.
Job losses among the 40 or so firms which trade on LTOM are expected, at
least in the short term. A senior dealer said the reaction among traders
when word of the proposals filtered into the market was one of shock. 'It's
all happening too quickly,' he said with many dealers worrying that they
could soon become redundant.
The change is intended to tackle chronically low volume in the stock options
market. In the US, the volume of equity derivatives is equivalent to 140 per
cent of the underlying stock market, compared with just 20 per cent in
London.
Unreliable price quotations deter retail investors, while dealers dislike
the lack of anonymity which often means revealing their trading in the stock
market.
'The only practical way we can see to achieve anonymity is through a fully
automated trading system,' said Mr Michael Jenkins, chief executive of
Liffe.
Liffe and LTOM are proposing a move to 'a fully automated market which, in
addition to allowing anonymity, would also incorporate automated quotation
mechanisms for all market-makers, small-order automated execution and a
facility for negotiating block trades'.
But some of the large institutions, which account for most of the business
in the options market, were uncertain whether a screen-based system would
increase turnover.
Despite such reservations, changes which will promote a successful merger
will be welcomed by the Bank of England.
Having initially played the role of marriage broker, the Bank is keen to see
the union consumated and is unlikely to be concerned by the relegation of
share options to a trading screen.

FT  24 APR 91 / BNE proprietor forecasts annual profit of Dollars 150m
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FLEET/NORSTAR Financial Group, the new proprietor of the bankrupt Bank of
New England, is forecasting that BNE will generate annual earnings from
operations of about Dollars 150m-Dollars 200m between 1993 and 1995.
The prediction comes less than four months after BNE was declared insolvent
and seized by federal regulators in one of the biggest bank failures in US
history.
Fleet, the Rhode Island-based bank, tempered yesterday's optimism with the
warning that it expects BNE to post a loss of Dollars 10m-Dollars 15m in the
first six months after the acquisition and to break even for the first 12
months.
Fleet, in partnership with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the New York buy-out
investment boutique which is one of the most powerful takeover players in
the US, was awarded BNE's assets on Monday.
Fleet will pay the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Dollars 125m
as a premium, made up of Dollars 100m in preferred stock and Dollars 25m in
cash. It will also inject Dollars 500m capital into the failed bank.
In exchange, Fleet will take control of three BNE 'bridge banks', with
combined assets of about Dollars 15bn.
To finance the deal, Fleet will raise Dollars 683m of new capital, including
Dollars 283m from investors advised by KKR.
The FDIC said Fleet's offer was the least costly to the federal bank
insurance fund. However, the FDIC will absorb most of the risk associated
with the commercial property loan losses which drove BNE into liquidation.
The FDIC will assume about Dollars 5.5bn of BNE's problem assets.
Fleet will also be able to turn any additional problem assets over to the
FDIC with minimal penalties until 1994.
Mr William Seidman, chairman of the FDIC, yesterday said the agency plans to
borrow between Dollars 5bn and Dollars 5.5bn from the US Treasury's Federal
Financing Bank (FFB) as a result of resolving the BNE collapse.
This is the first time that the FDIC has taken advantage of changes last
year authorising it to borrow working capital from the FFB. Mr Seidman said
about Dollars 3bn will be repaid from the sale of assets and about Dollars
2bn will be losses.
The FDIC has taken great pains to stress KKR's distance from the deal. It
described KKR's involvement as 'a passive investor'. But this one of the
first times that a group which is not a bank has been allowed to make a
significant capital infusion into a leading US bank.
Under the terms of the Fleet deal, KKR investors will buy Dollars 283m of
dual convertible preferred stock. This will be convertible into 16.03m
common shares of Fleet/Norstar at Dollars 17.65 a share in no less than
three years. In addition, KKR has warrants to buy 6.5m Fleet common shares.
On a fully-diluted basis after Fleet's common offering, KKR's investors will
have about 16 per cent of Fleet's non-voting stock.
KKR said the firm was attracted to the BNE bid by the strength of
Fleet/Norstar's management. Fleet, which was founded 200 years ago and has
assets of Dollars 32.6bn excluding BNE, is considered one of the best-run
New England banks. The BNE acquisition will transform it into the region's
biggest player.

FT  24 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Cannon Street
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Market reaction to the Pounds 49m cash call from Cannon Street Investments
suggests the fashion for rights issues is getting out of hand. Cannon Street
is a deeply unsuccessful little conglomerate whose net assets have fallen by
60 per cent in the past two years and whose earnings per share fell 29 per
cent last year. Since 1986 it has raised Pounds 100m through share issues -
yesterday's not included - and has spent Pounds 130m on acquisitions. In the
past year, its borrowings have shot up from Pounds 29m to Pounds 107m. The
net result by yesterday morning was a market value of just Pounds 80m. Then
came the call, and the shares rose 17 per cent.
Part of the reason may be that some of the new paper has been conditionally
placed with the group's banker, Bank of Scotland. Should the issue flop, the
result will therefore be a partial swap of debt for equity. Cannon Street
and its chairman have been here before, when its collapse in the 1974
secondary banking crisis led to it being owned for a while by its then
banker, NatWest. But the banks' problems are their own affair. There seems
no reason for the equity market to throw good money after bad.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The depressing thing about the latest news from Kleinwort Benson is the
insight it gives into the board's thinking. When the bank announced its
dreadful results last month, one extra item would not have greatly altered
their reception. But it chose to wait until the report and accounts to
disclose the embarrassing write-off of Dollars 23m of loans to an obscure US
partnership controlled by one of its directors. Perhaps more embarrassingly
again, it had to pay a further Dollars 2.4m to the partnership when the loan
agreement was terminated.
The really damning thing from the commercial banking point of view is that
that the failed company invested in such areas as Californian real estate.
Money was still being advanced last year when the US property market was in
full retreat. Shareholders might also usefully raise the question of why
Kleinwort signed a severance agreement forbidding it to sue for redress.

FT  24 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Tarmac
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tarmac's share price ebbs and flows these days with hopes for the great
recovery. It is therefore not surprising that the market took fright
yesterday at the board's unexpectedly gloomy observations for the current
year, even if a 6 per cent fall to 229p looked a needlessly savage reaction.
However the numbers are added up, it is hard to see this year's dividend not
being fully covered; and when the tide finally turns Tarmac is bound to be a
major beneficiary.
The big worry at the moment is the performance of Tarmac America, which is
making a pitiful 4 per cent return on Dollars 1bn of capital employed. The
division managed just Pounds 5m of operating profits in the second half. The
deterioration in Florida and Virginia should have come as little surprise,
but one wonders whether the company should grasp the opportunity to shrink
the size of its US operation. Taking Pounds 100m of working capital out of
UK housing, by contrast, looks a little odd at such a low point in the
cycle, though the company insists it is not retreating from the business.
The trouble could be reaching the desired volume of 11,000 homes this year
without again resorting to discounts. Investors who have chased the shares
of the housebuilding contractors this year will no doubt take note.

<TEXT>
There have been opportunistic rights issues aplenty this year, but Taylor
Woodrow's takes the biscuit. The company has presumably looked on in
wonderment as the market lapped up paper from less worthy competitors,
understandably concluding that it would be silly to miss out on the market's
appetite. No less than Pounds 1bn has been raised by housebuilders, property
companies and building material suppliers since early January. It cannot be
long before the market begins to tire of it.
It may be, of course, that Taylor Woodrow is right in claiming that there
are excellent opportunities to be snapped up in commercial property and
housing. But if the bottom has been reached, shareholders are entitled to
ask why their investment is not being geared up with borrowed money. The
balance sheet may be a little less comfortable than at the end of last year,
but it is hardly strained.
The group can at least point to the fact that it has read the property
market shrewdly in the past couple of years. It went into the downturn with
most of its property let and - unlike several rivals - with little
development in progress. But shareholders who take up this issue will need
patience.

FT  24 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Beazer beats the retreat
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,503.8 (+13.0)
The planned break-up of Beazer suggests that yet another grandiose folly of
the late 1980s is about to be disentangled the hard way. Shareholders are to
be offered shares in the original UK business, thereby being asked to pay
for their old company all over again. The rest - the grand global strategy
erected on the UK base - is implicitly worthless. Or perhaps not quite: if,
as Beazer suggests, the original business is worth Pounds 500m, the group's
present market capitalisation of Pounds 525m values the rest, including the
Dollars 1.7bn Koppers acquisition, at just Pounds 25m.
After the split, the old shares will consist of a half entitlement to the UK
business and a punt on Koppers' future. Since US ownership of Beazer is now
some 50 per cent and rising, it can be assumed that the company represented
by the old shares will end up US-owned and probably US-domiciled. The new
company will doubtless be UK-owned and eventually floated in its entirety.
Until more details are known, the whole can scarcely be valued. Much will
depend on whether the UK company will be independently run, rather than
subject to fresh empire-building by the old management. Even more will
depend on whether the flotation itself goes smoothly. The cash target of
Pounds 250m is ambitious, but may be essential in the context of net debt
still close to Pounds 800m. The snag is that the way things are going, by
the third quarter of the year new equity in UK construction companies could
be something of a glut on the market.

FT  24 APR 91 / Gorbachev faces test at party plenum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOVIET President Mikhail Gorbachev yesterday met Mr Boris Yeltsin, the
Russian leader, for the first time since Mr Yeltsin announced his intention
to run for the presidency of Russia.
The meeting, at the end of two weeks in which both have been urged to
discuss forming a coalition government, came on the eve of what promises to
be the most severe test Mr Gorbachev has faced from within his Communist
party.
A plenum of the ruling central committee gathers in Moscow this afternoon
angry and despondent at Mr Gorbachev's handling of the economy. This mood
may prompt calls for his resignation from his party post as general
secretary.
Yesterday's meeting, on the outskirts of Moscow, was held under the
framework of the Federation Council and brought together leaders of the nine
Soviet republics prepared to discuss a union treaty.
Mr Yeltsin has in the past routinely delegated attendance at meetings of the
Federation Council to his senior deputy, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov.
His attendance, and the location of the meeting on neutral territory away
from the Kremlin, suggests an effort will be made to rebuild a bridge
between the two most powerful figures in a rapidly declining country.
An aide to the president said the subject of round-table talks as a prelude
to a coalition government would be mooted between the two leaders.
Deputies in the Supreme Soviet endorsed the anti-crisis programme introduced
in the on Monday by Mr Valentin Pavlov, the prime minister.
Their vote, by an overwhelming 323 to 13, followed a speech by Mr Pavlov in
which he called for a 'state of emergency' covering banks, tax collection,
transport and power supply.
He also revealed that a presidential decree had been prepared to index
incomes to a basket of commodities.
However, most economists - including those working on the programme -
believe it will fail unless agreement is reached between the main political
forces, and crucially the leaderships of the republics, on its shape and
implementation.
Workers in Minsk, the capital of Belorussia, left work again yesterday and
demonstrated in the city centre after the breakdown of talks with the
republican authorities which had temporarily ended a previous round of
strikes in the capital and elsewhere.
Elsewhere, the strike wave in the pits and other plants appeared to be
contracting.

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THOUSANDS of Names at Lloyd's
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the wealthy individuals who back underwriting at the London insurance market
 -are to be asked to provide about Pounds 100m in fresh funds to cover
asbestosis and pollution claims in the US.
Willis Faber &amp; Dumas (Agencies) is one of several members' agencies sending
letters to more than 3,000 Names on marine syndicates 406 and 448, advising
them of a sharp upward revision in estimated underwriting losses for the
1988 underwriting year.
Names on the two syndicates, two of the biggest in the Lloyd's market, could
face bills for at least Pounds 25,000 each.
There is growing concern in the market in particular about the impact of
claims arising from pollution in the US, to which a large number of the
market's syndicates could be exposed.
Lloyd's has been hit by a series of claims arising from long-tail US
liability business, in which claims can emerge many years after the policies
were originally written.
Hitherto most losses on US liability business have stemmed from asbestosis.
Now, however, the market is having to pay out for a growing number of
pollution cases, mainly reflecting the costs of cleaning up toxic waste on
the orders of the US government.
Mr John Rew, co-author of Chatset's Lloyd's League Tables, a market guide,
said yesterday: 'For a long time we've been warning about the dangers of US
long-tail liabilities. It's a treadmill for the Names.'
Mr Rew said that Chatset had revised its estimates of Lloyd's result for the
1988 year (to be published in July 1991) to an overall loss.
In the Willis letter, Mr James Sinclair, managing director of the agency,
said Willis had been 'shocked to learn' that the Wellington Underwriting
Agency, which manages syndicates 406 and 448, had revised their 'estimated
loss on both syndicates.'
A total of 3,022 Names on syndicate 406 will be asked to meet a cash call of
about Pounds 70m following losses recorded in the 1988 underwriting year.
3,808 Names on syndicate 448 will be asked to meet a loss of about Pounds
35m. Some members may be on both syndicates.
In February, Mr Sinclair had forecast losses of a little over half these
amounts.
Mr John Prentice, chairman of Wellington, said loss estimates had been
revised upwards following an acceleration of claims in the last few months
but the figures still had to be 'finalised.'
Although both syndicates 406 and 448 specialise in marine business, both
devote between 20 and 25 per cent of their underwriting capacity to
non-marine liability insurance.
Mr Sinclair said in his letter that 'these revised amounts do not reflect
any of the estimates we have been told by Wellington to date and there are a
significant number of questions we think will be needed to justify the
calculation.'
Willis Faber, now part of the international broker Willis Corroon, owned the
Wellington agency before divesting it under the terms of the 1982 Lloyd's
Act.

FT  24 APR 91 / Trade gap may be start of recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S current account deficit widened last month, a sign that the
country's battered economy may soon begin a recovery.
The increase in the deficit, from Pounds 227m in February to Pounds 432m in
March, was announced yesterday by the Central Statistical Office. It was
caused largely by a 3 per cent increase in imports between February and
March, indicating renewed economic activity by Britain's consumers and
industrial groups.
Political opponents of the government seized on the increase in imports, to
Pounds 9.4bn last month, as signalling a structural weakness in the economy,
which may lead to a rapid growth in the import bill once demand improves.
According to this argument, Britain suffers from a lack of ability to meet
home demand by increasing domestic output rather than by buying goods from
overseas.
Mr Alex Carlile, the Liberal Democrats' trade and industry spokesman, said:
'After 12 years of Conservative economic policy, the fact that we still
cannot export more than we import ought to be worrying the government.' The
Labour party said the higher imports were linked to a weakening in Britain's
industrial capacity.
Last year, Britain cut its current account deficit to Pounds 12.8bn, from
Pounds 19.9bn in 1989, as the recession scaled back demand for overseas
goods. However, the pace of the improvement is clearly slowing.
The measure favoured by government statisticians as showing the underlying
trend - the value of visible trade, not counting oil and erratic items such
as aircraft, ships and gems - barely altered last month.
The deficit on this basis was Pounds 1.1bn in March, the same as in
February, and is the smallest number for four years. The comparable figure
in January was Pounds 1.2bn.
In terms of quarter-on-quarter statistics, the underlying deficit declined
by 7 per cent during the first three months of this year, compared to the
fourth quarter of 1990. Between the third and fourth quarters of 1990 the
fall was 22 per cent.
Mr Peter Spencer, chief UK economist at Shearson Lehman, a US-owned
investment house, said the trade figures were 'very disappointing, given the
weakness in the economy'.

FT  24 APR 91 / Lockheed wins Dollars 65bn fighter project: Consortium
secures first part of record Pentagon deal for new stealth aircraft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE and KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A CONSORTIUM led by Lockheed yesterday won the contract for the next
generation of US stealth fighter aircraft, expected to be worth Dollars 65bn
(Pounds 38bn) over the next two decades - the biggest-ever aerospace
contract.
The Dollars 12.1bn first part of the contract, awarded by the Pentagon, is
for the development of the aircraft, of which 650 are planned to be built.
It was won in the face of fierce competition from a consortium led by
Northrop.
Lockheed's partners in the consortium for the advanced tactical fighter
(ATF), are Boeing and General Dynamics. Pratt &amp; Whitney, part of United
Technologies Corporation, will build the aircraft's engines.
Yesterday's announcement was a severe blow to Northrop and its partner
McDonnell Douglas, the largest defence contractor in the US. The two
companies had spent about Dollars 1bn and more than four years trying to
secure the contract.
McDonnell responded to the announcement by saying it would cut its workforce
by 500 by the end of the year. Northrop said it expected to shed 200 to 400
jobs soon.
Analysts believe the project may determine the future shape of the US
aerospace industry. It will consolidate Boeing and Lockheed's strong
position and is likely to boost the two companies' earnings.
Mr Gary Reich, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers, has increased his
1992 earnings estimate for Lockheed by 25 cents a share to Dollars 5.40,
saying the contract should add 55 cents a share to net earnings in 1993.
Last night Mr Jerry King, Boeing executive vice-president, said the contract
would not result in significant earnings until the mid-1990s. Pratt &amp;
Whitney also cautioned that the contract would have no impact on its
production operations until the late 1990s.
General Dynamics estimated that its share of the revenues would total
Dollars 20bn over the programme's term.
The aircraft is to be a faster version of the F-15 Eagle fighters, and will
be capable of evading enemy radar.
Mr Donald Rice, the US air force secretary, said Lockheed and Boeing had
submitted the lowest bid. 'The ATF will balance stealth, supercruise and
advanced avionics in a highly manoeuvreable fighter that will ensure that
our pilots get first look and first kill,' said Mr Rice.
It would ensure American air superiority well into the next century, he
added.
The Pentagon's decision was the second blow this year for McDonnell Douglas,
which had to take a large write-off against fourth-quarter earnings after
the Pentagon decided in January to cancel its A-12 stealth attack aircraft
contract, a potential Dollars 50bn programme.
McDonnell Douglas has already started to wean itself of its dependence on
the Pentagon and has started to focus more on its commercial aircraft
operations.

FT  24 APR 91 / Prescription for a financial ailment: Market-based capital
requirements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL J COLLINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imagine gears clashing, the engine sputtering and the car stalling. That is
the picture some observers paint of the credit crunch and its impact on the
US economy. 'Get credit flowing again,' would seem the remedy. If bank
capital requirements stand in the way, reduce them, so that banks can lend
again.
Such a prescription makes no sense. It is the wrong response to the wrong
issue. Less capital is not better. Nor is more capital. What is needed is a
franchise that will improve banks' ability to attract capital and capital
requirements that are market-based.
The so-called credit crunch is no reason to reduce bank capital
requirements. Borrowers with the same prospective cash flows and financial
ratios as a year ago are getting credit, either from banks or in the capital
markets. For them there is no credit crunch.
The problem is that borrowers by and large do not have the same financial
ratios as they did a year ago. The recession has reduced their cash flows.
Consequently, the risk of lending has increased. Companies rated A a year
ago and B today are finding it difficult to obtain the same amount of credit
at the same rate as they did a year ago. This may be a 'credit crunch', but,
if so, it is more a symptom than a cause of the recession. To imply that
banks should be supplying credit to such borrowers as if nothing had changed
is in effect a recommendation that banks should be less prudent. That is
unlikely to do either the economy or the banking system any good.
The remedy for recession lies elsewhere. Political uncertainty contributed
to the downturn; its removal via the swift victory in the Gulf will
contribute to the upturn. Further stimulus has come through monetary and
fiscal policy. Most forecasters now expect the recession to end sometime
this year. This should spell the end of the credit crunch.
To perform their function as financial intermediaries banks need a franchise
that will attract capital. Such a franchise would allow banks to branch
freely and to offer customers a full range of financial services, including
securities and insurance as well as deposit-taking and lending. This allows
banks to diversify their sources of income, to make more efficient use of
their distribution systems and to realise economies of scale. The EC has
given its banks such a franchise through the Second Banking Directive. The
US and Japan are lagging behind, although adoption of the recent US Treasury
proposal would help close that gap.
The purpose of bank capital requirements is to limit the risk that a bank
will fail. To do so efficiently such requirements should be market-based.
This means putting investors in debt of banks (and of companies, such as
Citicorp, that own banks) at risk so that they will exercise market
discipline over the bank, and it means relating required capital ratios to
the market risks a bank assumes.
If investors in a company's debt believe that they are at risk when the
organisation becomes illiquid or insolvent, they will effectively control
the level of capital that the organisation must maintain. As the perceived
level of risk increases, such investors generally (and quickly) reduce the
amount of funds that they are willing to provide and/or demand an increase
in the rate of return. To counteract this the company must take steps to
improve its equity ratios.
Citicorp's own experience is a case in point. During the past year investors
and rating agencies perceived that the risk of Citicorp paper had increased.
As a result, Citicorp had to pay higher rates for certain types of funding
and it encountered some difficulty in placing as much paper as it would have
liked. We responded by initiating a programme to increase our total capital
by Dollars 4bn to Dollars 5bn over the next three years. The first tranche
of the capital increase has come through the issuance of Dollars 1.25bn in
convertible preferred stock. A second tranche will come through the sale of
non-strategic businesses. The rest should come through retained earnings; to
this end we aim to pare costs by Dollars 1.5bn a year while retaining our
revenue momentum. With tight control over asset growth, this
capital-building programme will improve Citicorp's capital ratios.
In designing capital regulation, policymakers should preserve such market
discipline. This entails limiting the guarantees that the government
provides to depositors or creditors of banks and companies that own banks.
Fortunately, both the US and the EC seem ready to do so. The US is
discussing ways to limit insurance of bank deposits, and the EC seems
determined to keep coverage low.
However, limiting guarantees is only the first step. Capital requirements
should be imposed on the bank (but not on companies that own banks) and
these requirements should be related to the bank's exposure to market risks,
such as interest rate risk, exchange rate risk and credit risk. The bank's
exposure to each risk is its net position (after due allowance for netting,
hedging and diversification) times the likely movement in the risk factor,
such as the level of interest rates. The bank's overall capital requirement
would be the sum of the requirements for each risk, minus an allowance for
the fact that some risks (such as interest and exchange rate risk) may
themselves be negatively correlated.
Elements of this market-based approach are present in the EC's proposed
Capital Adequacy Directive (CAD). This directive would apply to non-bank
investment firms and to the trading book of banks. For the bank's trading
book, the CAD would replace the 8 per cent Basle ratio with separate
requirements for credit risk, interest rate risk and exchange rate risk. The
CAD holds the promise of establishing a capital regime that will protect
both bank and non-bank investment firms while creating a level playing field
on which the two would compete.
In sum, the credit crunch will pass. Bank regulators need not act. But they
must act to give banks a franchise that will attract capital. And they must
act to make capital requirements market-based.

FT  24 APR 91 / East Europe should learn from Asia: From central planning to
a market economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By S STANLEY KATZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
East European countries engaged in the heroic change-over from
centrally-planned to market-driven economic systems have been getting most
of their advice from the west. They would do well to look to Asia as well.
Advice to eastern Europe from western experts largely follows classical
economic lines: free prices, remove subsidies, open your economies to
international trade, make your currencies freely convertible, privatise the
state-owned companies, invite foreign investment, close inefficient plants
and retire redundant workers. This, the experts acknowledge, will involve
some costs - higher prices, unemployment, lost income, and more foreign debt
and servicing. But these are short-term and will be more than offset by the
longer-term benefits that accrue from free markets. They urge, therefore,
that their recommended reform package be adopted quickly and in full, while
supporters of economic change still hold the high ground.
Initially, east Europe's economic reformers assumed that advice about
markets from advisers schooled in market economies could not be wrong. More
recently, however, the first rush of enthusiasm for a cold-turkey approach
to reform is fading. Euphoria over economic emancipation is giving way to a
more hard-headed assessment of the people and institutional deficits that
will have to be cleared before eastern Europe's economies can survive - much
less compete - in a free-market world.
The deficits are formidable: most of the basic skills and institutions
needed to make a system work - double-entry book-keeping, personal property
rights and a commercial banking system, to name a few - do not exist.
Industrial equipment and technology are, by western standards, obsolete. Few
companies can estimate their net worth or unit production costs, or judge
what they could produce competitively - information all serious foreign
investors would insist on. Arching over these deficits are the problems of
severe environmental degradation, long-neglected infrastructure and the
virtual disappearance of the region's pre-war ethic.
Increased awareness of their economies' internal weaknesses, together with
doubts about continued public support for a reform process that involves
hardships of unknown magnitude and unpredictable duration, are raising
second thoughts among eastern Europe's leaders about the wisdom of exposing
their still-fragile democracies to what amounts to an economic free-fall.
Other factors have surfaced as well that reinforce the need for a second
look. The recent rout of agricultural subsidies by the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade and the continuing row between the US and Japan over
market access, for example, suggest that the free-market approach
recommended for eastern Europe is honoured as much in the breach as in the
observance by the market-oriented countries of the west.
A further discovery is that the path to the market being urged on east
European countries is substantially different to that taken by countries
that have most recently successfully navigated the course from economic
backwardness to world-class competitors. These, of course, are Asia's Newly
Industrialised Countries (NICs): Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore.
Many cultural, political and social differences separate east Europe from
east Asia, and comparisons should not be pushed too far. But in terms of how
to go about transforming a backward economy into an efficient, competitive
one, there is much common ground and many lessons to be shared. A few
examples of the differences in the approach recommended to eastern Europe
and the way that NICs, and earlier, Japan, went about the work of economic
reform and restructuring are perhaps instructive:
Industrial strategy and support: Neither Asia's NICs nor Japan entrusted to
the market, or to foreign investors, responsibility for deciding which of
their industries would prosper and which would fail. On the contrary, they
formulated industrial strategies based on forecasts of market developments
and assessments of which of their 'neo-infant industries' could be expected
to carve out a competitive niche in world markets and which could not. For
the first group, they provided protection from import competition as well as
export incentives, tax relief and other financial help to bolster their
growth and competitiveness.
To ensure that the beneficiary industries would not become
protection-dependent and would become internationally competitive over time,
fiscal support was provided on a declining scale. At the same time,
companies in uncompetitive or declining industries were helped to diversify
or phase out, and workers retrained.
Eastern Europe, after 40 years of disastrous economic planning,
understandably eschews all forms of central planning, including Asia's
market-directed, indicative type. The same attitudes carry over to the
question of transitional help for industries trying to adapt to market
forces. While these attitudes are consistent with a free-market philosophy,
Asia's less doctrinaire approach might save some east European companies
that with reasonable transitional support could adjust to a market
environment, but without it would likely go under - taking jobs and income
with them.
Exchange rates: Asian countries have used exchange rates as an important
tool of economic policy. As typified by Korea and Taiwan, exchange rates
were set to encourage exports and savings and discourage imports. Only after
exports had penetrated big overseas markets - and they had amassed large
reserves in the process - did these countries agree (reluctantly) to a
revaluation of their currencies.
East European countries are being advised to do the opposite: let the market
determine the volumes of imports and exports and, by default, set the
market-clearing exchange rate.
Foreign investment: Japan earlier, and the NICs more recently, have acquired
much of their technology through licences, franchises, market-sharing
arrangements and reverse engineering (Asian for 'pirating'). They wanted
knowledge and technology, not foreign partners, and foreign equity
investment was (and is) not actively encouraged. During Japan's first period
of modernisation in the 1860s, Japan imported European bankers - but not
their banks - to help create a domestic banking system. When enough Japanese
had learned to be bankers, the foreign advisers were sent home. The NICs
have adopted an essentially similar technique. Price liberalisation and
subsidies: Prices in Asia's NICs are nominally set by market forces. But key
prices may be adjusted further by fiscal means (tax rebates, tariffs,
duties, subsidies) to ensure that the buy/sell, save/invest signals they
emit conform to national priorities: high savings and investment rates,
aggressive exporting and relative self-sufficiency in food. It is
incongruous that while east European countries are being urged to let market
forces determine their domestic prices, there is no market price for
imported rice in Japan - because there is no imported rice; and agricultural
prices in the US and Europe are influenced as much by national budgets as by
market forces.
A final consideration. It is axiomatic that public support for economic
reform is inversely proportionate to the distress it causes. Common to both
Asia's and eastern Europe's economic restructuring efforts is the need to
enlist and maintain public support for the reform process. Asia's NICs have
demonstrated that it is possible to achieve market-driven economic
restructuring without incurring unacceptably high economic and social costs.
Eastern Europe's economic reformers might find it rewarding to take a closer
look at Asia's experience.

FT  24 APR 91 / Leading Article: Rebuilding South Africa
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LINK between South Africa's efforts to negotiate a post-apartheid
constitution and the state of the country's economy is becoming increasingly
important. The process of fundamental political reform is difficult enough
at the best of times. It is especially hazardous when times are hard.
Now that the irreversibility of change in South Africa is so clearly
apparent, the least western governments can do to improve the economic
climate is to hasten the end of remaining sanctions. And the African
National Congress, still fighting a last-ditch battle against repeal, should
instead acknowledge that sanctions have achieved their purpose, declare
victory and withdraw.
As President F. W. de Klerk has pointed out during his visit to London, the
combination of population growth of 2.6 per cent a year, and an average
annual growth rate over the last decade of 1.6 per cent, makes a grim
backdrop to the constitutional process now under way in South Africa.
There is a danger that this process can be derailed by the violence that
wracks the country; and while political tensions are at the heart of the
fighting, there is little doubt that these tensions are exacerbated by
poverty and rising unemployment.
Mr de Klerk is thus right to argue that economic growth and constitutional
reform have to be mutually reinforcing. The lifting of sanctions combined
with new investment is an essential condition to South Africa's economic
recovery, which in turn is critical to growth in the whole region.
Conflicting signals
Unfortunately there continue to be conflicting signals from South Africa. Mr
Nelson Mandela, deputy president of the African National Congress, due in
London today, can be expected to persist in the ANC's view that it is too
soon to lift trade and other embargoes against Pretoria, arguing that
continued outside pressure is needed if Mr de Klerk is to fulfil his pledge
to create a non-racial South Africa.
This argument held good until Mr de Klerk so convincingly demonstrated his
commitment to reform. But by the end of June the last pillars of apartheid
will have been repealed - the Group Areas Act, the Land Acts, and the racial
provisions of the Population Registration Act.
Even if the government wanted to, it could not now rebuild apartheid. The
internal pressures that brought about the system's demise - demographic
changes, the growth of black trade unions, the increasing importance of
black consumers, shortages of white skilled manpower - are as powerful as
ever.
Meanwhile the new constitution for South Africa is slowly starting to take
shape. The ANC's draft constitutional principles, published earlier this
month, revealed encouraging common ground with Pretoria. Both parties
propose a bill of rights, proportional representation, and a bi-cameral
assembly.
Sticking points
On the face of it, the ANC demand that the constitution be drawn up by a
constituent assembly, and its call for an interim government, are sticking
points in the transition process. But there are signs that a compromise may
be possible. Pretoria has indicated that once the multi-party conference,
expected to convene later this year, has reached agreement on the principles
of the new constitution, they could be placed before a multi-party
conference instead of a constituent assembly.
And yesterday in London Mr de Klerk went some way towards meeting the ANC's
call for an interim government, offering all main political leaders 'a voice
in the formulation of important policy decisions' during the period leading
to a new constitution.
These developments should encourage the business community whose support Mr
de Klerk has been seeking during his visit to London. Of course, Mr de Klerk
must convince would-be investors that the violence that continues to scar
the country will soon be brought to an end. But they can play an important
part in bringing this about by taking an important role in the building of a
new South Africa.

What on earth is the world coming to? Britain's Inland Revenue seems to have

Somerset House have felt it necessary to issue Form CPS1 on the security of
cheque payments, which is an effective vote of no confidence in Britain's
postal system.
The Revenue notes that cheques sent by post may be stolen 'before they reach
us'. It recommends tax payers to use the bank giro, electronic funds
transfer, or pay by cash at the local Post Office. If you do insist on
sending a cheque in the post, and it is lost, you may become involved in
lengthy inquiries.

Kleinwort Benson must be ruing the day it ever heard of Kenneth McCormick
and Ojai. Until a year or so ago, McCormick was one of the darlings of the
Kleinwort Group and Ojai (pronounced O-hi) was best known as a Californian
shangri-la - a small town with just one traffic light and a music festival.
An American banker who rose fast up the swinging Californian banking tree,
McCormick became treasurer of First Interstate of Los Angeles while only
just into his 30s. There he became adept at the swaps business, and was
hired by Kleinwort to set up and run their fledgling US swaps operation in
1985.
A tall, soft-spoken man with a sharp eye for the market, he quickly turned
it into a success. The business flourished, earning Kleinwort several
million dollars a year. But like many Californians, McCormick was also
interested in the venture capital business, and
persuaded Kleinwort to help finance a new investment vehicle, Ojai Capital,
which would specialise in funding business start-ups and real estate
projects.
At the time, Kleinwort said the financing 'had been negotiated on an arm's
length basis' and it considered the transaction 'to be in the best interests
of the group and its share-
holders.' Some Dollars 23m later, McCormick is out of the door with a
promise that Kleinwort will not try to sue him.
It all smacks yet again of a fringe player trying to buy into a market it
should never have got into in the first place.

Sir Jeremy Morse, chairman of Lloyds Bank and host for yesterday's Wincott
financial journalism awards, hates gossip. Which is all very sad, since if
Sir Jeremy, fellow of All Souls, were ever to put pen to public paper he
would be able to shed more light on the City than most of the distinguished
Wincott award winners over the years.
But Sir Jeremy, who has headed Lloyds since 1977, is one of the old school
of bankers who believes in reticence. He learnt his trade at the nod and
wink school of Glyn, Mills &amp; Co where no one ever seemed to write notes. He
remembers being taken to see Lord Hampden at Lazards where nothing of
consequence was talked about. Hence, he was quite surprised when his
colleague turned to him after the meeting and said it had been 'extremely
useful'.
Increasing openness in the City, he said, had led to loss of status by the
Bank of England compared with the Treasury, because in the old days the Bank
had been able to give the impression that it knew an awful lot of important
things that it could not possibly discuss. Perhaps this had something to do
with the Bank having Reuters screens before the Treasury.
All this has changed with the rapid growth in financial journalism and Sir
Jeremy was surprisingly complimentary about the contribution of the fourth
estate. But then you can afford to be when you know an awful lot more
secrets than the media.

South Africa's President F. W. de Klerk may make many boasts about his
country. But one thing that should bother him is the surprisingly large
numbers of ex-South Africans now holding positions of influence and power in
the City of London.
Their loss to South Africa represents a time bomb that won't be defused
until it properly develops the talents of its majority population. Its 5m
whites compare with Australia's 17m and Canada's 25m. Yet neither of the
other two anywhere near match South Africa in supplying UK institutions with
senior abilities.
Besides the famous Sir Michael Edwardes, they include Sir Sydney Lipworth
(chairman of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission) and Sir Mark Weinberg
(former chairman of Allied Dunbar). The latter pair, both lawyers, are old
boys of Johannesburg's King Edward VII school.
Among the next generation are Eurotunnel's Sir Alastair Morton, Morgan
Grenfell's chairman John Craven, and Schroders' Win Bischoff.
If one counts Zimbabweans as well, there is Andrew Tuckey, chairman of
Baring Brothers. Simon, his elder brother is a QC and chairman of the the
review panel of the financial reporting council, and younger brother James,
is managing director of MEPC.
There are numerous reasons, political besides financial, why such people
come to the City. But why South Africans make better businessmen than
Canadians or Australians would call for a doctoral thesis.

FT  24 APR 91 / Made in Britain, Japanese-style: Car manufacturing in the UK
is still set to expand, despite the immediate problems of recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 1990s was supposed to be the decade of opportunity for the motor
industry in Britain. But as one crisis meeting succeeds another this week,
one could be forgiven for thinking that the industry is slipping back into
the dark days of the late 1970s and early 1980s.
The chief executives of Rover, Ford of Britain, Vauxhall and Peugeot Talbot
troop into the Treasury today to tell Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, of
their deep concern at what they see as an attack on car manufacturing in
last month's Budget.
Tomorrow union leaders have been called to talks with Mr Albert Caspers,
Ford of Europe's director for manufacturing operations, amid speculation -
strenuously denied by Ford itself - that the future of the US car maker's
British assembly plants at Halewood, Merseyside and Dagenham in Essex, is
again in doubt.
Yet the paradoxical fact is that more car assembly capacity is under
construction in Britain than anywhere else in Europe. By the mid-1990s
output is forecast to be more than double the crisis level of the early
1980s. As the Japanese car makers march in, component suppliers that have
previously shunned manufacturing in the UK are buzzing towards the
honey-pot.
The script looked promising, but for the moment the plot appears to be going
badly awry.
After five successive record years from 1985 to 1989 UK new car sales have
fallen ominously. Registrations last year were down by 12.7 per cent -
admittedly from a record level - and have plunged by a further 21.6 per cent
in the first quarter.
Highly indebted car dealers - reputable groups as well as fringe operators -
are collapsing into receivership and liquidation in worrying numbers.
Leading component makers are suffering sharply falling profits and
workforces are being cut. 'The current climate is hostile and in many of our
markets customer demand is erratic and uncertain,' says Mr Colin Hope,
chairman of T&amp;N, a leading UK auto components maker.
Truck sales are only half the level of two years ago and the slide into
recession is sharper than any UK truck maker can remember in the post-war
period. 'Heaven only knows how some manufacturers are surviving,' says Mr
Peter Foden, chairman of ERF, the last publicly-quoted, independent UK truck
maker. Most UK truck makers are running up big losses, and short-time
working and redundancies have been the order of the day for more than a
year.
Against a background of such immediate traumas Mr Derek Barron, chairman of
Ford of Britain and president of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders, Mr George Simpson, chief executive of Rover, Mr Paul Tosch,
chairman of Vauxhall, and Mr Geoffrey Whalen, managing director of Peugeot
Talbot, will seek to convince the chancellor that he has kicked the industry
when it was already down.
As the economic cycle turned down, they had been looking to the government
for support and encouragement in the attempt to make the industry a driving
force again in the UK economy. Instead, in a Budget principally designed to
extricate the government from the poll tax debacle, the industry was hit by
higher value added tax - but no relief in the discriminatory special car tax
 -fuel tax increases and scale charge increases for company car benefits
above the level of inflation, and the imposition on employers of national
insurance contributions on company cars.
The motor industry worries that the government is looking to it for a quick
fiscal fix. Memories run deep of the 1950s and 1960s, when the government
sought to regulate the economy in part through car hire purchase controls.
'The industry wants reassurance that this is not the beginning of it being
used again as an economic regulator,' says Professor Garel Rhys, professor
of motor industry economics at Cardiff Business School and adviser to the
Commons trade and industry select committee.
Above all the car makers are seeking a cut in the 10 per cent rate of
special car tax. The industry argues that no other leading vehicle producing
country in Europe singles out cars for such a discriminatory levy as the
special car tax.
This year is probably already a lost cause for the industry - the latest
forecasts suggest car sales will struggle to exceed 1.6m-1.7m units and
truck sales could hit the lowest level for decades.
Nevertheless, the worst fears of the industry chiefs may well turn out to be
only short-term; Britain could still prove to be one of the strongest growth
areas of the 1990s in the world auto industry.
The current recession is certainly causing painful job losses beyond the
labour force reductions of an industry seeking greater productivity and
efficiency. But the deepest and most painful restructuring moves were
already achieved in the 1980s.
A report by the Institute of Manpower Studies showed that from 1980 to 1987
the UK vehicles and parts industry had shed 185,000 jobs, or 45 per cent of
the workforce at the start of the decade. In the same period labour
productivity rose 66 per cent.
Profits certainly fell last year at Vauxhall, Peugeot Talbot and Rover. At
Ford of Britain, they fell sharply: the company was hit by industrial action
last year and is now also carrying the heavy losses of Jaguar, the UK luxury
car maker it acquired at the end of 1989. But that is a far cry from the sea
of red ink in which the industry fought to stay afloat a decade ago. It is
altogether leaner and fitter now.
'The UK is probably top middle in productivity in Europe,' says Prof Rhys,
'way behind Germany, probably behind Spain, but perhaps ahead of France. But
what saves the UK is its relatively low wages. With middling productivity
and the lowest wages, the UK has one of the best cost bases in Europe.'
Wage costs in the UK motor industry last year were the lowest among all the
world's leading automobile-producing countries, according to statistics
compiled by the German Automobile Industry Federation (VDA).
Some assembly capacity in the UK still has to be closed - most notably part
of Rover's Cowley, Oxford plant - but the accent in the 1990s, at least in
the car and components sectors, should be firmly on expansion. According to
Prof Rhys an optimistic forecast would suggest a leap in UK car assembly
capacity from 1.7m in 1989 to 2.7m-2.8m by the end of the decade.
It is the motor industry in Britain that will be growing, however, not the
British motor industry. In terms of ownership precious little of the latter
remains. What is transforming the sector's prospects is the wave of inward
investment by Japanese car makers into the UK.
The decisions by Nissan, Toyota and Honda to begin car production in the UK
appear to guarantee that output in the second half of the 1990s will exceed
2m cars a year, more than double the level of the first half of the 1980s,
and the build-up of production promises eventual relief for the sector's
chronic trade deficit.
To Mr Jacques Calvet, chief executive of France's Peugeot group and
philosopher-king of the lobby to restrict Japanese car sales in Europe, the
UK is fast becoming a 'Japanese aircraft carrier off the coast of Europe,'
and 'Japan's fifth-largest island'.
The alarming trend of UK car sales, imports and production in the 1970s and
1980s explains at a glance, however, why the government has welcomed
Japanese car makers to Britain so enthusiastically.
Since 1983 the UK balance of payments has shown a deficit on manufactured
goods - and the motor industry has played a key role in the slump. The motor
industry trade balance has deteriorated sharply since the end of the 1970s
and been firmly in deficit since 1982. In recent years it has accounted for
close to a third of the total UK visible trade deficit.
The first relief came last year, as the deficit fell to Pounds 4.6bn from
Pounds 6.6bn in 1989. The biggest factor in the improvement was the impact
of the recession, however, which cut imports as new car sales fell.
Now there are also the first signs of structural improvement, as UK car
exports begin to grow appreciably. Export programmes by Vauxhall, Ford and
Peugeot have been important. But for the first time exports by Nissan are
also having a significant impact and this year Nissan begins to export cars
to Japan from the UK.
The drama of the fluctuations in the fortunes of motor manufacturing in the
UK can hardly be overstated.
From the early 1930s to 1955 the UK had Europe's largest motor industry. It
is currently ninth in the world production league and fifth in Europe behind
West Germany, France, Italy and Spain.
In 1968 when the UK-owned industry combined its forces to form the British
Leyland Motor Corporation, the company accounted for 40 per cent of UK new
car registrations. Today the rump company that remains from British Leyland,
Rover Group, is 20 per cent owned by Honda of Japan, and last year it held
14 per cent of UK new car sales.
Compare that with the rise of the Japanese. Back in 1952 Nissan was
producing Austin cars in Japan under licence from Austin Motor, and Honda
did not even market its first car until 1963. It now appears a racing
certainty that by the second half of the 1990s Japanese car makers will
account directly for about a third of UK car production of about 2m units a
year.
Another third may be European-owned with Peugeot of France producing at
Ryton, Coventry, possibly with an enhanced capacity, and Rover Group at
least nominally UK-owned. Rover is already importantly dependent on Honda
technology, however, in addition to its minority ownership.
The remaining third of the UK car production base will be US-owned, with
Ford also controlling Jaguar and Aston Martin and General Motors (Vauxhall),
Lotus.
With total planned investments of more than Pounds 1.8bn the Japanese are
now committed to closing the yawning gap between UK car production of 1.296m
last year and domestic car sales of 2.009m:
Nissan will build more than 200,000 cars a year at its Pounds 700m
Sunderland plant by 1992-93. Output totalled 76,000 last year and is
expected to reach 120,000 this year with 80 per cent earmarked for export.
Nissan is also investing in UK R&amp;D facilities.
Toyota is committed to building 100,000 cars a year by late 1995 rising to
200,000 cars a year by 1997-98 at Burnaston, near Derby, but this timetable
could well be brought forward. It is investing Pounds 840m in car assembly
and engine plants.
Honda is committed to building 100,000 cars a year by 1994 at its Pounds
350m Swindon assembly and engine plant. Rover is producing up to 40,000
Honda Concertos a year at its Longbridge Birmingham plant.
Nissan has indicated its ambition to expand to a capacity of 400,000 cars a
year by the late 1990s, and both Toyota and Honda are expected to expand
significantly beyond their present publicly declared targets.
The next time a chancellor attacks the UK motor industry, the deputation on
his doorstep may well include Nissan, Toyota and Honda as well as Ford,
Vauxhall, Rover and Peugeot.

FT  24 APR 91 / Leading Article: New tax for councils
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS difficult to forgive the government for being engaged in a second
complete overhaul of local authority finance almost 12 years after coming
into power. It is not difficult to understand, however, since it made an
appalling mess of the first attempt. The question is whether the second one
is any better. The answer is 'yes', but only within the limited terms of
reference that the government has set for itself.
Bryan Gould, shadow secretary of state for the environment, complains that
the government still cannot say 'sorry'. He is a little unfair. There in the
consultative document on the new council tax is an apology, albeit a limp
one, for the community charge: 'the public', it admits, 'have not been
persuaded that the scheme is fair.' There, too, can be found something more
startling still, an apology from the Treasury: 'The government', it
acknowledges, 'considered the relative shares of local expenditure financed
from local and central sources, and concluded that the burden on the local
element had become too great.' How much more glasnost can you hope for, Mr
Gould?
The proposal on local taxation looks like a final plan in consultative
clothing. The principal question, therefore, is whether it is a reasonable
one, or at least better than either the community charge or the old rates.
It looks as though it is.
Sensible features
Each property is to be allocated to one of seven broad tax bands, with
houses and flats being placed in a band, according to how their value
relates to the average for all properties in England, Scotland and Wales.
Furthermore, 'couples living in properties in the same band anywhere in each
country will face the same council tax bill (before any rebates or
discounts) if their authorities spend at the standard level'. Both features
look sensible.
The detail of the proposed tax is subject to two main criticisms: first,
that increases in tax bills are not proportionate to increases in the value
of the properties; second, that it retains the head tax element, in the form
of the 25 per cent personal discount for single adult households. But once
one has abandoned the myth that each individual adult must receive an
individual bill, for the sake of accountability, the latter element is
hardly defensible. If broadly based discounts are to be given, it would be
better to relate them to other household characteristics, such as whether or
not it contains pensioners or dependent children.
Nevertheless, this is not a bad tax, as domestic property taxes go. The
fundamental objection is that it does not go far enough. This is to be the
only tax local authorities are allowed to set and is to cover a mere 15 per
cent of local authority current spending. Given this degree of gearing, the
power to cap will be used extensively. Local authorities are to remain the
government's poodles. They can bark, but only softly.
Attractive concept
This point is underlined by the consultative document on the structure of
local government. It starts from the assumption that local authorities have
little choice about what they are to do. 'The government is committed', it
declaims, 'to develop the concept of enabling authorities.' The concept is
attractive, but the lack of choice for local communities themselves is not.
Equally unattractive must be the planning blight that will now afflict much
of local government, as the Local Government Commission wends its weary way
through the structure of local government, area by area.
These proposals are, as everyone knows, about getting the government out of
a hole that it dug for itself. Whether they can do so will become somewhat
clearer after next week's local elections. The government is certainly in
better shape on the issue than it was. While the poll tax will be around at
least until 1993, the levels will be lower and a less unacceptable
replacement will be on the way. Perhaps it has even escaped the political
problem of its own making. If so, this is not because it deserves to, but
because a year is a long time in politics.

When people talk about breaking up the BBC to make it more 'market
oriented', and turning each channel into a separate business, have they
thought about what we have, what countries such as the US have where
broadcasting is already 'market oriented', and what we stand to lose?
Suppose you wanted to hear some music this evening at about 8 o'clock.

Swarbrick, Martin Carthy, and Fairport Convention in Birmingham. Radio 3
will be 30 minutes into a live broadcast of the BBC Welsh SO from Cardiff
where they are playing a Musorgsky and Shostakovich concert - just an
average evening on BBC Radio.

FT  24 APR 91 / North expected to recover soonest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NORTH of England, the last UK region to go into recession, is likely to
be the first to come out of it, according to a survey of the region's
first-quarter industrial and commercial performance published yesterday.
That would reverse previous experience, when the region - which comprises
the north-east and Cumbria for government statistical purposes - was always
'first in, last out' when the national economic cycle turned downwards.
The survey of 800 manufacturing and service companies was carried out by
local chambers of commerce and the Northern Development Company, the
regional agency supported by government, local authorities and the private
sector.
It found that exports held up 'encouragingly well' in the first quarter.
Although unemployment increased, the situation was expected to stabilise
before July. The longer view of profits and turnover was encouraging.
The change reflects the reconstruction of the regional economy since the
early 1980s. In the 1980-82 recession, the north-east in particular suffered
because a third of its workforce was in coal, steel or shipbuilding, which
were immediately affected when demand fell in the south.
Only 3 per cent of the workforce is now in those traditional industries and
the economy is widely based, as well as having many more smaller and
medium-sized businesses with which to absorb the shock of a downturn.
The north-west chambers of commerce economic survey of the first quarter is
more cautious about recovery.
Loss of staff from computing services companies is slowing, suggesting that
the UK recession may be starting to bottom out. Figures for the first
quarter of the year collated by the Computing Services Association indicate
that for the first time since 1989 the rate of change of staff numbers has
not worsened.

FT  24 APR 91 / Further increase in pupils attending independent schools
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of pupils at independent schools has risen for the eighth
successive year, according to this year's annual report from the Independent
Schools Information Service (ISIS), Andrew Adonis writes.
Some 476,448 pupils, 7.4 per cent of all school children, currently attend
1,372 independent schools. That is up from 6.3 per cent in 1983. The number
of boarders has fallen sharply, however, down some 4 per cent on last year.
The number of secondary-age pupils has fallen slightly since last year but
there has been strong growth at the other end of the spectrum. The number of
three-year-olds in private schools is up by 7.6 per cent on last year.
Pupils aged four are up by 5.4 per cent and those aged five to 11 up by 1.8
per cent. The number of boarders fell sharply, down 4 per cent on last year.
School fees have risen by an average of 12.5 per cent over the last year.
They now average Pounds 3,594 for day pupils and Pounds 6,672 for boarders.
One in four of all pupils receives financial help with fees, mostly from the
schools themselves. The government is to spend Pounds 100,000 on a work
experience scheme for students considering a teaching career. After a pilot
project last year Mr Michael Fallon, the schools minister, announced that
400 places will be available for a similar scheme this autumn. Government
proposals issued yesterday giving parents a say in the appraisal of
teachers' performance were immediately attacked by the second largest
teachers union as opening the system to influence from parental 'gossip and
tittle-tattle'.

FT  24 APR 91 / Audit Office faults NHS local autonomy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NATIONAL Health Service's Pounds 4bn-a-year supplies operation could
benefit from management techniques used by companies such as Boots and Marks
and Spencer, the National Audit Office says today.
An NAO study of the management of complex operations in private-sector
companies showed that the NHS's approach differed 'in nearly every respect'.
In particular, the report says, none of 16 private companies surveyed
'permitted local autonomy on the scale allowed throughout the NHS'.
The report's conclusion - that decentralised structures have prevented the
NHS from maximising its purchasing efficiency - comes when the government's
health reforms are encouraging still more local autonomy in many areas of
the health service.
The NAO examined how Boots, Marks and Spencer and Compass Services UK, a
contract caterer, handled their equivalent of the NHS supplies organisation,
which provides hospitals with food, bedding and equipment.
Department of Health officials said 'private-sector practice was not
necessarily appropriate for adoption by the NHS'.

FT  24 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): British Rail faces increased threat of
industrial action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE likelihood of industrial action ballots among 95,000 British Rail
workers grew last night after BR said it had made a final 7 per cent pay
offer.
After meeting to consider the BR offer last night, union leaders said they
would not recommend the executives of their unions to accept it, but would
consider later this week what action to take.
The move came as separate talks to avert threats of industrial action by
76,000 workers in the electricity supply industry were continuing. Late last
night the employers raised their pay offer by 0.5 percentage point to 8.5
per cent, which the unions are understood to have rejected. Electricity
unions had threatened an overtime ban from midnight tonight unless the offer
was increased substantially. Action by either the rail or power unions could
cause considerable disruption.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, said the BR offer 'seems
unacceptable'. Leaders of the RMT transport union are believed to be more
likely to call an industrial action ballot. Leaders of the Aslef drivers'
union may take the issue to the Railway Staffs National Tribunal for
arbitration instead.
BR made only a small improvement to an earlier 6.5 per cent pay offer, in
spite of warnings by union leaders that a vote on industrial action was
likely unless they were offered a rise above the rate of inflation. Unions
were meeting last night to consider a formal response.
The offer would cover 95,000 employees, represented by the RMT, TSSA and
Aslef transport unions, and would add Pounds 106m to BR's wages bill. It
would probably be extended to cover another 20,000 employees not directly
represented at yesterday's talks.
Mr Paul Watkinson, BR's employee relations director, said he believed 7 per
cent was a good offer because it would be above the rate of inflation for
the year it covered. He said that to have offered more would have been
irresponsible.
Mr Watkinson said the deterioration in BR's finances this year, because of
the recession, meant a higher offer would lead to cuts in services or jobs.
Unions were told during the talks in London that BR faced the most severe
financial difficulties for a generation. Revenue for 1991 was running 9 per
cent below the expected level and profits from property sales had fallen
sharply.

FT  24 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Promise by Labour on 'green rights'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LABOUR government would give employees 'green rights' in the workplace, Mr
Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, has told trade unionists. The
rights would include access to information and time off for training in
environmental matters.
The pledge comes as unions, employers and the government prepare to discuss
the environment at a National Economic Development Council meeting next
month. The Trades Union Congress will present proposals for a full range of
environmental rights for unions.
The proposals are likely to be strongly opposed by the Confederation of
British Industry, which favours a voluntary approach.
Employees should have access to information on environmental hazards and the
right to seek independent advice, Mr Gould told a union-organised conference
on the environment.
He said: 'Trade union representatives should have the right for time off to
receive training in environmental matters. They should have the right to
call in independent watchdogs such as the Environmental Protection Executive
(the new agency proposed by Labour) if they are unhappy about a plant or
process. Whistle-blowers should not be victimised.'
Mr Gould also backed a National Communication Union proposal for an
environmental equivalent of the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health
regulations.
The TUC will put forward its own 'green rights' plan at the NEDC meeting on
May 20. It is due to be attended by Mr Michael Heseltine, environment
secretary.
The proposals conform broadly with Labour's but add the right to negotiate
changes in production and work organisation and the right 'without
recrimination' to refuse to undertake work with potentially harmful
environmental effects.

He added: 'We also do cut glass sherry decanters complete with six glasses

'People say how can you sell this for such a low price. I say because it is

On Monday Ratners announced annual pre-tax profits had risen to Pounds
110.05m from Pounds 108.22m.

<TEXT>
UNIONS organising in the public sector should be prepared to be flexible
about traditional bargaining structures to allow better delivery of
services, a senior TUC official said yesterday, writes John Gapper.
In a study of how unions can help to improve standards in public services,
Mr Bill Callaghan, TUC assistant general secretary, said unions needed to
take 'a bold and innovative stance' and allow devolution of power.
Mr Callaghan was writing in a policy paper published by the Institute for
Public Policy Research, a left-wing research group, and the TUC. The paper
said unions should accept that competitive tendering could be good for
services.
The local government union Nalgo yesterday dropped its High Court action
challenging the validity of 54 dismissal notices issued by the London
Borough of Haringey in February.

FT  24 APR 91 / Supporters gather for Asil Nadir's third court appearance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT 100 supporters of Mr Asil Nadir mustered outside Bow Street
magistrates court in London yesterday when the Polly Peck chairman made his
third court appearance on theft and false-accounting charges totalling
Pounds 25m, Raymond Hughes writes.
Sir David Hopkin, the chief metropolitan magistrate, agreed that in future
Mr Nadir (pictured) need report to his local police station only once a week
 -between 7pm and 9pm on Mondays - instead of daily. The requirement was one
of the conditions on which Mr Nadir was granted Pounds 3.5m bail in
December. Another was that he must live and sleep at his Mayfair home. That
was varied yesterday to enable him to travel out of London overnight.
Mr Simon Browne-Wilkinson, for the Serious Fraud Office, asked for the case
to be adjourned until July 23. He said the case should be ready for transfer
to a crown court within six months.
Sir David decided that the next hearing would be on July 9 when, he said, Mr
Nadir need not attend court.

FT  24 APR 91 / E Midlands companies cut training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES IN the East Midlands, one of the UK's fastest-growing regions, are
cutting their investment in training and fixed assets such as machinery and
plant as the recession affects them more severely.
That emerges from a survey of 940 companies in the region carried out by
Price Waterhouse, consultants, and Nottingham Polytechnic, and published
today. Investment cuts are taking place against an expectation in two thirds
of the companies that business conditions will worsen over the next six
months.
Although the results of the survey do not reflect either the end of the Gulf
war or the most recent cuts in interest rates, they offer broadly the same
picture of the harsh commercial climate as other recent regional surveys.
The chambers of commerce in Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire, north Derbyshire
and Nottinghamshire reported in their sample that 43 per cent of companies
had smaller home order books and 30 per cent were finding that the number of
export orders was declining.
Price Waterhouse found that the worst-performing sector in the regional
economy was construction, followed by textiles and clothing. The downturn in
sales and profits had been most acute among Northamptonshire companies,
reflecting, Price Waterhouse said, 'the county's sensitivity to the deeper
recession being experienced in the south-east' of England.
In Derbyshire, where last year business confidence was higher than elsewhere
in the region, sales growth forecasts are now lower than for the rest of the
region.
Nearly half the companies in the survey expect a reduction in their capital
expenditure over the next six months.
Financial difficulties are now having a knock-on effect on employment
prospects. Nearly 30 per cent of companies are forecasting lay-offs. The
majority of wage settlements, however, are still in excess of 7.5 per cent.

FT  24 APR 91 / Backing for conditional fees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAW Society called on the Lord Chancellor yesterday to allow wider use
of 'no win, no pay' conditional fee arrangements as a means of improving
access to justice in cases where legal aid is not available, Robert Rice
writes.
Although the arrangements are permitted under the Courts and Legal Services
Act, the Lord Chancellor has issued a consultation paper suggesting they be
permitted only in personal injury cases.
He has also suggested that lawyers should only be allowed to increase their
normal fees by 10 per cent in such cases to compensate for the risk of
getting nothing when they lose.
The society says the maximum 10 per cent increase in normal fees is too low.
It would mean that lawyers would only undertake cases which are virtually
certain to succeed.
It also argues there are cases where conditional fees could improve access
to justice.

FT  24 APR 91 / Imports rise by 3% in March
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPORTS rose by more than 3 per cent last month to Pounds 9.4bn, providing
further support for theories that the recession might be close to reaching a
trough.
The increase, from a seasonally adjusted Pounds 9.1bn in February, is a sign
of a pick-up in demand from consumers and industrial groups.
Exports rose by more than 1 per cent last month, from Pounds 8.3bn in
February to Pounds 8.4bn in March.
The figures for the value of imports and exports are both down by 3 per cent
over the first quarter of this year, compared with the final three months of
1990. Compared with the January-March period last year, imports in the first
quarter of 1991 were down 10 per cent, while exports showed a reduction of 1
per cent.
The Central Statistical Office bases its judgments on longer-term trends in
the balance of payments on the figures for visible trade, not counting oil
and erratic items such as ships and precious stones. It said yesterday that
on the basis of those statistics there were clear signs that the underlying
rate of fall in imports had slackened in recent months.
The CSO is assuming a surplus of Pounds 500m in each of the first three
months of 1991 in invisible trade - services, financial payments and
government transfers. This may be revised when the government issues new
estimates for the first quarter invisibles balance.

FT  24 APR 91 / The Blue Arrow Trial: Shares bought after legal advice,
executive believed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FORMER chief executive of County NatWest believed the bank's buying of
Blue Arrow shares in the company's 1987 rights issue was done on the basis
of proper legal advice, the Blue Arrow trial heard yesterday.
Mr Peter Dale, the former managing director of County
NatWest Securities, agreed with Mr Jeremy Roberts, QC, that until early 1988
his client, Mr Jonathan Cohen, the former chief executive and one of the
defendants, had believed that proper legal advice had been taken.
Mr Dale told Mr Roberts that in February 1988, Mr Cohen had first announced
that it had become apparent that proper advice had not in fact been taken
and that that seemed to come as a surprise to him.
Mr Cohen was contradicted by Miss Elizabeth Brimelow, then County's
compliance director, who said proper advice had been taken, Mr Dale said.
Mr Dale also disputed the account given to the court by Mr Philip Rimell,
the former chairman of CNWS, of how CNWS bought 31m shares from County.
He agreed with Mr Roberts that Mr Rimell had willingly bought the shares
while he, Mr Dale, was abroad. He could not remember Mr Rimell having
telephoned him to object to the transaction and denied having instructed him
to take the shares.
The trial continues today.

FT  24 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Labour denies poor would be worse
off - Family policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday rejected Tory charges that its commitment to increases in
child benefit and pensions would not help the poorest families, as it
stepped up its attempt to take over the Tories' claim to be 'the party of
the family'.
At the launch of Labour's document on 'family prosperity', Mr Michael
Meacher, the shadow social security secretary, said that poorer families
would not suffer an equivalent deduction from income support with the rise
of child benefit to Pounds 9.55 a child a week.
Similarly, he said pensioners on income support would not lose out on
proposed increases in state pension.
During the Budget debate last month, ministers claimed that Labour's
calculations failed to allow for the effect of not clawing back the rise in
child benefit from families on income support.
The cost of Labour's proposals had been reduced, Mr Meacher added, by the
Budget increases in child benefit. The child benefit and pensions
commitments, costed at about Pounds 3.25bn, would broadly be met by setting
a top tax rate of 50 per cent and removing the ceiling on national insurance
contributions.
Mr Meacher said Labour would not act retrospectively, but would ensure
occupational and personal pensions provided at least as good a deal as the
state scheme.

New stations planned by National Power and PowerGen count for about 3,000MW
of the new capacity. The rest is being built by independent power projects,
notably the ICI and Enron consortium, which is planning an 1,875MW station
on Teeside.

FT  24 APR 91 / Mobil signs 15-year PowerGen gas deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES and JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOBIL HAS signed a deal with PowerGen to provide the UK electricity
generator with gas for the next 15 years.
The deal comes after last month's announcement by British Gas that it would
raise its prices to power stations for new gas purchases by 35 per cent,
arousing fears that many planned stations would be left without gas.
It will be viewed as a welcome sign that more competition is developing in
the industrial gas market previously dominated by British Gas.
Mobil will provide PowerGen with 100m cu ft of gas a day from the end of
1993 as part of a 15-year contract that will start to tail off after 10
years.
While the company would not indicate the price of gas included in the deal,
it is understood to be at a level between British Gas's existing price
schedule for power generators and its new 35 per cent higher rate for new
users.
Meanwhile PowerGen announced yesterday that it had awarded the Pounds 290m
contract to build its 680MW power station at Rye House, Hertfordshire, to
Siemens, the electronic and electrical equipment supplier.
Rye House will be a modern gas-fired station like Killingholme, PowerGen's
large new plant on Humberside, which is also being built by Siemens. Rye
House is due to become operational in 1994.
Replacing coal-fired stations with such new gas stations is a significant
plank of PowerGen's strategy, Mr Ed Wallis, the company's commercial
director, said.
In another development, Rugby Power, a partnership between East Midlands
Electricity Generation and Trafalgar House Corporate Development, is
withdrawing plans for a 380MW gas-fired power station near Rugby after local
people objected to the scheme.
Rugby Power now plans to revise and resubmit its application taking into
account the objections.

FT  24 APR 91 / Development aid record said to be lagging
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN was criticised yesterday for continuing to let its development aid
lag behind the standard set for rich industrialised countries.
Although British aid is among the best managed in the world, the amount
continues to fall well below the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of
gross national product (GNP). Furthermore, the gap is widening, according to
a review published yesterday by the Paris-based Development Assistance
Committee (DAC), which monitors industrialised countries' aid performance.
The biannual study arrives asthe prime minister is under pressure to fulfil
a 1983 statement that he hoped Britain would reach the UN target.
British Official Development Assistance (ODA) has increased only marginally
in volume since the early 1980s, to reach Dollars 2.6bn (Pounds 1.5bn) in
1989. It has fallen as a share of GNP, from 0.49 per cent in 1978-1979 to a
mere 0.31 per cent in 1989, says the report.
At that level, Britain is only the 13th most generous donor among the 18
countries belonging to the DAC, although the study shows that the UN target
is bettered by only four of them - Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands and
Denmark. France claims to spend 0.78 per cent of GNP on overseas aid, but
that falls below the UN target to 0.54 per cent if its overseas territories
are counted as part of France rather than overseas developing countries.
In real terms, Britain's ODA rose by 1.1 per cent in the five years to 1989,
slightly less than half the 2.3 per cent average rate of increase for
industrialised donor governments over the same period.
The DAC recognises that the British government is planning to do better by
increasing the volume of aid by 17 per cent over the next three years, but
feels that is not enough. 'Based on present planning, the real increase in
the UK aid programme is likely to remain slight' and aid as a share of GNP
might well fall further, said a communique by the DAC.
The high quality of British aid, delivered by a strong administration with
long experience in developing countries, makes it 'all the more desirable
that the British aid efforts be increased', the DAC added.
That would also help other donor governments to win more public support for
a boost in aid.
Britain's practice of focusing aid on the poorest countries comes in for
praise, as does its policy of using aid to encourage better government, with
economic and environmental reforms. 'The UK considers that good government
and development are closely linked,' said the DAC. More donors should follow
the same philosophy, it argued.

FT  24 APR 91 / BBC to shed 720 network TV jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BBC is to shed 720 jobs from its network television operation in London
this year as part of its cost-cutting programme and the need to source a
higher proportion of programming from independent producers.
The job losses, affecting nearly one in 10 network television employees, are
intended to save Pounds 14.5m a year. The BBC needs a Pounds 25m cut in the
costs of its network television operation by 1993.
The scheme involves closing two of the BBC's best-known studios: Television
Theatre, the Edwardian variety hall on Shepherd's Bush Green where the Wogan
chat show is filmed; and Lime Grove, where arts and current affairs
programmes, including the Late Show, are produced.
The BBC plans to shed as many jobs as possible through early retirement and
freezing recruitment but some redundancies will be unavoidable. The job
losses will be concentrated in programme resource departments such as design
and graphics, but will also affect administration. The Funding the Future
plan is designed to save Pounds 75m across its operations by 1993. The BBC
recently announced more than 100 job losses in news and current affairs and
114 in engineering.
The cuts in network TV, one of the largest parts of the BBC employing 7,750
of its 25,000 staff, employees, are also a reflection not only of Funding
the Future but of the need to satisfy government demands to commission more
independent programming.
The cuts also reflect a government demand that the ITV network and the BBC
must source at least 25 per cent of programmes from independent producers
from 1993.
Mr Will Wyatt, managing director designate of BBC Network Television, said
yesterday that the job losses were the result of a 'double squeeze' on the
division.

FT  24 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Poll date virtually rules out June
general election - Monmouth by-election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A JUNE general election has been virtually ruled out by senior
Conservatives, the party indicated yesterday when the government announced
that the Monmouth by-election will be on May 16.
By moving the writ in the Commons for a contest just two weeks after the May
2 local elections, the Conservatives signalled that they were hoping for a
swift campaign with minimal political damage.
The decision does not completely rule out a general election in June or July
but, if the government had intended that, the by-election would probably
have been delayed until the rest of the country went to the polls. The
Tories have selected Mr Roger Evans, a 44-year-old barrister, to contest the
poll, which follows the death of Sir John Stradling-Thomas, a former Tory
deputy chief whip.
Labour, which came second in the Monmouth poll in 1987, hopes to mount an
effective challenge as a springboard for the general election. Mr Peter
Mandelson, former director of campaigns, has been brought in as a campaign
adviser and is expected to take a significant role in directing the party's
campaign. A poll by BBC Wales suggests Labour is starting the contest with
41 per cent of the vote, against 39 per cent for the Tories. The party's
candidate is Mr Huw Edwards, a 38-year-old lecturer.
A senior Liberal Democrat official said the contest 'has all the ingredients
of another Ribble Valley', but the BBC Wales poll gave the party just 16 per
cent. Its candidate is Ms Frances David, a 57-year-old school teacher.
1987 election: Conservatives, 22,387. Labour, 13,037. SDP/Alliance, 11,313.
Plaid Cymru, 363. Conservative majority: 9,350.

FT  24 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Phone tax opposition grows -
Finance bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SENIOR Tory MP is to attempt to reverse the government's plans for taxing
portable phones when the Commons considers the Finance Bill, Ralph Atkins
writes.
Sir William Clark, chairman of the Tory backbench finance committee, says he
will table two amendments to the proposals for taxing mobile phones provided
by employers and used for personal calls as a benefit-in-kind worth Pounds
200.
The first amendment would overturn the government's plans. If that fails,
the second would exempt those who made only a very few personal calls on
such telephones.
A survey of Conservative MPs by Access Opinions, an independent research
company, showed 60 per cent of Tory MPs opposed to the plans announced in
the Budget.
British Coal would face difficulty obtaining planning permission for
opencast or surface mining in Wales if recommendations by the Welsh Affairs
committee are adopted.

FT  24 APR 91 / The Guinness appeals: Judges to hear medical view
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVIDENCE about the medical condition of Mr Ernest Saunders, the former
chairman and chief executive of Guinness, serving a five-year jail sentence
for his part in the Guinness affair, will be heard by the appeal court
today.
The three judges may decide to sit in private to hear the testimony of
doctors who have examined Mr Saunders on behalf of his lawyers and the
Serious Fraud Office.
Yesterday Mr Anthony Shaw, Mr Saunders' counsel, asked that the evidence be
heard in chambers in Mr Saunders' absence.
That, he said, would enable the doctors not to be constrained by
professional reticence about discussing Mr Saunders' condition in front of
him or in public.
He said he appreciated that the appeal was a matter of public interest being
heard in public, but there were larger humanitarian considerations.
The court could decide what it would be proper to make public in its
judgment, Mr Shaw said.
Lord Justice Neill said the court's provisional view was that the appeal
should remain public but it would consider the matter again today afterthe
doctors had met and discovered any disagreements between them.
He said: 'This is a case where we are very reluctant, unless overriding
considerations apply, to deal with it otherwise than in open court.
I think we shall need to be satisfied there are particular aspects of the
medical evidence that ought not to be publicly known.'
Mr Saunders; Mr Anthony Parnes, a City stockbroker; and Mr Gerald Ronson,
head of the Heron group, are appealing against convictions and sentences. Mr
Parnes is serving 2 1/2 years. Mr Ronson, released in February after serving
just under half his 12-month sentence, was also fined Pounds 5m.
Mr John Chadwick, QC, for the SFO, defended the allegation made against Mr
Saunders during the trial that he had intended keeping Pounds 3m of Pounds
5.2m he authorised Guinness to pay Mr Tom Ward, a US lawyer and Guinness
director.
Mr Saunders has complained that the allegation, and the way the trial judge
dealt with it, prejudiced his defence.
Mr Chadwick said the allegation had been properly made to test Mr Saunders'
credibility as a witness and correctly dealt with in the judge's summing-up.

FT  24 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: SDP Duck in Drake city? - Local
election diary (Plymouth)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLYMOUTH'S local elections look likely to form the final chapter in the
chronicle of a political death long foretold.
Under the leadership of a local boy, Dr David Owen, the city of Sir Francis
Drake could claim to be the principal birthplace of grassroots social
democracy.
Ten years on, both Labour and the Tories are promising that Social Democrats
Plymouth - the P for party was redesignated to the city's name just a few
months ago - will be finally laid to rest next week.
As with the demise of the Alliance, Dr Owen himself is accused of having
played a leading part in digging the grave. Reports that the member for
Devonport is considering a shift rightward to the Tories were widely deemed
the last straw.
At the borough council elections in 1987, the SDP fought every seat. This
time, it is contesting only 15 in Dr Owen's Devonport constituency  - three
of which are even being challenged by their old Alliance partners, the
Liberal Democrats.
Mr Harold Luscombe, local SDP leader, admired by many but loathed by Labour,
claims the party can hold the five seats it commands on the 60-seat council.
Yet the impact of several defections to the Tories and a resurgent Labour
party, especially in the job-depleted docklands, make that improbable.
Pressed, Mr Luscombe admits that annihilation is a possibility.
Until May 2 at least, the party will continue to fight on a fiercely
independent platform that has something to irritate everyone in the big
parties.
That includes a Torier-than-Tory plan to sell off a participation in the
still uncompleted Pounds 25m municipal conference and leisure centre to the
private sector - opposed as unrealistic by the Conservatives.
Mr Luscombe annoys Labour by castigating his old party as spendthrift. 'I
look back on the last few years with a certain pride,' he says. 'Nationally,
we have been the saviours of the Labour party.
'The ridiculous thing is that as the party leadership has become more
moderate, the local party has been going the other way.'
Three miles away in Keyham ward, the sober suits and yet more sober language
of Mr Jack Cunningham, Labour's national organiser, and Mr John Ingham, the
local leader, appear to tell a different story.
As in the party's campaigns in Nottingham and Milton Keynes, the heavy
emphasis is on a council partnership with private enterprise and the
community.
If Tory taunts about a hidden agenda ring hollow, local Labour economics
seem firmly rooted in the wishful-thinking school. In Plymouth, the party
claims it could have set a poll tax Pounds 10 below the Tories' Pounds 380
largely by persuading non-payers to do their civic duty.
Nevertheless, Labour - currently with 23 seats on the council to the Tories'
31 - looks in with a real chance to take control for the first time in 25
years.
Dr Colin Rallings, a psephologist at Plymouth's South West Polytechnic,
calculates that the same 8 per cent swing is needed as Labour requires
nationally to take power.
Last year's county council elections in key Tory wards proved that was
possible. But in a general election, much would depend on whether Dr Owen's
fans jump left or right.
The three-way split in all three parliamentary seats makes Devonport
winnable for Labour. Dame Janet Fookes' Plymouth Drake is also vulnerable if
the SDP vote collapses as predicted.
Ironically, Mr Alan Clark, the defence minister much disparaged in Plymouth
for failing to defend the city's navy interests, seems safest, with a 4,000
majority over the Liberal Democrats.
Plymouth's difficulties - housing, the need to diversify from a single
industry base, lack of development land - are relatively commonplace.
As in the other towns visited by this diary, that creates difficulties from
a political point of view, as the options are limited.
Often, for little more than the satisfaction of personal ambitions,
strenuous efforts are made to dress up what a broad consensus into the
tribal warpaints of national politics.
One missed opportunity is a curious fact that elsewhere might provoke
controversy - as a security measure the entire city centre is permanently
filmed by video cameras, monitored by the council's security men.
In the event, that draconian measure has not only sharply reduced petty
crime - it has also met approval from Tory, Labour and Democrats of both
Social and Liberal tendencies.
Three centuries on, the city that saw off the Armada has silently fallen to
the unblinking tyranny of electronic technology.

FT  24 APR 91 / The Council Tax: Local authorities split over plans for
reform - Council reaction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The outcome of the next general election will be influenced by the
electorate's acceptance or rejection of the new council tax announced
yesterday. Plans have also been published for streamlining local government
by introducing a single tier of authorities in place of many county and
district councils. FT writers report on the proposals and their implications
LOCAL authorities' opinion on the reforms was split last night.
Sir Jack Layden, chairman of the Labour-dominated Association of
Metropolitan Authorities, said: 'It's a Whitehall tax which gives massive
control to government ministers. It's excessively complicated and unjust.'
Mr John Chatfield, chairman of the Association of County Councils, said his
organisation had recommended the move towards a property-based tax and a
single tier of local government, which it believed would be the counties.
Mr Roy Thomason, chairman of the Association of District Councils, said:
'This is just what we need.' He was convinced that the single tier of
government would generally be the district councils.
Mr Alan Stenning, director of finance at Islington Borough Council, London,
was concerned that there would be little time to implement the new tax once
the consultation period was over.
Ms Margaret Hodge, leader of Islington council, said the new tax was still
unfair because it was not related to ability to pay. 'The poll tax
experiment has cost almost Pounds 400 per adult, so it would have been nice
if the government had said 'sorry,' she said.
The Institute of Revenues, Rating and Valuation, representing private
valuers and council revenue officers, welcomed the new tax. 'It will
unquestionably be simpler to collect and enforce than the community charge,'
said Mr Colin Farrington, director.
However, he warned that the timetable to introduce the tax by 1993 was very
tight and estimated it would take three to five years after its introduction
to return to the very high collection levels present under the old rating
system.
Mrs Jean McFadden, president of the Convention of Scottish Local
Authorities, welcomed the government's green paper 'as the first step away
from the hated poll tax.'
Mr Roger Cumberland, finance director at Radnorshire District Council, said
he had always been in favour of unitary local authority, but hoped the
government would not introduce it until after the new financial structure
was in place for at least one year.

FT  24 APR 91 / The Council Tax: Easing the burden in Tory marginals -
Political impact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The outcome of the next general election will be influenced by the
electorate's acceptance or rejection of the new council tax announced
yesterday. Plans have also been published for streamlining local government
by introducing a single tier of authorities in place of many county and
district councils. FT writers report on the proposals and their implications
THE NEW local tax would benefit all two-person households in the Labour
London borough of Lambeth, but in marginal Tory Bath such households in the
54 per cent of homes worth more than Pounds 88,000 would pay more. That
suggests either altruism or a belief that some supporters can be taken for
granted.
A more complex picture emerges beyond those extreme examples of the massed
ranks of figures provided by the government to illustrate how the council
tax would work.
The numbers themselves are subject to some caveats. They are based on bills
and not on actual amounts paid, so that the real benefit to people who did
well from the community charge reduction scheme, because they live in homes
that had low rateable values, will be less than the headline difference
suggests.
The reduction scheme has been added to the central government grant, leaving
a lower amount (Pounds 6.8bn) to be raised from local authorities, and the
cost of collection has been assumed to be 40 per cent of the cost of
collecting the poll tax.
In general, however, Tory marginals will breathe a sigh of relief.
Mr David Martin, the Tory MP for Portsmouth South, has a majority of just
205. With a Portsmouth city council poll tax at Pounds 179, households of
two or more people in five of the seven bands - 94 per cent of homes - would
pay less under the new tax.
In Pendle, where Mr John Lee, the Tory MP whose majority is below 3,000, has
been an outspoken critic of the poll tax, the gains for two-person
households look impressive.
Almost 70 per cent of homes fall within the lowest two property bands, under
which two-person households would gain from the switch to the new system.
With the release of the figures halfway through the local election campaign,
the first test of how well they survive sustained political debate may come
in the Monmouth by-election to be held in mid May.
Although most single-person households would be worse off under the new
system, households of two or more in the roughly three quarters of homes
valued below Pounds 90,000 would benefit.
Will it be enough?

FT  24 APR 91 / The Council Tax: Gamble aims to end Tories' trauma
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The outcome of the next general election will be influenced by the
electorate's acceptance or rejection of the new council tax announced
yesterday. Plans have also been published for streamlining local government
by introducing a single tier of authorities in place of many county and
district councils. FT writers report on the proposals and their implications
SO FAR, so good. The poll tax is all but dead, although the extended burial
service will take a full two years to complete. The initial reaction to its
successor the council tax, finally announced yesterday after weeks of
agonising, was a qualified welcome to a pragmatic package targeted to meet
the many anxieties of Conservative supporters.
However, the drastic nature of the solution, which represents the biggest
political U-turn for years, shows how traumatised ministers have become over
the damage inflicted by the poll tax.
A return to the rates is a gamble which has no guarantee of success, but at
least it gives ministers a chance to restore electoral credibility and to
seek to repair some of the harm done to the Tory party by the introduction
of a local tax widely perceived as regressive and unfair.
Mr Heseltine's original idea was to launch an across-the-board inquiry into
all aspects of local government - finance, structure and organisation. That
remains the intention, but the indications from yesterday's consultation
papers are that the inquiry has degenerated into a piecemeal approach
because of the need to ditch the poll tax fast.
Virtually all effort has been focused on that. Any changes in structure and
organisation lie well in the future.
In the short term, at least, the tactic might work. The figures show an
estimated average household charge for two or more people in the top
property band of Pounds 668 and in the lowest band of Pounds 267 - well
below the last average rates bill or the average poll tax paid last year.
That is clearly good news for the government, particularly as the measures
have been framed to avoid the big variations under the old rating system and
to ensure there are not too many losers in the prime Tory territory of the
south-east.
There is therefore political logic in not creating too many losers among
Tory supporters, and economic logic in the restoration of a link between the
size of bills and ability to pay. It looks a skilful package, although it
will lay the government open to the charge of looking after its own
supporters at the cost of others.
Yet many difficulties remain, mainly because no real attempt has been made
to link reform of finance to reform of structure. Mr Heseltine and Mr Major
may ultimately pay a heavy price for such a lopsided approach. The
impression remains that the shape of local government is being refashioned
almost accidentally as a result of the earlier botched attempt to abolish
the unpopular rating system.
The establishment of a fairer, more soundly based method of local
revenue-raising will not end the tensions between local and central
government, stretched almost to breaking point by the bruising fiasco of the
poll tax.
The confusion of responsibility between town halls and Whitehall has become
an increasing source of conflict over the last decade and the consultation
paper on structure showed that everything remains to be decided.
Battle lines are already being drawn up in the conflict that is about to
start over the introduction of unitary authorities, with many counties
fighting for their existence against pressures from the districts to take
over their powers.
Mr Heseltine has guaranteed a lengthy, messy process by emphasising that it
will be largely up to local opinion to decide what form of local
administration is required, including in some cases the retention of two
tiers of authorities.
Politically the difficulty is that the majority of both county and district
councils are at present Conservative-led and the party could be badly split
by the conflicts.
The blight of the poll tax might not yet be over. It might continue to
distort domestic politics until clear lines for local and national
administrative responsibilities are finally decided, and that is still some
way off.

FT  24 APR 91 / The Council Tax: Cheers and some relief from the party
faithful - Commons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The outcome of the next general election will be influenced by the
electorate's acceptance or rejection of the new council tax announced
yesterday. Plans have also been published for streamlining local government
by introducing a single tier of authorities in place of many county and
district councils. FT writers report on the proposals and their implications
GOVERNMENT supporters showered congratulations on Mr Michael Heseltine, the
environment secretary, in the Commons yesterday when he promised to bury the
poll tax and replace it with a council tax with a 'property and personal
element'.
Any lingering doubts on Tory benches about the effectiveness of the
long-awaited funeral arrangements were dispelled by Mr Nigel Lawson, the
former chancellor, whose objections to the introduction of the poll tax were
overruled by Mrs Margaret Thatcher when prime minister.
Ministers and Conservative backbenchers were clearly relieved when Mr
Lawson, who recently warned of the political perils that would be associated
with a replacement identifiable as 'son of poll tax', joined the welcome
given to Mr Heseltine's proposals.
Mr Lawson said there would be widespread relief that the government had had
the courage to 'consign the poll tax to oblivion' and to take a firm
decision that its successor should be property-based.
Labour's relatively unsuccessful attempt to give Mr Heseltine a rough ride
was led by Mr Bryan Gould, the shadow environment secretary, who emphasised
that the poll tax, with all its unfairness, would continue until 1993.
To cheers from Labour colleagues, Mr Gould protested that the new local tax
would be 'skewed' to protect the rich from paying their fair share.
Mr Heseltine repeatedly underlined the government's determination to
'intensify the capping regimes' to ensure high-spending, Labour-controlled
councils could not force up the new tax to unacceptable levels.
Mr Gould suggested that the allocation of properties in England to seven
different valuation bands reflected the 'seven strands' of opinion in Mr
John Major's divided cabinet, which was too weak to kill the poll tax
outright.
While deploring the government's failure to say 'sorry', he interpreted Mr
Heseltine's announcement as an admission that the poll tax had been a
disastrous mistake, costing the taxpayer Pounds 18m a day.
Mr Gould scoffed: 'The party that brought us the head tax now offers us a
stand-on-your-heads tax, but whether it is heads or tails, the British
people remain the losers.'
The new local tax, he said, was the outcome of a disreputable union between
the poll tax and political panic.
Mr Gould argued that the only consultations about the new local tax that
really mattered would take place through the local government elections on
May 2 and the coming general election. Amid further Labour cheers, and Tory
jeers, he forecast that the voters would 'kill off this Tory tax once and
for all by electing a Labour government'.
Mr Heseltine contrasted the 'certainty' of the government's proposals with
Labour's 'fair rates' alternative, which he claimed would involve returning
to the old rating system prior to a further upheaval leading to the
introduction of a different tax a year later. He also insisted that a Labour
government would not act to curb spendthrift councils.
Sir Norman Fowler (C, Sutton Coldfield), another former cabinet minister,
provided further reassurance for government supporters by likening the
reaction of Labour MPs to a recognition that 'their fox has been shot'.
For the Liberal Democrats, Mr Alan Beith said the product of Mr Heseltine's
announcement was not 'the son of poll tax but the son of rates'.

FT  24 APR 91 / The Council Tax: Changes to be adapted to Scottish needs -
Scotland/Wales

The outcome of the next general election will be influenced by the
electorate's acceptance or rejection of the new council tax announced
yesterday. Plans have also been published for streamlining local government
by introducing a single tier of authorities in place of many county and
district councils. FT writers report on the proposals and their implications
IN SCOTLAND the new council tax will operate in the same way as planned for
England and Wales, Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, announced yesterday.
However, while the discount, rebate and transitional arrangements would be
the same, some details of the tax might be varied to meet Scottish
circumstances.
Most households in Scotland were in the lowest three bands, where the
average bill for a two-person household would be Pounds 380 and Pounds 280
for a one-person household, Mr Lang said.
To prevent the new tax from reaching unacceptable levels, he said he was
making his capping powers - not exercised in Scotland under the poll tax -
equal with those of the Environment and Welsh secretaries.
A new system for the payment of water and sewerage charges would also be
introduced.
Mr David Hunt, the Welsh secretary, told the Commons that detailed
arrangements to replace the poll tax in Wales might need to differ to meet
local circumstances. The taxing of second homes was one area where different
provisions might be needed.
'The proposal I have brought forward today looks at Wales as a country in
itself,' he said. 'There is no transposition of values from England to
Wales.'
Mr Donald Dewar, opposition spokesman for Scotland, said the system had been
rigged to protect the better-off. 'Can it be right that the most expensive
property in Newton Mearns or Morningside pays at the most only two and a
half times the most battered council house in Easterhouse or Pilton?' he
asked.
The move to a single-tier tax was 'riding on Labour's coat-tails', according
to Mr Barry Jones, the party's Welsh spokesman, who also accused the
government of giving 'special treatment' to the wealthiest people in Wales.

FT  24 APR 91 / The Council Tax: Proposals for the poll tax replacement set
out in detail - Local funding consultation document
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The outcome of the next general election will be influenced by the
electorate's acceptance or rejection of the new council tax announced
yesterday. Plans have also been published for streamlining local government
by introducing a single tier of authorities in place of many county and
district councils. FT writers report on the proposals and their implications
THE consultation document A New Tax For Local Government sets out in some
detail the government's proposals for the new council tax, to come into
effect by April 1993.
Basic proposals: 'The government has decided that from the earliest possible
moment the community charge will be replaced by a new system of local
taxation. The new 'council tax' will comprise a property and a personal
element. But it will take the form of a single bill for each household,
based on the value of the property and the number of adults who live in it.'
Discounts: As 54 per cent of households have two adults living in them, 'the
government favours a discount approach on the assumption that there are two
adults in each household. Households with two or more adults would pay the
basic council tax for their property. Single-adult households would pay less
through a personal discount indicated on the bill.
'Under these proposals, some 38m adults in Great Britain would be taken into
account directly in calculating bills. Only 4m adults would be excluded,
many of whom - for example students and people on income support - would be
eligible for personal discounts even if they were to be counted for the tax.
'A significant advantage of the discount approach is that there is no need
for a register of council tax payers. Households simply receive a bill which
assumes two adults, but pay a reduced bill through a discount where there is
only one liable adult or two discounts where there are none or where the
property is not a principal place of residence.
'The government favours setting the personal discount as a percentage of the
basic bill of the household. It proposes that the discount should be 25 per
cent of the basic bill.'
Banding: Assessing the taxable value of domestic properties based on rental
values, capital values or rebuilding costs . . . would pose various
problems. The government therefore proposes to adopt a new approach: a
banding system.
'Each property would be allocated to one of a small number of bands.
Households in properties in the same band in a council's area would receive
the same basic council tax bill. There would be no need for a detailed
valuation of all dwellings.
'The banding system could be designed to ensure that excessive burdens did
not fall on a minority of properties. Undue variations in bills arising from
regional variations in property values could be avoided. Banding would
reduce the administrative task involved in the introduction of the new
council tax and allow it to be achieved more quickly.
'The government proposes a system by which all properties in an area would
be placed in one of a small number of bands constructed around the average
property value in the relevant country - England, Scotland or Wales.
'The government proposes that a couple living in the highest band would pay
two thirds more than a couple living in a property in the middle band. A
couple living in a property in the lowest band would pay two thirds of the
bill for a middle-band property. Overall, bills for couples in the highest
band would be two and a half times as much as those for couples in the
lowest band.'
Valuation: The Valuation Office of the Inland Revenue will supervise the
assignment of properties to bands. There would be no need for regular or
frequent revaluations of properties under a system of banding.
Multiple occupancy: The government proposes to bring some houses within the
scope of non-domestic rating when there is multiple occupancy, or where
adults are joint owners or tenants, recognising that many properties of this
kind are run as businesses.
Second homes: Where a property is not anyone's main residence, the
government proposes that the bill should then be reduced by the maximum of
two personal discounts.
Rebates: 'The government proposes that, for individuals or couples on income
support or equivalent levels of income, rebates should meet 100 per cent of
their liability to the council tax. There would be no minimum contribution.
'People on incomes above the income support level will contribute on a
sliding scale.'
Where non-dependants on low incomes live as the second adult in households
where the occupier is not eligible for a rebate, there should be a full
personal discount where the person is at or below the income support level.
Students: Where the first or second adult in a property is a student, a
student nurse, an apprentice or a Youth Training trainee, each will receive
a full personal discount. If there are no other adults in a household of
students, the household will receive two discounts.
Government grants and assessments: The system of standard spending
assessments by central government will remain, and under the new council tax
'grants will be paid to local authorities so that each area can finance
spending at a standard level by levying the standard taxable amounts fixed
by the secretary of state for the council tax.
'Local authorities would retain discretion to set their budgets above or
below the standard level . . . The government's intention is that an
authority's spending above or below the standard level will be reflected in
its council tax bills.
'The variation in spending should fall proportionately on the bills of all
council tax payers in the area, so that each household would see an equal
percentage increase or reduction in their bill compared with the level for
standard spending.'
Two-tier authorities: 'In areas with more than one tier of authorities, the
tiers should each set their own separate element of the council tax, and the
separate elements should be clearly identifiable on the single bill.'
Capping: The government will continue to use its powers to cap excessive
local authority spending. Powers for capping Scottish authorities will be
adjusted to equate with those in England and Wales.
Business rates: No changes are proposed in the business rate system
introduced in 1990.

FT  24 APR 91 / Greenspan hits at banking proposal: Treasury plan 'would
encourage foreign banks to move away from the US'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER RIDDELL, US Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, has strongly criticised
US Treasury proposals requiring foreign banks to set up separately
capitalised local holding companies if they wish to take advantage of the
opening up of US financial services.
Mr Greenspan told the Senate banking committee yesterday such a requirement
would impose additional costs on foreign banks without obvious benefits. 'It
also creates an inducement for foreign banks to conduct their banking
operations in less costly environments outside the US and for foreign
authorities to threaten reciprocal restrictions for US financial firms
abroad.'
Under the plan, which has already been attacked by international bankers,
any foreign bank engaged in activities other than simple banking would have
to close its current American branches and agencies involved in securities
and underwriting operations and conduct all of its US banking business
through a US subsidiary bank. This would also apply to any expansion into
these areas.
In spite of reservations on a number of points, Mr Greenspan endorsed the
general thrust of the Treasury's wide-ranging bank reform plan, saying it
attacked 'the major root causes of the problems in the banking system'. In
particular, he said a majority of the Fed board supported the proposed
overhaul of deposit insurance, tightening of supervisory procedures, removal
of restrictions on interstate branch banking and authorisation of new
investment activities for well capitalised bank holding companies.
However, the prospects for comprehensive banking reform this year have
receded because of a desire, especially on the House banking committee, to
concentrate on legislation to bolster the financially strained bank
insurance fund.
But Mr Greenspan urged Congress to 'avoid only partial solutions by
separating into component parts the comprehensive proposals for reform such
as those suggested by the Treasury.'
He said the Fed board was troubled about the proposal that the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation could borrow up to Dollars 25bn (Pounds
14.7bn) from Federal Reserve Banks to absorb losses sustained by the bank
insurance fund in dealing with failed banks.
This would involve the Fed in directly funding the government. Such funding
always been severely limited because of concerns about compromising the
independent conduct of monetary policy. It would be better, and have an
identical financial and economic impact, if the Treasury made the necessary
loans, he said.
Mr Greenspan also warned against too large an increase in premiums paid by
banks to support the insurance fund, which might threaten the soundness and
competitiveness of the banking system.
He also underlined the Fed's opposition to removing its present supervisory
authority over bank holding companies and limiting it to (mainly smaller)
state chartered banks.

FT  24 APR 91 / Dinkins dithers as NY sinks in the quagmire: Bernard Simon
on the Big Apple's big problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALMOST every city in North America is feeling a three-way squeeze these
days, but New York is worse.
The recession is eroding tax revenues; demands for social welfare and other
costly services are spiralling; yet little help is forthcoming from
governments preoccupied with balancing their own budgets.
These woes are only part, however, of the economic and political quagmire in
which New York finds itself. The fiscal crunch in the US's biggest city is
being compounded by a mayor seemingly unable to take tough decisions, a
white business community nervous about upsetting the black mayor, and
bureaucrats and trade union leaders who want everyone to make sacrifices
except themselves.
New York's latest budget worries have not yet reached the proportions of the
mid-1970s, when the city came close to financial collapse. 'It's a difficult
problem, but it's not a crisis,' says Mr Quentin Spector, executive director
of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, the body set up 15 years ago as
banker to the city, which now acts mainly as a financial adviser.
The budget impasse has so far had little more impact on New Yorkers than the
prospect of a shortened season at municipal swimming pools this summer,
fewer lifeguards on the beaches, and a drive for private donations to save
the Central Park petting zoo.
The long-term damage could be far more severe. While the budget deficit is
projected at a relatively manageable Dollars 450m-500m for the fiscal year
to June 30, it is expected to soar to Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.7bn) in 1991/92.
The city's borrowing ability is also at risk, at a time when it needs to
raise about Dollars 3bn a year to fund new capital projects. New York bonds
are already trading at a premium of about 1 percentage-point to those of
issuers with a similar credit rating.
Mr Don Mele, director for public issues at City Partnership, a non-profit
civic group, is worried that the improvements made to New York's
infrastructure over the past decade - ranging from street repairs to
gleaming new subway carriages - will gradually unravel if a solution is not
found to the budget problem.
At the core of the problem is New York's heavy exposure to the real estate
and financial services businesses, and related sectors, which have been
especially hard hit by the recession. The city's economy tumbled into
recession more than a year before the rest of the country, and has felt its
impact far more severely.
According to the New York Port Authority, construction activity fell by 28
per cent last year, compared to a national decline of only 11 per cent. With
many high-income earners in the financial services and related industries
out of work, retail sales dipped by 1.2 per cent last year, against a 3.9
per cent advance in the country as a whole.
Matters have been made worse by the dithering of Mayor David Dinkins and the
intransigence of the city's trade unions.
Instead of taking the tough decisions needed to balance the budget, Mr
Dinkins has gone out of his way to avoid confrontation with the city's many
special interest groups. He lifted, then reimposed, a freeze on hiring
municipal workers. At the same time, he has proposed hiring several thousand
police officers to dampen fears about a new crime wave.
Several deadlines are looming. The financial markets' opinion of New York's
financial condition will become clearer within the next 10 days when the
city is expected to raise about Dollars 1bn in 'revenue-anticipation' bonds
 -money required because the New York state budget, which will provide for
transfers to the city, is itself almost a month overdue.
If Mr Dinkins fails to bring the municipal budget shortfall below Dollars
100m by the end of June or if the city is shut out of the capital markets,
administration of municipal finances could pass to the Financial Control
Board, another agency set up in the mid-1970s to bring more discipline to
New York's financial affairs.
The chances are slim that the FCB, whose members include the governor, the
mayor, city and state comptrollers and three private-sector nominees, will
actually step in. Whether by fiscal prudence or by some sleight-of-hand
accounting, Mr Dinkins is likely to pull out all the stops to avoid the
humiliation of outside intervention.
According to Mr Spector, 'the betting seems to be that the city will make it
through 1991 intact, but partly by mortgaging 1992. The question is: Will
they use that time well?'
The answer depends largely on how quickly the city emerges from recession
and can rebuild its eroded tax base. Ms Nancy Feldman, an analyst at
Standard &amp; Poor's rating agency, asserts that 'there's no question New York
will lag the rest of the country.'
The danger is that a prolonged slump or very slow recovery will not give Mr
Dinkins the tax revenues he needs to balance the 1991/92 budget. The city
will then face far more unpleasant choices than it does today, plus the risk
of more severe labour strife and political turmoil.

FT  24 APR 91 / Fall in durables orders sets back recovery hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER RIDDELL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES of an early end to the US recession have been undermined by an
unexpectedly large drop in new orders for manufactured durable goods. Orders
in March fell 6.2 per cent to the lowest level since August 1987, Peter
Riddell writes from Washington.
The financial markets had been expecting a small rise in new orders
following declines in three of the previous four months. The sharp drop
revived hopes of a possible cut in interest rates and contributed both to a
rise in government bond prices and to a weakening in the dollar.
Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, yesterday told the
Senate banking committee that current conditions suggested the economy was
'still modestly moving lower,' but at a diminishing rate.
He expected the recession 'to bottom out in a reasonably short period
ahead'.
He said the Fed continued to examine the economy on a 'day-by-day' basis and
the options remained open for interest rate movement. But he warned that the
current rate of inflation was 'more worrisome' than the rate in the summer
of 1986, during a previous economic slowdown.
Significantly, there was weakness across the board in durable goods orders,
affecting nearly all big industries. New orders for non-defence capital
goods equipment, generally regarded as a leading indicator for business
investment, fell by 10.3 per cent in March.
Excluding defence, new orders fell by 5.4 per cent.
Yesterday's report runs contrary to some other recent, more positive
indicators, such as in the housing sector, which suggested that the
recession might be bottoming out and a recovery could start by the late
summer. It raises the question of whether total output, as measured by real
gross national product, will continue to drop in the current period, which
would represent three successive quarters of decline.
Some economists have pointed to a recent rise in stock/inventory levels as
suggesting that any pick-up may be delayed and limited.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH exporters made FFr11.4bn (Pounds 1.13bn) of net claims on
state-guaranteed contracts last year, equivalent to around 1 per cent of
France's total overseas sales, said Coface, the French export credit
guarantee agency.
The figure, the balance between overall repayments on state-guaranteed
exports handled by Coface and premium and other income, is a slight increase
on the FFr10.9bn of claims on state-covered exports paid out the previous
year.
It does not include claims expected from unpaid bills related to the Gulf
war, likely to be around FFr5bn this year, Coface officials said.
Coface saw a 23 per cent rise in reimbursements it had to pay out on its own
account, rather than on the export credit guarantees it manages on behalf of
the government. These rose from FFr290m to FFr345m, with the worst
performance coming from the recession-hit UK, plus Spain and Italy, said Mr
Henri Baquiast, chairman of Coface.
The group covers short-term credits of less than three years and political
risks in the European Community, while it acts as an agency for the state
for most non-EC political risks and medium-term credit guarantees.

<TEXT>
AT least 74 people have been killed and over 800 injured in an earthquake
which shook the Caribbean coasts of Costa Rica and Panama on Monday evening.
Rescuers were yesterday struggling to free more victims trapped under
rubble.
The epicentre of the tremor, which measured 7.5 on the Richter scale, was
40km south-east of the Costa Rican banana-exporting port of Puerto Limon.
Banana production is the main economic activity in the region and is thought
to have been badly disrupted.
Scores of buildings in Puerto Limon were destroyed, and fires broke out at
the state-run oil refinery close to the port. Communications have been
disrupted, as have water and sewage systems. Tidal waves hit the islands
around Bocas del Toro in Panama.
The Panama-based Union Of Banana Exporting Countries (UPEB) said: 'We know
there has been serious damage to the roads and infrastructure, but we do not
yet know the full extent of the damage to the plantations.'
The main producers in the region, United Brands, Standard Fruit and Del
Monte, all have plantations in the earthquake zone.

THE Brazilian government will appeal to the Supreme Court this week to stop
a wave of judgments allowing people to withdraw cruzados blocked in an
Dollars 80bn (Pounds 47.3bn) asset freeze last year, alleging that the
resulting increase in money supply could scupper its economic stabilisation
plan, Christina Lamb writes from Rio.
Ms Zelia Cardoso, the economy minister, said on Brazilian television: 'If
the court decides that all the money should be liberated I wash my hands of
all responsibility over what may happen to inflation.'
The government appeal comes in response to a series of regional court
decisions declaring its asset freeze, the centrepiece of a drastic
anti-inflation plan, unconstitutional. This has led people to ask the courts
to free their money. There are 70,000 cases pending.

<TEXT>
GEC AVIONICS, the aerospace subsidiary of the General Electric Company, has
become the third British company this month to win a significant order to
supply components for the new Boeing 777 wide-bodied aircraft.
With the GEC contract, Boeing, the world's leading manufacturer of
commercial aircraft, will have placed Pounds 500m of business on the 777
with British companies this month.
The GEC Avionics contract, estimated at Pounds 45m initially, is for the
primary flight computer system for its new twin-engined airliner. Smiths
Industries and Hawker Siddeley have also won Boeing contracts this month.

FT  24 APR 91 / China widens HK airport war of nerves

CHINA has stepped up its war of nerves with Hong Kong over the government's
plans for a HKDollars 100bn (Pounds 7.53bn) airport by welcoming outline
proposals from a leading local construction entrepreneur for an alternative
HKDollars 60bn private sector-based project.
This has emerged at a time when some international construction companies
are beginning to reassess their interest in tendering for the government
project because contracts are stalled by the row with China, which is
refusing to give approval until it gains partial control over the project.
Mr Gordon Wu, founder-chairman of Hong Kong-based Hopewell Holdings, met Lu
Ping, Peking's senior official with direct responsibility for Hong Kong in
Peking during the past two days.
Hopewell officials reported that Mr Wu's ideas had been 'fully supported' by
the officials, who said they wanted to see the project 'fully in the private
sector' and would help with air traffic rights.
Although there is no suggestion of any immediate contract negotiations, the
move is significant because Mr Wu gained support from a number of leading
Hong Kong property developers and other businessmen during a series of
private conversations before he went to Peking on Sunday. It is unlikely
that the Hong Kong government would be prepared to switch to Mr Wu's plans
and hand over control to the private sector. It would also resist giving
government land to the developers.
It is believed that Mr Wu's talks covered the possibility of the businessmen
starting construction in 1997, immediately after Hong Kong returns to
Chinese sovereignty.
Two key preliminary contracts, each worth about HKDollars 1bn-HKDollars
1.5bn, which should have been awarded this month, have not yet been signed.
One is expected to go to Kumagai Gumi (Hong Kong) for reclamation work in
the Kowloon area connected with approach roads, and another is slated for
Shui On Construction, a local contractor, to move a nearby typhoon shelter
and reclaim land.
Wimpey Construction of the UK has decided not to go ahead at this stage with
an application next month to be pre-qualified for one of the largest
contracts, worth an estimated HKDollars 6bn-8bn, to reclaim land and build
the main airport platform. Other international contractors are expected to
review their interest in tendering for this and other Hong Kong projects
because of the growing air of uncertainty.

<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S offer of up to 50,000 passports to key Hong Kong people has been
poorly received by managers and administrators, the individuals the package
was designed to attract, Angus Foster writes from Hong Kong.
Just fewer than 15,000 passports have been allocated for public sector
managers and administrators, the largest job category in the package. The
quota has been under-subscribed by about 10 per cent, according to Mr Donald
Tsang, director of administration.
The package was introduced last year under the British Nationality Act. It
was one of a series of measures designed to restore confidence in Hong Kong,
severely shocked by the crackdown against pro-democracy demonstrators in
Peking in June 1989.
All the other job categories have been over-subscribed, some heavily. The
government received 1,000 applications from legal professionals by the time
the offer closed at the end of February against a quota for this category of
only 185.
Mr Tsang said the response by private sector managers and administrators was
not surprising because they were the only people who had to disclose details
about income.

FT  24 APR 91 / Kashmir guerrillas flourish under iron fist: India's brutal
methods have helped a small insurgency spread
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOUSEGO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE handful of armed separatists Indian security forces faced in Kashmir
three years ago have grown into groups of militants with a total strength
running into thousands and spread across the region.
They are now better armed, self-consciously revelling in the Kalashnikovs,
rocket-launchers, revolvers, handgrenades and automatic weapons captured
from Indian troops. Many are being trained in Pakistan and Afghanistan.
In Srinagar, the militants appear to have established 'no-go' areas in parts
of the city that are surrounded by Indian paramilitary forces, but into
which the Indians dare not go except in strength.
The most important factor boosting the militants' cause has been the harsh,
repressive measures used by Indian forces. Mr Girish Saxena, the governor of
the state, concedes the damage atrocities have done. 'In our efforts to keep
down the level of alienation and increase confidence,' he says, 'any excess
sets us back.'
Though security forces are showing more restraint in Srinagar and some other
towns, the governor's orders seem largely ignored in search operations
carried out in villages. India's paramilitary forces in the state are
overstretched, ill-disciplined and in-creasingly hardened to the use of
brutality.
As with most insurgency movements that have spread rapidly, the expansion of
the revolution has created its own disorders. There has been a mushrooming
of guerrilla factions - somewhat reminiscent of Lebanon - competing and
quarrelling among themselves.
What is clear is that the best armed and trained are the fundamentalist
groups like the Hezb-e-Mujahideen, which backs the Pakistani claim to the
valley . Militant groups impose their own system of 'taxation', levying
contributions at gunpoint from traders and businessmen.
They intimidate officials to ensure that taxes, telephone and electricity
bills remain unpaid. Increasingly they determine what new appointments are
made and how funds (made available from New Delhi) are spent.
They have destroyed whatever hopes there were of reviving tourism this year
by kidnapping two Swedes.
Other pillars of the economy - handicrafts and the marketing of fresh fruit
 -have also been crippled. Wealthier Kashmiri Moslems are leaving the
valley, announcing their departures as temporary.
The governor, and some of his officials, see encouraging signs in growing
public weariness of the tension and disruption. In Srinagar there has been a
strong popular reaction against the recent wave of kidnappings. A large
crowd turned out recently for the funeral of a senior police official shot
in Srinagar. More people are seeking the administration's help in face of
the difficulties of daily life.
Intelligence reports apparently indicate that some of the militant groups
are ready to respond to Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar's offer of talks.
Individual militants are said to be fed up with a struggle that they - no
more than the Indian forces - can win militarily, and which will probably
lead to their own death.
'People now believe - and this goes for 90 per cent of the population - that
this course of armed violence cannot achieve any objective. It is bound to
fail,' says Mr Saxena.
In these circumstances he adds: 'The (government's) objective is to give a
chance to anyone who is prepared to join the mainstream and take part in the
political process.'
But hopes of meaningful talks with the militants that could bring about a
political solution still seem to be wishful thinking. There is no government
in New Delhi with the authority to make concessions. The main political
parties are deeply divided over how much autonomy India is willing to grant
to a Moslem-dominated area on Pakistan's borders.
There are equally deep divisions between the military and the civilian
leadership in Kashmire over the balance to be struck between the use of the
carrot and the stick. Mr Saxena, who became governor a year ago, clearly
favours more carrot. But the ill-trained and often ill-educated paramilitary
forces on which he depends are more familiar with the more blunt methods of
torture and brutality. That way the insurgency continues to spread.

<TEXT>
GROWTH in India's gross domestic product is projected to slow down this year
to less than 4 per cent for the first time in six years.
The Reserve Bank of India expects GDP to rise this year by 'not more than 4
per cent', against 4.5 per cent in the previous two years, reflecting
uncertainties that grip the economy. Mr S. Venkitaramanan, the bank
governor, said yesterday that the difficult balance of payments situation,
and the consequent disruption in the flow of imported inputs, will slow
industrial growth, although agriculture is expected to maintain its growth
rate.
Cash deposits for opening letters of credit for certain categories of
imports are now fixed at a stiff 200 per cent, up by half, to ease pressure
on foreign exchange reserves. The World Bank has convened a meeting of donor
countries in Washington on May 1 to provide emergency aid to India.

Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN INCREASING number of western governments prepared yesterday to reinforce
their military presence in Iraq, Turkey and Iran as part of the
international effort to save the lives of Kurdish refugees.
Iraq, meanwhile, formally asked the United Nations to take control of the
'safe havens' being established by US forces in northern Iraq.
Britain is to send the 29 Commando Regiment of the Royal Artillery to the
Turkey-Iraq border to join other elements of 3 Commando Brigade, defence
sources say. They will take 105mm guns which can be slung under a Chinook
helicopter.
US defence officials confirmed that the US had sent a naval battle group,
including the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt, from the Red Sea to the
Mediterranean as a warning to Iraq not to interfere with the refugee
operation.
In Paris yesterday, Mr Tom King, the British defence secretary, agreed with
Mr Pierre Joxe, his French counterpart to instruct their military staff to
look into the possibility of extending refugee operations further east
towards the border with Iran.
Iraqi forces have remained in the northern Iraqi town of Zakho, defying US
orders to move away and increasing tension in the area around the sites of
the proposed refugee camps.
'Intimidation levels are really growing,' US Marine Staff Sergeant Lee
Tibbetts told reporters at Silopi on the Turkish side of the border. 'It's a
very, very tricky situation. I'm telling you, it's getting wild over there.'
It is estimated that hundreds of refugees are still dying each day in the
mountains despite the increased flow of international aid, and US officials
are hoping to start moving people back to their homes or to the camps in
Iraq in the next few days. Several armies have started to contribute to the
relief effort.
French paratroopers have set up an outpost near Zakho; Chancellor Helmut
Kohl of Germany said yesterday that German troops would build a refugee camp
in northern Iran; Spain is expected to send 500 soldiers to the area within
a week, and Norway is considering a US request to send troops; Canadian,
Belgian, Dutch and Italian troops are also involved. The Iraqi government,
while criticising the US-led relief effort in Iraq as an infringement of the
country's sovereignty, has not so far intervened militarily and continues to
negotiate with Kurdish opposition leaders and to talk of political reforms.
Yesterday the Iraqi news agency reported that the ruling Revolutionary
Command Council had decreed that the cabinet would take on constitutional
powers previously reserved for President Saddam Hussein.
The decision by Kurdish organisations to begin negotiations with Mr Saddam's
regime has been sharply criticised by other opposition groups which say he
cannot be trusted.
In the south, Shia Moslems - whose uprising in early March was crushed by
government forces - continue to announce guerrilla attacks.
The Iranian news agency yesterday quoted refugees arriving from southern
Iraq as saying opposition forces clash nightly with Republican Guards in
Shia Moslem areas. Fighting over the previous two nights took place in
Basra, Tanumah and Qurnah, with a number of government soldiers killed and
military equipment destroyed, the agency said.

FT  24 APR 91 / De Klerk urges UK business to back economic launch pad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN, Africa Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT F W de Klerk yesterday offered South Africa's opposition parties
'a voice' in decision-making during the transition to a new constitution and
urged British businessman to help South Africa become an economic 'launching
pad' for the region.
In two keynote speeches Mr de Klerk vigorously proclaimed the emergence of a
'new South Africa', called for an end to economic sanctions, painted a
vision of a prosperous post-apartheid southern Africa, and defended his
efforts to end political violence in the country.
Mr de Klerk made clear in a speech at the Royal Institute for International
Affairs that the ruling National Party envisaged an important post-apartheid
role for itself. 'My government is committed to the sharing of power,' he
said, but added: 'and wholly opposed to surrendering it unconditionally.'
Earlier in the day he also firmly rejected the African National Congress's
call for an interim government.
He went part of the way towards meeting their demand, however, when he said:
'We are prepared to consider certain transitional arrangements at both the
legislative and the executive levels in order to give the leaders of the
various negotiating parties a voice in the formulation of important policy
decisions.'
At a press conference at the start of the day, Mr de Klerk argued that
political reform had to be be underpinned by a vibrant economy that would in
part depend on the lifting of sanctions and new investment capital from
abroad.
'We are now positioned for . . . an economic take-off provided that the
necessary investment is made and the necessary industrialisation takes
place,' he said.
'We don't ask for handouts, we don't ask for donations,' he continued: 'We
ask that all impediments be removed and then we have no doubt that we will
get the flow of private sector investment because of the opportunities that
our economy . . . offers to them.'
Mr de Klerk's economic message was taken up again later in the day during an
address to the Institute of Directors. After calling for a restoration of
sporting links with Britain, he spoke of the potential of southern Africa.
He warned that 'economic growth and constitutional reform must be mutually
reinforcing' saying that 'unless the pressing problems of poverty and the
unemployed are addressed, elegant constitutional models will be of little
avail.'
Mr de Klerk met for the first time Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour Party leader,
who afterwards said it was still too soon to lift sanctions.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of the first long-term contracts for the reconstruction of Kuwait seems
set to be awarded to Waste Management, the largest waste services company in
the US.
Chicago-based Waste Management looks likely to be given one of the world's
biggest clean-up jobs - clearing the debris left by the Iraqis from the
streets of Kuwait City. So far, the Kuwaiti authorities have awarded mainly
short-term emergency contracts, but Mr George Villasana, Waste Management's
vice-president for the Middle East, said he was in the final stages of
negotiating a one-year contract.
Immediately after the defeat of Iraq, Waste Management crossed into Kuwait
with 30 vehicles and 60 labourers and began to clean up a suburb of Kuwait
City, even though it then had no contract from the Kuwaiti authorities. The
company has since been awarded a month-long contract worth about Dollars 4m
(Pounds 2.2m) to clean part of Kuwait. It has brought about 450 workers,
mainly from the Indian sub-continent, into Kuwait to do this.
Mr Villasana said he was now negotiating a year-long contract worth well
over Dollars 10m to clean the majority of Kuwait City, including almost all
the central districts. The rest of the work will be divided between five
Saudi companies.
The company will have to demolish pill boxes and clear away burnt-out cars.
Mr Villasana said he aimed to return the streets to a semblance of normality
within two months.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S Environment Agency has challenged the country's powerful automotive
lobby by calling on citizens to review their use of cars and to place
greater reliance on sea and rail transport for domestic freight haulage.
The targeting of trucks and cars as a growing source of Japan's air
pollution problems is a particular embarrassment for the car industry, which
has recently embraced environmental themes in domestic advertising
campaigns.
The Japanese cabinet yesterday approved a white paper from the agency, which
argued for increased use of electric and methanol cars, and concluded that
carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide problems will not improve unless there is
less reliance on cars.
Japan's car makers have been leaders in improving fuel efficiency and
reducing emission levels, but the Environment Agency suggested that a more
fundamental change needs to be made to the country's car culture.
Mr Toshiro Kojima, the agency's director of planning, said said the tax
structure should be revised to encourage environmentally friendly forms of
transport.
He said that the increased use of diesel trucks had contributed to pollution
problems, and haulage companies would be reluctant to trade-in their diesels
while that fuel remains about 30 per cent cheaper than petrol.
'Many trucking companies are small or medium in size, and owners don't want
to discard their present trucks. We have to provide some tax incentives to
change this situation,' Mr Kojima said.
The proposals must be approved by the more influential Ministry of
International Trade and Industry and Transport Ministry before legislation
can be drafted. The latter has made clear it will oppose changes that would
put haulage companies at any disadvantage

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JAMES BAKER, the US secretary of state, is to make an unscheduled visit
to the Soviet Union today to seek closer co-ordination in his efforts to
revive the stalled Middle East peace process.
Washington is looking to Moscow to help it build momentum for the peace
effort. A US plan envisages Soviet co-sponsorship of a regional peace
conference as an opening to direct talks between Israel and the Arabs.
Mr Baker, currently in Damascus, flies to the Caucusus spa town of
Kislovodsk today for a meeting tomorrow with Mr Alexander Bessmertnykh, his
Soviet counterpart. Mr Baker is expected to discuss under what circumstances
Moscow would be prepared to normalise relations with Israel, suspended
during the 1967 six-day war.
Mr Baker has been pushing for 'confidence-building' measures on both the
Arab and Israeli sides pending a formal resumption of peace efforts. Moscow
says it will resume full diplomatic ties with Israel once the Israelis agree
to participate in an international conference on the Middle East. A
spokesman for Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the Israeli prime minister, said Mr Baker
had advised that he would follow up his Soviet discussions at a meeting with
Mr Shamir on Friday.
Mr Baker, whose latest Middle East peace shuttle - his third in six weeks -
is aimed at drawing Israel and the Arabs into direct talks, has not made
conspicuous progress. But neither the Arabs, including the Palestinians, nor
Israel has rejected his peace conference proposal. The Arab side is urging
the US to exert real pressure on Israel to co-operate in a genuine peace
effort.
Mr Baker has been careful to avoid publicly criticising Israel, but there
may come a point in the next few weeks when Washington will be obliged to
use additional leverage with the Israelis.
Mr Baker is also likely to discuss the problems surrounding the holding of a
US-Soviet summit - - a summit which the Nato countries have said will not be
held until the Soviet Union agrees to observe clauses in the conventional
forces reduction (CFE) treaty which Nato says it is presently flouting,
writes John Lloyd in Moscow.
This includes the redesignation of army divisions as marines to escape the
terms of the treaty, and moving tanks east of the Urals.
However, Mr Vitaly Churkin, the foreign ministry spokesman, said yesterday
that 'the CFE problems are ones that we both want resolved before the summit
will take place. A solution can be found and I don't think it is far away.
As far as we are concerned a summit should be held by June.'

   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Polish government has committed itself to maintaining tight controls on
money supply this year in return for credits of Dollars 1.6bn over three
years, according to a letter of intent to the International Monetary Fund.
The letter - accepted last week by the IMF's Board of Management - shows
that Poles can expect an additional Dollars 325m loan to cover the increased
costs of oil imports this year.
A quarter of the Dollars 1.6bn IMF loan is to be used cover the costs of a
debt reduction agreement Poland is seeking with 400 or so western banks, to
which it owes Dollars 11bn.
The upper limit on Poland's new foreign borrowing this year is set at
Dollars 1.5bn and, despite an expected fall in the rate of growth of exports
and higher import costs, foreign currency reserves are to grow by Dollars
700m.
The letter also promises to keep Poland's present dollar/zloty exchange rate
'as one of the main points of' the government's anti-inflation strategy.
Domestic money supply is to grow in nominal terms by 43 per cent this year
against a 36 per cent forecast inflation rate. Wages in state owned
industries are to be permitted to rise by no more than 60 per cent of the
increase in prices. Should the inflation rate increase more than expected
then these controls will be tightened.
The budget deficit is to be no higher than Zl 6,000bn or 0.5 per cent of
GDP, while the supply of credit to the rest of the economy is to grow in
real terms by 19 per cent.
Poland's stock exchange saw trading in shares from the Krosno glass works
suspended yesterday when sellers exceeded buyers. Under the rules the price
will be fixed 10 per cent below last week's to await the next session in
seven days time.

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl yesterday pledged his support for Berlin as Germany's
future seat of government.
He said a move to Berlin, already the official capital, would need 10 to 15
years to complete and Bonn should retain a number of important ministries,
including defence.
The chancellor's surprise decision will boost Berlin's chances of again
becoming the seat of government. Before his announcement, Bonn was thought
to be favoured by a slim majority of members in the Bundestag, the lower
house of parliament, and by most of the west German Lander (states).
It was decided yesterday that the Bundestag will conduct a free vote on the
issue on June 20. The Bundesrat, the upper house, will vote the following
day.
Mr Kohl, trying to regain the political initiative after his party's defeat
in a state election on Sunday, said a government in Berlin would be in a
better position to help overcome the division between the two parts of
Germany.
The announcement may help to boost Mr Kohl's flagging popularity in east
Germany where many voters equate a pro-Berlin view with a vote of confidence
in the east. The timing of his announcement was probably determined by last
Sunday's election in Rhineland-Palatinate. The state borders on Bonn, and Mr
Kohl would not have wanted to make his views clear before the votes were
cast.
Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister and leader of the pro-Bonn,
Bavarian-based Christian Social Union, said he regretted the announcement
and insisted that he had no money available to finance the move, costed at
anything between DM5bn (Pounds 1.7bn) and DM100bn.
Mr Waigel said he would have preferred a compromise, dividing functions
between the two cities.

FT  24 APR 91 / Banks step in to stem dollar's advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONCERTED DOLLAR sales by European central banks and weak economic news from
the US yesterday took some of the steam out of the dollar's rise.
Eleven central banks, spearheaded by the German Bundesbank, took action to
support the D-Mark with large bouts of dollar sales around midday in
European trading.
The German currency, stricken by domestic political shocks and economic
uncertainty, has been the main victim of the dollar. The US unit's rise has
quickened as signs of an emerging economic recovery have rapidly followed
the end of the Gulf war.
Traders reported that the central banks of Finland, Norway and Denmark as
well as the UK, Italy and France were selling dollars, pushing down the US
currency about 2 1/2 pfennigs in Europe.
The action possessed an element of surprise. The markets had to begun to
believe that the Bundesbank was against intervention while the Federal
Reserve was content with the level of US interest rates.
There was no apparent trigger point for the intervention but the banks were
thought to have been spurred by the currency's French fixing at DM1.7580,
the 16-month high it set on Monday.
The attempt to cap the dollar was aided by news that there was an
unexpectedly large 6.2 per cent drop in new orders for US manufactured
durable goods last month.
Analysts said the intervention was likely to have only a very limited
effect. Further dollar strength and D-Mark weakness were in store.
In New York, the dollar closed at DM1.7435, after finishing at DM1.7420 in
London, where it had closed at Dollars 1.766 on Monday.
On Wall Street the economic news, and comments by the Fed chairman about
interest rate policy, had a damping effect on share prices after a string of
strong first-quarter company results spurred a modest recovery. The Dow
Jones Industrial Average closed 2.73 higher at 2,930.45.

FT  24 APR 91 / New council tax may set stage for autumn poll: Two out of
three households will be better off says government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday signalled a return to the political offensive in
the run up to the general election with the claim that its new
property-based council tax would leave two out of three households better
off.
As Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, formally administered
the last rites to the poll tax in the House of Commons, cabinet colleagues
predicted that the stage was set for an autumn election.
Mr Chris Patten, the Conservative party chairman, greeted the announcement
with the pledge that: 'We now have the opportunity, which we intend to
seize, to go on the attack'. Another senior minister said: 'We have not only
shot the fox but we have buried it six feet under'.
The details of the council tax - which will be levied on the capital value
of houses and flats slotted into seven nationally-set bands - marked the
final break with the policy which Mrs Margaret Thatcher had once dubbed her
flagship.
An avalanche of figures for every local authority in England, Scotland and
Wales suggested that two out of three households would face bills of less
than Pounds 400 a year if the new system were in place this year. The claims
were fiercely rejected by Labour, which said the new system would be
impractical and unfair.
Local authority associations were split, with praise from the
Conservative-controlled Association of District Councils balanced by sharp
criticism from the Labour-dominated Association of Metropolitan Authorities.
Mr Bryan Gould, Labour's shadow environment spokesman, said that the
government's proposals meant that the poll tax would remain at least until
1993. He said that Labour's 'fair rates' plan would bring quicker and bigger
savings for the voters.
The Institute of Revenues, Rating and Valuation described the government's
timetable as 'tight'.
Mr Heseltine confirmed that properties would be classified in seven bands -
from the cheapest, worth less than Pounds 40,000, to the most expensive
valued at over Pounds 160,000.
The valuations would be contracted out to private companies but overseen by
the Inland Revenue's valuation office. Households in the lowest band would
pay about two-thirds the amount of those in the the middle band - based on
the average property value in England of Pounds 80,000.
At the other end of the scale those in the highest band would pay about
two-thirds more. The key elements of the tax would apply also to Scotland
and Wales, although there might be technical differences.
The illustrative figures produced by Mr Heseltine - hotly contested by Mr
Gould - indicated that the new tax would bring an average bill for the
cheapest property with two adults of Pounds 200 this year against Pounds 668
for one in the highest band.
The environment secretary confirmed that single-person households would
receive a 25 per cent discount, an element designed to reduce the burden on
elderly people living alone.
The decision to base the tax on the assumption of two-person properties was
attacked by Labour, however, as a political fudge designed to placate
supporters of the poll tax within the government's own ranks.
Ministers conceded that the new system would redistribute the burden of
local taxation from the north of England to more affluent areas in the
south. Households in many Tory marginal constituencies in the North West
will be among the main beneficiaries. The political calculation is that
although Tory voters in the south will be the main losers, the ceiling on
the amount that councils will be allowed to levy from each of the seven
bands will cushion the impact.
Mr Heseltine - who also published details of his plan to set up a local
government commission to lead a move towards the creation of single-tier
authorities - added that the government would retain its powers to cap
high-spending authorities.
While the key points of the new local tax are not negotiable in a
consultation period which is due to last until June, the government is far
more open to suggestions on the future structure of local government.
Mr Patten will signal his determination to regain the political initiative
in the run-up to the general election at a press conference early this
morning.
Ministers believe that the proposals may have come too late to have a
decisive impact on next month's local elections, and most have all but ruled
out a June general election.
Most appear convinced, however, that with the poll tax behind them and
further falls in inflation and mortgage rates expected over the next few
months, Mr John Major should be in a position to call an election in the
autumn.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
COUNCIL TAX - MAIN POINTS
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
A council tax will replace the poll tax in April 1993.
It will reflect the capital value of a property occupied by two adults
and give a 25 per cent discount to single people.
Property will be valued in seven bands based on value.
Payment in the top band will be limited to 2.5 times that of the bottom
band.
There will be a single bill for each household.
Poor people will be protected by discounts.
There will be no minimum contribution.
Second homes will receive a discount of 50 per cent.

FT  24 APR 91 / End of recession in sight chancellor tells directors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN LAMONT, the Chancellor, yesterday tried to convince a sceptical
and occasionally critical audience of 3,000 executives that an end to the
recession was in sight.
He told the Institute of Directors' annual convention at London's Royal
Albert Hall he expected a recovery in output - 'albeit relatively slowly at
first' - in the second half of the year.
He believed his first budget and the recent reductions in interest rates
would help pave the way for an improvement in business optimism. The
government, he stressed, was on course to achieve a sharp and sustained
reduction in inflation, although unemployment would continue to rise after
conditions began to improve.
The chancellor sat down to respectable applause but immediately found
himself on the defensive in a question-and-answer session. .
He denied that ministers were 'going soft' on the need to control public
expenditure and reaffirmed their determination to cut personal taxes in the
medium-term.
After Mr Lamont left, the government's handling of the economy came under
heavy fire from sections of a traditionally supportive gathering which
appeared still to be in mourning for Mrs Margaret Thatcher.
Mr Peter Morgan, IoD director-general, led the criticism, claiming that
Britain's business renaissance had been 'torpedoed by runaway inflation'.
Governments, he said, should be expected to deliver zero inflation but they
were too often prepared to fuel it to win elections.
He added: 'This awful recession . . . is a failure of government economic
management. It is a government failure, not market failure'.
He attacked the government for failing to cut income tax further. The 20p
target had 'moved from the realm of commitment and conviction to 'jam
tomorrow' rhetoric'.
Mr Robert Horton, chairman of British Petroleum, expressed surprise and
regret that after 12 years in power the government still had to make the
conquering of inflation its first priority. But he stressed that government
alone was not to blame. Management had often 'let free enterprise down'.
The tussle later transferred to the Commons, where Mr Neil Kinnock, the
Labour leader, taunted Mr John Major, the prime minister, with Mr Morgan's
remarks. He said the IoD also realised the recession was 'hand-made in
Downing Street'. As a former chancellor, the prime minister had to bear 'a
special, personal burden of guilt'.
Mr Major dismissed the accusation. Far from 'flattening' the economy, the
government was flattening inflation and interest rates, he said.

FT  24 APR 91 / Beazer plans debt cut by floating UK business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BEAZER, the heavily-borrowed construction and building materials group,
yesterday announced plans to float its UK businesses and then sell up to
half the shares in the new company for up to Pounds 250m.
Mr John Matthews, chief executive, said the plan would require the approval
of shareholders, the stock exchange and the group's bankers.
Funds from the share issue would be used to reduce Beazer's large US
borrowings - most of which were raised to finance the Dollars 1.7bn
acquisition of Koppers cement and aggregates business in March 1988.
If the plan went ahead, the share sale would be likely to take place between
June and September of this year. The new company, to be called Beazer
Europe, would include all the group's UK housing, contracting and commercial
property businesses.
It has not been decided whether to offer shares in the new company solely to
existing shareholders or to make them available also to new investors.
The UK businesses, which have an estimated net asset value of about Pounds
400m, generated Pounds 72.7m out of total group operating profits of Pounds
189.8m in the 12 months to June 30, 1990. On the stock market, Beazer's
shares closed 4p higher at a new high for the year of 185p after the
announcement.
This gave the group a total stock market value of just under Pounds 500m
compared with an implied price tag under the flotation plans of about the
same amount for the UK businesses alone.
Mr Matthews said the group believed its current share price substantially
undervalued the group's businesses. Shareholders were likely to achieve
better value by splitting the company, he said.  The proposals would leave
the group owning a large US cement, concrete and aggregate business and
maintaining a controlling interest in its former UK operations. Beazer's
last annual accounts, for the year to June 30, 1990, showed net debts of
Pounds 880.5m mostly in the US. This compared with shareholders' funds of
about Pounds 1bn.
The group, which last month announced a 31 per cent fall in pre-tax profits
to Pounds 43.2m during the six months to the end of December, has said that
net debt should be reduced to about Pounds 750m by the end of June this year
following a series of disposals and joint ventures in the US.
Beazer said that, at the last count, about 40 per cent of its shares were
held by US investors. Analysts believe the proportion of US investors is now
nearer half.
Mr Matthews said the group would have to think carefully about where it
would be domiciled should it end up with its core assets and the majority of
its shareholders in the US.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OPTIONS market was subdued yesterday as dealers waited for an
announcement from the London Traded Options Market and the London
International Financial Futures Exchange on the merger of the two markets.
None was immediately forthcoming, but the market was alive with speculation
about its future. Floor dealers were resigned to some upheaval in the
depressed traded options market, but reports of the plan to move all equity
options on to a screen-based system still caused surprise.
Turnover remained depressed on the options market with total business just
24,467 contracts. Analysts reckon LTOM needs 30,000 contracts traded per day
to break even.
Shell July 550 call options were actively traded as the shares advanced
following strong figures by US oil majors. A total of 2,201 options changed
hands, equivalent to 2.2m shares.
Marks and Spencer traded 1,547, mostly April 260 calls. Hanson was boosted
by activity in May 220 puts.
On the futures market, the June FT-SE 100 index contract finished 21 points
up at 2,527. But its premium to the spot index ended at just 21 points,
against the 30 points brokers estimate is necessary to take account of
futures dividend payments and financing cost.

FT  24 APR 91 / World Stock Markets: Frankfurt waits for the dark days to
pass - Andrew Fisher looks for the good news which might inspire the German
stock market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS YEAR has been fairly dispiriting for the German stock market. While the
west German economy remains strong, its growth is slowing down. In east
Germany, the dismantling of the old communist system is causing immense
industrial and social strains. And recession abroad, coupled in the case of
the US with a rising dollar, has bit deeply into export earnings.
On top of all this, the political climate has turned sour with the defeat of
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic party (CDU) in his home state
of Rhineland-Palatinate.
As well as demonstrating that voters had lost confidence in the government's
handling of affairs after unity - they certainly disliked tax increases
after promises that these could be avoided - the state election also removed
its majority in the upper house of Parliament (Bundesrat).
Thus the Bonn cabinet could find life tougher in the months ahead, since the
Bundesrat has the power of veto over legislation, including tax.
Yet the stock market outlook is by no means all gloomy. Some analysts feel
the time may be ripe for foreign institutional investors to pay more
attention to the German market, since it has so clearly failed to keep pace
with other exchanges.
'People are underweight in a market which has underperformed,' says Ms
Katrin Kandell, an analyst at the London office of Sal. Oppenheim, the
German bank. 'They are starting to look at 1992. There has to be some
positive news in the next six months.'
What could that be? Indications of a bottoming out in the east German
economic slump could be one element. Another could be evidence that the
knocks which west German exporters have taken over the past year are
becoming less painful.
Degab, the investment analysis offshoot of Deutsche Bank, recently forecast
that German corporate earnings would rise by around 8 per cent next year
after declines of 5 per cent in 1990 and 1 per cent in 1991; in 1989, they
grew by 13 per cent.
Two sectors which have been especially buffeted by the problems on export
markets, chemicals and cars, are expected to show a marked improvement next
year, while the surge in retail and consumer companies' profits should ease
and construction, helped by the rebuilding of east Germany, should remain
strong.
Germany's construction companies are currently enjoying a prolonged boom,
with business in the west also vigorous. A study by the Frankfurt office of
Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the UK stockbrokers, shows that seven out of the
German companies with the best liquidity ratios are from this sector. They
also have valuable land and property assets, which are considerably
understated in their balance sheets.
BZW's German Company Handbook gives a good illustration of the financial
solidity of German corporations. Out of 138 companies covered, 53 have no
gearing at all and only 21 have any net debt.
Moreover, 58 of them finance all capital spending through cash flow. Thus
those with heavy future commitments in east Germany, such as RWE and Veba,
the energy concerns, have plenty of scope for internal funding.
Mr Harry Christopoulos, a BZW analyst, says: 'German companies have lots of
assets and low gearing.' Also, adds Ms Kandell, more of them are using their
property port-folios for development projects, thus unlocking some of their
value.
Her hope is that German companies, prompted by the demands of east German
investment or the desire to ward off unfriendly takeovers, will start to pay
more attention to their share prices. At present, they can lower their tax
bills by salting away profits in reserves and thus understating earnings.
One day, though, EC tax harmonisation may change all that.

FT  24 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent registers a
progressive recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOURSES showed a modestly progressive recovery yesterday, measured by
half-hourly gains on the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index which an improved start
for Wall Street, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT recovered nearly all of Monday's losses as domestic institutions
and officialdom reconsidered the implications of the CDU's Rhineland
Palatinate election defeat on Sunday, and as the market digested results
from Daimler and Siemens (on Monday) and Hoechst yesterday.
There was also some speculation in industrials after Germany's
constitutional court ruled that compensation should be paid to former owners
of east German property seized under 1945-49 Soviet military occupation.
Reversing the pattern of Monday's declines, a modest rise in the FAZ index,
5.73 to 676.76, was followed by a 25.14, or 1.6 per cent gain in the DAX to
1,597.05 at the close. Volume rose from DM5bn to DM6bn, reflecting domestic
institutional buying.
Daimler led carmakers up with a DM15 rise to DM695.50. Ms Barbara Altmann,
of B Metzler in Frankfurt, said buyers were more interested in the higher
dollar, and the big exporter's recovery prospects, than last year's fall in
profits. Siemens rose DM14.20 to DM597.50 although some pundits were
forecasting lower profits for the current year on Monday.
Hoechst held its DM13 dividend, and rose DM7.80 to DM264.50. Its former
parent, IG Farben, the shell of the giant which grouped Germany's chemical
industry before and during World War II, rose DM3.20 or 12.4 per cent to
DM29 on the land compensation court ruling.
PARIS started the new account on a firm footing but turnover showed no
significant improvement, which raised doubts that the recovery would
persist. The CAC-40 index rose 14.63 or 0.8 per cent to close at 1,781.83 on
volume estimated at around FFr2bn.
Alcatel, which lost ground towards the close of the previous account,
recovered FFr9 to FFr577 with 322,515 shares traded, and Peugeot added FFr7
to FFr550 with 152,925 shares exchanged. Among the second-liners, Moulinex,
which is thought to have a rights issue in prospect, jumped FFr8 or 6.8 per
cent to FFr125.50 with 76,400 shares traded. Carrefour went against the
market, losing FFr6 to FFr3,720 following its unconvincing general meeting
on Monday.
MILAN had a repeat performance of the previous day, with continued
profit-taking in the insurance and banking sectors and further gains in
shares controlled by Mr Carlo de Benedetti. The Comit index fell 2.82 to
593.17 in volume estimated at slightly above Monday's meagre L138bn.
Mediobanca fell L25 to L16,190 and Generali lost L200 to L37,900.
Cir, Mr De Benedetti's holding company, gained L50 to L2,660 in spite of a
one-day delay in the talks with Mr Silvio Berlusconi on resolving their
dispute for control of Mondadori. Olivetti, the computer manufacturer,
advanced L25 to L3,870.
ZURICH moved on the Frankfurt market, the Credit Suisse index closing 4.8
higher at 554.8. There was some foreign buying but volume, overall, held at
a modest level, reflecting the lack of movement in interest rates, and
gyrations in the dollar after central bank intervention.
Among chemicals, Ciba-Geigy registered rose SFr70 to SFr2,510. The company
said that the effects of the strong dollar will not show until the second
half of this year.
STOCKHOLM recovered from a weak opening to close mostly unchanged after a
choppy session. Share prices rose, and domestic interest rates eased, on
relief that the revised national 1991/92 budget did not contain any
surprises. The Affarsvarlden general index advanced 8.6 to 1,066.7 and
volume rose to SKr379m from SKr264m. Ericsson was the most active share. Its
free B shares rose SKr6 to SKr198 in volume of SKr55m.
SKF free B's were SKr0.50 lower at SKr92.50 after the company reported a 92
per cent decline in pre-tax profit in the first quarter to SKr59m, at the
low end of expectations.
MADRID rose and the stronger dollar gave an extra lift to issues with ADR
facilities. Repsol closed Pta45 higher at Pta2,600, Endesa gained Pta25 to
Pta2,435 but Telefonica put on a mere Pta3 to Pta996. The general index
closed 1.92 higher at 281.50 in low volume of Pta9.9bn, after Monday's
Pta15.4bn.
AMSTERDAM was led higher by Royal Dutch which briefly hit an all-time high
of Fl 159.10 before closing Fl 2.30 better at Fl 158.40. The equity market
was also boosted by the good reception of the new 15-year government bond.
The CBS tendency index closed 1.3 or 1.4 per cent firmer at 95.4.
OSLO continued its slide in moderate trading, with shipping the weakest
sector as the all-share index fell 2.41 to 472.53.

FT  24 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei recoups losses on
futures-related buying
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE PRICES fell initially on news of a leasing company in financial
trouble, but staged a recovery later on futures-related buying. Activity
remained dull ahead of the Golden Week holidays next week, when the market
will be open only on Tuesday to Thursday, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225-share average closed up 254.56 at 26,491.57 after losing 305
points on Monday. The index started on a weak note and recorded a day's low
of 26,078.31 on reports that Shizushin Lease had filed for court protection
under the bankruptcy law, as a result of its extensive loans to faltering
real estate companies. Investment trusts came in as buyers at that level and
the index reached a day's high of 26,568.89.
Volume picked up to 360m shares from 250m as some investors were encouraged
by expectations of Y7bn worth of cash coming into the market from new
investment trust funds due to be set up at the end of the week.
Declines still led gains at the close by 562 to 392, with 176 issues
unchanged, but the Topix index of all first section stocks put on 6.99 to
1,982.52. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 1.65 to 1,501.76.
Mr Yoichi Kamina at SG Warburg said there was no evident change in
sentiment, and buying was for technical reasons. 'We expect the market to go
up after Golden Week, so it is not surprising that some investors wanted to
buy at the lower levels,' he added.
Mr John Courtney at WI Carr said investors were cautious, and did not expect
a big market move until publication of corporate results which could give it
new direction.
Focus moved back to large-capital stocks, depressed recently by the interest
rate uncertainty. Kobe Steel rallied Y13 to Y552 and Nippon Steel firmed Y1
to Y472.
Companies which were reported to be creditors of Shizushin Lease lost ground
in the morning but recovered in the afternoon. Mitsui Trust Bank opened Y20
lower at Y1,450, but closed up Y40 at Y1,510. Tokio Marine &amp; Fire, which
holds a 5 per cent stake in Shizushin, lost Y20 at the opening but closed up
Y10 at Y1,350.
Nippon Yakin Kogyo fell Y40 to Y1,000 on profit-taking. The issue has risen
recently on buy recommendations from major Japanese brokers, on the back of
strong earnings for the current year.
High-priced shares which had been popular on favourable earnings forecasts
lost ground as interest turned to big board issues. Family Mart, the
convenience store chain, receded Y200 to Y10,600, and Keyence, the measuring
equipment maker, lost Y200 to Y16,500.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 287.61 to 29,269.64, its fourth decline in a
row, on volume of 30.9m shares. Investors who had bought shares for the
short term took profits.
New Japan Chemical rose Y30 to Y1,180. The company expects sales of its
additive which raises the transparency of polypropylene to double to Y3bn
for the current year.
Roundup
MAJOR EXTERNAL influences on the Pacific Basin, Wall Street overnight and
Tokyo, were in conflict yesterday and a number of markets reflected this.
HONG KONG, which dipped to an intraday low of 3,549, was pushed briefly into
positive territory by bargain hunting, but closed with the Hang Seng index a
net 12.85 lower at 3,569.64. Turnover eased from HKDollars 1.41bn to
HKDollars 1.28bn.
Property shares and the commercial and industrial sector posted moderate
losses, while banks and utilities were narrowly mixed.
Traders were keeping an eye on the airport issue, where there is now the
debate that a private sector solution to the stalemate in negotiations
between the Colony and China might be bad for the Hong Kong government but
good for the stock market.
SEOUL, which tested its January 4 low for 1991 of 614.60 on the composite
index with a 12.72 or 2 per cent fall on Monday, rebounded yesterday with a
jump of 22.23 or 3.6 per cent to 637.84. Turnover climbed too, but it was
still moderate after a rise from Won91.6bn to Won142.3bn.
The market has suffered from tight monetary conditions, but there was an
unofficial report of lower inflation from the Bank of Korea yesterday, and
subsequent talk of a loosening in monetary policy.
AUSTRALIA saw turnover rise from ADollars 202m to ADollars 233m as the All
Ordinaries index eased 2.4 to 1,510.5; a parcel of 5.66m shares in Advance
Bank Australia - 9 per cent of its share capital - was sold at ADollars 5.20
a share by ANZ Bank. Advance closed down 10 cents at ADollars 5.10.
TAIWAN retreated 1.6 per cent and broke a five-day winning run, the weighted
index sliding 91.91 to 5,732.09. BANGKOK followed Wall Street down, the SET
index losing 15.71 to 893.19.
KARACHI registered record volume of 4.8m shares, up from 3.9m last Sunday
when the KSE index rose 24 to 1,675. A KSE spokesman said an additional
650,000 shares were traded after hours following news of further government
initiatives to boost exports and trim red tape.

FT  24 APR 91 / Money Markets: Europe rates steady
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
INTEREST RATES were steady in Europe yesterday after the German Bundesbank
set an unchanged fixed rate at a one-month securities repurchase agreement
tender and the Bank of Spain left its money market intervention rate
unchanged.
Wholesale rates in London were also stable as hopes of lower bank base rates
received the second setback in two day's. Monday's news of high retail sales
in March was followed yesterday by a larger than expected UK current account
deficit in the same month. Call money in Frankfurt was unchanged at 8.85 per
cent following the Bundesbank's offer of a securities repurchase agreement
tender at a fixed rate of 8.60 per cent. Dealers expect the supply of funds
to roughly match the DM10.8bn draining from the banking system today as an
earlier facility expires.
In Madrid the Bank of Spain supplied liquidity to the domestic money market
at an unchanged 13.5 per cent at the regular thrice-monthly repurchase
tender for central bank certificates.
In London three-month interbank was steady at 11 7/8 -11 3/4 per cent and
12-month money was unchanged at 11 7/16 -11 5/16 per cent.
On Liffe short sterling futures maintained a recent weaker trend. June
delivery opened unchanged at 88.64, but closed at 88.59.
Day-to-day credit remained in short supply on the cash market. The Bank of
England initially forecast a shortage of Pounds 1,350m, but revised this to
Pounds 1,200m at noon and to Pounds 1,250m in the afternoon. Total help of
Pounds 1,172m was provided.
In early operations the authorities bought Pounds 73m bank bills outright in
band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent. Before lunch another Pounds 124m bills were
purchased, by way of Pounds 47m bank bills in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent and
Pounds 77m bank bills in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent.
In the afternoon Pounds 975m bills were bought, via Pounds 1m Treasury bills
in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent, Pounds 545m bank bills in band 1 at 11 7/8 per
cent and Pounds 429m bank bills in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent.
Bills maturing in official hands, repayment of late assistance and a take-up
of Treasury bills drained Pounds 7m, with the unwinding of a repurchase
agreement on bills absorbing Pounds 1,374m and bank balances below target
Pounds 130m. These outweighed exchequer transactions adding Pounds 65m to
liquidity and a fall in the note circulation of Pounds 95m.

surpass UK

<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NORWAY will overtake Britain as Europe's biggest crude oil producer this
year, according to a report issued by Edinburgh-based County NatWest WoodMac
(CNWM), writes Karen Fossli in Oslo.
Norway's average crude oil and natural gas liquids (Ngl) production will
increase by 13 per cent over last year's level to 1.94m barrels a day.
By comparison, this year Britain will produce an average of 1.85m barrels a
day from offshore fields, a slight increase over the 1990 average level of
1.84m barrels.
Britain's production is hindered by annual maintenance shutdowns in May and
June and a loss of 200,000 barrels a day from the Brent field, where
installation of subsea emergency shutdown valves is taking place.
In the fourth quarter of this year Norwegian crude oil/Ngl production will
surge to around 2.1m barrels a day, its highest level ever, forecast CNWM.
This increase will stem from the coming on stream of the Oseberg North
field, which will produce 100,000 barrels a day of crude oil.

FT  24 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tin price forecast to rise by
50%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIN PRICES will rise by 50 per cent in the next 12 months from the current
low levels which make most of the industry unprofitable, forecasts the
Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) research group.
This is a less-optimistic prediction than the Association of Tin Producing
Countries (ATPC) and the EIU admits that there is 'a high probability' that
its forecasts will be wrong because 'at some stage it will no longer be
appropriate for consumers to keep stocks at a bare minimum.
'No one wants to anticipate that moment, but equally no one wants to be left
out once it arrives. When prices do rise, they will rise very sharply,' the
EIU warns in its latest World Commodity Forecasts report.
It predicts that tin prices will move up from an average Dollars 2.53 a lb
in the first quarter this year to Dollars 3.80 in April-June 1992.
Primary tin output will fall by nearly 12 per cent to 159,000 tonnes this
year because of cuts by producers.
Consumption is forecast to slip by 2.7 per cent to 175,500 tonnes, which
would imply a deficit in the west of 12,500 tonnes. Sales from the US
strategic stockpile and imports from the eastern bloc are expected by the
EIU to account for some of the deficit, leaving western stocks to be reduced
by 10,000 tonnes - well below the 13,000 tonnes hoped for by the ATPC.
The EIU expects next year's mine production to recover by more than
consumption - to 162,300 tonnes against consumption of 177,100 tonnes.
Stocks might fall again, by another 7,800 tonnes, the EIU suggests, putting
an upward pressure on prices.

FT  24 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: Bank chief hits at settlement
systems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SYSTEMS for settling securities transactions seldom allow for the transfer
of securities only against payment, whatever they may claim, Mr Pen Kent, an
executive director of the Bank of England, warned yesterday.
Speaking at a conference in London, Mr Kent said that many countries had
improved their settlement systems to meet the requirements laid down by the
G30. Status reports on the level of development in 21 countries around the
world will be produced by the G30 in the next few days, he said.
However, few had succeeded in developing a true system of delivery against
payment, in which cash is released only against the delivery of securities,
and vice versa. This leaves a residual risk in settlement systems which
appear to offer buyers and sellers full security, he said.
'Perfect synchronisation is very difficult to achieve,' Mr Kent warned. 'In
practice, settlement systems may well involve intermediaries explicitly or
implicitly guaranteeing the performance of the principals to overcome timing
inconsistencies.'
Ideally, he said, delivery versus payment should involve real-time transfer
of cash at the time of the trade, with payments being made gross rather than
netted out.
'More work needs to be done on delivery versus payment (DVP). I do not think
most systems do achieve DVP as I have described it,' he said. 'Many systems
exchange stock against some form of payment. Legal title, however, may not
be guaranteed. Payment may not be in immediate good funds. The system may
rely on the good name of an intermediary such as a bank or depository.'
Mr Kent added that regulations which will allow the development of Taurus,
the UK's long-delayed new settlement system, will be published within days.
The delay in the regulations, to be produced by Department of Trade and
Industry, has already meant that the introduction of Taurus has been put off
from October this year to next spring at the earliest.
Mr Kent warned that the regulations, when published, would be long and
detailed, but that they have been designed 'to minimise the changes to
existing legal rights and obligations.'

BARCLAYS de Zoete Wedd is closing its US equities operations and laying off
15 per cent of its staff, just a year after hiring a number of top-flight
analysts to set up the business.
The investment banking and securities arm of Britain's Barclays Bank said
yesterday that a detailed review had concluded that 'the cost of building
and maintaining a business in US equities wouldn't produce adequate returns
in the forseeable future.'
A BZW official in New York indicated that, even with the recent upturn in
the securities business, the firm had found it difficult to compete against
established US securities dealers with far greater resources.
She described the venture as an 'opportunistic act which proved untenable'.
The lay-offs affect 60 research, sales and support staff, most of them based
in New York.
The firm emphasised that its international equities business based in New
York will not be affected.

FT  24 APR 91 / International Bonds: C&amp;G steps into sterling floating rate
note sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHELTENHAM &amp; Gloucester Building Society stepped into the sterling floating
rate note sector of the international bond market yesterday with a Pounds
125m deal, increased from Pounds 100m, lead managed by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew.
The deal follows the reopening of the sector by the Woolwich Building
Society last week, after six months during which floating rate funding could
not be sold.
The four-year maturity of yesterday's issue was a year longer than the
Woolwich deal and tested the readiness of investors to lock into this
relatively illiquid market.
Lead managers responded to demands for higher fees from several firms and
offered eight basis points for underwriting, against four basis points last
week. However, several leading houses again declined to participate, arguing
that fees of around 10 basis points would be commensurate with underwriting
risk.
This did not appear to inhibit the progress of the deal however, with the
issuer regarded as one of the few improving credits in the sector. The paper
pays 15 basis points over the three month London interbank offered rate and
was reoffered to investors at the fixed price of 99.69. At this level, the
discounted margin is 24.5 basis points, very close to the return on the
three-year Woolwich deal.
The lead manager reported strong demand from UK institutional investors and
some demand from continental European investors.
Elsewhere, investors anticipating further appreciation of the dollar were
offered two virtually identical Dollars 200m three-year deals from
state-backed European financial institutions.
Credit Local de France came with an issue lead managed by J. P. Morgan
priced to yield 46 basis points over comparable US Treasury securities. Some
hours later, LKB Baden-Wuerttenberg offered paper via Nomura International
at a yield spread of 47 basis points over treasuries.
J Sainsbury, the UK food retailer, is to redeem its outstanding Pounds 150m,
5 per cent convertible capital bond issue on June 24. Investors holding
unconverted bonds can either switch into equity at the conversion price of
Pounds 2.62 or take a redemption payment. Under the redemption clause, the
bonds will be converted into preference shares, which will then be redeemed
at par, plus a premium of 3 per cent.

FT  24 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: Treuhand may breach borrowing
limit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN OFFICIAL in Bonn yesterday suggested that the Treuhand, the east German
state-backed privatisation agency, was likely to breach its borrowing limit
for 1991, possibly by DM3bn.
The agency, originally set a limit of DM25bn, is under pressure to extend
its financial safety net as the unemployment unleashed by its restructuring
programme becomes more controversial in the east.
The suggestion from Bonn came as the Treuhand confirmed plans to launch the
largest D-Mark commercial paper programme since the market opened at the
beginning of this year.
The DM2bn facility, arranged by Dresdner Bank with Deutsche Bank as
co-arranger, will cover the agency's short and medium-term requirements.
D-Mark commercial paper has only been allowed since the beginning of this
year, when the Bundesbank put aside its previous objections and a change in
law removed the constraint of seeking ministry of finance approval for each
issuance.
In addition to the Treuhand programme, six programmes are already in place
including DM500m for Daimler Benz, Germany's biggest industrial
conglomerate, DM500m for BMW, the car manufacturer and DM250m for Sudzucker,
the sugar company.
Daimler Benz kicked off the market in mid-February and outstandings already
amount to just under DM1bn. Much of the paper has been issued at the very
short end of the market from seven days upwards.
The Treuhand has said it will tap the market in maturities between seven
days and two years. Yesterday's programme marks the first incursion of
another bank as arranger into a market which to date Deutsche Bank,
Germany's largest, had managed to keep to itself. On four of the other six
deals Deutsche had acted as sole dealer as well as arranger. JP Morgan and
Westdeutsche Landesbank are both appointed dealers for the Treuhand.

FT  24 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: Intermediaries warned of
tough challenges - FT Conference (European Securities Markets in the 1990s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY intermediaries operating in the European securities markets face
significant challenges if they are to survive to the end of the decade,
industry executives warned yesterday.
Speaking on the second day of a Financial Times conference on the
development of the European securities markets, Mr Herschel Post, chief
operating officer of Lehman Brothers International, warned that the process
of disintermediation that swept the commercial banking world during the
1980s could come to bear on many securities intermediaries in the coming
years. This included stock exchanges themselves as well as brokers, he said.
Partly as a result of the shifting boundaries in the securities business,
large institutions have already moved to integrate a range of intermediary
functions, from acting as investment managers to being brokers and
principals in securities trades.
This vertical integration would allow them to move resources most
effectively between the different functions to meet opportunities, he said.
Mr Gerhard Eberstadt, member of the board of managing directors of Dresdner
Bank, listed this vertical integration as one of the indispensable
components of any financial intermediary's strategy in the coming years.
Others, he said, were a clear, earnings-related focus on the segments and
geographical areas in which an intermediary plans to operate; a focus on
earnings rather than turnover; and a modern, customer- oriented distribution
system.
Mr Eberstadt added that universal banks, similar to those in Germany, were
best placed to take advantage of deregulation in Europe.
Universal banks do not suffer the same pressures as investment or commercial
banks to constantly try to overcome regulatory hurdles by developing new
financial products, he said.
'These (products) do not necessarily suggest a greater emphasis of a more
rigorous approach to risk management, as is often stated.
'They tie up important resources to circumvent artificially created hurdles,
which are then not available for other, more productive purposes of
financial intermediation.'
Universal banks do not suffer these pressures, since they can switch
resources between commercial and investment banking, he said. 'It is not
difficult to forecast a global trend toward universal banking for the coming
years,' he added.
Responding to a question later, Mr Post said he did not believe investment
business in Europe would concentrate into the hands of a few, large
universal banks.
As had already happened in the US, investors in Europe would come to
understand the benefits of selecting intermediaries on the basis of
performance, and this would lead to more varied choice.
Mr Howard Coates, deputy chairman of BZW equities, said that the challenges
facing intermediaries in Europe were greater than those they faced elsewhere
in the world.
This is because, in addition to the challenges posed by deregulation,
intermediaries had to cope with the problems of dealing in many, often small
local markets, with the same securities often being traded on more than one
market. In addition, cultural and historic differences meant that different
types of investor and issuer demanded a different approach from
intermediaries.
BZW's response to the higher costs and lower income in securities markets
had been in part to focus on higher value products, and in part to pare each
business so that it could survive even in difficult periods.
Different equities, such as French equities, are treated as different
products and given their own profit and loss account, he said. In addition,
BZW now reviews its customers by the profits that the firm generates from
business it does with them.

international consultation in securities regulations
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The International Councils of Securities Associations (ICSA), which
represents self-regulatory authorities in the leading financial centres,
closed its meeting in London with a call for greater international
consultation in securities regulation, writes Simon London.
The two-day meeting discussed ways of improving the efficiency of
multi-national securities offerings, the detection of malpractice in
cross-border dealings and licensing of securities industry professionals to
work internationally.
One area of concern is the delay in formulating capital adequacy guidelines
for securities houses. Delays were placing securities firms at a competitive
disadvantage, commented Mr Robin Hutton, director-general of the British
Merchant Banking and Securities Houses Association.
Capital adequacy requirements for the securities industry are being examined
by the Basle group of central bank regulators, the European Commission and
the US and Japanese regulatory authorities. However, no guidelines are
expected to be published before the end of this year.

DISPELLING some of the gloom which surrounds the US insurance sector, Chubb
Corporation, the big US property - casualty insurer, yesterday reported a
15.5 per cent improvement in first-quarter profits after tax, at Dollars
128.3m.
The figure included realised investment gains of Dollars 4.2m, compared with
the Dollars 5.2m worth of gains included in the first quarter of 1990.
During the latest quarter, the insurer made a small underwriting profit of
Dollars 7m, compared with a Dollars 7.1m loss in the same period a year
earlier.
Net premiums written on the property and casualty side during the three
months totalled Dollars 737.7m, compared with Dollars 659.4m in the first
quarter of 1990.
Catastrophe losses were marginally lower at Dollars 8.2m, against Dollars
9.3m, while the combined ratio (after dividends to policyholders) fell from
102.1 per cent to 98.8 per cent.
Investment income, meanwhile, rose by 8.2 per cent to Dollars 100.7m, while
Chubb's life and health operations contributed a Dollars 12m profit for the
quarter, compared with Dollars 10.2m a year ago. The only slippage came on
the property front, where the real estate operations saw profits fall from
Dollars 13.1m to Dollars 7.5m.

bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HUNGARY plans to launch convertible bonds on the back of its privatisation
programme, according to the official news agency.
The bonds could be used to buy shares in some of the
companies in Hungary's First Privatisation Programme, Mr Frigyes Harshegyi,
deputy president of the central bank, told the MTI wire service.
The dollar bond issue would take place after companies had been introduced
to the stock exchange.
About 15 of the 20 companies included in the First Privatisation Programme
may be floated on the stock exchange from the middle of the year, according
to officials. They include Hungarhotels, Pannonia and Danubius, Hungary's
three largest hotel companies, Richter Gedeon, the largest pharmaceuticals
manufacturer, and Centrum, an extensive chain of department stores.
The scheme would be an imaginative way of interweaving two important
government aims: servicing Hungary's Dollars 21bn foreign debt, the largest
per capita in eastern Europe; and fuelling investor demand for Hungary's
ambitious privatisation programmes.
But it is unclear how the scheme would mesh with the plans already being
drawn up by advisers hired to privatise the 20 companies in the second half
of 1991. Moreover, the Hungarian government is already planning to issue
bonds convertible into privatised assets in compensation for property
expropriated by the Communists. These, stock exchange officials fear, may
flood the market and quickly trade at a discount.
The idea of issuing convertible bonds is part of the Hungarian National
Bank's effort to return to favour on international money markets.
Hungary recently announced a DM150m bond issue after an DM200m issue last
month was oversubscribed. With the latest issue, the central bank was able
to narrow last month's 250 basis point spread over bund yields.
Mr Harshegyi recently said that Dollars 1bn-worth of bonds would be issued
this year, about three-quarters of that in Japan and Germany.

airline privatisation

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PHILIPPINE Commercial International Bank is pushing ahead with the
privatisation of Philippine Airlines (PAL), but is waiting for the sale
prospectus and the results of a due diligence review before making a final
decision on the bidding consortium.
A number of parties are known to be interested in acquiring the 60 per cent
of PAL that the government is to put up for sale. They include Northwest
Airlines of the US, JAL of Japan, a consortium led by a Hong Kong company,
and a group headed by PAL pilots. 'Once the prospectus comes out, we will
decide whether to bid, who to bid with and how much to bid,' said Mr Stephen
Cu-Unjieng, PCIB managing director for investment banking.
Mr Feliciano Belmonte, PAL president, said that PAL had incurred a net loss
of 1.5bn pesos (Dollars 54.6m) for the year ended March 1991, mainly due to
heavy foreign exchange losses and increased domestic fuel price costs.
He said the foreign airlines were interested in PAL's trans-Pacific routes,
rather than its current balance sheet. By the end of the year, Mr Belmonte -
who also heads the government pension fund that controls 75 per cent of
equity in Philippine Airlines - disclosed the airline was planning to double
its Manila-US flights to 26 a week.
One of the main obstacles to PAL's successful privatisation is its planned
buy-back of Dollars 175m of Paris Club debts and Dollars 170m of commercial
debts. The Philippines' central bank and the finance department have drafted
an agreement that might resolve the debt issue, Mr Belmonte said.
He said the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS), the majority
stockholder in PAL and the Philippine Plaza Hotel, has asked for a guarantee
from Allied Kajima (AKL) of Japan foIlowing its purchase of the hotel for
1.5bn pesos.
Mr Belmonte, who is GSIS president and general manager, said AKL has been
asked to pledge as security 100 per cent of the shares to be bought as well
as a mortgage on the hotel, which is being bought with a long-term lease
from GSIS over the land.

<TEXT>
MCI Communications suffered a 21 per cent fall in first - quarter earnings
in the highly competitive US long-distance telephone market, despite record
revenues.
The second largest long-distance carrier earned Dollars 123m, or 48 cents a
share, down from Dollars 156m, or 62 cents, a year ago. Revenues advanced to
just over Dollars 2bn from Dollars 1.8bn, but operating income fell to
Dollars 265m from Dollars 283m.
Mr Bert Roberts, president, blamed the decline on the recession and
competitive pressures. He noted that MCI had launched an unusually large
number of services in recent months, notably Friends &amp; Family, which offers
discounts to residential subscribers for frequently-called numbers.
MCI has a 13 per cent share of the long-distance market. Although MCI's
share was boosted by last year's acquisition of Telecom USA, the
fourth-biggest operator, it was expected to have garnered a larger slice of
the market by now.
Mr Courtney Munroe, analyst at Northern Business Information, said MCI's
problems have been compounded by aggressive cost-cutting.
'In trying to improve margins they've cut corners in customer service,' he
said. Recent surveys by NBI indicate that, despite a host of impressive new
services, MCI's image in the marketplace has deteriorated as a result of the
belt-tightening measures.

AUSTRALIA'S two gov-ernment-owned airlines are likely to complete the sale
of significant shareholdings to overseas investors before the end of the
year, airline executives said yesterday.
'We should be able to come to some conclusions within the next two or three
months,' said Mr Ted Harris, chairman of Australian Airlines, the
government-owned domestic carrier.
The government plans to sell 100 per cent of Australian Airlines, of which
40 per cent will be placed with overseas buyers, with a ceiling of 25 per
cent on individual foreign shareholdings.
It also wants to sell 49 per cent of Qantas, the international flag carrier,
of which 35 per cent will be placed with overseas airlines. The balance of
the shares will probably be floated later.
Qantas and Ansett Australia, the domestic airline owned jointly by TNT and
News Corporation, will be barred from buying shares in Australian Airlines.
Both government-owned airlines are to be recapitalised before the sales
go-ahead, probably through the assumption of debt by the government in
return for shares.
The detailed plans for the sales, announced in statements by Mr Ralph
Willis, finance minister, and Mr Kim Beazley, transport minister, are
largely in line with privatisation proposals announced in December.
However, the government rejected a request from the Qantas board for
permission to acquire up to 25 per cent of Australian Airlines to protect
its access to domestic traffic.
Officials said ministers rejected the proposal because it would have
undermined the privatisation of Australian Airlines, and blurred the
division between domestic and international operations.
The decision angered Qantas, which said it would be placed at a competitive
disadvantage to foreign airlines.
'It is difficult to understand why Qantas has been specifically excluded
from participation in any form in domestic aviation in Australia while its
foreign competitors are being encouraged to do just that,' said Mr Bill Dix,
Qantas chairman.
The government's decision to recapitalise the airlines in advance of the
sale of shares will increase their attractiveness to investors by reducing
the high gearing both have incurred as a result of re-equipment programmes.
The extent of the recapitalisation has not been determined, but Mr Beazley
said last year that repairing the airlines' balance sheets would cost around
ADollars 600m (USDollars 465m) for Qantas and ADollars 300m for Australian
Airlines.
Qantas is understood to have had talks with British Airways, Japan Air
Lines, Singapore Airlines, United Airlines, of the US, and Garuda, the
Indonesian flag carrier.
The same airlines head the list of potential shareholders in Australian
Airlines, but the government is unlikely to allow airlines to acquire
holdings in both Qantas and Australian.

ISRAEL Chemicals, the country's biggest and most profitable state-owned
industrial group, reported a drop in net profits in 1990 to Dollars 78.2m
from Dollars 86.3m in 1989, a record year for the group.
Sales were up Dollars 76m to Dollars 1.23bn, but a fall in world prices for
potash, Israel Chemicals' core product, a drop in phosphate sales to eastern
Europe, and the shekel's relative strength against foreign currencies were
blamed for the reduced earnings.
Net return on capital was 14 per cent, maintaining Israel Chemicals'
traditional position as the leading performer among the state's industrial
holdings.
The group, which exploits Israel's main natural resources from the Dead Sea
area, has been slated for privatisation for some time, but a planned private
placement of a majority stake with foreign investors was blocked by
political objections.
A partial flotation on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange is the preferred option
of most ministers, although no decision has been taken.
Israel Chemicals now relies heavily on international markets.
Last year, exports were up by 7 per cent at Dollars 646m, a little over half
of total sales. The drop in earnings came mainly from two of the group's
core Israeli production companies, Dead Sea Works and Negev Phosphates.
Profits were up at Dead Sea Periclase, which makes magnesia and hydrochloric
acid, Rotem-Amfert, which makes sulphuric and phosphoric acid, and at
Giulini Chemie, a West German subsidiary making phosphate salts and
aluminium sulphate.
Israel Chemicals intends to pay a dividend to the government of Dollars 12m,
after Dollars 50m in 1989.

WITBANK Collieries, the coal arm of the Rand Mines group, suffered the
effects of rising costs and higher finance charges to record lower earnings
in the six months ended March 1991.
Turnover rose by 18 per cent to R569.4m (Dollars 210m) but tighter margins
saw operating profit only 4 per cent higher at R106.5m.
A sharp drop in investment income and a 27 per cent rise in the interest
charges to R26.3m, the result of the Middelburg mine purchase, left
after-tax profits 13 per cent lower at R51.3m.
The half-year dividend is being maintained at 210 cents a share but the
directors expect profits for the full year to show a decline.
In 1989-90, Witbank, one of South Africa's four big producers, contributed
R163.2m, or 73 per cent of Rand Mines' total attributable profits.
Export tonnages increased by 26 per cent, mainly as a result of the
first-time inclusion of Middelburg. The effects of an economic slowdown were
seen in the domestic market where sales declined by 4 per cent. Sales to
Escom, the power utility, increased by 13 per cent.
The directors reported that the increased turnover was mainly volume
related, with margins falling because of increased rail charges while
inflation-induced cost increases were not offset by export revenues which
were held in check by the firmness of the rand.

ITT, the US conglomerate with interests ranging from defence to insurance,
reported a 9.4 per cent fall in first-quarter profits, to Dollars 229m after
tax.
Earnings per share also fell, from Dollars 1.77 to Dollars 1.7, but, in both

On the one hand, the first quarter of 1991 took in portfolio gains of
Dollars 35m - or 26 cents a share - mainly at ITT Hartford, the insurance
arm. This contrasted with portfolio gains of Dollars 4m, or 3 cents a share,
in the corresponding period a year earlier.
On the other hand, the first quarter of 1990 was boosted by an after-tax
gain of Dollars 47m from the sale of the stake in Alcatel Alsthom. ITT said
that without this item, net income in the first quarter would have improved
by 18 per cent.
ITT said that its electronic components business improved on higher volumes
and better efficiencies at ITT semiconductors. ITT Defence also had a better
quarter due to more favourable margins on certain contracts and despite
lower sales.
The fluid technology business was 'slightly down' but ITT automotive and the
group's forest products division both saw sharper falls.

FT  24 APR 91 / International Company News: Bankers Trust suffers from weak
dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKERS Trust, the highly- regarded US banking group, suffered a 19 per cent
fall in first-quarter earnings. A strong advance in trading income was more
than offset by higher non-interest expenses, lower foreign exchange revenues
and write-offs on investments in highly-leveraged companies.
Net earnings slipped to Dollars 160m, or Dollars 1.85 a share, from Dollars
198m, or Dollars 2.36, a year earlier. Interest income fell only slightly to
Dollars 213m.
The company blamed an 8.4 per cent rise in non-interest expenses partly on
the weaker dollar, which accounted for about a quarter of the increase.
Staff severance costs jumped by Dollars 40m.
Trading revenues almost doubled to Dollars 304m, thanks largely to a strong
performance by the capital markets business, which includes interest rate,
currency and equity derivative products. But corporate finance fees tumbled
by 23 per cent.
Loans on the bank's books continue to fall sharply, reflecting the policy of
the past four years of distributing a higher proportion of loans to other
financial institutions, such as regional and foreign banks, insurance
companies and pension funds. Its total loan portfolio stood at Dollars
19.6bn on March 31, down from Dollars 29.2bn in 1986.

FT  24 APR 91 / International Company News: First Executive receives Dollars
643m tax claim
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ATTEMPTS to rehabilitate Executive Life of California, the main operating
unit of troubled Los Angeles-based insurer First Executive, have run into a
serious obstacle from the Internal Revenue Service, which claims to be owed
Dollars 643m.
Mr John Garamendi, the Californian insurance commissioner who seized control
of Executive Life earlier this month, warned that the move 'could force the
company into liquidation and jeopardise the savings of hundreds of thousands
of policyholders and annuitants'.
The Los Angeles office of the IRS, however, said that while it was obviously
concerned about policyholders' welfare, it had a duty to the US public to
make sure demands for back tax were logged.
The IRS claim covers tax which the authorities say the company should have
paid in 1981, 1982 and 1983, together with penalties and interest due
because of the non-payment. The IRS declined to split the tax sum from the
penalty/interest charges, although there were reports that the actual tax
claim totalled less than Dollars 250m.
The IRS acknowledged that the penalties/interest element was likely to be
substan-tial.
The Californian regulators have recently suggested that rehabilitation
efforts were centring on talks with a European consortium, led by Altus,
part of Credit Lyonnais, the French bank.
Officials at the Insurance Department said they did not know what the
reaction of the consortium had been to the tax demand.
However, Mr Garamendi said he would 'do everything in my power to stop this
IRS raid on the assets needed to pay Executive Life policyholders. I plan to
immediately contact both the Bush administration and Congressional leaders,'
he added.

<TEXT>
RJR NABISCO, the tobacco and food group which was subject to the biggest
leveraged buyout in the US two years ago, yesterday reported a small
after-tax profit of Dollars 5m in the first quarter of 1991.
It is the first time RJR has made a profit after interest and tax since the
massive Dollars 25bn takeover masterminded by Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts, the
investment banking business. In the first quarter of 1990, RJR reported a
net loss of Dollars 222m.
News of the surplus seemed to surprise some Wall Street analysts, who
greeted the figures warmly. 'It's positive - we were expecting a small
loss,' commented one high-yield analyst at Salomon Brothers.
On the stock market, RJR shares rose in morning trading in New York by 3/8
to Dollars 11 7/8 , while its junk bonds also advanced on the profit news.
The company has just completed the latest in a series of refinancing
exercises aimed at reducing the cost of its outstanding debt.
The most recent restructuring involved the issue of 115m new shares, to
raise Dollars 1.29bn, plus a Dollars 1.5bn tranche of new junk bonds.
During the first quarter, RJR's operating profits rose to Dollars 647m, 7
per cent higher than the same period a year earlier, with 'cash earnings' -
that is, before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation - marginally
improved at Dollars 940m against Dollars 923m.
Sales overall were 8 per cent higher at Dollars 3.47bn.
Of the two main business divisions, food showed the more marked advance.
Sales rose from Dollars 1.34bn to Dollars 1.51bn, while operating profits
(ahead of amortisation charges) were 21 per cent higher at Dollars 171m.
On the tobacco side, sales rose 5 per cent to Dollars 1.96bn, while profits
edged 2 per cent higher at Dollars 648m. The company reported 'significant
volume gains' overseas, but said its domestic volumes were still falling by
more than the market generally - the latter figure standing at around 3 per
cent a year.
The flow of debt refinancings has helped to push down interest costs. In the
first quarter, cash interest expense was Dollars 307m from Dollars 388m.

<TEXT>
CINCINNATI Milacron, one of the world's biggest machine tool makers, slipped
into the red in the first quarter on the back of weak demand and heavy price
discounting.
However, the company reported a pick-up in new orders, with a first-quarter
inflow 6 per cent higher than a year earlier and 14 per cent up on the
previous three months. The order backlog also widened during the quarter.
Milacron suffered a Dollars 5.9m loss, or 22 cents a share, in the first
quarter, against earnings of Dollars 2.5m, or 10 cents a share, a year
earlier. Sales dipped to Dollars 181.1m from Dollars 184.2m.
Mr Daniel Meyer, chief executive officer, said slack business conditions
were especially evident in standard machine tool, grinding machine and
plastics machinery sectors.
He said stringent cost controls combined with new products and an expanded
distribution network should return the company to break-even in the second
quarter.

39.2m
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
WEAK demand and mounting costs have lead Bethlehem Steel, the second largest
US steel manufacturer, to unveil a Dollars 39.2m loss after tax in the first
three months of 1991. In the same period a year ago, the company made a
profit of Dollars 21.3m.
Bethlehem warned it expected to report a further deficit in the second
quarter of the year, despite 'a slight seasonal upturn'.
'While there are some signs of stability and potential recovery for the
economy . . . the outlook remains uncertain because of high unemployment,
credit constraints and the recent strengthening of the dollar,' the company
said.
But the Pennsylvania-based company said it was still studying the
possibility of a collaborative venture with British Steel. The venture,
announced in outline earlier this year, would involve the UK company in
taking over and reorganising the US group's subsidiaries which make
structural and rail steels.
Yesterday, Bethlehem said that, as part of a feasibility study, talks were
being held with the United Steel Workers Association 'concerning the joint
venture's requirements for competitive labour costs'.
Bethlehem had warned it would probably post a first-quarter loss, although
it did not specify the extent of the expected deficit.
Bethlehem said the basic steel division turned in an operating loss of
Dollars 26m, against a profit of Dollars 29m a year ago.
Steel-related operations made an operating loss of Dollars 7m, against a
Dollars 4m deficit in the first quarter of 1990. As a result, the overall
loss at the operating level reached Dollars 33.3m, compared with Dollars 25m
profit last year.

revival

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SALOMON and Morgan Stanley, two of the largest securities houses in the US,
provided fresh evidence of the revival in Wall Street's fortunes yesterday
when they unveiled big increases in first-quarter profits.
Salomon reported record net income of Dollars 273m, or Dollars 2.30 a share,
more than double the Dollars 119m earned a year earlier on revenues of
Dollars 690m. Total net revenues were Dollars 1.18bn, against Dollars 690m
in 1990.
Morgan Stanley posted a 46 per cent rise in net income to Dollars 120.1m, or
Dollars 3.07 a share, based on net revenues of Dollars 747.8m, up from
Dollars 578.2m in 1990.
A string of Wall Street firms has reported dramatically-improved profits for
the quarter, a result of the boom in New York share prices, the big rise in
trading activity, and the recovery in the underwriting of new stock and bond
issues.
For Salomon and Morgan Stanley, the main factor behind the improvement was
the large rise in revenues from principal trading activities, especially
stocks and bonds.
At Salomon, income from principal transactions rose nearly 50 per cent to
Dollars 968m on the back of strong earnings from proprietary trading and
market-making in equities, mortgage-backed securities, corporate bonds and
government issues. Overseas earnings were also healthy, especially on
European fixed-income securities and Asian equities.
Investment banking revenues rose by Dollars 15m to Dollars 99m at Salomon,
primarily due to a doubling in business from new issues of corporate stocks
and bonds, high-yield debt and mortgage-backed securities.
The two areas where Salomon performed less impressively were real estate and
Phibro Energy, the company's oil trading subsidiary, which posted pre-tax
earnings of Dollars 5m, against Dollars 7m a year earlier.
The cost of moving to a new headquarters in Manhattan, and an increase in
benefits and bonuses paid out alongside higher profits, pushed Salomon's
non-interest expenses up to Dollars 696m, against Dollars 489m a year
earlier.
The earnings picture was similar at Morgan Stanley, where a strong
performance from global sales and trading activities, particularly in fixed
income, equities, foreign exchange and commodities, lifted revenues from
principal transactions to Dollars 392.6m, up from Dollars 277.7m in 1990.
Income from investment banking business rose 14.5 per cent, with increased
debt and equity underwriting volume offsetting a decline in financial
advisory activity.
A 33 per cent rise in compensation and benefits expenses to Dollars 373.9m
accounted for the bulk of the increase in total outgoings at Morgan Stanley,
which totalled Dollars 544.2m in the quarter, up from Dollars 436.6m at the
same stage a year ago.

dividend after advance

GENERALE de Banque, Belgium's largest bank, yesterday announced net profits
for 1990 of BFr8bn (Dollars 232m) a rise of 7.8 per cent above those of
1988, the last comparable year.
Generale de Banque, whose 1989 results were depressed by heavy provisions
against foreign loan losses, said despite continued problems due to the
economic downturn in the US, deposits in Belgian francs grew by 8 per cent
following Belgium's decision to tie its franc more closely to the D-Mark.
Declaring a BFr5 increase in its dividend to BFr270 a share, Mr Jacques
Groothaert, the bank's chairman, said that while the bank had made certain
exceptional profits last year, from the sale of its stake in European
American Bancorp and in Lease International, it also had to pay out BFr2bn
last year towards redundancies, aimed at shedding some 1,500 staff by the
end of this year.
Mr Groothaert said Generale de Banque, which recently abandoned an ambitious
cross-border merger plan with Amro Bank of the Netherlands, had no
intentions of linking up with any Belgian bank at home.
Groupe Bruxelles Lambert, one of the largest Belgian holding companies,
yesterday announced consolidated profits for 1990 of BFr5.68bn, up from
BFr4.25bn the year before.
The results included capital gains from the sale of GBL's stake in
Wagons-Lits, the Belgian tourism and hotel company, which was offset by an
exceptional BFr3bn book loss from the deconsolidation of the US assets of
the group. Much of this, BFr2.5bn, was 'purely a book-keeping loss' due to
the accumulated depreciation of dollar assets since 1982.
GBL raised its dividend for 1990 to BFr274-a-share, up from BFr215 the year
before.
Barco, the Flemish electronics group, has maintained its dividend of BFr26 a
share, even though pre-profit tax for 1990 fell to BFr899m, from BFr1.22bn
in 1989.
The poorer profits reflected mainly the cost of acquisitions in the US and
Europe.

FT  24 APR 91 / International Company News: NEC says it is in talks over
taking stake in Bull
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
NEC, the Japanese electronics company, yesterday agreed it was taking part
in negotiations with Groupe Bull of France which could lead to NEC holding a
stake in the state-owned computer manufacturer and a seat on the main board.
NEC's acceptance of its involvement in talks implies it approves a profound
restructuring plan prepared by Mr Francis Lorentz, Bull chief executive,
designed to eliminate Bull's huge losses and return the company to
profitability within three years.
The plan involves sweeping away the company's untidy and inefficient
structure and replacing it with a global operation comprising separate
operational divisions handling manufacture and marketing for different
regions.
The Japanese company refused to comment on speculation that the stake could
be as much as 10 per cent.
The Japanese manufacturer supplies the loss-making French computer maker
with large mainframe computers and has extensive links with it.
Groupe Bull is NEC's principal marketing conduit to the West for its large
machines.
Talks have been going on for some months with a view to resolving the future
of NEC's 15 per cent stake in Bull HN, a company set up in 1987 in which
Groupe Bull held a 72.2 stake, NEC, 15 per cent and Honeywell of the US 12.8
per cent.
Honeywell recently marked its final retreat from the computer business by
selling its stake in Bull HN to Groupe Bull for an undisclosed sum.
The success of Mr Lorentz' strategy depends on NEC's agreement to
redeploying its stake in Bull HN into Groupe Bull.
Senior government officials said Groupe Bull's losses - last year they
amounted to some Pounds 700m (Dollars 1.2bn) - and its need for a foreign
partner were big factors behind the Paris administration's decision early
this month to allow private companies to take minority stakes in state-owned
ones.
The government would be relieved, sources suggest, to see Bull supported by
such a strong partner as NEC.
Observers had long speculated that Bull's problems would be the final
element to force the government to loosen President Francois Mitterrand's
three-year-old freeze on nationalisations and privatisations.
This relaxation in the government's hold on state industry comes in the form
of a decree, which paves the way for NEC to take a shareholding in Groupe
Bull, as well as easing the way for foreign alliances currently being
negotiated by two state banks.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SKF, the world's leading roller bearings manufacturer, recorded a 91.8 per
cent slide in its first-quarter profits after financial items due to falling
demand for its products. The drop was to SKr59m (Dollars 9.4m) from SKr721m
for the January-March period of 1990.
The company's net sales fell by 2.7 per cent to SKr6.92bn from SKr7.11bn.
Income per share was SKr0.90 after tax, compared with SKr3.7 last time. The
return on shareholders' capital for the most recent 12-month period was 2.9
per cent, compared with 7.3.
At the end of March this year, SKF's production level was 20 per cent below
what it was at the same time last year, with most plants operating well
below capacity.
SKF said its 60,000 workforce had been cut by 1,800 over the first three
months of the year. Inventories were virtually unchanged as at the end of
1990, at 35.2 per cent.
The company blamed the continuing fall in demand for its products in its
biggest European markets as well as in the US and Brazil.
SKF forecast continuing low demand over the next few months, with more costs
incurred by a further reduction in manpower. The company said a further
4,000 to 5,000 jobs may have to go this year if weak demand for its products
continued.
Profits after financial items for SKF's bearings divisions fell to SKr77m,
compared with SKr600m for the first quarter of 1990, although this year's
first-quarter result was better than the SKr110m loss sustained by bearings
in the fourth quarter of last year. Net sales were also down to SKr5.47bn,
from SKr6.04bn.
The company said bearings sales in the German car industry and in the Far
East had been maintained.
In its tools business, SKF suffered a SKr11m loss, compared with a SKr29m
profit for the same period of 1990 and a SKr29m loss in the fourth quarter
of last year.
Tool sales increased to SKr597m in the first quarter from SKr368m last time.

<TEXT>
LORAL, the US defence electronics group, yesterday completed the Dollars
182m sale of 49 per cent of its satellite business to three European
partners.
This concludes an agreement made in October with Alenia, the Italian
state-owned aerospace group, plus Aerospatiale and Alcatel Espace, the
French public and private sector aerospace companies.
Space Systems/Loral makes communications and weather satellites, with 2,000
employees and sales of Dollars 350m last year. The four partners' combined
forces represents one of the world's biggest civil communications and
weather satellites groupings, with 7,800 employees and Dollars 1.5bn of
joint turnover.
The US satellite business, formerly part of the space systems division of
the Ford Motor Company, was won by Loral in an auction last summer, against
unsuccessful bids from rival teams including Aerospatiale and Alcatel.
The completion comes days after the acquisition by Alenia and Aerospatiale
of Boeing's De Havilland subsidiary in Canada, and underlines the growing
ambitions of the two continental European aerospace manufacturers to break
into the US and the specialised satellite markets.
According to Alenia, the deal will help the three European companies provide
turn-key communications packages, offering clients satellites, control
units, earth stations and related services.
The three European companies have worked together with the US group now
owned by Loral for some time on commercial communications satellites,
notably the Intelsat V series and three Arabsat models. They are currently
involved in the joint development of the next generation of Intelsat VII
satellites due to enter operation next year.
Independently, Alenia, which was formed from the merger of the state-owned
Aeritalia and Selenia aerospace and defence groups late last year, has
sealed a number of international collaboration agreements in recent weeks as
part of its own foreign expansion drive.

MATRA, the French missiles and electronics group, yesterday reported that
profits stagnated last year on a gentle increase in orders and sales.
Net earnings were FFr606m (Dollars 101.89m), barely changed from the FFr605m
recorded in 1989, on turnover up 10 per cent at FFr24.3bn from FFr22.1bn.
The group received FFr26.3bn of orders last year, against FFr24bn in 1989.
Space and defence, the largest division, which makes missiles, defence
electronics and satellites, saw its turnover rise from FFr8.4bn to
FFr10.3bn.
This includes the first FFr4.5bn contribution from Matra Marconi Space, the
51 per cent owned space equipment company.
The transport and car division, which produces the recently re-launched
Espace for Renault and makes urban railways and automotive electronics,
reported sales of FFr8.1bn, representing 34 per cent of group turnover.

FT  24 APR 91 / International Company News: Spanish utilities propose
Dollars 5bn power merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE TWO biggest private sector electricity utilities in Spain, Hidrola and
Iberduero, are in 'advanced and serious' negotiations to create a new
company that would make it one of Europe's largest private utilities with
combined generating capacity of some 14,000MW and a market capitalisation of
more than Dollars 5bn.
Representatives of the two companies met on Monday with the Ministry of
Industry and Energy to discuss the proposals, which could involve a full
merger or the creation of a joint holding company. The proposals have been
prompted by government plans to radically re-design and streamline the
electricity sector.
Madrid wants to take the country's 12 generators - most of which also
control their own distribution networks - and create just two or three
groups. Ideally, it would then hand over nationwide distribution to a single
company which would be able to buy electricity from, and sell it to, Spain's
neighbours in the European single market after 1992.
The big private utilities - Hidrola, Iberduero, Sevillana and Union Fenosa -
have become alarmed at the prospect of being pressed by the government into
arrangements and mergers that do not suit them. They have been desperately
trying to come up with their own plans to pre-empt the government's plans.
The commotion sweeping the sector - the second biggest on the Madrid Stock
Exchange after the banking industry - has been compounded recently by
aggressive corporate raiding by the state-controlled generator, Endesa, the
country's biggest generator, from which the private utilities are obliged to
buy what they claim is overpriced power.
Endesa's acquisitions include 10 per cent of Sevillana, the big Andalucian
utility in 1989, and, this year, 80 per cent of Electra de Viesgo in the
north, and smaller stakes in Fecsa, the Catalan utility, and Union Fenosa,
which also operates in northern Spain.
'This is little more than nationalisation,' said a senior Spanish banker
involved in the industry. Spanish banks own stakes in most utilities and
vote up to 40 per cent of utility shares using proxy votes at shareholder
meetings. Analysts believe Endesa may be accumulating the stakes to get into
distribution or to use in an eventual swap of assets which the government
might order to facilitate its reorganisation.
At the heart of the debate is a highly complex system of compensations
erected by the government in 1987 to keep tariffs standard nationwide. This
assists high-cost producers by forcing efficient generators to distribute a
share of their income around less fortunate operators.
Endesa, probably reflecting government plans, says it wants three groups
created, with Hidrola and Iberduero and itself leading them. This would
leave Endesa free to take control of Sevillana, Fecsa and Union Fenosa.
A combined Hidrola and Iberduero, which would bring together Iberduero's
strong hydro-electrical assets and more modern conventional generating plant
at Hidrola, would pose a strong industrial threat to Endesa's vision.
Combined generating capacity would be close to that of the newly-created
PowerGen in the UK. Total shareholder equity in Hidrola and Iberduero would
be more than Pta1,000bn (Dollars 9.2bn), compared with the Endesa group's
current Pta472bn. Combined long-term debt, though, would total Pta1,300bn,
against Endesa's current Pta450bn.
The Energy Ministry, which is designing a new national energy tariff plan to
coincide with the reorganisation of the sector in the next few months, could
block a merger simply by threatening it with unprofitable compensation
arrangements even though it seems unlikely to drop its unified tariff.
Madrid, however, is loathe to be seen to be over manipulative of private
sector companies and may give it the green light if, in return, shareholders
in Sevillana, Fecsa and Union Fenosa can be persuaded to ease Endesa's entry
as the other main controlling force in the sector.

FT  24 APR 91 / International Company News: Eridania down despite improved
sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ERIDANIA, the agro-industrial subsidiary of Italy's Ferruzzi group, suffered
a fall in consolidated net profits to L230bn (Dollars 176m) last year from
L298bn in 1989, writes Haig Simonian.
The decrease, which partly stemmed from a drop in net extraordinary items to
L61bn from L150bn in 1989, came despite a 2.9 per cent increase in sales to
L9,165 from L8,909.
Net profits at parent company level fell to L60bn from L68bn in 1989.
Eridania, which earlier this month announced a rights issue of up to L281bn,
is paying an unchanged dividend of L240 for ordinary shares and L270 for
savings shares.
The group, which last year raised its share of national sugar production in
Italy to almost 37 per cent, said dry weather conditions in Europe had
combined with the Gulf crisis and the rise in the value of the dollar to
make business conditions more difficult last year. However, net operating
profits rose by 8.8 per cent to L594bn.
The company said it expected improved results for the current year, both in
terms of operating earnings and sales.

FT  24 APR 91 / UK Company News: Doctus shares fall 8p on profit warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOCTUS, the management, personnel and marketing consultancy, yesterday
issued a profit warning and said it was reviewing the marketing element of
its business - which was beefed up under two years ago through the Pounds
40m merger with Prospective Group.
Doctus's share price fell 8p to 39p, compared with its 12-month high of 138p
last May.
The group also announced that the roles of chairman and chief executive were
to be split. Mr Brian Blake would continue as chairman and Mr Alan
Greenough, who joined the board last October, would take the latter post. A
non-executive deputy chairman was also about to be appointed.
Mr Blake, who said the management changes were not connected with the weaker
performance, said the group's interim pre-tax profit to March 31 would be
'quite a bit below' last year's Pounds 4.1m.
The Gulf war and downturn in the UK economy had led to 'a decision
paralysis' and the cancellation of some orders. Trading had suffered
particularly in January and February.
For the full year brokers' forecasts of Pounds 10m-Pounds 12m (Pounds 11.4m)
would not be met, although trade had picked up since the first half. The
group was about to announce disposals that would reduce year-end debt of
Pounds 25m.
Its review of strategy included considering whether or not to keep the
marketing activities, which accounted for 60 per cent of operating profit
last year. Prospective, formerly known as Pineapple because of its roots in
the eponymous dance studio, was mostly marketing orientated.
Mr Blake said the decision to review this side of the business did not mean
that Prospective - acquired for shares, but bringing in substantial debt -
had been a bad buy. If parts were put up for sale, they would only go if the
prices were right.
Marketing's performance had been flat last year compared with more than
doubled profit growth at the management and human resources consultancies.

FT  24 APR 91 / UK Company News: McKechnie slides to Pounds 10.5m as
Australian recession hits sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAXABLE PROFITS continued to slide at McKechnie, the West Midlands-based
plastic components, specialist engineering and household products group.
For the half year to January 31 1991 profit came to Pounds 10.5m, down from
Pounds 12.7m, which itself was down some 27 per cent on the 1988-89 first
half. Earnings per share for the latest period were 8.8p (10.5p).
The interim dividend, however, is maintained at 5p. That reflected a degree
of optimism about the prospects for the second half.
Indeed, Mr Jim Butler, chairman, said not only that UK companies, even those
in the sluggish automotive sector, were reporting 'steadier trading
conditions' but also 'it is tempting to believe that the worst of the
recession is over.' At the same time group companies in the US had growing
order books. However, that was offset by continuing problems in
Austral-asia.
Recession in Australia led to lower demand and put pressure on margins
during the first half. Exchange rate movements took Pounds 500,000 out of
operating profits; those factors were the most significant in the decline of
group profits. UK and US operations, helped by cost cutting and product
improvement, managed to hold their earnings levels of 1989-90.
Return on assets and on sales fell largely because of the acquisition of
Engineered Custom Plastics in the US. That company had not been operating
profitably but should be by the end of the year.
Turnover dropped to Pounds 153.6m (Pounds 178.6m), partly because of the
Australian experience. Just as important, however, was the re-positioning of
the group, its greater concentration on plastics and specialist engineering,
brought about by the sale of its UK metals operations, which had provided a
quarter of operating profits. The impact of the sales will be spread over
the whole year.
During the second half turnover and profits again would be affected but
interest charges would be lower. The sale of the metals companies -
McKechnie Extruded Products, Worcester Parsons and Stelco - would realise
Pounds 53m cash which was initially being used to strengthen the balance
sheet. Gearing would be reduced to less than 10 per cent by the end of the
financial year.

FT  24 APR 91 / UK Company News: Interest boost helps Farnell to Pounds
33.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG GROWTH in interest income helped Farnell Electronics, the
manufacturer and distributor of electrical and electronic equipment,
increase pre-tax profits by 10 per cent from Pounds 30.64m to Pounds 33.78m
in the year to February 3.
Farnell, which had cash balances of Pounds 29m at the year-end, benefited
from high rates available in the money markets and interest income rose from
Pounds 1.45m to Pounds 3.8m.
Turnover fell from Pounds 169.7m to Pounds 163.8m, mainly because of the
disposal of AC Farnell, a wholesale distributor of brown goods, sold in
March last year.
Farnell's main division, electronic component distribution, increased
operating profits from Pounds 21.33m to Pounds 23.43m on turnover up from
Pounds 97.36m to Pounds 104m.
Electronic equipment manufacturing saw operating profits fall from Pounds
8.87m to Pounds 7.12m on turnover of Pounds 60.3m, down from Pounds 65.46m.
Earnings per share increased by 12 per cent to 16.3p (14.5p).
The directors are recommending a final dividend of 3p, bringing the total
for the year to 5.5p, a rise of 15 per cent.
Mr Henry Elstone, finance director, said the group's German subsidiary made
a loss of Pounds 2m, but its development was continuing and he was looking
for a good return in the current year.
Mr Elstone said the group had been hit by recessionary conditions in the UK,
but was confident that it would be able to maintain its 25-year record of
growth in earnings per share.
Farnell's Australian subsidiary made a small net profit during the year,
which Mr Elstone said was a commendable performance in view of the
difficulties of the economic climate there.
COMMENT
These are good results in view of the depth of the recession in the UK
economy, which still accounts for the vast majority of the Leeds-based
group's business. Farnell did well to increase profit margins slightly in
its already extremely lucrative distribution business, but holding the
erosion in manufacturing margins to 11.8 per cent, compared with 13.6 per
cent in the previous year, is just as impressive.
The main concern in the market is that Farnell will use its cash pile to pay
too much for the distribution activities of STC, the British
telecommunications group bought last year by Northern Telecom of Canada.
However, paying over the odds would not be in character for a canny northern
management team.
Forecast flat profits of Pounds 33.5m put the shares, up 4p yesterday to
206p, on a prospective multiple of just over 12, in line with its sector.
That seems undemanding, particularly if the German investment comes good,
but the shares are unlikely to advance until the group's acquisition
intentions become clearer.

FT  24 APR 91 / UK Company News: Flat showing as FR dips to Pounds 21.3m -
Worldwide defence cuts and project delays take their toll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLARE PEARSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FR GROUP, the aviation products group which makes 65 per cent of its sales
in the defence sector, reported flat profits and earnings for 1990.
Pre-tax profits were Pounds 21.3m (Pounds 22.6m), on turnover of Pounds
169.2m (Pounds 153.8m). Earnings per share came to 20.07p (20.75p). The
final dividend is unchanged at 4.14p maintaining the total at 6.37p for the
year.
The results came against a worldwide background of cuts in defence
procurement. They were also specifically affected by losses at WES, the
con-tainers and general engineering division. Without these, profits would
have been slightly ahead, said Mr Giles Irwin, finance director.
He said FR had now 'taken the knife' to WES, which had been integrated into
Flight Refuelling, the dominant air-to-air refuelling pod division.
Mr Irwin said this division put in a good performance as did the other
larger operations - notably FR Aviation, which provides training and
maintenance to the military.
However, group performance had been, and continued to be, affected by delays
in sizeable projects. Supplies of refuelling pods to the US airforce, for
instance, had been delayed owing to a change in specification. There had
been cost overruns on the Phoenix air vehicle project where GEC is the main
contractor.
Mr Irwin said the Gulf conflict had produced a 'number of small value items'
for FR but nothing significant in a group context.
COMMENT
The long-running sore of delayed contracts continues to trouble FR along
with other companies in its sector. The current year is promising no relief
from the complaint, especially ahead of the white paper in June, which is
expected to clear up deep uncertainty about how big the British armed forces
are going to be in the future. That means FR is set to complete its third
year of broadly flat profits, perhaps making no more than Pounds 20m
pre-tax. This puts the shares on a prospective p/e of about 8.5 while the
yield is some 5 per cent. The shares are well down on levels achieved at the
start of last year but still look fully-valued for the moment at 160p. It is
reasonable to expect a recovery in 1992; but there is no near-term relief
for long-suffering investors who have now been waiting for four years for FR
to recover the momentum of its earlier career.

FT  24 APR 91 / UK Company News: McCarthy &amp; Stone losses rise to Pounds 6.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLARE PEARSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MCCARTHY &amp; STONE, the UK's biggest builder of retirement homes, announced
deepened losses of Pounds 6.4m (Pounds 5.7m) on turnover down from Pounds
38.3m to Pounds 33.1m for the six months to end-February.
Basic losses per share were 14.4p (9.6p). The interim dividend, however, is
maintained at 0.5p.
Mr John McCarthy, chairman, said he remained cautious about the level of
sales for the rest of the year.
Volumes were virtually unchanged during the first half with 404 units sold
compared with 408.
Reductions in working capital meant group borrowings, excluding a
convertible loan stock of which Pounds 14.8m is outstanding, fell from
Pounds 90.4m to Pounds 87.4m, cutting gearing to 96 per cent. Inclusive of
the convertible, gearing was 112 per cent.
The half-year period was affected by a drop in the contribution from land
sales and other operating income, including sale of fixed assets and
commissions earned by Peverel, the management company.
The company said land sales resulted in a profit of Pounds 200,000, down
from Pounds 500,000, while other operating income accounted for Pounds 1.1m,
against Pounds 2.6m.
In anticipation of an upturn next year, the company has recommenced
construction on a number of sites.
Stocks at February 28 comprised a land bank of 2,189 units plus 253 units at
various stages of construction and 1,413 available for sale.
Interest took Pounds 7.3m (Pounds 9.1m). The tax credit arising on losses is
not yet being accounted for.
COMMENT
There was some encouraging news in these results in that, after a very sharp
fall last year, volumes appear now to be trundling along the bottom. That
still leaves all those long-term investors who bought into McCarthy &amp; Stone
a few years ago, when sheltered housing was all the rage, almost as woeful
as the elderly would-be customers of the company who found they could not
sell their existing homes.
Still, the company is a reasonable play on the expected recovery in its
market niche. However, it should be remembered that as a longer-term
strategy McCarthy has turned its back on nursing homes - thought by many to
be coming thing as the elderly survive for ever more years - having
complained it could not make decent returns.
After losing Pounds 10.8m last year, it should produce a deficit of about
Pounds 8m this time before the pre-tax line moves back into the black in
1992. The shares presented a buying opportunity at a low of 33p last
December, but that evaporated with a subsequent sharp recovery. Yesterday
they stood at just above 90p.

FT  24 APR 91 / UK Company News: Coats extends offer after only 0.69%
acceptance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COATS VIYELLA, the textile group which is in the throes of a Pounds 194m
hostile bid for Tootal, announced yesterday that it was extending its offer
after receiving acceptances representing 0.69 per cent of its target's
ordinary shares.
Coats, which already owns 85.65m ordinary shares, or 29.41 per cent of
Tootal's equity, has received acceptances for a further 2.02m shares. It
also has acceptances for 3.67m (62.35 per cent) of the preference shares.
This means the level of acceptances received by Coats from Tootal
shareholders has fallen slightly since the previous closing date. Tootal
yesterday issued a statement claiming this meant its arguments were 'winning
the day'.
The Pounds 194m bid has effectively been put on ice until May 10 while the
Office of Fair Trading considers whether to refer it to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission. Tootal may then issue additional information, such as a
profits forecast, and Coats could mount a second offer.
Tootal's shares were unchanged at 76p yesterday, still higher than Coats'
offer of 65p cash. Coats' shares slipped 2p to 137p.

Ptarmigan Holdings, a maker of sausage casings and cake decoration products,
reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 6,000 for the half year to December 31
1990, against a Pounds 263,000 profit last time.
Operating profits dropped from Pounds 305,000 to Pounds 167,000, but these
were wiped out by increased interest charges of Pounds 173,000 (Pounds
42,000). There was no tax (Pounds 84,000 charge) and losses per share came
out at 0.06p (1.83p earnings).
Extraordinary charges, related to the closure costs of the hatchery
operation, totalled Pounds 306,000 (Pounds 77,000).

In the half year ended March 3 1991, 'a most difficult period', Cosalt
returned pre-tax profits down Pounds 617,000 at Pounds 1.01m.
Outlining the reasons, Mr Edward Brian, chairman, said the fishing industry
remained depressed, the caravan companies had to reduce working hours to
allow overproduction to be absorbed by the market, and the workwear side,
which manufactures for the rental trade, received fewer orders as a
consequence of the recession.
The interim dividend is held at 4.25p, payable from earnings per share of
5.9p (9.36p).

Higher interest charges made inroads into interim profits at VTR, the

figure of Pounds 432,000, against Pounds 601,000.
Mr Philip Lovegrove, chairman, explained that the rise in charges from

investment programme.
No further large capital expenditure was planned for the rest of the year.
Mr Lovegrove said both Video Tape Recording and AV Department increased

Turnover rose to Pounds 3.18m (Pounds 2.71m). Earnings per share came to

The commercial property investment portfolio produced a 'creditable

19 per cent ahead to Pounds 7.3m (Pounds 6.1m) mainly due to rent reviews

FT  24 APR 91 / UK Company News: Scale back urged if Scottish electricity
sale oversubscribed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is being urged not to offer shares in the two Scottish
electricity companies to overseas institutions so as not to disappoint
individual Scottish investors if the issue is heavily oversubscribed.
Torrie &amp; Co, the Edinburgh stockbroker which handles large numbers of
individual applications for privatisation shares, said it believed the issue
will be so popular that it risks embarrassing the Scottish Conservative
party and is calling on its customers to lobby MPs to block a foreign sale.
'It will be politically disastrous to sweet-talk the canny Scottish investor
into applying for sensible numbers of shares only to be offered nominal
allocations,' the broker said, especially if it is then perceived that
Japanese, American and European institutions have made 'guaranteed profits.'
About 20 per cent of recent privatisation issues, including the regional
electricity companies and the generators, have been sold to foreign
institutions.
The government has appointed advisers to prepare the way for offering shares
in Scottish Power and Scottish Hydro-Electric to institutions in Europe,
Japan, the US and Canada, but no decision has been taken on whether to sell
the shares overseas.
Torrie said interest among Scottish electricity customers was running high.
The issue is expected to raise between Pounds 1.5bn and Pounds 2bn.

<TEXT>
the second largest in the UK - increased its final dividend by 10 per cent
to 4.95p despite a rise of only 0.8 per cent in net asset value per share in
the year to March 31.
The trust had net assets of Pounds 771.2m at its year end, equivalent to
262.5p per share, against 260.5p per share previously.
The increase in net assets lagged behind the FT-A All-Share Index - which
rose by 7 per cent over the same period - because of the overseas weighting
of the trust.
At March 31, 33 per cent of the portfolio was invested outside the UK, split
between continental Europe (11.5 per cent), Japan (8.8 per cent), United
States (8.3 per cent) and Far East (4.4 per cent).
Edinburgh has debenture debt of Pounds 105m, most of which is invested in
the markets.
The total dividend for the year is 7.7p (7p) based on earnings per share of
8.15p (7.84p).
Although net asset value underperformed against the index, a narrowing in
the discount to net asset value of the share price - from 19.4 per cent to
14.4 per cent - helped the shares to perform almost in line with the
All-Share Index over the year.

FT  24 APR 91 / UK Company News: Bridgend considers offer in Cowan de Groot
battle
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A BATTLE for control of Cowan de Groot is in the offing after Bridgend
Group, the distribution, leisure and property concern, announced it was
considering making a cash offer for the toys, electrical components, and
household goods company.
Bridgend had earlier purchased 1.15m shares in Cowan, lifting its holding to
9.98 per cent.
The move comes as a response to last week's agreed share-exchange offer from
Wilton Group, chaired by Mr Michael Buckley, who also heads Cowan.
Bridgend had earlier unveiled a 74 per cent expansion in taxable profits for
1990. The outcome - Pounds 1.06m against Pounds 608,000 - included a
nine-month contribution from the Woodington leisure and property group
purchased in March 1990. Interest charges took more at Pounds 819,000
(Pounds 549,000).
Turnover totalled Pounds 7.85m (Pounds 3.87m on continuing operations).
Earnings per share on the sharply increased capital emerged at 3.5p (3.1p).
A recommended final dividend of 0.8p brings the total for the year to 1.2p
(1p).

FT  24 APR 91 / UK Company News: Tarmac sinks 49% to Pounds 190.7m - Sharp
fall likely in current first half as property recession continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEEP recession in UK and US housing and commercial property markets
caused pre-tax profits at Tarmac to fall by 49 per cent, from Pounds 377m to
Pounds 190.7m, last year.
Sir Eric Pountain, chairman of Britain's biggest construction and building
materials group, warned that profits would also fall sharply in the first
half of this year.
Sir Eric said January and February had been particularly bad months for UK
housebuilding and construction material sales. These had been further
depressed for part of that time by severe winter weather.
He said it would be difficult, although not impossible, to reover the first
half downturn during the final six months of the year: 'Much will depend
upon the timing and the pace of recovery in the UK housing market. There has
been a slight improvement in sales since interest rates started to fall in
February.' said Sir Eric.
The share price fell by 16p to 229p following the warning.
Sir Eric said Tarmac's markets last year had been the toughest for more than
a decade, reflecting the severity of the economic downturn in the UK and US.
Group operating margins fell from 12.7 per cent to 7.2 per cent as sales
volume and prices came under severe pressure in most divisions.
Only the construction division achieved an increase in operating profits -
ahead 30 per cent to Pounds 40m helped by an increase in UK road contracts.
In contrast, housing profits collapsed 63 per cent from Pounds 183.5m to
Pounds 67.3m. The group blamed expensive land bought in 1987 and 1988 for a
sharp fall in margins. The number of houses sold slipped from just over
12,000 in 1989 to 11,209 last year. The average price of a Tarmac home had
remained static at about Pounds 75,000.
Sir Eric said this masked a price reduction in real terms as the group had
built fewer one bedroom homes.
Profits from UK quarries fell by 20 per cent to Pounds 80m. Tarmac said
volume sales of aggregates and ready-mix concrete had been maintained at the
expense of margins as prices had fallen. Black top sales, however, had
increased reflecting the rise in road construction.
Profits from sales of other building materials fell by 42 per cent to Pounds
17m. Sales of brick and aerated blocks were hit particularly hard by the
decline in UK housebuilding. Industrial product profits fell by 15 per cent
to Pounds 38m while commercial property profits declined by 40 per cent to
Pounds 12.7m.
There was no comfort in the US where profits halved from Pounds 43.7m to
Pounds 20.8m. Before currency translations profits were down by 43 per cent
to Dollars 40.1m. As in the UK, volume sales and prices were under pressure
in many of Tarmac's US markets.
Earnings per share fell from 32.3p to 16.7p leaving total dividends
unchanged at 11.25p, covered 1.5 times. The final distribution is held at
8.25p.

FT  24 APR 91 / UK Company News: Budgens board examines cost of
restructuring proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUDGENS, the troubled chain of neighbourhood grocery stores, is asking
Charterhouse to act as its financial advisers in addition to Kleinwort
Benson after receiving restructuring proposals from a group of institutional
shareholders.
These proposals called for the removal of Mr John Fletcher as chairman and
the appointment of new directors.
Mr Martin Sorrell, chief executive of the WPP marketing services group, will
now play a pivotal role in determining the Mr Fletcher's future.
As the only non-executive director on the Budgens board, Mr Sorrell will
have to consider the merits of the proposals put to the company by IEP
Securities, Electra Investment Trust, and Gartmore Investment Management
which between them account for 27 per cent of its equity.
The proposals also envisaged bolstering the board through the appointment of
three external executives: Mr John von Spreckelsen and Mr Christian
Williams, who previously worked at Bowater Freight Services, and Mr Graham
Rigby, an accountant.
Budgens is currently inquiring into the experience of the three executives
and considering what expertise they could bring to the company.
The board is also exploring its options concerning the future funding of the
company and how it can reduce its borrowings of Pounds 30m.
One factor that will weigh heavily with the Budgens board is the cost of
replacing Mr Fletcher.
He has only recently signed a five-year contract and his pay last year
amounted to Pounds 145,000. Coupled with pension payments it is conceivable
that Mr Fletcher could receive more in a compensation package for loss of
office than the shareholders will gain this year in dividends.
But the three executives who may join the board will not come cheap as they
are asking for a collective salary package of about Pounds 300,000 plus a
number of share options.
The prime mover behind the proposals is IEP Securities, the investment
vehicle founded by Sir Ron Brierley, which bought into Budgens at the time
of the company's merger discussions with William Low, the Scottish grocery
chain, in 1989.
IEP later bought further shares to average down the cost of its shareholding
but it is still sitting on a huge loss.
The average price it paid for its shares is estimated at 85p compared with
Budgens' closing share price of 46p yesterday.
The Budgens board will have to be careful not to be seen to favour one group
of investors - however powerful they may be - above the other 23,000
shareholders.

FT  24 APR 91 / UK Company News: Brent Walker finalising its 1990 accounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRENT WALKER, the heavily-borrowed leisure group, is this week finalising
its accounts for 1990, a period which saw the group's stop-gap refinancing
of its Pounds 1.4bn of debt.
The preliminary results are expected in the first half of May with the full
accounts published later in the month.
Brent Walker is still working with its bankers on a restructuring of its
liabilities on a long-term basis, better to match its assets and trading
prospects.
It is likely that the accounts will be qualified as have those of other
companies involved in financial restructurings. Generally, auditors have
said that the accounts are prepared on the assumption that the restructuring
is successful.
Weatherall Green &amp; Smith, the group's property valuer, is understood to have
completed a revaluation of the property assets, which will have taken
account of the fall in the property market since the last valuation at the
end of 1988.
Directors may argue with the group's audit committee over how much of the
revaluation they incorporate in the accounts. Bankers, however, will look at
the actual valuation when assessing the group's ability to carry debt, and
will also look at the sale value of whole businesses rather than the value
put on individual properties.
The group's bankers are also due to see a draft report on the company by
Touche Ross, the accountants. However, this report is expected to be revised
as the company has reworked its cashflow forecasts. It will eventually form
the basis of the restructuring.
The task facing Brent Walker and its banks is to raise cash and to prune the
business to produce a company capable of servicing its debt. To this end it
has been discussing the sale of various assets with interested buyers for
some months.
Allied-Lyons, the brewing, wines and spirits, and food group, confirmed
yesterday that it was in talks with Brent Walker over its brewing and pub
interests. It added that an internal memo which had been leaked to the press
'represented an analysis of commercial considerations to be addressed and
does not represent any form of definitive agreement'.
Allied said that it would be two or three weeks before the two sides could
establish whether there might be a deal.
Brewing analysts pointed out that following the government's proposals for a
shake up in the industry, the sector was in a state of flux. One said
'everyone is talking to everyone else about everything'.
One suggestion was that Allied could agree to supply Brent Walker's 1,122
pubs, putting extra volume through its own six breweries, which could be
very profitable. This might lead to the closure of Brent Walker's brewery.
Brent Walker's brewing and pub interests largely relate to its acquisition
of J W Cameron and Tollemache &amp; Cobbold for Pounds 324m in December 1988
from the Barclay brothers. This purchase included two breweries and 855
pubs.
The Tollemache brewery in Ipswich was closed in 1989 and production
centralised at Cameron's Lion Brewery in Hartlepool. Brent Walker already
buys in a sizeable proportion of its beer requirements.

FT  24 APR 91 / UK Company News: Decline in financial printing hits St Ives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CITY FINANCIERS are not alone in mourning the dearth of contested takeover
bids. St Ives, the UK's largest independent printer, reported a 26 per cent
fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 13.59m to Pounds 10.06m in the six
months to January 31, almost entirely due to the fall in financial printing.
Mr Robert Gavron, chairman, said the company had experienced the worst
trading conditions in 30 years. Turnover on financial printing had halved
and healthy profits in that division had turned into a small loss.
Group sales as a whole fell 8 per cent to Pounds 108.05m (Pounds 117.1m).
Earnings per share fell from 8.3p to 6.5p fully diluted but the interim
dividend is maintained at 1.5p.
The group had no net debt at the half way stage, but gearing was expected to
rise to 15 per cent by the year end as a result of completing a Pounds 127m
capital programme on new technology and consolidating printing at fewer
plants.
During the period, St Ives picked up the printing of 50 new titles. About 40
titles had been lost but as most of these had closed rather than gone to
competitors market share had increased.
Mr Gavron said that despite a pick up in financial printing as result of the
recent spate of rights issues, magazine advertising was still sluggish and
that division had further to fall before business improved.
COMMENT
Given the industry is printing 10-20 per cent fewer pages compared with six
months ago, a 26 per cent fall in pre-tax profits is neither surprising nor
a particularly poor showing. But things are likely to get worse before they
get better in the main consumer magazines, offset only partly by an upturn
in financial printing. While new printing technology and cost cutting will
put St Ives in good shape for the next up-cycle, looming opportunities in
Europe may not be wholly welcomed in the City. St Ives seems an obvious
partner for VNU, the Dutch publisher that says it wants to spin off its
printing arm, or Bertelsman of Germany if it goes the same way. The
possibility that such a partnership might require a call on shareholders for
cash is likely to overhang the share price. This year pre-tax profits of
Pounds 21.5m are expected, giving 14p per share. It looks fairly fully
priced with a multiple of nearly 17 times earnings.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD ALEXANDER, chairman of the National Westminster Bank, warned yesterday
that there would be no immediate improvement in the bank's performance
because of the recession and continued high level of bad debts.
However, the bank had taken several initiatives to cut costs which should
begin to flow through in the second half of the year. This would be followed
by significant improvements in 1992 and 1993.
Lord Alexander told the annual meeting that NatWest was taking several
initiatives to deal with problems which depressed last year's result,
particularly at its two loss-making arms, County NatWest, the investment
bank, and NatWest Bancorp, its US arm.
The equities business of County had met 'all significant milestones' which
were set for the first quarter of this year, and was well ahead of its plan
to achieve satisfactory profitability. In February, Lord Alexander gave the
business two years to get back in the black or risk closure.
NatWest also announced the appointment to the main board of Mr Derek
Wanless, chief executive of UK financial services.

FT  24 APR 91 / UK Company News: UK market conditions push Ward down 31%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WARD Group, the steel and building components combine, blamed the worst
UK market conditions in its 45 year history for a 31 per cent drop in
pre-tax profits.
For 1990 the profit came to Pounds 8.7m (Pounds 12.6m). The final dividend
is 4.8p, for an unchanged 7.2p, payable from earnings of 25.2p (36.4p).
Mr Nigel Forsyth, chief executive, said the 'bitterly disappointing' results
would have been worse without the help of the European business, which
remained relatively buoyant. Non-UK turnover increased slightly to Pounds
67m (Pounds 63m) while overall sales were down to Pounds 172.8m (Pounds
175.3m).
The group was planning to expand further on the Continent, into eastern
Europe and the Soviet Union, increasing those sales from 39 per cent of
turnover to more than 45 per cent. It already has manufacturing plants in
Belgium, France, Italy and Germany.
However, Mr Forsyth warned that difficult market conditions would continue
throughout the year. He could not see any improvement in overall profits
until 1992.
The slump in profits led to the company reducing its employees from 2,360 to
1,852.
Gearing fell from 39 per cent to 26 per cent as borrowings were reduced from
Pounds 10.3m to Pounds 7.4m. Interest payable amounted to Pounds 2.04m,
covered five times by operating profit of Pounds 10.76m (Pounds 12.9m).
The group continued its investment programme, spending Pounds 7m on
developing new machinery and equipment. That brought the total invested over
the past four years to Pounds 30m, and a further Pounds 8m is allocated for
1991.

FT  24 APR 91 / Cannon St in Pounds 46m cash call
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANNON Street Investments, the debt-laden industrial holding company, is
raising Pounds 46.7m net via a one for three rights issue, and a placing and
offer of 25.7m convertible preference shares, in a move to slash its
borrowings by more than 40 per cent.
The rights issue of 25.69m new ordinary shares at 90p was at a discount to
the closing price on Monday of about 10 per cent gross. The shares closed up
18p at 124p yesterday.
The convertible preference shares, which are subject to clawback, have been
conditionally placed at Pounds 1 per share with the Bank of Scotland. The
fixed cumulative annual dividend on the convertibles is 9.75p (net) and the
conversion price is 120p.
Cannon Street's strategy is to buy smaller companies and develop them into
larger groups for eventual flotation on the market. Mr Bill Hislop,
chairman, said of the decision to launch a rights issue, placing and
offering: 'A major consideration was that we will be able to float our
businesses totally unhampered by gearing considerations.'
The group announced its cash call on the market as it reported a 35 per cent
fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 26.5m to Pounds 17.3m for the year to
December 31. Turnover rose from Pounds 228.86m to Pounds 281.42m.
Interest charges for the year jumped from Pounds 2.06m to Pounds 8.47m while
operating profits fell 6.8 per cent to Pounds 26.5m (Pounds 28.45m).
The group increased its bank borrowings to fund investments in its leisure
businesses. Since 1989, it has invested about Pounds 30m to expand its
hotels and leisure division. The contribution to operating profits from this
area rose from Pounds 2.6m to to Pounds 3.1m last year. Only the hotels and
leisure and electronics distribution divisions increased operating profits.
The business services division was stable but building and building
services, food and drink, and home improvements saw operating profits fall.
Cannon Street's results include a Pounds 700,000 loss representing its share
of the losses of Betacom, the telecommunications company, in which it has a
29 per cent stake. Further extraordinary losses of Pounds 3.3m were related
to bad debts and closure and rationalisation costs.
Total borrowings were Pounds 106.5m at the year-end against net assets of
Pounds 26.4m.
Earnings per share fell to 17.21p (24.15p) and an unchanged final dividend
of 5.5p was recommended, maintaining the total at 8.80p.

FT  24 APR 91 / Construction group calls for Pounds 162m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAYLOR Woodrow yesterday launched a one-for-four rights issue to raise
Pounds 162.4m, joining the growing number of British construction companies
seeking to take advantage of a weak property market
Shareholders will be offered one new share at 200p for every four already
owned.
Since the beginning of January, British companies have sought to raise
almost Pounds 3bn from rights issues. Just over Pounds 1bn of those issues
came from construction and property groups. Overall, British companies
sought only Pounds 4bn from rights issues in the whole of last year.
Mr Peter Drew, Taylor Woodrow's chairman, said the group would use the
proceeds of the rights issue to make 'selective acquisitions' in a weak
residential and commercial property market.
'Most property and housing developers have been less able than Taylor
Woodrow to withstand the burden of the current recession and, as a result,
opportunities have arisen to acquire property and housing assets at
favourable prices.
'A number of attractive opportunities have been identified and are receiving
active consideration,' said Mr Drew. The group would consider buying
companies as well as individual properties and development land.
He said the board considered that a rights issue was the most appropriate
way to raise funds to pursue investment opportunities and still maintain a
strong financial base with gearing and interest cover at reasonable levels.
'It is certainly cheaper than raising debt at current rates of interest,'
said Mr Drew. Net debt represents 41 per cent of shareholders' funds,
according to the group.
Taylor Woodrow's share price - after an initial slide of 14p - recovered to
close only 2p lower at 251p last night. Hambros Bank said that
sub-underwriting for the issue, which had been fully underwritten by the
bank, had been completed satisfactorily.
The group's cash call is the fourth-largest rights issue to be announced by
a British company this year. The biggest was by Tesco, the stores group,
which at the end of January announced a two-for-11 issue to raise Pounds
572m. Last month Bass, the brewery group, announced a Pounds 557m rights
issue while Redland, the UK building materials company, sought to raise
Pounds 280m from its shareholders.
A common theme among issues from building companies has been the need to
raise cash to prepare for recovery and to take advantage of the weakness of
other groups. Most companies say, however, that opportunities to buy land
for housing - the sector most likely to lead the recovery - have been
limited.
Taylor Woodrow, like other large UK construction groups, has been hit by the
collapse in residential and commercial property markets. Last month the
company announced a drop in pre-tax profits of 28 per cent last year to
Pounds 83.4m - the first fall at the group for 30 years.
It also revealed that the value of its commercial property portfolio had
fallen from Pounds 801.9m to Pounds 646.1m during the 12 months to the end
of December.
The group is forecasting a total dividend of 9.5p for the current year,
unchanged on last year.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl yesterday pledged his support for Berlin as Germany's
future seat of government.
He said a move to Berlin, already the official capital, would need 10 to 15
years to complete and that Bonn should retain a number of important
ministries, including defence.
The chancellor's surprise decision will boost Berlin's chances of again
becoming the seat of government. Bonn, Before his announcement, Bonn was
thought to be favoured by a slim majority of members in the Bundestag, the
lower house of parliament, and by most of the west German Lander (states).
It was decided yesterday that the Bundestag will conduct a free vote on the
issue on June 20. The Bundesrat, the upper house, will vote the following
day.
Mr Kohl, trying to regain the political initiative after his party's defeat
in a state election on Sunday, said a government in Berlin would be in a
better position to help overcome the division between the two parts of
Germany.
The announcement may help to boost Mr Kohl's flagging popularity in east
Germany where many voters equate a pro-Berlin view with a vote of confidence
in the east.
Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister and leader of the pro-Bonn,
Bavarian-based, Christian Social Union, said he regretted the announcement
and insisted that he had no money available to finance the move, costed at
anything between DM5bn (Pounds 1.7bn) and DM100bn.
Mr Waigel said he would have preferred a compromise, dividing functions
between the two cities.

16) over equity withdrawal both complex and perplexing. Given that your
fellow countrymen reside - according to EC statistics - in the poorhouse of
Europe, one would have assumed the relatively recent ability of British
house-owners to utilise prior to death what little wealth they have been
able to accumulate would be welcomed.
The more so since some of that equity withdrawal has been used to finance
management buy-outs and other productive investments. Nor should equity
withdrawal from housing cause inflation through increased demand for
consumer and other goods since there is an adequate supply of foreign
manufactured goods competing to meet that demand.
The resulting trade deficit problems will only be solved by producing more
of those goods in this country to meet home market requirements. Similarly,
the home-grown inflation of house prices will only be solved when there is
sufficient supply of housing for purchase and rent available to meet demand.
The wholesale suppression of the housebuilding industry over the past two
years by inflation fuelling high interest rates which you have often
supported will simply cause house price inflation yet again in the future.
Taxation neither in the form of relief nor additions will not solve your
problems nor will reducing the already low level of wealth of the British
people. Until you recognise that inadequate supply is the main cause of the
inflation problem you are attempting to address you will never solve the
problem.

FT  24 APR 91 / Letter: Banks should take losses on the chin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr IAN MCINTYRE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Now that the banks' reporting season has mainly produced another
disastrous set of results I am experiencing a rather nasty consequence.
At our annual facility renegotiations with our various banks and
institutions, new charges and increases in some rates are being proposed.
This is despite our continuing satisfactory expansion and controlled use of
funds which in the past have led to reductions at similar annual meetings.
The reason given is always that profitability must be recovered.
Superficially, of course, they are correct but in every case the losses have
been caused by bad debts or provisions for non-performing loans following
disastrous lending policies in earlier years. Their profits at the trading
level continue to be more than satisfactory.
Why should other more prudent customers make good the mistakes of the banks'
managers? Surely such losses should be borne by the owners of the banks -
the shareholders.
All that such excessive zeal to increase rates will do is increase inflation
and slow our economic recovery. Come on you clearing banks - take your
losses on the chin and rebuild your customer base by supporting the better
borrowers. If your customer accepts blindly your new charges and increased
rates, maybe you would be wise not to lend to him]

FT  24 APR 91 / Letter: The warnings of a coming slump
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Professors WYNNE GODLEY and BOB ROWTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leading article ('The New Consensus', April 20) is incorrect when
it states that, in contrast with 1981, there 'have been no howls of
complaint' from the universities about unemployment.
We, together and separately, have been warning for at least the past 18
months that the British economy was heading for a slump.
In particular, we pointed out last July, in an IPPR pamphlet entitled
'Britain's Economic Problems in the 1990s', that it would be a strategic
error of colossal magnitude to join the ERM in anything like the existing
exchange rate.
If Britain did so, we predicted that unemployment would eventually rise to
well over 3m with severe long term consequences.
These warnings and forecasts have subsequently been repeated on a great many
occasions. For instance, in the New Statesman on January 18, we predicted a
much larger and longer fall in output than other forecasters; in a
post-Budget review we forecast that unemployment would rise to about 3.5m by
the end of 1992.
And contrary to what your leader suggests, these forecasts were accompanied
by carefully argued, and strongly expressed, statements which explicitly
disputed the proposition that 'macroeconomic policy cannot target real
activity'.
The Treasury has won no argument. Over the years it has made one wildly
wrong forecast after another and, as a consequence, has undertaken policies
which have already had extremely damaging short run and structural effects
on the British economy.
It is dangerous that the British establishment should only admit one way of
thinking to be worthy of consideration at any given time, however wrong it
has been in the past and however much the orthodoxy changes.
At the same time it engages in a conspiracy of silence with respect to the
expression of fundamental disagreement.
In our view, the scale of the present downturn has, even now, not been
properly appreciated. And we strongly dispute that there is nothing which
can be done to stem the debacle.

FT  24 APR 91 / Letter: Britain's legacy from neglecting education
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof M. DESAI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It was disappointing to find Samuel Brittan (Economic Viewpoint, April
18) endorse the vulgar view that qualifications are unnecessary. It has been
a long-standing English practice to denigrate formal training by pointing to
the odd genius who made it to the top without such training. But for every
Isambard Kingdom Brunel who got to the top a thousand 16-year-olds are left
without hope of qualifications either from school or at work each year. That
neglect of education is at the root of Britain's structural problems is not
merely the view of the Labour party.
Mr Brittan also takes the standard neo-classical position that all things,
goods or services, are equal with production and that manufacturing should
have no special status. However, if you think in terms of tradeables and
non-tradeables, manufactures are more tradeable than services, and while it
is conceivable that an import bill of any size can be financed by income on
invisible account or capital inflow it is not very likely. The problem is
that for Britain to finance its import bill without a devised manufacturing
sector will require either a drastically devalued pound, a very high nominal
interest rate or a large number of unemployed. Economic policy is about the
art of the reasonably probable and not merely the remotely possible.

FT  24 APR 91 / Arts: The Government Inspector - Greenwich Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE ARMITSTEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A crooked red revolve topped by onion domes and flanked by the paraphernalia
of country life, including a barely visible stuffed ram, provides the
setting for this classic of the Russian stage in a rambustious new
translation by Ronald Eyre. The ram is among equals, for Gogol's satire is
about the stuffed sheep of local government; and here they are, in their
Anglicised incarnations, with goatees and cheek puffs, quivering moustaches
and great bristling beards to signify the rank, age and dignity of petty
officialdom.
The Englishness of Matthew Francis' production extends beyond the
characterisation of this grubby local squirarchy to the character of the
comedy in which they are involved. For all their hypocrisy and corruption,
they are drawn with an affection for the stereotypes they represent. Arthur
Cox's apoplectic judge and Patrick O'Connell's mayor are awful, but we feel
safe with them; while Michael Burrell's timid, balaclava-clad schools
superintendent would pass muster for a Shakespearean mechanical, and Frank
Moorey's bulbous charity commissioner is a dead ringer for Mr Bumble the
beadle, from Oliver.
They are comic enough in the early whirlwind of conniving and kowtowing but
the play tries to push them further than their constitutions permit them to
go. When their stupidity has been revealed, and the mayor steps forward to
implicate his audience, there is no frisson of recognition, no fidgeting in
seats, because there is none of the cruelty that the satire demands. Even
the incursion of the wronged populace, in a nightmarish apparition to the
opportunistic Khlestakov, fails to make the leap.
The result is to pull the sting from the tale, leaving an empty space where
the phony inspector has been, and making the announcement of the real
inspector's arrival - by a state servant in gleaming Czarist gold  - a mere
textual formality. Matthew Francis' production lives through the
performances of Timothy Spall and Bob Goody as Khlestakov and his servant
Osip, a beaky scrimbleshanks of misdirected loyalty.
Spall, particularly, is on cracking form as a little Lord Fauntleroy gone to
seed who stamps a chubby foot and crinkles a piggy snout as he fights to
rescue his dignity from a greasy strand of hair, the relic of some foppish
haircut, which is forever flopping forward over his face.
The spectacle of Khlestakov succumbing to his host's hospitality is a moment
of inspired farce from an actor of vibrant originality. He does so with a
physical abandon that leaves him flapping drunkenly on the floor like a
great bloated cockroach helplessly stranded on its back, while the assembled
worthies look on in appalled admiration. For this scene alone I would cross
London.

FT  24 APR 91 / Arts: The Barber of Seville - Barcelona
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD CRICHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Michael Hampe's Cologne production of The Barber of Seville, seen at the
Edinburgh Festival in its time and now in the hands of Hampe's colleague Kai
Luft, has made its way to the Liceu in Barcelona, where I caught the last
performance. The intimate, domestic style might have proved too low-key for
this large and splendid theatre were it not for good team-work from a fine
cast (alternatives for most of the principals) and notable support from the
much improved Liceu orchestra under Paolo Olmi. Olmi's speeds were on the
whole fast, riskily so when some of the soloists' runs threatened to turn
into slides, but only the final vaudeville, which lost its lilt and sense of
happy relaxation, was damagingly quick.
A major attraction was the appearance as Rosina of Cecilia Bartoli (sharing
the role in Barcelona with Raquel Pierotti), the young mezzo whose
recordings have made a great impression. In the theatre the volume is not so
great as the records suggest, but the vivid impact, the personality, the
rhythmic zest and the burnish on the tone are unmistakable. She recalled
Conchita Supervia at Covent Garden before the war - the sound was quite
small but every note, inflection, gesture, carried. As a comedienne Bartoli,
with her expressive features, supple movements and sure timing, is a treat
to watch.
William Matteuzzi, Bartoli's partner in a recent Barbiere recording, rightly
played Almaviva's first scene (properly handled, one of the most effective
and atmospheric openings in any opera) as a young gallant half-asleep in the
cold early morning, uncertain of his welcome. Unfortunately the stiffness
crept into his first aubade, but the second, the ravishing 'Se il mio nome",
was most delicately turned, with decorations in keeping with the sinuous
windings of the tune. Matteuzzi is an agile comedian and a good ensemble
player. Long-held high notes are on the way back, it seems. With this
singer, no regrets.
Anthony Michaels-Moore's young, fresh and likable Figaro, his warm, vigorous
baritone riding out into the theatre, reached the same high standard - no
need, though, to outpace this conductor in 'Largo al factotum'. The Bartolo,
Enrico Fissore, was gentle, restrained, almost self-effacing. In the midst
of these the ripe and rusty Basilio of Nicolay Ghiaurov, with his imposing
Slavonic bigness a potential cuckoo in the nest, was all the more effective
for his restraint. He greatly pleased a packed house.

FT  24 APR 91 / Arts: Sexual taboos versus the human spirit - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We see Betty Jones, who is 71, come up the stairs and into the bedroom,
saying: 'I was a domestic here 50 years ago - no, more than 50 years ago. I
had this terrible pain, I can remember. I came up here and I thought 'I'll
just get up on the bed'. I sat on the bed and I had this terrific pain, and
out pops this baby, and I thought 'Where's that come from?' It was fixed to
me by the cord and I thought 'I haven't got to go through life with that
fixed to me, surely?' I didn't even know I was pregnant. I was petrified.
The mistress comes in and she says 'You wicked girl, Betty, look at the mess
you've made. You've got to pay for those sheets, you're not getting any
wages'. Next thing I knew the ambulance men came and took me off to a mother
and baby's home'.
The astonishing thing about this is that Betty Jones is not an actress
delivering lines from an 18th century diary but a woman speaking to us from
her own memory. We see her in Episode 3 of the BBC2 series A Secret World Of
Sex which began last night and will continue for another five weeks. Once in
a while a series turns up, usually documentary, which really does what the
cliche says: opens a window on the world to reveal something which we may
have heard about, but had never seen clearly before.
Betty Jones's recollection typifies the way in which A Secret World Of Sex
achieves this. With a vividness and immediacy which is often enthralling,
and all too frequently painful, it uses personal witness to lay before us
the ignorance, guilt, fear and cruelty which surrounded virtually every
aspect of sex for those who grew up in the first quarter of the 20th
century. Again and again women who had never been told how pregnancy
occurred ('I thought what he was doing was just the 'in' thing') explain how
they attempted suicide rather than face the stigma of an illegitimate child.
A woman who was raped when she was 14 tells matter of factly how she could
not possibly explain this to her mother. She had a breakdown and ended up in
mental hospital.
The series was commissioned by BBC Bristol from the independent company
Domino Films, but the moving spirit behind it is Steve Humphries. Eight
years ago, as a lecturer in social history at Essex University, he began the
research work for a book. He says: 'I was curious to find out how the old,
narrow attitudes towards sex affected the lives of people brought up before
the last world war. The taboo on sex amongst that generation is still so
great that we know very little about their sexual experience. I decided that
the only way to find out what happened was to ask them before it was too
late.'
So he did, and the interviews form a major part of his book, also called A
Secret World Of Sex, which appeared in 1988 (Sidgwick &amp; Jackson, Pounds
11.99). It contains many of the stories, photographs, and statistics which,
as director/producer, he has now included in the BBC series. But what the
book does not and cannot include is the tone of voice, the glint in the eye,
the defiance of those who agreed to tell their stories for his cameras.
No doubt the very fact that they did agree proves that they are atypical:
more self confident than most, a bit bolshie perhaps, in many cases
remarkably brave, even by the standards of this new age of supposed
permissiveness. It must take considerable courage for a white haired lady in
her seventies to describe in front of a film crew how her parents came home
unexpectedly when she was with her boyfriend and 'I had to push my knickers
in my handbag'. There is of course humour. Last night's opening programme
included an account from Evelyn Nelson (81) of necking in a field of long
grass when the farmer called a policeman who blew his whistle and demanded
they come out: 'It was like a football match, so many people got up'.
However, some of these first person accounts are so appalling that it is
difficult to go on watching. Yesterday's programme included the story of
Edna Higginbottom, born in 1923, who was discovered by her grandfather to be
having a sexual relationship when she was 15. He called the police who asked
'Did intercourse take place?' and upon being told 'Yes' hauled her into
court where her grandfather said 'Shut her away' and signed the necessary
papers. She was promptly locked up in a mental home and kept there for 20
years. Nor was this particularly unusual, it seems: under the 1913 Mental
Defectives Act, girls who brought shame on the family by consorting with men
were routinely locked away.
There is nothing revolutionary or, these days, even very unusual about the
way these programmes are made. My own shorthand for the technique is 'World
At War' because they employ the mixture of archive film, still photographs,
and new interviews of those with good memories which was used so powerfully
in the memorable Thames series about World War II. A Secret World Of Sex
gains greatly from a model delivery of the commentary - in other words
unselfishly unnoticeable - by Zoe Wanamaker (who recently gave such an
outstanding performance as the murderer's moll in Prime Suspect) with none
of the distracting histrionics which Laurence Olivier loaded onto The World
At War.
Each of the six episodes deals with a particular taboo: sex before marriage,
pornography and prostitution, illegitimate babies, homosexuality, sexual
violence, and VD. They are packed with memorable vignettes: the description
of men at Soho's old Windmill theatre with cameras hidden in chocolate
boxes; Lady Marguerite Tangye's account of debs' delights being aroused by
debs in the backs of cars and then resorting to the lower class gels at the
Bag O'Nails club for relief.
Some programmes are better than others, the most powerful of the lot being
the third, 'In Disgrace', which tells of five women, including Betty Jones,
who bore illegitimate babies: 'I felt like killing myself, but didn't know
how to start' . . . 'I was treated like an outcast' . . . 'My mother saw my
morning sickness and said 'Are you pregnant?' and I said 'What's pregnant?''
The wickedness of keeping young women in ignorance, and then persecuting
them for the natural results of that ignorance is enough to make you scream
with anger. However sad today's one-parent family phenomenon, it is surely
better than this hideous injustice.
But the most impressive aspect of the series is its collective strength.
Together these programmes manage to convey not just a graphic impression of
the sexual aspects of pre-war society, but a powerful sensation of how it
must have felt to live with all that guilty conscience, and terror, and
victimisation. As you listen to the self-righteous sermonising of the
religious and the 'purity league' members, it serves as a forceful reminder
of how many would still like to drag us back into that cesspit of ignorance
today. In the name of 'innocence' the moralists want to sterilise television
and push young people back into the dark. Yet it seems unlikely they will
manage it.  The most heartening aspect of this series is the character of
the people who agreed to talk to Steve Humphries. Of necessity they are in
their seventies, eighties or nineties, yet few of them look or sound
anything like that old. Perhaps an enthusiasm for sex keeps you young.
Moreover, even allowing for the fact that they are by definition the bolder
members of their generation, it is their obduracy which is so striking. As
Eastern Europeans later in the century would survive the political
totalitarianism of their societies, these Britons outlasted the moral
totalitarianism of theirs, showing that the human spirit can withstand just
about anything.

FT  24 APR 91 / Arts: Dutchman's dream of Italy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The lure of the Classical South proved irresistible to countless generations
of Northern landscape painters inspired by Claude and Poussin to bask in the
golden light and antiquity of the Roman campagna. Claude's poetic handling
of warm southern light was to have a significant effect on the Dutch
painters who migrated south during the 1630s, '40s and '50s. It even
influenced those who stayed at home, such as Cuyp. The work of these Dutch
Italianates is perhaps the most neglected aspect of the Golden Age of Dutch
painting.
A small, predominantly loan exhibition at Richard L. Feigen &amp; Co (6 Ryder
Street, SW1, until June 7) focuses on Adam Pynacker. After Jan Both, and
along with Nicholaes Berchem, he is arguably the most important of the
second and most interesting generation of Dutch Italianate landscape
painters. The show is the first devoted to him. It serves as a reappraisal
and as a reminder of the enthusiasm for 17th century Dutch painting in
mid-18th century Britain which was to have a profound influence on the
course of landscape painting in this country, from Richard Wilson to Turner.
Pynacker's first biographer, Arnold Houbraken - his latest, Laurie Harwood,
has curated this show - states that the artist spent three years in Italy.
It seems likely that he was there 1645-48, and that he was travelling on his
father's behalf as a wine merchant. The paintings executed on his return are
the results of remembered experience.
There are 11 paintings on show. With the Dulwich Picture Gallery's 'Bridge
in an Italian Landscape' of around 1653, we catch our first glimpse of
Pynacker's mastery. The clarity of its unifying light is breathtaking. The
low-lying sun illuminates the underside of the bridge, catches the water and
spangles the slender-leafed long grasses, the tree trunks and hanging vines
with silver and gold. The muleteer and goatherd, who strike up conversation
on the bridge surrounded by their stock, are naturalistically grouped; the
figures and the dog are softly silhouetted against the bluish mountains
beyond.
Already various elements of the Pynacker repertory are established: the
serpentine contortions of the overlapping trees (derived from Both); gnarled
birch stumps invaded by fungi; and silver-tinted long grasses. An open,
luminous sky around the light source fills one half of the canvas and acts
as a foil to the dark woody hills of the other.
Pynacker is probably best known for the larger canvases he painted in
Amsterdam in the 1660s, examples of which can be seen in the Wallace
Collection (which cannot lend) and the Dulwich Picture Gallery. This small
but delightful show, especially if augmented by visits to Hertford House and
Dulwich, probably serves Pynacker better than an exhibition of 100
paintings.
Another Dulwich picture takes a bow at the National Gallery, in the first of
its new series of Brief Encounters (until April 28). The aim of the series
is to explore the relationship between two paintings closely related in
technique, style and subjectmatter, one from the permanent collection and
the other a loan. What better start than the Samson and Delilahs by Rubens
and his disciple Van Dyck, the latter seen for the first time in Britain
since its cleaning for the recent exhibition in Washington.
Mantegna's treatment of the subject is misogynous; Rembrandt's is brutal;
Rubens, in contrast, allows Delilah a moment of reflection. The shorn hero
is still asleep in her arms, the soldiers at the door. She looks down at her
doomed lover with an expression of triumph tinged with tenderness and a hint
of regret. The pose of the two figures echoes a pieta.
Rubens painted this glowing, opulent and dramatic tour-de-force after his
return from Italy, in 1609. A decade later, the 20-year-old Van Dyck
borrowed the composition and reversed it. In every respect, his reworking of
the subject makes for a disappointing contrast. Rubens's penetrating
psychology is lost. He was to prove much better at being Van Dyck than
Rubens.

FT  24 APR 91 / Business and the Environment: UK's new pollution inspector
puts industry under scrutiny - John Hunt meets David Slater, who takes up
the position next week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HUNT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The job of policing new environmental controls over a large section of
British industry will be taken over next week by David Slater, a consultant
from the private sector. He succeeds Frank Feates, who is retiring as chief
inspector of Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution.
HMIP is implementing a new system of integrated pollution control (IPC),
which some companies fear will require them to shoulder a heavy financial
burden in order to meet the new standards. This programme commenced on April
1 and will be introduced in stages.
The engineering and chemical industries have been particularly concerned
about the introduction of Batneec (which stands for the 'best available
techniques not entailing excessive cost'). It is the central part of the new
system of pollution control.
Big plants such as engineering and chemical works and refineries will be
obliged to conform with Batneec by introducing tougher measures over the
next four years. Industry has complained that it has little information on
what this will mean in practice for specific processes and has been alarmed
that it could entail heavy capital investment.
But Slater believes Batneec should be seen as a positive way of improving
standards so that environmental damage can be avoided. He sees Batneec and
the Environmental Protection Act as 'very good conceptually, a great advance
pointing the way that legislation will be going in the rest of the world'.
He is also confident that the 'green' message is getting through to business
and industry. 'In some of these big companies you are starting to see the
effect,' he says. 'There is a big emphasis on management improving the
safety of their processes. It is in the company's interests to be viewed as
environmentally friendly. It is a big commercial advantage.'
From experience, Slater has seen what can happen when things go wrong at
large industrial plants. He is a founding director of Technica, consultant
scientists and engineers, where he has worked on environmental studies and
risk assessment. Previously he was with Cremer and Warner, consulting
engineers.
He has been involved in studying the huge chemical explosion at Flixborough,
Humberside, which killed 29 people in 1974, the chemical plant accident at
Seveso, Italy, the Union Carbide disaster at Bhopal, India, and a study on
the Exxon Valdez disaster.
He believes that industry has learnt the lessons of these events and has
developed a range of management tools such as risk analysis, environmental
impact assessments and environmental audits.
'There is no such thing as a completely pollution free or completely safe
process. But you can minimise the risk through good design. There has been a
big push towards quality in industrial processes. If you improve quality it
is a safer company, a cleaner company and it makes a profit.'
The UK Government has been under attack for failing to provide enough staff
and resources for the inspectorate to carry out its enhanced role.
Integrated pollution control means that the branches of the old
inspectorates covering pollution of air, water and land have been merged
into one organisation embracing all these areas. There has been some
in-fighting between the different disciplines as the new There have also
been complaints that salaries have been inadequate to attract staff of
sufficient quality.
But the Government has now increased staffing and salaries and Feates will
hand over the inspectorate to Slater in better shape than when he took over.
Slater believes that salaries, up to Pounds 32,900 for a new inspector are
now competitive with outside industry. When jobs were advertised recently
more than 600 applications poured in. 'These are very encouraging signs,' he
says.
He is confident that morale has improved at the inspectorate. 'It has to be
professional, credible, competent and independent and I am sure it is going
to be that way.
'There are a lot of very good inspectors out there at the sharp end. They
have the industrial expertise and they know what the problems and
practicalities are.'
The inspectorate is to be given agency status so that it can operate more
flexibly and at arm's length from government. Slater welcomes this: 'It
makes a lot of sense, it is a natural evolution.'
He is cautious, however, over suggestions that Britain might eventually need
a powerful independent agency to act as a 'green' policeman along the lines
of the US Environmental Protection Agency.
In recent years Slater has been in charge of Technica's US operation and his
experience has made him sceptical of importing the US model. He found the
American system to be adversarial and believes the mechanisms now being
introduced by the Government may fit better into the British scene.
He emphasises that the inspectorate is prepared to listen to the problems of
industry but cannot take on the role of a commercial consultancy advising
companies. 'That is not good for industry,' he says. 'They have to develop
their own expertise.'
On the one hand the new pollution control regime has been criticised by some
sections of industry for being too tough. On the other it has been attacked
by the environmental movement as too weak.
Slater is philosophical about this. 'If you do your job properly you may end
up being somewhat unpopular with both sides,' he says. 'But at the end of
the day the public needs to rely on the credibility and competence of the
organisation.'

FT  24 APR 91 / Business and the Environment: Looking for a quiet life -
Jamie Allen reports on measures by the Hong Kong government to reduce the
colony's noise level
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Hong Kong has been called many mysterious and laudable things, including
Fragrant Harbour and Pearl of the Orient. It has never officially been named
Construction Site, although this comes closer to what it is like to live in
the cramped and frenetic territory than any euphemism can manage.
Walking along a footpath involves dodging jackhammers, crossing a road
entails negotiating temporary wooden planks over works' sites, and living
next to a new building site could well mean you never need worry about
sleeping through your alarm clock.
But coming to terms with the problem of noise has been a long, slow struggle
in Hong Kong. Unlike Japan, which enacted its first environmental laws in
1967 and a noise regulation law the following year, Hong Kong did not enact
its first comprehensive Noise Control Ordinance until 1988 and construction
activities did not come under control until 1989. (They are still not fully
under control).
While Japan has banned the worst form of percussive piling - the diesel
hammer - in Tokyo and several other cities, Hong Kong has chosen not to
bring in sweeping regulations which rule out the use of specific pieces of
machinery.
Usually pragmatic in its dealings with industry over environmental matters,
the Hong Kong Government devised legislation which contained incentives for
contractors to switch from the noisiest type of percussive piling (the
diesel hammer) to quieter methods of both percussive and non-percussive
piling.
Quieter percussive methods include the hydraulic hammer and the drop hammer,
while non-percussive methods include hand-dug caissons (wells dug by hand
into which reinforced concrete is put) and mechanically bored piles (hollow
columns made by drills which grind and/or break the rock into which
reinforcement is put).
The system, which was implemented in late 1989, offers percussive piling
operators three kinds of daily permits - a three-hour permit for piling
operations which are unacceptably noisy (those which exceed the accepted
noise level for an area by more than 10 decibels); a five-hour permit for
those which are moderately noisy (those which exceed the level by between
one and 10 decibels); and a full 12-hour permit for piling operations which
do not exceed the acceptable noise level.
An added incentive is that quiet piling methods are permitted to run all
night, while the hours of operation for the three- and five-hour permits are
not chosen to the convenience of the contractor, but by the Environmental
Protection Department.
As time costs money and as construction deadlines are tight in Hong Kong,
the aim was to make noisy piling a frustrating, inefficient and uneconomic
proposition. The controls have brought about some improvements in the
thinking and behaviour of the construction industry in Hong Kong - it has
encouraged some of the larger contractors to test quieter methods of piling
and suppliers such as Daido of Japan and BSP of Britain to try to sell new
and more sophisticated piling technology to the local market.
According to one of the largest local suppliers of construction equipment,
China Engineers, the controls have also caused the sales of new diesel
hammers to dry up in the last few years.
But statistics compiled by the Environmental Protection Department present
something of a dilemma - the number of three-hour permits has not declined
during 1990, meaning the incentive scheme is not working or at least not as
quickly as it was intended to.
On Hong Kong Island and Kowloon, the two most built-up parts of Hong Kong
and hence the most 'noise sensitive', the combined number of three-hour
permits in each quarter last year was, respectively, 60, 70, 58, 60. In the
New Territories, the rural/new urban development part of Hong Kong, the
permit numbers were 19, 23, 16, 12.
Even more discouraging is the fact that the total number of three-hour
permits (318) exceeded the total number of five-hour and 12-hour permits
combined (276). But the Environmental Protection Department does not feel
defeated by these statistics and believes contractors are going through a
transition period. It will soon carry out a survey to ask contractors
whether they are planning to use quieter methods.
Andrew Kwan Siu-hei, acting principal environmental protection officer in
the Noise Control Group, said many of Hong Kong's contractors are small
operators who are reluctant to change their work practices and reluctant to
buy new equipment. 'Maybe they (the small contractors) are used to the old
technology. Better to let large contractors test new methods. I think sooner
or later they will change,' said Kwan.
Construction industry representatives say the issue is complicated and that
the problem lies with Hong Kong's outdated building regulations. These
regulations are enforced by another government department, the Buildings and
Lands Department, whose record of co-operation with the Environmental
Protection Department is less than good.
Although the regulations are about to be revised, so far they have
undermined the success of the incentive scheme. Rod Buckell, technical
manager with the piling company Franki Kier and chairman of the
environmental committee of the Hong Kong Construction Association, said
contractors would change overnight if the financial incentive was there.
The reason they did not was because an outdated formula governing pile
driving in the building regulations makes it cheaper to use diesel hammers
rather than hydraulic hammers, which would be given a five-hour permit under
the Hong Kong system. Contractors cannot simply switch to bored piles for
every job because they mostly follow tender designs drawn up by engineers
and because the type of piling used depends on a number of factors,
primarily cost, time, the size and type of site, and the weight of the
building being erected.
'Quietness has nothing to do with the design of piling in Hong Kong. Cost is
paramount,' said Buckell. There is one area, however, where the new piling
controls are having a definite beneficial effect - the ability to pile all
night with quiet methods. Buckell said this has made bored piling using new
and sophisticated equipment more economic than it was before and has helped
to loosen the hold percussive or 'driven piling' has on the industry.
'By limiting the number of hours driven can work, bored is now economic,'
said Buckell. He estimates the permit system has increased the cost of
driven piling (using steel piles) by about 10 to 15 per cent. But Buckell
also asks, why use piles at all for the foundations of buildings?
The cutting edge of foundation work these days in Hong Kong and countries
such as France, Germany and Canada is a method called 'deep compaction'. The
soil is compacted almost back into its rocky state by vibration using steel
pokers or is pressed down under the impact of a heavy mass. It is useful for
land reclamation work, of which Hong Kong will be doing a lot over the next
10 years, and at HKDollars 15 (Pounds 1) per cubic metre it costs about half
the price of piling.
Its main drawbacks are that it can only be done on sand - not on mud - and
the height of buildings above is limited to about 11 storeys. Yet it is not
hard to see that 'deep compaction' could have wide application throughout
Asia, especially in countries where earthquake problems limit the height of
buildings, such as in Taiwan, or in developing countries which do not need
to build skyscrapers.

FT  24 APR 91 / Jobs: Consultant discovers surprising differences between
candidates either side of 40 - Fresh light on the age-barrier paradox
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT LAST the Jobs column has been supplied with a clue to a question that has
mystified it these past 18 years or more. Why do senior executives, mostly
aged at least 40, typically resist taking on people over 40 to work for them
as executives?
The reason usually cited for refusing to recruit same is that folk of such
advanced years are no longer up to the work. But that surely rebounds
awkwardly on the executives doing the recruiting. So unless there is
evidence that the 'past-it' clause does not apply to 40-pluses already
ranked as seniors (and I've never seen any) we would seem to be faced with a
paradox.
Fortunately, a way out has been found by recruiter Barrie Whitaker of the
consultancy arm of Price Waterhouse. His work entails assessing
job-candidates by a variety of measures - tests of verbal and numerical
reasoning, and of personality, as well as 'in-tray' exercises  - and he has
lately compared the under-40s' results with those of their elders.
So far, only one occupational group has provided him with enough candidates
for the findings to be statistically respectable. It consists of finance
executives, of whom he has tested 100 on the right side of the age bar, and
77 on the wrong side. But he says the results are similar for other types
such as general managers and personnel and production people.
A further thing that proved much the same was the reasoning-test performance
of the under- and over-40s. Apart from a marginal lead for the younger set
on the numerical measure, there was no difference between them.
Where the two age-groups did contrast was in persuasiveness, friendliness,
decisiveness and astuteness. The oldies came out stronger on all those
counts, which would apparently give them an edge in the job of managing.
Nevertheless there were other factors which cast light on their unpopularity
as executive recruits. For example, the oldies were more critical and
controlling than the younger set, and less democratic, practical and
conscientious in sticking to boring, repetitive tasks.
Hence it seems that, at the same time as being better equipped to work as
managers, the over-40s are more difficult to manage. But that still leaves
the question why senior executives of comparable years are averse to taking
on the challenge of managing them.
The answer, Barrie Whitaker thinks, lies in another unexpected difference he
has found between the two age-groups. The over-40s are more competitive. So
senior recruiters, being of that nature themselves, probably see similarly
inclined as well as better equipped older candidates as a greater threat to
them in their own positions.
NOW to the table below, which gives indications of the pay prospects held
out by different kinds of specialist work in the United Kingdom. The figures
come from the latest survey made for the British Institute of Management by
the Remuneration Economics consultancy.
Dated at January 1, the study covered 24,651 middle- and upper-ranked staff
in 385 widely varied organisations throughout the UK, which together employ
over a tenth of the country's workforce. Anyone wanting the weighty report,
which costs Pounds 325, should contact Peter Stevens of the consultancy at
51 Portland Rd, Kingston-upon-Thames, Surrey KT1 2SH; tel 081-549 8726, fax
081-541 5705.
My table is confined to 11 specialisms commonly found in companies, and in
each case shows the average total money pay - bonuses and such besides
salaries - at seven levels of seniority from director downwards. Except for
'Management services' which includes information technology, and 'Company
secretary' which covers in-house legal services, the specialisms should need
no further explanation.
As may be seen, the one with the best top pay is financial management. But
measured by the average prospects across all seven ranks, it is second to
the company secretarial area. Third by the same measure comes marketing
followed by management services, R and D, personnel, sales, engineering
design etc, purchasing, distribution, and manufacturing.
FINALLY to four jobs. All are being handled by headhunters who may not
identify their clients. They therefore promise to abide by applicants'
requests not to be named to the employer at this stage of the proceedings.
The first pair, being offered through Brian Standring, are for technical
services managers initially based near London with a probability, though no
certainty, of transfer to central Africa. They will work for an
international group making and distributing products including food and
beverages, and will be responsible for efficient and profitable production.
The more senior will require higher-level experience than the second. But
both must be engineers who understand finance as well as up-to-date
production methods such as total quality management and just-in-time
manufacturing. They need to be French-speaking too.
Salaries plus bonuses Pounds 46,000 and Pounds 35,000 respectively. Cars and
stock-options among perks.
Inquiries to the Standring Partnership, 83 Wycombe Rd, Marlow,
Buckinghamshire SL7 3HZ; tel 0628 471185, fax 0628 482240.
The other two jobs are in the London options-sales team of an international
bank, and are offered through recruiter John Williams of Russell, Williams
and Associates (45 St Mary's Rd, London W5 5RQ; tel 081-579 1082, fax
081-566 2024).
Both posts need high numeracy, with one also requiring success in marketing
currency options, and the other the same in marketing interest-rate options
with emphasis on caps and floors.
Salaries about Pounds 30,000 with bonus on results, and cars.

FT  24 APR 91 / FT Law Report: Negligent valuer pays no damages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWINGCASTLE v GIBSON House of Lords (Lord Keith of Kinkel, Lord Brightman,
Lord Griffiths, Lord Oliver of Aylmerton and Lord Lowry): April 18 1991
A MORTGAGEE who lends in reliance on a negligent valuer's report, and who
would not have lent but for that report, cannot claim damages from the
valuer for loss of contractual interest due from the borrower on the loan
sum if the borrower defaults. But, in addition to the difference between
sums paid out and sums recovered, he can claim interest at a commercial rate
on the loan sum, to compensate for the time he was deprived of its use.
The House of Lords so held when allowing an appeal by the defendant valuer,
Mr Alastair Gibson, a chartered surveyor, from a Court of Appeal decision
(FT, April 6 1990) upholding a County court assessment of Pounds 7,136
damages owed by him to the plaintiff, Swingcastle Ltd.
LORD LOWRY said that at the beginning of 1985 Mr John Clarke and his wife
were in financial difficulties. Their home was mortgaged. They owed Pounds
1,700 to a building society and Pounds 6,300 to a finance company.
Being anxious to pay off those debts, they went to brokers whose business
included putting borrowers in touch with lenders.
The brokers instructed the valuer to survey the property and give a report
for the benefit of whoever might become their lending principals.
The valuer placed the forced sale value at Pounds 18,000. Relying on his
valuation, Swingcastle lent Mr and Mrs Clarke Pounds 10,000 secured by a
first charge over the property.
The entire loan was used to pay the Pounds 1,700 and Pounds 6,300 debts, and
the Pounds 2,000 brokers' fee.
The loan was repayable by 120 monthly instalments at 36.51 per cent annual
interest. If the borrowers went into arrears, the lenders were entitled to
add outstanding interest to the principal sum and charge interest on the
whole, at 45.619 per cent.
The borrowers quickly fell into arrears and surrendered possession on June
30 1986. The lenders sold the property for Pounds 12,000. Completion took
place on February 27 1987. On September 4 1987 the lenders issued a writ
against Mr Gibson, claiming damages for loss allegedly sustained by them in
reliance on his negligent valuation.
They pleaded loss comprised of Pounds 19,912.96, being the 'amount required
to redeem the loan as at February 27 1987', Pounds 401.35 estate agents'
fees, and Pounds 983.25 legal costs. Those sums, less the Pounds 12,000 sale
proceeds totalled Pounds 9,297.56.
Liability was admitted in the County court and it was admitted that but for
the valuer's negligence the lenders would not have made any loan to the
borrowers. The sole issue was the measure of damages on the basis that, on a
competent valuation the lenders would have made no loan.
About some of the figures there was no dispute. The lenders' outgoings
included the Pounds 10,000, the Pounds 401.35 and the Pounds 983.25. On the
other side of the account, the lenders had received Pounds 1,734 from the
borrowers between February 1985 and April 1986, and Pounds 12,000 from the
purchasers of the property.
The disputed ingredient was the Pounds 19,912.96.
The lenders arrived at that figure by calculating the amount of principal
and interest outstanding, having regard to the initial 36.51 per cent rate,
and the 45.619 per cent penal rate.
In the County court Judge Harris QC allowed the claim and gave judgment for
Pounds 7,136.41 with interest and costs.
The valuer's case was that damages should have been assessed on the basis
that the lenders were entitled to be placed in the position that they would
have been in if they had received a competent valuer's report and had
consequently made no loan.
He said damages were to be calculated on the footing that the lenders should
(1) take credit for the Pounds 10,000, the Pounds 401.35, and the Pounds
983.25; and (2) give credit for Pounds 1,734 paid and Pounds 12,000 received
on sale of the property; and that the lenders had for two years been
deprived of the use of Pounds 10,000 which they would not have lent but for
the negligent valuation.
In the court of Appeal Lord Justice Neill reviewed a number of authorities
including Baxter v Gapp (1939) 2KB 271 which had been successfully relied on
in the County court. He concluded Baxter was binding and that the judge was
right to assess the damages in the way that he did.
He then considered the case as if it were free from authority.
He began with the principle in Livingstone v Rawyards (1880) 5 App Cas
25,39, that damages should 'put the party who has been injured . . . in the
same position as he would have been in if he had not sustained the wrong'.
He said that where a client would not have lent at all but for the negligent
valuation, a number of approaches to assessment were possible. One was that
the lender could be awarded unpaid interest owed when the security was
realised. That was the method adopted in Baxter.
But, said Lord Justice Neill, 'to award damages on this basis is in effect
to treat the valuer as the guarantor of the contract of loan'. In the
absence of authority he would have rejected that solution.
Other methods, he said, were to award a sum equivalent to what the money
would have earned as interest on another loan, or on deposit or if invested
elsewhere. Whether any of those methods suited a case would depend on the
evidence.
Baxter was regarded by all three members of the Court of Appeal as authority
for accepting the lenders' approach to the claim for interest.
In Baxter, (1) the trial judge calculated interest by reference to what the
mortgagor had failed to pay under her contract; but (2) the appropriate rate
of interest was never an issue between the parties or in the mind of the
court. The real issue was whether the plaintiff could recover consequential
loss.
Having regard to point (1), the case was almost by accident an authority for
the proposition by which the Court of Appeal in the present case found
itself reluctantly bound.
Baxter was not an attractive precedent. The approach seemed contrary to
principle. The aggrieved party was entitled to be placed in the same
position as if the wrong had not occurred, not to receive compensation for
lost interest at the contractual rate.
The valuer's approach in the present case, and Lord Justice Neill's
analysis, were correct.
What the lenders lost was the use of the Pounds 10,000 while locked up in
the loan.
There was no cut and dry solution to calculating the amount of damages in
cases of this kind. It depended on the evidence.
The lenders ought to have presented their claim on the basis that, if the
valuer had advised properly, they would not have lent the money. Where they
went wrong was to claim that the valuer deprived them of interest they would
have received if the borrowers had paid up. The fallacy of their case was
that they had been trying to obtain compensation for the borrowers' failure,
not damages for the valuer's negligence.
Taking Pounds 10,000, Pounds 401.35 and Pounds 983.25 on one side, and
Pounds 12,000 and Pounds 1,734 on the other, the lenders were Pounds
2,349.40 in credit.
In the absence of evidence as to how the lenders financed the loan or how
the money, if not lent, could have been profitably employed, 12 per cent
interest was the proper rate at which to recompense the lenders for being
deprived of their Pounds 10,000. Two years would yield Pounds 2,400, but one
might ask whether it was reasonable for the valuer to bear liability to date
of sale in February 1987, the property having been surrendered in June 1986.
It was for the lenders to prove their case. They had not appeared. In the
light of that fact and the figures, it would not be fair or sensible to
remit the action to the County court for new assessment.
The appeal was allowed. Their Lordships agreed.
For Mr Gibson: Roger Toulson QC and Roger Stewart (Reynolds Porter
Chamberlain).
Swingcastle was not represented.

FT  24 APR 91 / Management: The struggle to breach the Whitehall Wall -
Government and industry must both play their part
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Geoffrey Morgan was plucked from the ranks of the civil service as a
potential high-flyer and seconded for two years to Guinness's brewing
operations, his arrival at the company's reception desk set the alarm bells
ringing.
His induction into Guinness 20 years ago provided him with his first
experience of the mutual suspicions which separate Whitehall from the world
of business. 'I turned up with my official briefcase and the gate-keeper
immediately alerted the staff that Customs and Excise were on the premises.
The company was not up to anything but it liked to be prepared when
officialdom called. I was quickly given a less formal-looking briefcase.'
Though Whitehall-wise, Morgan was naive when it came to the business world
and jumped at the opportunity to see it from the inside. He was astonished
at the lack of paperwork and what he saw as the simplicity of the company's
objectives - 'selling more beer'.
By contrast, helping to run a country, he suggests, without any attempt to
belittle the daily challenges confronting industry, can be quite
complicated.
His remarks offer an insight into the cultural differences which have long
separated public service and private enterprise and which many believe
could, if more effectively bridged, help improve Britain's economic
performance.
By spending time with Guinness, Morgan climbed over what the Public Policy
Unit has just dubbed the 'Whitehall Wall' - the barrier between government
and industry. According to PPU, which monitors and advises on government
policy, the wall is built squarely on lack of understanding, poor
explanation and invariably unhelpful attitudes.
A PPU report, published by the Bow Group, the centre-right think tank,
concludes that the government's outlook remains steadfastly inward. It
claims that Whitehall, despite the phased introduction of private sector
disciplines into its revenue-raising operations, has barely started to
comprehend the needs of the enterprise culture which its recent political
masters have tried to spread.
Industry, on the other hand, is accused of paying scant attention to the
process of policy-making and of invariably leaving responsibility for
dealing with government in the hands of unsuitable employees. Companies are
urged to regard the task of enlightening government about their activities
as a duty and social responsibility.
The system of civil service recruitment does not help. The Civil Service
Selection Board, which interviews all the most promising entrants, has no
brief to foster either commercial disciplines or greater empathy between
government and governed. Only one in a thousand of those officials entering
a Whitehall department at the first level of middle management has any
working experience of a commercial environment.
The PPU says that the 'bottom line' to businessmen is financial; their
frustration is with officials who draft policy without fully appreciating
the market consequences of their actions.
Top-ranking civil servants are portrayed in the same mould as judges, almost
exclusively receiving their training in a cloistered environment both
technically and culturally removed from the world over which they may
exercise profound influence.
Lord Young, the former Trade and Industry Secretary, criticises the lack of
two-way traffic: 'Where are the very best of civil servants, who leave and
go into industry in their early forties, as the French do as a matter of
course? How many in our great companies have the faintest idea how
government really works? One or two, not more.
'We practice a doctrine of separation of experience that appears absolute.
Then we wonder why it is that government has an imperfect understanding of
the needs of commerce and industry.'
Progress towards overcoming the ghetto mentality between public and private
sectors has been more marked in other, often more vibrant, economies.
In Japan, for example, large numbers of 'Amagari' - or high-flyers - are
continually seconded from companies to spend up to two years in government
ministries, which command a far greater status in the eyes of businessmen
than is the case in Britain.
In France, the Ecole Nationale d'Administration provides civil servants with
contextual training intended to provide them with appropriate industrial and
business skills. Critics even suggest the system has gone too far, with the
development of equally critical political skills invariably neglected.
Sporadic attempts in Britain to enhance co-operation and understanding
between both sides have been under way since 1968. The initiative was
revitalised in 1989 by Lord Young as Trade and Industry Secretary with the
launch of the Bridge programme.
After his spell in the brewing industry, Geoffrey Morgan is now an
under-secretary in the Cabinet Office and the man primarily responsible for
secondment.
The British programme is essentially intended for 'rising stars' on both
sides. Larger, better-resourced companies tend to dominate the programme but
smaller companies are now being encouraged.
While many civil servants opt to join companies, as opposed to business
support organisations or financial institutions, they rarely express an
interest in manufacturing businesses. Among the most popular Whitehall
destinations for corporate employees are the 'economic' departments like the
Treasury, DTI and Energy.
In 1989, the Department of Trade and Industry, which employs 12,000 people
and is charged with 'assisting the process of wealth creation', despatched
41 people to join the wealth-creators. The DTI played host to 46
businessmen.
The total secondment programme during 1989 saw a total of 627 longer-term
placings on both sides of the Whitehall Wall, along with another 550
short-term attachments. At the same time, 69 civil servants took up
non-executive directorships with companies.
A separate, 'short-stay' arrangement, operated by the Whitehall and Industry
Group - a joint venture between industrialists and the Cabinet Office -
enables high-calibre civil servants to spend up to three weeks with
companies, participating at the highest levels of decision-making.
But the strong emphasis placed on quality rather than quantity for the
overall secondment programme cannot fully disguise some disappointment
within government and beyond over the still-limited scale of the initiative.
The Royal Institute of Public Administration, which is concerned with policy
making and administration in the public sector, has joined calls for the
secondment programme to be expanded and given a higher status by both sides
and deplores the sort of attitude which means some companies leave the job
to their community affairs or charity sections.
Chris Bright, a competition lawyer with Linklaters &amp; Paines, the solicitors,
recently finished a two-year spell with the Department of Trade and Industry
and enthusiastically supports the initiative. 'My view of the civil service
changed markedly. I got fed up being accused of working from ten o'clock
until four; the reality was that I had never worked harder in my life.'
Though full of admiration for the expertise and dedication of the senior
civil servants with whom he worked, Bright has some kindly criticism.
'There is a tendency for people within government departments to over-focus
on particular issues. They do not always get the broader picture and fail to
appreciate the wider impact of the decisions they take.'
Bright also believes that too many civil servants remain over-sensitive
about publicly imparting information and are suspicious of any scheme which
lifts the veil: 'The inbuilt perception among some public servants that the
people should not know certain things is a mentality that must be addressed
and overcome.'
Susan Gardiner left Customs and Excise to spend two years with P&amp;0
Containers and says the experience broadened her entire approach to
decision-making. She says she is 'far more willing to be optimistic' about
resolving problems.
She does not believe, however, that the ethos of private sector management
can necessarily be transferred into the civil service, where a wider,
political perspective is necessary.
Gardiner would like to see the secondment programme extended but says
industry, too, has to be willing to participate. Businesses might not, she
suggests, always demonstrate the sort of broader, long-term view such a
commitment demands.
Given a civil service more than half a million strong, the Cabinet Office
hopes the current rate of secondments can be stepped up. In the meantime,
one of its biggest challenges is to find companies prepared to take Inland
Revenue staff; the quest for mutual understanding does, apparently, have
some boundaries.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFFREY OWEN

<TEXT>
As a mechanism for disciplining bad management, the hostile takeover has its
attractions. But it can be overdone. When the market for corporate control
becomes over-heated, as it did in the mid-1980s, assets are shuffled and
re-shuffled for short-term gain and sound companies are damaged in the
process. Can anything be done to limit the intensity of the next takeover
wave?
The outcome of takeover contests would be more rational if the opportunistic
element were reduced and the principal actors - above all, the institutional
investors whose votes are usually crucial - were forced to focus on the
long-term prospects of the companies concerned. At present, as in the
NCR-AT&amp;T case in the US, investors have to sort their way through a stream
of one-sided propaganda, accompanied by a series of legal manoeuvres as the
contestants seek to gain advantage.
In these circumstances it is hard to answer the fundamental question - how
well has the defendant management been doing and what is it likely to
achieve in the future.
One of the merits of the proposal put forward last year by two American
lawyers, Martin Lipton and Steven Rosenblum*, is that it offers a more
orderly framework in which takeover decisions can be taken. Directors of
public companies would be judged on their performance over five years. At
each quinquennial meeting they would offer themselves for re-election on the
basis of a detailed account of their stewardship over the preceding five
years and their plans for the next five; past performance and future
projections would be subject to an appraisal carried out by an independent
investment bank or consulting firm. Hostile bids could only be considered at
the quinquennial meeting; directors would be free from takeover threats in
the interim, but their jobs would clearly be on the line at the end of each
five-year period.
This approach meets the desire of managers not to be judged solely on
short-term financial results, but without making their lives too
comfortable. They would have to be more open and explicit about their
forward plans; their ability to fulfil those plans would be exposed to
rigorous public scrutiny.
Institutional shareholders
The usual reaction of City practitioners to the Lipton-Rosenblum paper is
polite indifference: do we really need to tear up the existing system just
because of a few takeover excesses? But a virtue of the proposal is that it
builds on existing arrangements for reporting to shareholders.
Unlike most other proposals for reform, it does not have unrealistic
expectations about changing the behaviour of non-executive directors or
institutional shareholders. Most institutions have neither the resources nor
the motivation to become 'interested owners', monitoring companies on a
continuous basis; it is not obvious that the management of those companies
would be improved if they did so.
But shareholders do need reliable information on which to base investment
judgments. Just as the proposed accounting changes in the UK would improve
the quality of financial information, so the Lipton-Rosenblum reforms would
provide better insight into overall corporate objectives and performance.
The proposals do involve restrictions in the free market for corporate
control. But takeovers, especially those involving large companies, are
important events with economic and social repercussions. It is right that
contested bids should be decided only after the most careful consideration.
The argument is not that the market for corporate control should cease to
exist - it remains an important source of flexibility in the Anglo-American
capitalist system - but that the rules governing its operation should be
tightened in a way which makes bad takeovers less likely. The quinquennial
proposal involves a skilful trade-off between the interests of managers,
investors and society as a whole. It does so by uniting boards of directors
and shareholders behind what ought to be the primary goal of the enterprise
 -to maximise profits over the long term.

FT  24 APR 91 / Public-sector workers urged to be flexible
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIONS organising in the public sector should be prepared to be flexible
about traditional bargaining structures to allow better delivery of
services, a senior TUC official said yesterday.
In a study of how unions can help improve standards in public services, Mr
Bill Callaghan, TUC assistant general secretary, said unions needed to take
'a bold and innovative stance' and allow devolution of power.
Mr Callaghan was writing in a policy paper published by the Institute for
Public Policy Research, a left-wing research group, and the TUC. The paper
said unions should accept that competitive tendering could be good for
services.
The paper includes other contributions questioning whether unions should
change policies. It is intended as a stimulus to the Labour party and unions
to review attitudes to how public services are delivered.
The contribution of unions to better delivery of public services is highly
sensitive for Labour because of the role of public-sector strikes in 1979 in
bringing down the last Labour government.
The paper was welcomed by Mr Rodney Bickerstaffe, chairman of the TUC's
economic committee, who said unions did not 'want everything back the way it
was a decade or more ago'. He said they could not simply defend the status
quo.
Mr Callaghan said there was no longer a consensus in the labour movement in
favour of direct employment of labour by councils in all cases. The case in
favour of direct employment would have to be made in a more sophisticated
manner.
In another contribution, Mr John Stewart, head of the school of public
policy at Birmingham University, said that a form of public service more
accountable to people would require a new degree of flexibility among staff.
He said existing bargaining structures created barriers that prevented
manual workers' full potential from being realised, and unions had to be
prepared to negotiate new terms and conditions.

FT  24 APR 91 / Audit Office faults NHS local autonomy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NATIONAL Health Service's Pounds 4bn-a-year supplies operation could
benefit from management techniques used by companies such as Boots and Marks
and Spencer, the National Audit Office says today.
An NAO study of the management of complex operations in private-sector
companies showed that the NHS's approach differed sharply 'in nearly every
respect'. In particular, the NAO report says, none of 16 private companies
surveyed 'permitted local autonomy on the scale allowed throughout the NHS'.
The report's conclusion that decentralised structures have prevented the NHS
from maximising its purchasing efficiency comes when the government's health
reforms, introduced this month, are encouraging still more local autonomy in
many areas of the health service.
The NAO examined how Boots, Marks and Spencer and Compass Services UK, a
contract caterer, handled their equivalent of the NHS supplies organisation,
which provides hospitals with food, bedding and equipment.
Between them the three companies supply about 4,000 delivery points and, the
NAO says, 'face similar logistic challenges' as the NHS. In addition, a
consultants' report was commissioned on 13 other private companies in
manufacturing, food processing and retailing.
A fundamental difference between the public and private sectors was the
greater emphasis placed by the private companies on central control. They
also made greater use of information technology to help manage their
supplies operations, and had management information 'on tap', with senior
managers exercising close oversight of activities.
The report concludes that the NHS supplies organisation 'does not apply
financial and commercial disciplines which are common in the private
sector'.
It demonstrates differences of view between the NAO and the Department of
Health over the value of devolving decision-making on purchasing. The NAO
says the 'variety of decentralised structures' in the NHS had led to
fragmented purchasing, making it unlikely that operating costs would be
minimised and purchasing power maximised. The Department of Health argued
that decentralised structures offered 'positive advantages such as local
accessibility and ownership'.
The NAO said the most significant need was for more positive strategic
oversight by senior management.
Department of Health officials told the NAO that, while recognising some of
the points raised, 'private-sector practice was not necessarily appropriate
for adoption by the NHS as the businesses were different in many respects'.

RECORD numbers of power stations are being built in England and Wales, the
seven-year statement issued by the National Grid Company disclosed
yesterday.
Nine new stations, with a total capacity of 7,400MW, have signed agreements
for connection to the national electricity grid, NGC said.
New stations planned by National Power and PowerGen, the two large
generators, account for about 3,000MW of the new capacity. The rest is being
built by independent power projects, notably the ICI and Enron consortium,
which is planning an 1,875MW station on Teesside.
The new plant would mean about 35 per cent spare capacity on the system,
compared with an ideal surplus of about 24 per cent. That high margin would
be likely to force old stations to close, NGC said. It had taken into
account peak electricity demand expectations, which it predicted would rise
from 49,200MW in the year ending March 1992 to 52,000MW in the year ending
March 1998. These forecasts were broadly unchanged from those in the last
seven-year statement.
Mr John Uttley, the NGC's finance director, said the company was spending
more on infrastructure and less on refurbishment as a result of the many new
stations joining the grid. NGC could afford the capital, he said. He
expected capital expenditure to rise from Pounds 300m in the year ending
March 1991 to Pounds 400m in the following year. That would accord broadly
with expectations at the time of the electricity flotation, Mr Uttley said.

FT  24 APR 91 / Lamont shifts emphasis of economic monitoring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Norman Lamont, the chancellor, yesterday announced two fundamental shifts
of emphasis in the Treasury's monitoring of the economy.
In a speech to the annual convention of the Institute of Directors, Mr
Lamont acknowledged that official economic data would continue to signal
that the UK was in recession in spite of the output recovery expected to
begin in the second half of the year.
At the same time, underlying inflation - as measured by the retail prices
index, excluding mortgage interest payments and the community charge - would
be 'meaningless in the coming year' as a result of the changes to the poll
tax and VAT announced in the Budget.
To track underlying inflation, the Treasury would monitor closely the RPI
less mortgage interest payments. That would recognise the largely offsetting
nature of the partial taxation switch from community charge to VAT and
exclude the volatility from changes in interest rates.
To assess the shape of the recovery, the Treasury would focus on anecdotal
surveys of consumer and business confidence, as they had given the best
early warnings of the recession which started in the middle of last year. In
general, forecasts - which rely more on economic statistics - failed to
predict the recession.
Mr Lamont said he was sceptical towards forecasts but had a lot of respect
for data. Lagging indicators of the economy - such as unemployment figures -
would continue to signal recession for some time after the recovery had
begun.

FT  24 APR 91 / The Council Tax: Independent commission planned - Local
Government Structure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GOVERNMENT-appointed Local Government Commission will be established to
prepare for changes in the structure of English councils from April 1994.
The commission, while independent, will operate within guidelines designed
to achieve government intentions of replacing the present two-tier structure
of county and district councils with unitary authorities.
Single-tier authorities, says the government's consultation paper published
yesterday, would produce 'more efficient and more accountable local
government' and reflect people's sense of identity with their communities.
There will be no wholesale abolition of existing county or district
councils, although the consultation document makes clear the government's
intention to move towards unitary authorities. 'In some places, it may be
best for existing authorities to be merged; in others the best approach may
be to create or recreate quite different authorities. In some areas there
could be a case for two tiers. The aim will be to achieve the structure
which best matches the particular circumstances of each area.'
Under the present two-tier system, the paper says, there was often confusion
over which authority was responsible for providing a particular service.
Such confusion clouded accountability.
Some authorities created by the last substantial local government
reorganisation in 1974 were still not wholly accepted by the communities
they served. In areas where the two tiers needed to work together - such as
planning - there was sometimes conflict and tension between the policies of
country and district councils.
'Changing the structure of local government will not in itself solve all the
problems. But in the main it is desirable that people can identify one
authority which secures services in their area. Having a single tier should
reduce bureaucracy and improve the co-ordination of services, increasing
quality and reducing costs.'
The consultation paper emphasises the government's determination to shift
the basis of local-authority activity from the direct provision of services
to the 'enabling' role of organising them. It says the government is
committed to contracting-out local authority services to the private sector
and voluntary organisations where that is justified by market-testing. 'The
aim should be to secure the best services at least cost.'
Such a changing role of local government, the paper says, significantly
altered the presumption that there was an ideal size of authority for the
efficient delivery of services. The government expects a range of sizes for
new authorities, determined by local circumstances, to emerge from the
proposed Local Government Commission review.
The consultation paper does not propose to change the structure of local
government in London and the metropolitan counties, where unitary
authorities have existed since 1985. Ministers are, however, looking for
improved ways of handling some joint services such as voluntary-sector and
arts funding in those conurbations.
Specific proposals to establish new unitary authorities will, the paper
says, have to be 'cost-effective'. The government plans to issue detailed
guidance on the basis for costings. Mr Michael Heseltine, environment
secretary, would reach decisions on proposals to change the system of local
government in a particular area after receiving the commission's
recommendations.
The complexity of existing electoral arrangements, which vary between local
authorities, may, the paper says, 'discourage people from taking an interest
in local government'. It finds a case for reconsidering electoral cycles and
numbers of councillors. Possible changes to local electoral arrangements
will be discussed in a consultation paper.
Views on yesterday's proposals are being sought by June 14. Separate papers
are being produced on the structure of local government in Scotland and
Wales.

FT  24 APR 91 / World Trade News: Airbus chief vows to fight off Gatt
challenge by US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission will use 'every legal weapon' at its disposal to
defend the interests of Airbus in its aircraft subsidies dispute with the
US, Mr Jean Pierson, the head of the European aircraft consortium, said
yesterday.
The long-standing trade dispute has entered an important new phase with the
US taking the issue before the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(Gatt). The US claims the European consortium has received direct subsidies
totalling Dollars 25.9bn which have distorted trade in commercial aircraft.
But Mr Pierson, in an address to the Cranfield School of Management,
vigorously rebutted the US claims and called for a more balanced
redistribution of the world civil aircraft market.
'Airbus stands today as the only recourse against the monopoly of the civil
aerospace industry by US manufacturers,' Mr Pierson said. 'It must carefully
protect its hard-won positions in the strictest respect of international
agreements,' he added.
Mr Pierson claimed that the latest US attacks against Airbus coincided with
the European consortium's twin strategy of capturing a third of the world
airliner market by 2010 and developing a 700-seater aircraft to challenge
Boeing's monopoly of the jumbo airliner market.
He also suggested that the American attacks had intensified with the
approach of the first flight next October of the new long distance,
four-engined Airbus A340 aircraft which will increase competition for Boeing
and McDonnell Douglas in the long-haul airliner market.
Despite the aircraft industry's current difficulties, Mr Pierson expected
air traffic to show at least 5 per cent growth a year during the next 20
years, requiring the delivery of 12,300 new aircraft between now and 2010.
'This represents some Dollars 680bn worth of business of which Airbus firmly
intends to capture a third,' he said.
Responding to the latest US complaints, Mr Pierson said the European side
had recently made a number of proposals to redraft some of the contentious
articles of the Gatt civil aircraft agreement code. Europe, for example, had
agreed to limit to 45 per cent direct government support for research and
development of new Airbus programmes.
'From 100 per cent for the early Airbus programmes, launch aid has been
reduced to 60 per cent for our latest programme, the A330/A340 and to nil
for the A321,' Mr Pierson said. In return, Europe wanted total transparency
in the indirect support the US manufacturers receive from their government.
However, this proposal had been turned down by the US administration.
Mr Pierson claimed Boeing and McDonnell Douglas had received Dollars 23bn in
indirect supports from government agencies between 1978-87. The US, however,
disputes this.
Mr Pierson stressed that the European consortium's target was to finance
future programmes from internal funds. 'We have done so for the A321. As we
start delivering a complete range of aircraft from 1993 onwards, we will be
in a better position to compete with Boeing on an equal footing,' he said.

<TEXT>
FRANCE is poised to become Romania's leading foreign investor, following the
visit of President Francois Mitterrand to Bucharest last week.
Mr Mitterrand, the first head of state to visit Romania since the revolution
in December 1989, was accompanied by six ministers, a dozen leading
businessmen, and bankers from the French Foreign Trade Bank, the Credit
Commercial de France and Lazard Freres.
France clearly intends to take advantage of the strong cultural links
between the two countries.
French companies have been reluctant until now to invest in Romania, largely
because they have been waiting for the law on foreign investment to be
enacted this month.
Most western investments in Romania have tended to focus on small-scale
activities. In the first quarter of 1991, Germany and Italy invested the
most, with Dollars 5.2m and Dollars 2.2m, respectively.
However, French companies anxious to gain a foothold in eastern Europe now
appear to be taking Romania as a serious potential trading partner.
This shift in emphasis was confirmed by the companies who travelled with Mr
Mitterrand. They included:
CIT Alcatel. It is hoping to gain 40 per cent of the market in telephone
systems. It will be competing with Siemens of Germany, which signed a
joint-venture agreement last autumn.
Groupe Sucres et Denrees. It signed a FFr100m (Pounds 9.93m) contract for
the rehabilitation of sugar beet production and the construction of three
sugar refineries.
Other large companies about to sign contracts include Societe Generale des
Eaux, which is planning to modernise Bucharest's poor water system and Elf
Aquitaine, which is looking into the country's petrol stations network.
Bouygues. It signed during the presidential visit a letter of intent for the
largest joint venture in the country so far, the construction of an
international trade centre.
The government-backed French international radio service, Radio France
International, has been broadcasting locally since January. A bilingual
station in Bucharest is planned for later in the spring.
The francophone international channel, TV5 Europe, started broadcasting in
Bucharest the day the French president arrived.
France's cultural budget in Romania already amounts to FFrs70m, by far the
largest among western countries.

MR Jibril Aminu, the Nigerian oil minister, is due in Washington tomorrow to
sign further financing arrangements for the Oso Nigerian gas condensate
project.
He will meet officials from Mobil Producing Nigeria, an arm of the US oil
company, which is a partner in the project, to sign loans worth Dollars
530m.
The loans are being made partly by the World Bank and its commercial arm,
the International Finance Corporation, as well as Japan's Export-Import bank
and the US Export-Import bank. Total financing for the project which is due
on stream in 1993, is put at Dollars 885m.
The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation expects the project to produce
100,000 barrels of gas condensate a day in its first year of production.

</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH exporters made FFr11.4bn (Pounds 1.13bn) of net claims on
state-guaranteed contracts last year, equivalent to around 1 per cent of
France's total overseas sales, said Coface, the French export credit
guarantee agency.
The figure, the balance between overall repayments on state-guaranteed
exports handled by Coface and premium and other income, is a slight increase
on the FFr10.9bn of claims on state-covered exports paid out the previous
year.
It does not include claims expected from unpaid bills related to the Gulf
war, likely to be around of FFr5bn this year, forecast Coface officials.
However, Iraq was already among last year's worst payers, as were Egypt,
Morocco, Nigeria and Brazil, said officials.
Coface saw a 23 per cent rise in reimbursements it had to pay out on its own
account, rather than on the export credit guarantees it manages on behalf of
the Government. These rose from FFr290m to FFr345m, with the worst
performance coming from the recession-hit UK, plus Spain and Italy, said Mr
Henri Baquiast, chairman of Coface.
The group covers short term credits of less than three years and political
risks in the European Community, while it acts as an agency for the state
for most non-EC political risks and medium term credit guarantees.
Coface saw its operating profits fall from FFr133.8m in 1989 to FFr103.5m
last year, but exceptional gains lifted net earnings by FFr22.9m to
FFr158.4m.
Premium income on Coface's own activities rose by 9 per cent to FFr605m, but
Mr Baquiast did not expect the growth rate to improve significantly this
year, given the uncertain outlook for French industry's main export markets.
Coface was last year transformed from a government department into a
state-owned company, partly in anticipation of the European Commission's
increasingly tough policy on state support for exports.

FT  24 APR 91 / World Trade News: Dunkel acclaims free trade moves by
developing nations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MCDERMOTT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Uruguay Round on global trade liberalisation may have stalled last
December, but 45 countries, mostly developing ones, have liberalised their
trade policies since the round was launched in 1986.
These moves are recorded in the annual report of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) presented to the Council yesterday by Mr Arthur
Dunkel, the director-general.
While pointing optimistically towards this development within Gatt, which
now has 101 members, Mr Dunkel records that, in volume terms, the growth of
merchandise trade slowed in 1990 to 5 per cent from 7 the previous year.
World output growth slipped from 4 to 3 per cent, but both figures were
close to the average for the 1983-1990 period of expansion.
In spite of the slowdown in volume growth in 1990, the value of merchandise
trade rose by 13 per cent to Dollars 3,500bn, boosted by the 7 per cent
depreciation in the average value of the dollar.
Preliminary estimates indicate that trade in commercial services - including
transport, tourism, telecommunications, insurance and banking  - increased
by 12 per cent to about Dollars 770bn.
Much of the standstill in the Uruguay Round talks has been caused by the
impasse between the European Community and the US over the need for deep
cuts in agricultural subsidies.
Looking ahead to 1991, Gatt says that 'there is, as yet, no evidence that
the slowdown in economic growth in the major industrial countries -
including a fall in output in France, the United States and the United
Kingdom in the fourth quarter of last year - has run its course'. A world
recession is unlikely, it says, but the timing of a broadly-based pick-up in
growth rates is also unclear.
The measures undertaken by the 45 countries include tariff reductions and
'bindings' (tariffs fixed in schedules to Gatt which can only be raised if
compensation is negotiated), the elimination of quotas, the abolition of
import licensing restrictions and the removal of other non-tariff barriers.
Looking ahead to the remainder of this year, Mr Dunkel emphasises 'the
importance of pushing ahead with the Uruguay Round negotiations'.

FT  24 APR 91 / World Trade News: Poland to give birth to Fiat's new baby -
FSM is to produce a brand new car under licence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIAT is about to become the first western car maker to start production of a
new car range for western and eastern European markets exclusively from a
plant in eastern Europe.
The Italian company is to launch early next year a new mini car, the Fiat
Cinquecento (Fiat 500), which will be assembled under licence by FSM, one of
the two Polish state-owned car makers.
It is the first time that a model to be licensed by Fiat for production at a
foreign plant has been developed from scratch rather than derived from an
existing Italian model.
Fiat has invested L1,000bn (Pounds 453m) in developing the Cinquecento and
in plant and equipment to modernise the FSM assembly plant at Bielsko Biala,
Silesia.
Initially 160,000 cars a year will be produced. About 100,000 will be
exported to western Europe. Output could rise later to 220,000 cars a year.
Plant and equipment worth DM900m (Pounds 302m) has been supplied to FSM
under the Cinquecento development and production contract signed in 1987.
About half of this is being supplied by Italian machine tool and components
companies outside the Fiat group.
The currency needed by Poland to pay for the investment at FSM will be
generated by cars purchased by Fiat for sale through its dealer network in
western Europe.
As a result of this arrangement Fiat has taken on the entire commercial risk
for credit extended to Poland to buy plant and equipment both from the Fiat
group itself and from other suppliers.
Cover provided by SACE, the Italian state export credit insurance agency, is
limited to the risks of loss of revenue because of political events and
catastrophes, and actions by the Polish authorities which might limit FSM
production or block exports of finished cars.
The Cinquecento - named after Fiat's first baby car which pioneered the mini
car sector in the 1930s - will replace the existing Fiat 126, the smallest
car in the Fiat range.
The 126 was first produced in 1972 at the group's Cassino assembly plant in
Italy, but production was gradually transferred to the FSM plant at Bielsko
Biala from 1979. The Polish plant has been the sole production source for
the 126 since 1981.
Fiat is still seeking Polish government backing for a more far-reaching plan
to modernise and rationalise the entire Polish motor industry. It wants to
create a holding company combining FSM and FSO, the two state car makers, in
which Fiat would take the role of 'strategic investor', to build engine and
gearbox plants, and a licensing agreement to assemble the Fiat Tipo at the
FSO plant in Warsaw.
There is confusion over the future of the antiquated FSO operations,
however, which are centred on production of earlier Fiat designs under
licence.
Fiat's radical plan appeared to have gained the backing of Polish President
Lech Walesa on a recent visit to Italy, but FSO is also conducting competing
negotiations with General Motors for the assembly of Opel/Vauxhall cars in
Warsaw.
Mr Jack Smith, GM vice chairman responsible for international operations,
visited Warsaw last week for talks with FSO. The US car maker has completed
a feasibility study and is expected to begin negotiations with the
government and FSO within a month.
GM is considering investing Dollars 100m to establish an assembly operation
for 30-50,000 cars a year (on two or three shifts) at part of the existing
FSO facility.

<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S offer of up to 50,000 passports to key Hong Kong people has been
poorly received by managers and administrators, the individuals the package
was designed to attract.
Just fewer than 15,000 passports have been allocated for managers and
administrators, the largest job category in the package. The quota has been
under-subscribed by about 10 per cent, according to Mr Donald Tsang,
director of administration.
The package was introduced last year under the British Nationality Act. It
was one of a series of measures designed to restore confidence in Hong Kong,
severely shocked by the crackdown against pro-democracy demonstrators in
Peking in June 1989.
All the other job categories have been over-subscribed, some heavily. The
government received 1,000 applications from legal professionals by the time
the offer closed at the end of February against a quota for this category of
only 185.
Mr Tsang said the response by private sector managers and administrators was
not surprising because they were the only people who had to disclose details
about income.
Almost 400 passports were set aside within the managers and administrators
category for civil servants. Competition for these passports was fierce,
according to Mr Tsang.
The government received just over 63,800 applications for the first tranche
of 38,900 passports on offer for people in the general occupations and
disciplined services. A further 1,800 people, including entrepreneurs and
sensitive service personnel, have been invited to apply by the Governor.
The response was much poorer than expected. China's opposition to the
scheme, a feeling in Hong Kong the scheme was elitist and a dislike of the
UK were all blamed for the low level of interest.
'I only want a British passport so I can go and live in Paris after 1992,'
says a 28-year-old Hong Kong Chinese journalist who did apply.
Mr Tsang said any passports left over from the managers and administrators
category can be carried forward and given out in the second tranche when a
further 6,750 passports are on offer. Applications for the second tranche
will run from 1994 to June 1997, when Hong Kong is handed back to China.

<TEXT>
BRITAIN has offered to take in hundreds of Kuwaiti university students next
year as part of a package of technical and material help designed to get the
emirate's education system back on its feet.
A delegation of British educationalists, led by the British Council, made
the offer this week after the Kuwait government indicated it is placing the
highest priority on opening its schools and universities in August and
September.
Kuwait says it expects its 600 schools to be refurbished and ready by
August, but that damage to vital teaching equipment in universities and
other higher education institutions would hinder the return of some of the
emirate's 15,000 university students.
Mr Stuart Sutherland, the vice-chairman of London University, said he had
accordingly offered places to hundreds of Kuwaiti students, whose fees would
be payed by the Kuwait government, on a temporary basis. 'We could reopen a
small campus in London next year which would take 400-500 students,' he
said. 'And I"m sure other British polytechnics and universities could offer
some space.'
The delegation, led by Mr Timothy Raison, vice-chairman of the British
Council, also included Ove Arup, the architects, and Laing Consultants, who
discussed supplying Kuwait with everything from books to laboratory
equipment. Mr Raison said no firm contracts had been offered, but added:
'The government seems very willing to commit themselves quickly to
re-equipping.'
Mr Raison also said the Kuwaiti authorities expressed interest in setting up
creches, in order that Kuwaiti women could be encouraged to take up teaching
posts. This is a further indication that the government is determined to
replace Palestinians, who traditionally made up the core of Kuwait's
teaching staff, in public service posts.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL'S central bank yesterday warned that the country could face
unprecedented emigration and unemployment approaching 20 per cent of the
workforce if the government did not quickly enact economic reforms to cope
with a wave of immigration by Soviet Jews.
Prof Michael Bruno, governor of the Bank of Israel, also linked the issue to
present efforts by the US to mediate a Middle East peace settlement. He said
Israel risked losing vital US assistance for raising the huge funds the
country will require to finance immigration if the peace process failed.
'US readiness to help finance (immigrant absorption) has a significant
importance to our ability to raise money in the international financial
marketplace and a greater expert than myself would tell you what the
conditions are under which the US will be ready to invest here,' said Prof
Bruno, who is due to leave his post shortly.
A 60-page bank plan for absorption of Soviet immigrants, expected to total
more than 400,000 by the end of this year, called for a series of radical
reforms as well as short-term measures to boost employment and improve
infrastructure. It said that as many as 200,000 immigrants and additional
native Israelis might leave the country, and unemployment could almost
double within two years if such steps were not taken.
It called for cuts in taxation on business and employment, the scrapping of
labour market rigidities, greater capital market freedoms, and a more
liberal foreign trade regime. Mr Bruno complained that a government plan
last September to enact a number of these prescriptions had never been
carried out.
'Non-implementation of the policies would prevent the possibility of fully
enjoying the fruits of the immigration. The pace of productive growth would
be too slow, unemployment would grow to dangerous dimensions, followed by
growing emigration,' the bank's plan said.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LUXEMBOURG yesterday proposed that the European Community establish a
fully-fledged central bank during the transition to monetary union, but
delay its creation until 1996.
The plan was tabled by the EC's current president at the regular fortnightly
meeting of special negotiators on economic and monetary union (Emu). It is
designed to strike a balance between the insistence of France and several
other states that the European central bank be set up in 1994, the planned
start of the transition to Emu, and the desire of Germany to delay such a
bank until the late-1990s target date for a single currency.
Ever since last October's Rome summit which called for a new monetary
institution in 1994, there has been a war of words between Paris and Bonn on
how to interpret that summit's communique, with Mr Jacques Delors, the
Commission president, intervening from time to time to accuse Germany of
backsliding.
The Luxembourg plan calls for a three phase move towards a fully-operational
European central bank. Six months after an Emu treaty comes into force,
perhaps 1993 or 1994 depending on the speed of ratification by national
parliaments, the present 'committee' of EC central bank governors would be
transformed into a 'council'. Its role would be to improve co-ordination of
national monetary policies, whose implementation would still be in national
hands.
By 1996, or earlier if governments agreed unanimously, the European system
of central banks would be set up, to take over the running of the European
monetary system and act as a clearing house for the Ecu.
Finally, from the date when EC governments had taken the final decision to
merge their currencies, the European central bank could expand its role to
hold and manage foreign exchange reserves. It could also start to make
policy recommendations to national central banks, and be empowered to make
those recommendations public if necessary.

<TEXT>
THE central banks of the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary
yesterday pledged support for a new banking payments system for trade among
east European nations.
The system would use as a common currency the Ecu, the basket of the main
west European currencies. It has been proposed by the Ecu Banking
Association, a group of west European banks, and would be based on an
existing Ecu bank-payments operation in Switzerland.
Officials from the central banks of the four countries were at a meeting in
Turin to discuss the concept. Three west European banks - Deutsche Bank of
Germany, Credit Lyonnais of France and San Paolo Bank of Italy - have said
they will help the initiative.
The east European nations are to discuss the system further over the next
few months. Assuming details such as legal and technical issues and problems
over lines of credit can be sorted out, the venture is likely to be
controlled by a group of banks from eastern Europe.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Soviet land reform in east Germany between 1945 and 1949, involving the
expropriation and redistribution of nearly one-third of the former communist
state's land, cannot be reversed, according to the German constitutional
court in Karlsruhe.
The Bonn government, under pressure from Moscow and from the short-lived
democratic government in east Berlin, had already accepted the Soviet land
reform in last year's unity treaty, but 14 individuals lodged formal
complaints that such acceptance was unconstitutional.
Yesterday's ruling, that the Bonn government was justified in accepting the
land reform, affects 3m hectares of land. The court advised that the
government should pay compensation to the former owners.
Ministers in Bonn welcomed the decision and said that it removed an
uncertainty that had held up new investment in many rural areas. Property
expropriated by the Nazis between 1933 and 1945 or by the East German
government after 1949 is, with some qualifications, still being returned to
former owners.
The uncertainty created by this slow and difficult process is still regarded
as one of the biggest obstacles to new investment in east Germany.
In the second half of 1990 east Germany had a GNP of DM105.3bn (Pounds
35.2bn) about 8.3 per cent of west Germany's GNP over the same period, the
Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said. Average gross monthly income in
east Germany was DM1,357, 37 per cent of the west German level.

He said the Bundesbahn, its DM47bn (Pounds 15.7bn) debt mountain higher than
annual turnover and with a deficit last year alone of DM5bn, was bankrupt in
the normal commercial sense. On current projections the debts of the
Bundesbahn plus the east German railways could top DM400bn by 2000.
He said: 'I want to change the Bundesbahn into a business which makes

MR Vladimir Meciar, prime minister of the Slovak Republic, was ousted by

Slovakia faced the prospect of intensified political conflict after Mr
Meciar threatened to march on the government in Bratislava. Nearly 1,000 of
his supporters gathered outside parliament last night demanding his
reinstatement.
The presidium of parliament also forced out of government all but one of the
members of Mr Meciar's Public Against Violence (PAV) movement which formed a
coalition with Mr Carnogursky's Christian Democrats. Several had supported
Mr Meciar's new breakaway nationalist group, PAV-Platform for a Democratic
Slovakia. He won more than 80 per cent support in recent opinion polls in
Slovakia.
Mr Meciar opposed Prague's free market economic reforms because the Slovak
economy stands to lose most jobs.
Mr Carnogursky has been ambivalent about Slovak independence. He favours a
treaty with Prague on continuing the federation. President Vaclav Havel
rejects this.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BULGARIA will have a law on privatisation and property rights in place by
the autumn as part of the coalition government's timetable for implementing
a second package of reforms aimed at creating a market economy, Mr Dimiter
Popov, the prime minister, said yesterday.
The measures, which are expected to allow Bulgarians to own and buy
property, are also designed to open up the country to foreign investment.
Little in the way of foreign investment has flowed into Bulgaria in recent
months, largely because the current legislation is either too vague on
taxes, or too restrictive on the repatriation of profits.
Moreover, investors have shied away from Bulgaria because until recently the
country was too unstable; western commercial bank creditors have not yet
agreed to reschedule the Dollars 8.5bn (Pounds 5bn) debt owed to the London
Club.
However, Mr Popov, who was elected prime minister last December following
the resignation of the socialist government, stressed Bulgaria's new
stability. 'It is definitely stable. The parliament is working hard to draft
and pass new legislation. The political climate is much better,' he said.
Since January, when a coalition government consisting of the Union of
Democratic Forces (UDF), a loose grouping of 19 political groupings, and the
Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), was set up, Bulgaria has embarked on a
tight monetary policy.
In February, prices were increased four-fold, a squeeze on credit and
consumer spending has been successfully implemented, and the first phase of
land reform - the return of a maximum of 30 hectares to its original owners
before 1946 - has been passed.
At the same time, industrial production has plummeted by 20 per cent because
of the collapse of the Soviet market and a moratorium on western credits.
But the success of these reforms has been overshadowed by bitter infighting
between the UDF and the BSP about who should control the political and
economic agenda.
Mr Popov, 63, politically independent, and a lawyer by profession, denies
that purges in the administration have taken place. 'We will not start any
revenge. No such thing has taken place in Bulgaria. Those with talent will
be promoted, irrespective of their political background. But we will not
accept those who abused their position in the former regime.'
The former regime, led by Mr Todor Zhivkov, who is now standing trial for
corruption charges, was toppled from power in a bloodless palace coup in
November, 1989. The BSP (former communist party) won a comfortable majority
in last June's free elections.
However, BSP sympathisers and UDF officials admit that the UDF leadership
remains determined to purge former communists. Mr Popov says his aim to to
create 'a new civil service based on competence and competition.'

<TEXT>
THE European Commission has told the French government to furnish detailed
proof that it is not using the flagships of its public sector to funnel
illegal state aid to smaller companies in industrially declining regions.
This latest row over state aid between Brussels and Paris comes shortly
after the Commission announced it would examine French plans to provide over
Dollars 1bn in fresh capital to two big state-owned companies, Bull, the
computer manufacturer, and Thomson, the defence and electronics group.
Thomson is one of six state-owned companies named in the Commission's
letter, along with Electricite de France, Elf Aquitaine, Pechiney, Rhone
Poulenc, and Enterprise Miniere et Chimique.
The Commission has given Paris two months to provide details of the funding
which would enable it to compare it with the activities of three private
groups, BSN, CGE and Saint-Gobain, which France maintains behave
identically. 'As major local employers (they are) merely assuming
responsibility for the survival of part of the economic fabric,' the French
authorities wrote to the Commission last April.
Brussels says the subsidised loans, provision of services, and, in some
cases, acquisition of holdings by the six state companies may constitute a
distortion of competition.
It has reminded the French government that if this proves to be the case, it
will have to recover the aid. Last year the Commission made Renault, the
state-controlled car manufacturer, repay more than Dollars 1bn in assistance
which Brussels judged illegal.

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Swedish recession, one of west Europe's worst, should end gradually next
year under the influence of the government's anti-inflation strategy and an
international upturn. This was forecast in yesterday's supplementary budget.
The government's medium-term outlook suggests Sweden will move into line
with average western European economic performance by the mid-1990s. Mr
Allan Larsson, finance minister, told employers yesterday the economy had
already begun to recover
In his budget statement, he said inflation, now running at 9.6 per cent
annually, would ease considerably this year; he projected 3 per cent for
1992.
There would be a negative growth rate this year of -0.2 per cent but the
following year should see the economy grow by 1 per cent, with annual growth
of more than 2 per cent thereafter until 1995.
The government takes an optimistic view of what will happen to pay
increases, expecting a marked fall to 5 per cent this year, after an average
10.3 per cent in 1990, and just over 3 per cent in 1992 as a result of a
two-year national agreement now accepted by all public sector workers and 55
per cent of private sector manual workers.
Mr Larsson said the government would have to act if those opposing restraint
secured higher pay than the rest because it would lead to the collapse of
the whole pay stabilisation deal and wreck the government's strategy.
He said there would be a SKr18.5bn (Pounds 1.75bn) budget deficit this year,
although the percentage of public spending as a proportion of gross domestic
product was down to 62 per cent compared with 67 per cent 10 years ago.
The government is aiming to cut its own budget by SKr2bn or 10 per cent over
the next three years; public sector consumption is set to rise at an annual
rate of 0.4 per cent.
Registered unemployment will increase, but the government expects the rate
to stay under 3 per cent. Independent forecasters believe it will climb to
4-5 per cent by the end of next year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A YEAR-LONG low key guerrilla war by Spain's governing Socialist party
against the conservative finance minister, Mr Carlos Solchaga, is escalating
sharply over the latter's dismissal of a party proposal to use Spanish banks
to finance cheap mortgages for 400,000 people in the next four years.
The Socialist party, which faces testing municipal elections on May 26,
plans to use low home financing as its main election plank.
However, when it was first mooted last week that Spanish banks might be
forced to set aside funds to enable homebuyers to take mortgages at 8 per
cent, Mr Solchaga, with Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez' tacit support,
rapidly and pronounced it unworkable.
The banks, he said, could not be asked to make unprofitable loans. Normal
mortgages cost more than 18 per cent in Spain.
Party officials immediately hit back accusing the finance minister of trying
to hijack its election programme.
Two days later Mr Gonzalez steered a cabinet meeting into announcing that
finding cheap homes for people was a good idea but that some other way would
have to be found to do it. What he meant was that taxpayers would have to
come up with the money.
On Monday, for some reason, Mr Solchaga repeated, on radio, his view that
the party's original plan was quite unworkable.
The party immediately accused him of being blinded 'by his own fuzzy
vision'. He promptly retorted that 'if they are going to accuse me of fuzzy
vision they should accuse (Mr Gonzalez) the same way'.
Mr Gonzalez is trying hard not to take sides, though he probably agrees with
his finance minister.
Mr Solchaga's toxic relations with party administrators go back more than a
year, when he began to criticise openly the control over the party held by
Mr Alfonso Guerra, the left-wing former deputy prime minister. Mr Guerra
left the government in January in the wake of a family financial scandal,
but he has remained deputy party leader.
Mr Gonzalez has tried to declare his government's independence from the
party but it is clear he cannot totally divorce himself from grassroots or
even bureaucratic party opinion.
At the moment, the row may actually be working to the Socialists' benefit,
as cheap housing has become the dominant issue in the local elections. But
the constant sniping between finance minister and party is beginning to
irritate the prime minister seriously.

Real labour costs, relatively stable throughout the 1980s, threatened to
rise by up to 2.5 per cent a year between now and 1994, causing a severe
slowdown in the number of new jobs and pushing up inflation, he said.
The rise in wages also had a direct impact on state finances because of the
government's promise in 1989 to raise social-security benefits in line with
private sector salary increases.
Mr Duisenberg, presenting the bank's 1990 annual report, said the government
had to do more to control its budget deficit without resorting to large
increases in the burden of taxation and social security contributions.
However, he 'feared the worst' because the financing deficit so far this
year had already exceeded government targets, complicating efforts to cut
the deficit to 3.25 per cent of national income by 1994.
'The targets for 1994 will never be realised if we do not manage to extract
ourselves from the quicksand of 1991,' he said.

FT  24 APR 91 / French minister heads into education minefield: Everyone
agrees the system needs reforming, but no one agrees how
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
WHEN Mr Michel Rocard's government was appointed three years ago, it made
modernisation of the education system its top domestic priority. Mr Lionel
Jospin, a leading light in the Socialist party, was give the job of
education minister, and the number two spot in the cabinet, to symbolise
this priority.
Most people greeted the government's declaration of commitment with a
mixture of respect and scepticism. For while everybody agrees that French
education needs reforming, everybody also knows that education is a daunting
political minefield; recent French history is littered with education
ministers who attempted to tamper with the entrenched traditions of the
education system, and who paid dearly for their temerity.
It now begins to look, however, as if Mr Jospin really does intend to try to
reform the hydra-headed monster. He has just tabled proposals which go to
the heart of the system, because they are aimed at humanising the gruelling
baccalaureat school-leaving examination.
These reforms are designed to simplify the syllabuses of the different
baccalaureats, to shorten and above all to alleviate the school working
week, and to modernise teaching methods.
Whether the package will make any headway is still uncertain: the main
parents' association has voiced its approval, but the main secondary school
teachers' union has condemned it outright.
The complaint most frequently levelled against the traditional baccalaureat
is that it is an elitist, intellectual examination, ill-adapted for mass
education.
Twenty years ago, 40 per cent of 17-year-olds were still at school; today
the figure is over 70 per cent. Twenty years ago, 25 per cent of the
school-leaving generation were aiming for the 'bac'; today the figure is 55
per cent; by the end of the century the government aims to raise the
proportion to 80 per cent.
The traditional baccalaureat continues to be the yardstick of attainment and
the principal door for future advancement, and it continues to be the main
target for a growing number of French school students.
And yet the expansion in numbers has left it largely unchanged either in
content or in method: it remains a traditional intellectual examination,
taught with traditional class-room methods, and in theory (but only in
theory) it is taught by traditional French intellectuals.
France is now probably the only country where philosophy is still one of the
obligatory subjects in the main school-leaving examination.
The most revolutionary element in the Jospin package is the proposal that
the lycees should set aside three hours a week for informal 'modules', small
class-groups devoted either to catch-up work for slow students, or to the
acquisition of learning and research techniques for the fast.
This is an iconoclastic innovation because, while the work carried on in
these modules would be part of the core curriculum, it would not be marked.
Two of the most notorious weaknesses of the French education system are that
it has the shortest school year in Europe, but the longest school week. For
some technical baccalaureats the school week now lasts 40 hours, plus
several hours' home-work every night. Mr Jospin is now proposing a maximum
of 35 hours.
The third component of the Jospin reforms is a simplification of the
baccalaureat syllabuses, so as to get away from the current scourge of
hyper-specialisation.
At present there are eight different subject groups for the general
baccalaureat, and 17 for the technological bac; both would be simplified
into three broad streams. In the general bac, the choice would be letters,
social science, and science, though the curriculum would continue to include
subjects outside the main specialisation.
The main stumbling block for all previous reform efforts has been the
resistance of the many teaching unions, and this one is not likely to be an
exception.
Mr Jospin has carefully kept away from any detailed proposals on the content
of the baccalaureats; this is the most treacherous ground because it affects
the vested interests of teachers of philosophy, geography, maths, etc. But
if Mr Jospin's modest reform is to be implemented, it may require a
revolution in the attitudes and methods of France's teachers.
It looks as if Mr Jospin really does intend to try to reform the
hydra-headed monster. He has just tabled proposals which go to the heart of
the system, because they are aimed at humanising the gruelling baccalaureat
school-leaving examination.

FT  23 APR 91 / International Company News: Fokker plans to build 130-seat
airliner
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FOKKER, the Dutch aerospace group, aims to complete a feasibility study on
developing a new 130-seat airliner by the end of 1991.
The Dutch company is one of several European aircraft manufacturers to have
announced its interest in entering the market for 130-seat aircraft. 'Four
players in that market segment are too many, but Fokker believes that it
must be one of those four,' Mr Marten Kuilman, the chairman, said at the
annual report presentation.
If Fokker's plans proceed as expected, its proposed 130-seater aircraft
would be based largely on its 100-seater Fokker 100. Fokker is also
considering the development of an 80-seat aircraft which would be a
derivative of its former F28.
In 1990, Fokker's net profit nearly doubled to Fl 83.4m (Dollars 42.1m) from
Fl 42.4m in 1989. The sharp rise was due mainly to lower financing charges,
higher contributions from associated companies, and book profits from
divestments.
Despite the steep increase, the company announced in March that it was
postponing the resumption of dividend payments. It attributed the delay
partly to the sacrifices being asked of its workforce, where jobs are being
cut to reduce costs and counter the weakness of the dollar.
Mr Erik Jan Nederkoorn, the group's finance director, said the recent strong
rise in the dollar had brought it back to a more 'comfortable' level for
Fokker.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA'S Catholic bishops have attacked the 'unjust' economic policies of
President Carlos Menem, blaming them for creating an ever-wider gap between
rich and poor.
In a strongly worded note issued over the weekend, the bishop's also
condemned widespread corruption which 'is destroying us as a people and as a
society.'
The note, issued at the end of the annual bishops' conference, is the second
time in as many months that the powerful Catholic church has taken issue
with Mr Menem. Last month they warned that 'generalised corruption' was
undermining support for the government.
The traditionalist hierarchy's latest broadside is significant because in
the past it firmly supported conservative, often military, governments. Mr
Menem, although nominally a Peronist, has adopted pro-business and free
market policies.

FT  23 APR 91 / Soviet debt to Finland falls as trade drops
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ACCORDING to figures released by the Bank of Finland, the total Soviet debt
to Finland reached around FM5.6bn, (Dollars 1.4bn) at the end of last March,
dropping from some FM6.5bn at the end of 1990.
The drop in the debt was mainly attributable to credits and deposits
received by Finnish commercial banks from the USSR.
Of the total FM5.6bn debt owed by the Soviets to Finland, FM2.2bn was made
up of over five-year-long clearing credits, FM1.2bn in five to seven-year
hard-cash credits and FM1bn in one-year hard-cash credits given by Finnish
banks.
Another FM400m is in a special clearing account with the remaining FM800m
being hard-cash payments in arrears.
Apart from these receivables, the balance of payments in the clearing
account is at present Dollars 100m in favour of the Soviets.
This money will be used to pay back the debt owed by Moscow to Finnish
companies.
Finland is facing a severe recession which has also been exacerbated by the
sharp plunge in trade with the USSR, after the Finnish-Soviet clearing
system switched to hard currency at the beginning of 1991.
Mr Mauno Koivisto, the Finnish president told Mr Valentin Pavlov, Soviet
Prime Minister, this week in London that he hoped both countries could
switch back to trade based on barter.
Given the economic and political instability in the USSR, observers are
sceptical of such a change.
Meanwhile, Finnair, the state-owned airline, and the Soviet airline,
Aeroflot, have signed an agreement which is aimed at studying the prospects
of forming a joint venture to offer air services between Leningrad and the
rest of Europe.
With its home base in Leningrad, the joint venture airline would use a part
of Finnair's DC-9 fleet and use Finnish airlines maintenance and training
facilities in Helsinki.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWEDEN'S main opposition parties - the Moderates and the Liberals - were
accused yesterday of wanting to introduce Thatcherism into the country if
they form a government after the next general election.
'They want to put Mrs Thatcher's discarded coat over Mother Sweden,' said Mr
Allan Larsson, finance minister of the ruling Social Democrats, in an attack
on their joint economic programme revealed at the weekend which is designed
to transform Sweden into a more market-oriented economy.
'What they want to do is nothing more than to introduce the policies that
were tried out in Britain during the 1980s and which led to very high
unemployment and increased social division,' he added.
Today Mr Larsson will introduce Sweden's supplementary budget for 1991 which
will indicate the Social Democratic alternative to the Moderate-Liberal
economic programme.
The two main opposition parties have indicated they intend to fight the
forthcoming general election campaign on a common economic strategy.
It contains promises for a direct cut in Sweden's value added tax from 25
per cent to between 18-20 per cent as part of a staged reduction in public
spending and tax pressure for adjustment to future European Community
membership.
The parties also pledge to cut the proportion of Sweden's gross national
product of 60 per cent that goes to the public sector, reform the sickness
insurance system to deal with the scandal of high absenteeism from work and
privatise the state industry sector.
They will also abolish monopolies, encourage saving and share ownership, and
strengthen market forces in the labour market as well as in the financial
system and in industry.
Both Mr Carl Bildt, the Moderate leader and Mr Bengt Westerberg, leader of
the Liberals said their programme would not be changed to satisfy any other
possible coalition partners in a future non-Socialist government.
The Christian Democrats who are expected to enter Parliament for the first
time will back the far-reaching economic manifesto. But Mr Olof Johansson,
Centre party leader, said he could not agree with much of it and doubted
whether the Centre would support such a market strategy.

Quest for the right balance - Patrick Blum looks at the controversial
privatisation programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEW issues have been quite as controversial as the government's
privatisation programme in spite of a broad consensus in favour of selling
companies nationalised in the mid-70s.
Though there has been some opposition to the privatisations from groups of
former owners who are mostly seeking better compensation, and, on the left,
from those who want to preserve a large state sector, in practice the
government has had a free hand.
This has allowed it to establish what must be the largest privatisation
programme in Europe outside the former communist countries.
Plans are to sell dozens of leading companies including banks, insurance
companies, manufacturers of a wide range of products from cement to beer,
chemicals to pulp and paper, steel and oil distribution companies, leading
utilities including telecommunications, the tobacco monopoly, the state
airline, shipping and bus companies, to the last state-owned newspaper.
The scale of the programme has not really been at issue, rather criticism
has focused on the way it has been undertaken. The government has been
accused of selling companies on the cheap to foreigners, of inflating share
prices to maximise revenues, of distorting the market by imposing rigid
limits on the purchase of privatised shares by the same foreigners, of
failing to protect adequately Portuguese interests, of going about it in a
half-hearted way, and of failing to use privatisations as a means of
restructuring the economy.
It is an illustration of the difficulty of the task that in one way or
another all of these conflicting criticisms can be held to be partially
true. Local business groups have been most vocal in attacking the government
for failing to defend Portuguese interests.
They argue that the method of selling companies on the stock market combined
with the high price set for privatised shares effectively rules out a
greater role by Portuguese investors who do not have the financial clout of
large foreign groups.
The problem is that there are too few large Portuguese groups able to absorb
the volume of privatisations planned even if prices were lower. One
suggestion is that potential Portuguese investors should be given
preferential credit terms to help them buy into companies.
To counter the criticism that it is selling off the family silver to
foreigners, the government has imposed rigid limits on the amount of
privatised shares foreigners can buy, but this has proved ineffective.
Foreign companies have indirectly through local alliances to win key if not
majority stakes in most of the companies privatised so far.
What the limits have done is to distort the process, make it less
transparent, and push prices up further.
Most critics believe the government's main objective has been to maximise
revenues from the sales, which last year alone brought it revenues of more
than Es140bn (Dollars 970m) in six operations.
That figure is likely to look small if this year's programme which includes
selling several banks and some leading companies is fully carried out,
though this appears less certain now. The programme has unfolded in fits and
starts, and has faced repeated delays. These have been exacerbated by the
Gulf war, and several privatisations due in the first quarter of the year
have yet to take place.
A general election is due by October at the latest and this will
increasingly occupy the minds of ministers.
Perhaps the most serious charge is that not enough thought has been given to
using the privatisation process to restructure important parts of the
economy.
The government's answer is that by privatising public companies it is doing
precisely that and strengthening the market economy.
Critics are not convinced  - 'privatisations in the financial sector, for
example, are decided piecemeal,' says a leading economist.
'There is no overall strategy, but what we need is an active restructuring
to prepare quickly the economy for the single (European) market.
'The government should intervene selectively to help the formation of
Portuguese groups, otherwise we'll miss a unique opportunity.'

FT  23 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE 2,500 level lost in slow trade
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UK STOCKS suffered another sharp reversal yesterday, falling nearly 30
points to close below the FT-SE 2,500 mark as investor optimism melted away
on both sides of the Atlantic. Selling pressure remained fairly modest but
buyers continued to avoid UK equities, believing that further cuts in UK
interest rates may be delayed and that the domestic economy remains
depressed.
The Footsie Index ended 29.3 down at 2,490.8, the low of the day and the
first close below 2,500 since the beginning of the month. Concern over
interest rates and economic uncertainties mirrored those in New York.
London, already depressed by the fall of almost 34 Dow points in New York on
Friday, fell sharply in late dealings yesterday as Wall Street recorded a
loss of a further 32 Dow points early in the new session. Having failed to
show much enthusiasm last week for Wall Street's successful, albeit brief,
move above Dow 3,000, the UK market now seems to be reacting quickly to the
fall in the US market.
As often when the underlying equity market lacks certainty, share prices
reacted to movements in the June futures contract on the FT-SE Index. In
late trading the futures contract turned down and led the underlying equity
market below the 2,500 mark.
However, equity trading volumes were moderate in London yesterday, with Seaq
recorded turnover at 403m shares, compared with 465.8m on Friday and as much
as 700m shares daily during last month's bullish period. Lower volume is
disturbing for the securities industry; London Stock Exchange data shows
that retail business fell to the Pounds 700m to Pounds 800m daily range last
week, after running well above Pounds 1bn daily in March.
The latest Confederation of British Industry/Financial Times survey of
distributive trades did little to change views on the underlying
sluggishness of consumer business - an unexpected rise in high street sales
appeared to reflect special factors, chiefly the sharp increase in value
added tax announced in the UK Budget in mid-March.
Today brings the UK trade figures for last month, which equity market
analysts predict will show little change from the Pounds 0.7bn monthly
deficit recorded in February.
Wall Street's influence brought widespread falls in the blue chip
internationals, where the dollar's strength proved no help to such US
currency earners as BAT Industries and the pharmaceutical stocks. ICI, with
first-quarter trading figures due this week, fell smartly. With crude oil
prices still unsettled and many analysts bearish, BP and the other leading
oil producer shares could make little headway in yesterday's stock market.
The retail group took the CBI/FT survey fairly well, and although there was
little buying across the broad range of the sector, there were a few firm
spots. Ratners, the jewellery chain, brushed off disappointing results as
investors continued to show faith that there will be a recovery in the
economy, and thus in consumer confidence, by the end of the year.
Kingfisher, the high street stores group, managed one of the firm
performances of the session.
Mr Neil Mackinnon, chief economist at Yamaichi, warned that the next shock
for London and other global equity markets could come on Friday, when the
first-quarter GNP data for the US economy are published. 'So far there is
little evidence to support the official view of an early recovery in the
(US) economy,' said Mr Mackinnon.

FT  23 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: Royals hit by rights talk
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SUSTAINED weakness in Royal Insurance, the composite insurer, was
accompanied by vague market suggestions that the group might be considering
a rights issue. A cash call from Royals has been talked about for some time
by a number of insurance specialists. Another suggestion is that analysts
are preparing to downgrade their earnings and dividend forecasts for the
company.
Some dealers, however, attributed the sharp fall in the shares, which
settled 18 lower at 447p, to the fact that they had held up well against the
rest of the sector during the first quarter.
There are suggestions that Royals' first-quarter results, due next month,
could show a loss in excess of Pounds 60m. Analysts had been hoping that
Royals might break even in the current year, but now some of them are
looking for a full year loss of something in the order of Pounds 50m.
Gestetner weakens
Downgradings from competing broking houses put shares of Gestetner, the
distributor of office equipment and photographic products, under pressure.
Three analysts at least revised estimates of current year profits, the
lowest of which until yesterday had been Smith New Court's Pounds 62m.
James Capel was said to have reduced its figure to Pounds 58m but more
savage cuts came from BZW, and from another house which preferred to remain
anonymous. Citing extremely poor trading throughout February and March,
which will obviously affect group first-half profits, BZW dropped its
estimate to only Pounds 50m for the full year. An even lower figure of
Pounds 47m was said to have been forecast by another house.
BZW retained its longer term view of being overweight in the stock but sees
short-term downside. Gestetner closed 20 weaker at 213p.
Hammerson good
The volatile property stock Hammerson was the best performer of the day
among FT-SE 100 constituents in the wake of results announced last week.
County NatWest issued a buy note on the stock yesterday. It highlighted the
company's cautious management policy and exposure to the dollar as reasons
to buy. 'The worst is certainly over, certainly in terms of sentiment.' said
County.
The company also made a presentation to its institutional shareholders at
the offices of its broker BZW. More than 60 fund management staff attended.
Hammerson was 20 better at one point and the shares eventually closed at
630p for a gain of 15 on the day. Volume was a typical 350,000.
Ratners shines
Ratners, the jewellery retail chain, shrugged off disappointing final
results as investors looked forward to the prospect of a recovery in
consumer spending by the year-end. The shares closed 8 higher at 178p on
turnover of 3m.
With nearly half of Ratners' UK profits made in the Christmas period, the
market took heart from the confident statement by Mr Gerald Ratner, the
chairman, who said he was hopeful for significantly better trading
conditions during that important period.
Full year profits fell 8 per cent to Pounds 112m, slightly below market
estimates. As a result, analysts lowered their current forecasts to around
Pounds 127m to Pounds 130m from Pounds 130m to Pounds 135m.
It was the turn of cautious chemicals analysts to voice opinions on ICI and
its first-quarter figures due on Thursday. The shares fell 21 to 1080p.
Inchcape slipped 8 to 332p as the company reshuffled its board.
Volume in Saatchi &amp; Saatchi climbed to 25m, but traders explained that more
than 1 1/2 bn Saatchi shares are in issue now that the rights offer is
complete. As a result, it is one of the most liquid stocks in the market and
this kind of trading volume is to be expected. The share price ended
unchanged at 19 3/4 p.
Weekend reports that ADT might sell its stake in Christies International
left the latter 8 off at 218p. Volatile Brent Walker slid 8 to 66p in the
wake of press comment on the company.
The wider market reaction combined with a downgrading by Lehman Brothers,
the securities house, pushed Trafalgar House down 9 to 245p in heavier
trading volume of 2.7m shares.
Official confirmation of weekend reports that Guinness Mahon, the UK
merchant bank, will announce a substantial interim loss later this week
prompted a near 20 per cent drop in the shares. They closed a net 8 lower at
42p.
Mr Geoffrey Bell, Guinness Mahon's chairman, said the results would include
a provision of Pounds 30m for bad loans, giving the bank an after tax loss
of Pounds 35m. There will be no dividend, Mr Bell added.
Bank of Yokohama, Japan's leading regional bank, gained control of Guinness
Mahon in 1989, paying 146p a share, and it holds a 65 per cent stake. Mr
Robert Maxwell has a 9 per cent holding.
Oil shares were resilient, closing little changed on balance in spite of the
steep falls in equities on both sides of the Atlantic. They were bolstered,
dealers said, by the latest rise in crude oil prices, currently around the
Dollars 20 a barrel mark, and the strength of the dollar. 'With oil priced
in dollars the majors are 100 per cent exposed to the currency,' said one
specialist.
There were hints that Elf's advisers had priced Elf's 25 per cent holding in
Enterprise Oil prior to its imminent placing, but specialists said it was
more likely that Elf would hold out for a price in the region of 600p before
it would sell. Enterprise was easier at 555p.
Cadbury Schweppes fell 11 to 395p on a revival of speculation about a
possible rights issue. Asda was off 1 1/2 at 119 1/2 p as the market waited
for the company's meeting with brokers, to be held later this week. The
shares have been depressed on speculation that analysts' forecasts may be
reduced.
Budgens put on 2 to 47p after reports that some shareholders are seeking
senior management changes.
Relief that the annual profits shortfall over the previous year was not
worse boosted issues of Polymark International, the laundry equipment
distributor. The ordinary shares advanced 8 to 28p and the preferred 'A' 17
to 115p.
Renewed speculative interest was held responsible for further strength in
USM-listed ML Laboratories, which finished 18 higher at 455p.
There were further setbacks in a water sector still suffering from last
week's news that trading in the Water Package is to cease from July 12.
Dealers maintained that this will result in sustained selling of the
Package, with funds unwilling to be left with thinly traded components of
each package unit.
Much of the recent selling has come from overseas investors, it was said,
with Japan-ese institutions conspicuous and heavy sellers. Also depressing
sentiment has been some unease about the UK government's chances of winning
the next general election. The opposition Labour party has recently
reaffirmed its intention to renationalise the water companies if it wins the
election.
The Package was down over Pounds 100 at one point yesterday, but rallied to
close a net Pounds 42 off at Pounds 2968. Anglian Water weakened 10 to 286p,
while Southern dipped 8 to 270p and Severn Trent the same amount to 280p.
North West drew sustained support, closing unchanged at 296p after 291p.
Cronite returned from suspension with a reassuring directors' statement, and
the shares closed at 24p, double the April 5 suspension price.
Further speculation that the UK Ministry of Defence will shortly award its
much-mooted replacement tank contract to Vickers failed to support the
shares, which fell 7 to 218p. Vickers manufactures the Challenger tank, a
new and more sophisticated version of its old Chieftain series.
Downiebrae, the Glasgow-based steel profile and pipe flange manufacturer,
found favour ahead of Friday's annual results and ended 7 higher at 36p.
